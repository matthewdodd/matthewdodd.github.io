I was serving a customer while my master and mistress were at dinner, in a parlour behind the shop. The prisoner said she wanted some stuff to make her a gown, but did not know what to pitch upon, and said she must see several pieces. When I had served the other person I attended on her. There were some ready made goods, scarlet and black cardinals and capuchines, lay on the counter, which I went behind, opposite to her; she pointed over the counter to a piece of stuff, which, she said, she wanted to see. I laid hold on it, and in the mean time there was a capuchine lay upon some other goods, which I saw her take and put it under her cloak. I shew'd her several pieces of stuff after that. She said she liked one piece very well, but we could not agree for price, so I went backwards to my master to know if he could take the money, and told him she had put a capuchine under her cloak. My master came out and shew'd her several more pieces. Then I went to my mistress, a kinswoman of my master's. and asked her if she did not know of such a capuchine lying on the other goods. She said, she did. I said, the woman now has it under her cloak. She came out, went to the prisoner, who was sitting, and took it from under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she gone out of the shop ?</p>
               <p>Alderson. No, she had not. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Q. Where has it been since ?</p>
               <p>Alderson. In the hands of the constable, who deliver'd it to me to day, and said he should not be wanted, so is gone home.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Alderson. I don't know.</p>

               <p>H. Triscom. I do; it is Mr. Boucher's property. I took it from un der the prisoner's cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live there ?</p>
               <p>H. Triscom. I do; I keep his house.</p>
               <p>Q. By what do you know it ?</p>
               <p>H. Triscom. It is a new one; I made it myself, and I can swear to the silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make no others of the same sort of silk?</p>
               <p>H. Triscom. We had no others made of the same silk then; this was made for a lady at Hampstead, and I expected her to call for it every minute; the prisoner had it under her cloak all of a wisp.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went to buy a gown, something of a brown stuff, when the man was serving two customers. He ask'd me what sort of stuff I wanted I said, something very dark for a winter gown; I pointed to a piece and sat down in a chair; I did not know that any thing lay on it. He asked me 14 d. per yard for it, and then 13 d. I had a guinea and 13 d. in my pocket. We could not agree for price. The gentlewoman came out of the room and said, get up. what is this under you? I got up, and the capuchine was under me. I said, I beg your pardon, I did not know that I sat upon any thing. She said, I stole it. I said, I will go any where with you, for I know myself innocent. My husband is on board one of his majesty's ships, and I have three small children to maintain. I buy and sell old cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. to H. Triscom. Are you sure it was not under her?</p>
               <p>H. Triscom. It was not. I took it from under her left arm, under her cloak; she was sitting on a stool in the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Great Leonard-street, Shore-ditch. On Wednesday, the 21st of April, I went into a public-house in Cheapside, with two young women who lodge in my house—in the evening I was the worse for liquor—the prisoner was in that house—I did not know him before—we had something to drink, and Betsy, the prisoner, and I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> (Betsy is not here)—we then drove to our house—I arrived there a little after twelve—I had no money in my pocket—I went down stairs to the caddy, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> boy came down, and I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I had a purse in the caddy, with two sovereigns and a half in it—the prisoner was sitting close by the tea-caddy when I took the money out—I put the purse, and two sovereigns and a half, into the tea-caddy again—I had no occasion for that—I took the string out of my shoe, because I felt it under my feet—I missed the money about eight the next morning—I went to bed about one—Betsy went up stairs to bed, after the prisoner and the boy went away.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100107"></xptr>
               <p>we came from Leicester-square—I left about twelve o'clock—I was dot drinking all the time—I cannot tell how much I drank—Betsy drank too—Charlotte did not drink—she did not know I had a purse—she knew where I kept my money—I have not been comparing notes with Charlotte—I said the prisoner was sitting on the kitchen table when I went to the caddy—I do not know what Charlotte Wilson has said—I have always said the prisoner was close by the purse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say that he stood close to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have a witness that he was sitting on the table, and a woman told him not to sit on the table, he would break it—he was sitting part on the table, and one of his legs on the floor—I was locking the caddy, and Charlotte Wilson came down and said, "Let me lock it," but it was locked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon your oath, have you ever sworn it was you locked the caddy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she took the key out of my hand, and said, "Have you locked the caddy?"—I said, "Yes, I think I have," and she said it was locked—she took the key, and thought she looked it—we locked it between us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not swear before the Magistrate, "I then locked the caddy?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly I said that—on the second day it was mentioned before the Magistrate that Charlotte Wilson was there—my depositions were read over to me—I think there was about Charlotte Wilson assisting me to lock the caddy—Charlotte Wilson mentioned it, I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the contrary, did you swear, "I stooped to pull the string of my shoe out—I then locked the caddy?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did say, I locked the caddy—I heard Charlotte say at Worship-street it was she locked it—she said I assisted her on the second day—I know a gentleman named Wellum—I have known him twelve or fourteen years—he maken our shoes, that is all I know about him—he does not visit at our house—if he has come in with boots and shoes, he has had a cup of tea—he drank tea there last on the Sunday that the prisoner was to bring the money—Wellum said that the prisoner should say, he was very sorry he could not bring me all—I expected him to bring two sovereigns and a half—that was all I expected—if Wellum has said I would not take a farthing less than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it is not true—I sent Wellum to the prisoner to ask him about my money—I found out he was in Mr. Butler's shop—I sent there—I did not tell Wellum to threaten to expose the prisoner to his master—I heard Wellum say that the prisoner said he did not want his master to know—I did not get a farthing from the prisoner—it was after my sending Wellum to him that I had him taken up—I lost this on the Wednesday—the prisoner said he would come to tea on the Sunday, and the first night I went with Wellum was the Friday, but I did not hear what the pri<lb></lb>soner said to Wellum—Wellum saw him on Friday night, Saturday night, and Monday morning, and then I had him taken—when Wellum came to me, he said, "He will give you your money, it is all right, I am to go to-morrow night for it"—on the Saturday night he want—it was very wet—he came and said the prisoner had not got the money, but would bring it up on the Sunday—I sent Wellum on Monday—he came back, and said the prisoner told him he wished to extort money from him, and he would give him in charge—I then gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 21st of April, I was at this public-house in Cheapside—I went home at a quarter-past twelve o'clock—I arrived with the prisoner and my fellow-lodger Betsy Thomas—the prosecutrix gave the money to the boy to pay the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when I went down, the prisoner was sitting on the leaf of the table—the caddy was open, and I saw the prisoner <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> the purse on the hearth-rug—I did not know the purse, as I had not seen it before—after he left, I took it and threw it on the mantel-piece—the prosecutrix came and told me she was robbed—I said "That is the purse I saw on the hearth-rug, and threw it on the mantel-piece"—the end of it was turned—I am sure the prisoner threw it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you live in the house with the witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, Betsy Thomas lives in the house—she is not here, because she was insensibly tipsy, and her evidence was not taken down—I am quite sure of that—I have not sworn that she was in liquor, but not very bad, or that they were both in liquor, but not very bad—I have sworn that when I left them they were not, and when they returned home they were insen<lb></lb>sibly tipsy—I have been talking to Mrs. Hamilton about this—she said on her oath she saw the money in the purse, which I had not seen—it did not strike me as being odd that a man should throw a purse on the rug—I should not have given it a thought, had I not heard that the money was taken from the purse—I was close to him—I suppose he was not aware that I saw him—he could have taken it off—I locked the caddy, and when I was locking it, the prisoner was sitting on the leaf of the table—the caddy was on the table—Hamilton was making an attempt to lock it—she could not do it, and I did it—she was sitting by the table when the pri<lb></lb>soner threw the purse on the rug—she might have seen him throw it had she been sober, but she did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you state that she was sitting by and saw it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not say that—what I stated was, that had she been sober she would have seen it thrown on the hearth-rug, as well as me, but as she was tipsy she did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you swear the witness Hamilton sat by and saw it, but she was very tipsy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not swear that—I was sober before the officer—what I said was taken down and read over to me—I signed it—this is my signature—I cannot read writing—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Hamilton sat by and saw it, but she was very tipsy")—there is a mistake there—I said, "Had she been sober she might have seen this mistake"—I did not notice it—I made no remark to</p>

               <p>the prisoner about his throwing his purse on the rug—thought it was an old purse—Mr. Wellum makes my shoes—he does not sit down to dine with us, though I do not know why I should object to it—he took lunch with us once during this time—some bread and cheese and a pint of porter—I think it was last Wednesday—no, Thursday—I heard no voice saying "Thursday"—he took lunch with us yesterday—he has not dined at our house—he drank tea with us—he was waiting for the prisoner to come—I cannot say how often he has drank tea in the house.</p>

On the 19th of February, a little before nine o'clock in the evening, I only was at home, my husband was gone out, the window-shutters were up, and the door on the latch; I was in the parlour behind the shop, the parlour door was open - I was sitting there, and heard the shop door open, I rose from my seat, and went as far as the parlour door, a man came in as if to purchase, he shut the door, came forward, through the shop, to the parlour, lifted up something to my head, and said if I made any alarm he would blow my brains out - I instantly screamed out, he struck me on the head, I believe, with a pistol, I fell on the window seat in the parlour, took hold of his arm to secure him till some one came, but I could not; he struck me five or six times on the head, he then left me, and my female servant came in. I did not see any other person, nor did I see him take anything out of the shop. I am certain the prisoner is the person that struck me - I did not lose my senses; I saw him about two hours after at my house, he was brought by the officers, I was then in bed, but the instant I saw him I was certain he was the person - he was dressed the same as the person that struck me. I was confined to my bed some days.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You attended two examinations before the magistrate - A. Yes; I then said the prisoner was the man - the door is opened in the usual way - I latched it myself. The property was gone.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I am sure I never took any money out of the cash-box, nor did any other person.</p>

            . I keep the house, No. 17, Portugal-street, it is in the parish of St. Clement Danes. I remember the night in question I went out about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, I had examined my cash-box a few minutes before I went. I had more money than I liked to keep in the house, took out 45 l., and left six 5 l. and three 1 l. notes, a sovereign, and various papers, in the box. I was going to Holborn, as I passed Mr. Clark's I saw three persons standing at his private door - the prisoner at the bar was standing with his back to the shutters, the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120006"></xptr>two, one looking towards Lincoln's Inn, the other towards the market - it was after his shop was shut; there was a gas-light just over the shop window; there is a light likewise from the Coffee-house; when I saw them stop, I was going to address them, but did not, thinking they were Mr. Clark's journeymen waiting to be paid their wages. I took particular notice of the prisoner, as the light was directly on his face. I went on to Holborn, was sent for back, and missed my cash-box with all its contents. I immediately went to Bow-street, and to Charles-street, Drury-lane, with Jeffrey, the officer, where I saw a boy that I met between my window and Clark's, and pointed him out to the officer. I went to the corner of Brownlow-street with Furzeman - there were about thirty or forty persons there; it was about eleven o'clock. I fixed on the prisoner as the person whom I saw at Clark's door, and he was taken into custody, We took up two other persons for obstructing the officer, and took the prisoner and the other two to my house. They were all shewn to Mrs. Drew separately, the other two before the prisoner; she did not hesitate a moment, for when the prisoner was brought before her, she exclaimed,</p>

               <p>"That is the man!" and said she knew nothing of the other two. I never found any of the property.</p>
               <p>MRS. DREW re-examined. The men were shewn to me separately. I had no doubt that the prisoner was the man. I never saw the other two before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. I said before the Magistrate he was the man.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Drew. On the 19th of February I was in the kitchen, which is below the shop, and remember hearing a noise in the shop. I went up stairs, heard Mrs. Drew call Murder! several times, and when I went into the shop there was no other person but Mrs. Drew.</p>
               <p>MR. DREW re-examined. My shop is lighted with gas - there is a glass door to the parlour; any person might see into the parlour from the street-door, if there was a light there.</p>

               <p>"You know it is not customary for grocers in London to sell tobacco." He left the shop, and turned up the street towards Drew's. I am sure the prisoner is the man who was in my shop.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policman N</hi> 425). Just, before 3 a.m., on 24th July, I saw the prisoner coming across a field near Rectory Road, Hackney, and on seeing me he stooped down in a cutting—I went towards him and he got up and ran away—I followed him into Evering Road, and I caught him after he had got over two walls—I said, "What did you run away for?"—he mumbled something and caught hold of my coat and resisted me—I said, "Let go my coat"—he would not and I drew my truncheon and struck him on the arm, and he said, "Don't knock me about, and I'll go quiet"—two other constables came up and I gave him into their hands, and went back and found this parcel which he had dropped in the Evering Road while running—it contained this dress (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him searched at the station and saw the articles produced found about him in different pockets.</p>

I was at the station when the prisoner was brought in—I told him to take his coat off, and I found these salt cellars and cruet and silver articles in the coat pockets—this drab dress was underneath his coat, and this piece of silk was inside his trousers below the waistband, and other articles were in his trousers pockets and in various parts of his dress—I asked him his name and address, and he refused to. give it—I said, "You will save a good deal of trouble if you will tell us where you got the things"—he said, "I was lying on some grass and two men came along and threw them down, and I picked them up"—and he said three or four hours afterwards in the cell, "I should have taken them to Hackney Police-station"—I went at about 10.30 to 4, Sandford Place, and found all the rooms in confusion, the catch of the kitchen window had been put back, and the bottom of the window raised and the shutters forced—this knife, or any knife, would force back the catch—there were marks as if something had been passed—I found this knife in the prisoner's pocket—Sanford Place is about 70 yards from where he was found.</p>

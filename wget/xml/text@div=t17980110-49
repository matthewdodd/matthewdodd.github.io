               <p>Q. Was he coming in the direction as from that house? - A. Yes, he passed me; I went a little farther, and saw something lying under some pales, and a man laid down by it; I asked him what he had got there; he said, his bundle; I told him, if it was his bundle, to get up, and pick it up; I told him it appeared like lead, he said, it might be lead, or copper, it did not belong to me; I sent my wife for another watchman to come and assist me, she was with me at the time; then this other watchman came, William Cox, he is not here; when he came up, he asked the man if he knew him, he said, no; says he, you may know me, my name is Thomas Bruce; Cox said to me, let him go, I know him; I let him go, and then he went down the lane where the other man was gone, I took the lead up and carried it home, it was very heavy; when morning came, I shewed it to people, and asked them it they knew any thing of it, and afterwards, Mr. Brown, who keeps the sign of the Swan, said, he knew where it came from, he sent two men to fetch it away from my house.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there more than one piece of lead? - A. No, one piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it fitted? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any company on the 16th, Saturday night, at your house? - A. Yes; it was pay-night, and Bruce, Philips, and Humphries, were all at my house, they came there about eight, Bruce and Philips were in the parlour, and Humphries in the tap-room; they went away about ten, I did not see them all three in company together, Philips and Bruce were settling with their master sawyer, for their pay, I saw no more of them that night, that I recollect; on the Sunday morning, I heard a report, that somebody had been attacked with lead, I had the care of a house that had been shut up for two or three days before; I went to look, and I missed some lead from a wash-house, adjoining Mr. Benning's; I stood by when one piece was tried, four or five days after; I do not know whether it came off there or not, the nail-holes seemed to come pretty right, the greatest part of it was cut in such small pieces, that it was impossible to fit it; I had the charge of the lead about an hour, and then they took it down to the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Q. It was delivered to you by the watchman? - A. It was brought to my house, and then it was taken down to Justice Jenkinson, that was on the Sunday.</p>

             sworn. - I am a carpenter; on Saturday night, the 23d of December, a constable came to me, Thomas Ashwell, and charged me to assist him to execute a warrant against the two prisoners; I went with him to the Swan, Phillips was there making a gathering for Bruce amongst the workmen, to take him something to Newgate, this was a week after the lead was lost; the constable and I, and two or three others, went into the taproom, he tapped Phillips on the shoulder, and said, you are my prisoner, he gave me charge of him, and took charge of Humphreys himself; Phillips said, he would not be taken by any body, and Humphreys declared the same; we had a scuffle for near half an hour in the tap-room and passage, one man paid me about the head, and the constable too, with a stick; I did not know who they were, but they seemed to be working people, who knew most of them; Phillips swore, he would do for me, several times in the course of the scuffle, so did most of them, they cried, knock them down, and do them; and soon after breaking the tap-room door, and the bar door, I got Phillips down in the bar, and I held him fast down with my knee, he begged that I would not hurt him; I told him, if he behaved well, I would not, and I let him try to get up; as he was getting up, he pulled this knife out, (producing it;) I began to pay him about the head, and one of my men took the knife from him; we then got him down, and tied his hands and legs, put him in a cart, and took him to the watch-house; the next night after they got there, there was an attempt to rescue them, and we were obliged to send to Enfield for the soldiers; Humphreys was secured at the same time that Philips was, by other people, and they were both taken to the watch-house at the same time; the soldiers were obliged to go with their drawn hangers to handcuff them, and they were obliged to use their hangers to bring them to town, there was such a number of people round them; I came part of the way to town with them, they made several attempts, both of them, to run away, while I was with them, and the people that were round them endeavoured to assist them as much as they could; I was present this day week, when the lead was fitted to Mr. Benning's house, I received it from the officer, Jonathan Trott, that was the lead found upon Bruce, there were 67lbs. 3qrs. of it; I tried it to the portico, at the back part of Mr. Benning's house, it had been nailed up against the wall, the nails had been drawn out with the lead, except one which was a large spike, and the lead exactly fitted; I can safely take my oath, that that lead came from Mr. Benning's premises, the officers, Trott and Holmes, have got the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to apprehend them, was any thing said of what they were apprehended for? - A. No, nothing; I went in with the constable, and he gave me charge of them; while I was scuffling with Phillips in the tap-room, I told him, we wanted him for being concerned in taking the lead that was found upon Bruce, and then they got worse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The violence of their conduct encreased, after they found there was a charge of felony against them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they? - A.One is a wheelwright, the other a blacksmith, they had both worked in my yard that day, till between five and fix o'clock, not for me, but I gave them leave to work for a neighbour, in my yard.</p>
               <p>Q.This is a house very common for workmen to be paid at? - A. I never pay any men at a public-house, and I can only speak for myself.</p>
               <p>Court. I wish every master would follow your example.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN TROTT sworn. - I am a constable, I was not applied to till the 24th of December; Holmes had a charge of them on the 23d.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: On<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100070"></xptr>Saturday night, the 23d of December, I was directed to apprehend the two prisoners, and to get Trott to assist me, but I could not find him that night; I did not see the prisoners till they were in the cage, they were delivered to me in the cage; I fetched Trott to assist me to handcuff them, on the Sunday morning; they resisted, and we were obliged to go to Enfield for a file of soldiers. (Produces the lead).</p>
               <p>Trott. Webb, and the other watchman, brought this lead down to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Holmes. I put my mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Webb. I put my mark upon it the morning after I found it; this is the same lead.</p>
               <p>Tuck. This is the same lead that I tried upon Mr. Benning's premises.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BRUCE sworn. - I am a sawyer: On Saturday night, the 16th of December, I was at the Swan drinking with a young man, about nine o'clock at night, and Humphreys came in, and had a pint of beer and a pipe of tobacco; he desired me to go with him to the front door, which I did, and he told me he knew of some lead, and wanted me to help to carry it; I would not go at first, and we went into the parlour again, and stopped about half an hour longer; then Phillips and I had a glass of gin at the bar, and as we were going out, Humphreys came up and had a glass of gin, and then I went with them both to the bottom of an orchard belonging to Mr. Smith the butcher; Phillips told me to stop there, and he would bring the lead to me; I saw them go up the orchard, they were about an hour and a half getting it all; they both came back to me three times with lead; I took it from them over a ditch, and then all three of us took it to a place by the side of a lane; then Phillips put a piece upon Humphreys's shoulder to take down the lane, and another upon mine; I heard the watchman coming, and I threw my piece down; Humphreys went down the lane before me; the watchman came up, I was standing about two yards from it, I was never lying down at all, I told the watchman I did not know what it was; he sent for another watchman, and he knew me, and they let me go about my business, and I saw no more of them; I was taken up on Sunday morning, the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Benning's house? - A. Yes; the orchard is about fifty or sixty yards from it; I did not see where they brought the lead from, nor they did not tell me they stole it.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had pretty good reason to suspect it? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you throw it down when the watchman was coming? - A. I did not know rightly how it was, whether I came honestly by it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell him you did not know what you were carrying? - A. I did tell him so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the Jury to believe that you did not know it was lead that you were carrying? - A. I did not know rightly whether it was lead or copper.</p>
               <p>Q. But Phillips had told you that he knew of some lead? - A. Yes; I told the watchman I believed it was lead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You gave exactly the same account before the Magistrate that you have told now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were committed the next day to Newgate? - A. No, on the Wednesday; I was in the cage till then.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did you see Mr. Tuck while you were in the cage? - A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How often in Newgate? - A. Once.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come to you in Newgate for? - A. He came to see me; and I thought it would be best to tell him, and I told him the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Q. You were committed for trial for this offence? - A. I don't know whether it was for trial or not, I thought I was to go down to have another hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Which tells the truth, you or the watchman; you say you were standing still, and he says you were lying down? -</p>
               <p>Webb. He was lying down, leaning over the lead; I fell down over his feet, or I should not have seen him.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was something between the two.</p>
               <p>Phillips's defence. I know nothing of the lead; when Mr. Tuck apprehended me, he pulled out a pistol, and caught me by my silk handkerchief that I had round my neck, and I thought he would have choaked me, and I pulled out my knife to cut the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Humphreys's defence. What Bruce says against me is all false; I neither saw him nor was I with him all that night.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Phillips called two, and Humphreys five witnesses, who gave them a good character.</p>

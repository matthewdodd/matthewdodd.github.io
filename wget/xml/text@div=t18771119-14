On 20th October I was outside the Admiral Keppel public-house and saw Weeks go in—I followed her, and saw a bad sixpence taken out of one of the tills—Weeks went out and crossed over to Brooks and another man, to whom she gave something which she had in her left hand—she put it in his coat-pocket—I was" in uniform—they looked across, saw me, and hurried off—I followed them 200 yards and saw Brooks go into the Hour Glass, Fulham Road—I went in and saw him put down a coin and receive four or five pieces in change—Weeks and the man went round a dark corner and waited for him—I ran in and asked the landlady to look in the till, which she did, and took a bad sixpence from the top—I followed the prisoners—they noticed me, and the other man darted off—I took the prisoners, one with each hand, and saw Weeks put her hand in her pocket and throw away something, and one coin which fell on the pavement was picked up and given to me—I took the prisoners back to the public-house, but the barmaid failed to identify them—Brooks said that he was merely buying a box of lights of Weeks—I produce three coins; one I received from Mrs. Emerton, one from the Admiral Keppel, and the third Weeks threw away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Crane. On 15th Nov., about 12 o'clock at night, I got out of an omnibus at the Mansion House—I had two half crowns, sixpence, threepence, two halfpence, and three farthings loose in my dress pocket behind me—I stopped to look at a fire, and the prisoner stood by my side—I had never seen her before, but am sure she is the person—I observed a pair of scissors drop down, which fell against my foot nearest the prisoner—I do not know where they fell from—I then put my hand to my pocket, and caught hold of the prisoner's hand, which was just going out of my pocket, and called out, "Oh, you have robbed me!"—I missed all my money from my pocket; there was only my handkerchief and a key left, and there was a hole cut tight through my pocket—this is it (<hi rend="italic">showing it</hi>)—it has been cut—it was not so before; it was quite a new dress—the pocket is attached to my dress—I caught hold of the prisoner with both arms, and some gentleman by said, "Give up the woman the money," and he picked up the scissors, and asked who they belonged to—she gave me back some of the money—a policeman came up, and I gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. On 15th Nov., about 12 o'clock at night, I was standing at the end of Lombard-Street, looking at a house on fire—I felt something fall between my legs, which I picked up, and it was a pair of scissors—I saw the prisoner right behind me—I turned round, and asked her whether the scissors belonged to her—she said they did not—I said, "They must belong to you, for there is no other person handy enough to throw them"—I then saw the prosecutrix, who was about a yard or not so much from me, and I heard her say she had robbed her, and she had got hold of the prisoner—the prosecutrix said if she gave up the money she would let</p>

            . I am a serjeant of the Police. I made inquiry for the prisoner, and went with Lee, the officer, to No. 3, Match-walk; it is a house of a certain description; we knocked repeatedly, and got in at last, and there found the prisoner coming down stairs; I asked Henderson, in his presence and hearing, if he was the person who stole his property - he said he was; the prisoner at first objected to be searched - I found 9s. 6d. on him, and 10d. in copper; before Lee searched him the prosecutor asked him where his property was - he said, "I have taken your property, but the greater part is spent or lost" (it was four o'clock in the morning) - Lee then searched him, and found a watch on him, but no gold.</p>

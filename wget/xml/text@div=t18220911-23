This was about three nights before I missed my money. I had twelve sovereigns and nine guineas in the chest, which was locked; the key was in my breeches pocket, and my breeches under my pillow. I saw it safe on the 26th of July - three days after that he slept on my chest; I told him to get off and get into bed; he said he lay very well. There were two beds in the room, one mine, and one two sailors had. He only slept in my room that night. I missed my money on the 31st of July. I found the chest locked as I left it. I left the room first in the morning he was on the chest then alone - the sailors were gone. I saw the money safe after he slept on the chest, and never saw him in the room after the 26th.</p>

            . About a day after the 31st of July I saw the prisoner with two sovereigns in his pocket, and a handful of silver; and two or three days after, I changed him a sovereign at the bar. I asked how he came by so much money; he said he got it from the Captain whom he came with. I had had every body in the house searched before that morning - he said he supposed if he had been at home he should have been overhauled as well as the rest; and though he was a dark man, he committed no robberies. I know that a week before he had no money at all.</p>

The prisoner came to me one Tuesday afternoon, the day before he was taken, and asked if he could have a lodging; I said, Yes; he said he had been paid by his Captain for his voyage, and left six guineas with me to take care of. He had more gold in his pocket - I don't know whether they were sovereigns or guineas. I gave them to Forty next morning. He did not come to sleep there.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not a man at your house offer me 20 s. 6 d. for them, and I said they were not mine - A. One Barnett was talking to him; I don't know what he said.</p>

             an old shipmate, who sailed with me in 1818; he said he had received some prize-money at Greenwich, and gave me six guineas and three sovereigns, to take care of for him - I said I would get somebody to take care of them. He said he did not like Seedenberg to know he had them. I took them to Jacobs.</p>

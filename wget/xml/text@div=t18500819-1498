                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On 3rd Aug., I was on duty in Rathbone-place, and saw both the prisoners—I knew Shepherd before—I followed them and saw them cross over to a truck of goods in front of a public-house—Shepherd stood by the side of it, and Mason joined him—Shepherd put his hand into it, and took a bundle out which appeared to be in a red handker<lb></lb>chief—he handed it to Mason, and they both went into the public-house—I ran, and when I got to the corner of Greek-street they came out at the side door which leads out of a mews, and I did not see the bundle—I followed, and took them at the corner of Percy-street—I asked where the bundle was that they took out of the truck—Shepherd said he did not know anything about it—they must have passed it away in the public-house or mews—I took them back to the public-house, and asked the landlord in their presence if they had left the bundle there—he said they merely went in at the front door and went through, and had nothing to drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a builder, of Stephen-street, Tottenham-court-road. On 3rd Aug. I was at the corner of Greek-street, and saw Shepherd put his hand into the truck, take a red and white bundle out, and give it to Mason—it was between them, as if they wanted to conceal it—they then went into the public-house at the front door, and came out at the side.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London Docks. There is tea in the warehouse, No. 9—on 9th May I saw the prisoner, who was a labourer there, going from the docks earlier than usual—he passed me, and I saw something bulky in his pocket, asked to look what he had got—he said his lunch—I took him into the gate-keeper's box, and found 5 lbs. of tea, some in his hat, some in each pocket, and some between his shirt and his skin—I asked him where he got it—he said he bought it of a man on board a ship.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Where was I when you stopped me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In Pennington street—I was standing at the gate—there ought to have been a gate-keeper belonging to the Customs there, but he was not there—there was one belong<lb></lb>ing to the London Docks, there were not three gate-keepers there, only two—you were about ten yards from the dock; I should not be justified in say<lb></lb>ing 100 yards—I came up with you about two seconds after you passed me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman of No. 9 warehouse, West Quay, Lon<lb></lb>don Docks. The prisoner was employed there on 9th May—there was a quantity of tea in chests there, which had been landed there the day before—after the prisoner was taken, I found one of the chests had been opened by violence, and tea missing—I have compared the tea found on the prisoner with that in the chest, and have every reason to believe it is the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you see me at work that morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I have not looked at the book, I placed you at work to mark goods as they came out—the ship's name is <hi rend="italic">"Mitchell"</hi>—there were forty men at work at it—there was <hi rend="italic">jube</hi> on board in bundles—I missed you at half-past nine o'clock, and found Dicker doing your duty—I did not step into the cabin and have a glass of grog, there has been none on board these three weeks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The witness has just stated there was <hi rend="italic">jube</hi> on board the ship, I can prove there was no such thing on board; I can prove by the bill of lading there was not one particle of <hi rend="italic">jube</hi> in the bill of lading or invoice there was <hi rend="italic">kyar</hi>-rope; I have been four years employed by that honourable and honest Company, the London Dock; I have got a wife and five children I was fourteen weeks out of employment, and oat of those fourteen weeks I had seven days' work; when he apprehended me with the tea, I bad met with a party like a sailor, who said he had got a little tea to dispose of, and if I would purchase it, it would prove to my welfare; I said I had got no</p>

               <p>money; he said, "Never mind, if you can make a good sale of it, I will entrust it to you, and give you 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. pence for yourself; and consequently I consented; I had neither handkerchief, cloth, or anything else, and I put it about my body; I went and got very tipsy, and this constable of this honest Company, which is robbing the British merchants of England by wholesale, came and seized me, and said it belonged to them; I am a poor man with a wife and five children, and have had only seven days' work. In coming from Canton or Hong-Kong to London, a great many chests of tea would be broken, and they fetch the chests out in dozens, by heaps, and by numbers, and if the parties think proper they are put into bags and taken away: there is no superior officer, but away the man runs with them on the truck, and away the tea goes on the ground, and then this man comes and says the tea corresponds; the tea, as I said before, is already broke, then it goes to the warehouse, sixty or seventy yards, over rough stones and smooth stones, and Mr. Chandler and the others have a share in it, and that is the honest Com<lb></lb>pany. If I give the foreman a glass of grog he says I am an <hi rend="italic">out-and-out</hi> worker, and I get work next day, but a man with a large family is not able to do this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gold chaser, and live in Wildermess<lb></lb>row. On the 1st of July I was a passenger in the <hi rend="italic">Princess Victoria</hi> steamer going to Gravesend—we got to Greenwich about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning—I observed a boat bringing passengers on board from Greenwich—it came on the Kent side of the steamer—on the Isle of Dog's side, at least the north side—I cannot say whether the boat was hooked to the steamer—one young lady came on board from the boat—I saw another young lady in the act of coming on board from the boat, but the steam boat went on, the paddle-wheel went round and filled the boat with water in an instant—I heard the words "Let go," and "Goon," almost together—"Let go" was said first—before the words "Let go" were said the boat appeared to me to be hooked to the steamer, though I cannot say whether it was—the second young lady was stepping on the ladder—she fell back into the boat—the boat was filled with water, and the waterman the boy, and the deceased were in it, besides the lady—the boat was un<lb></lb>hooked then—it floated some distance from us, although it was full of water—I then saw the deceased and his sister struggling in the water, although in the boat, and the deceased, I suppose, must have slipped over the boat, and sunk to rise no more—I cannot say whether I saw him in the water—I do not know who gave the command of "Let go," and "Go on"—the lady who did come on board was assisted by somebody on board she was almost pulled up the steps—I should think the boat floated thirty or forty yards from the steamer before I missed the deceased—I cannot exactly judge—there was a sailing-barge a-head of us, coming towards us—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184008170189"></xptr>
               <p>should think she was thirty or forty yards from us—we had quite stopped—I am frequently on the water—I think the barge would have struck the steamer if we had not gone on—I did not see another steamer behind the barge.</p>
               <p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are not acquainted with the mode of acting under certain emergencies on the water? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not know whether it was a wherry that came alongside—it was a larger boat than I often see on the Thames—it was a waterman's boat—the barge was coming down in a direction towards the side on which the boat was—we were near the north shore—the skiff was not capsized—there were five persons in the boat, one of whom came on board—the steamer had stopped before the boat came alongside, I am quite sure of that—I did not see any hook in any body's hands—the barge was sailing—she was coming up with the wind—we were going with the tide, and she was coming against it, I believe, I am not certain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am mate of the barge <hi rend="italic">Mary,</hi> which was coming towards the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi>—the tide waft with us—when nearly opposite Greenwich I saw the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> going on—I observed her stop, and saw a wherry go alongside—I did not see the lady get out—I saw the boat hooked to the steamer, but did not see her afterwards till she was sunk—the hooking was done by the steamer—the <hi rend="italic">Emerald</hi> steam-boat came up by the side of us, and hit us about the quarter-mast, and carried away our mizen-mast—she was coming up close behind us before the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> stopped, and at the time the boat was hooked on to the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> she struck us—we were about twenty yards from the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> at that time, inside, to the north—if the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> had not moved there was danger of our running against her, we should have hit her on the larboard quarter, and struck her—we were on the same side of the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> as the wherry—I do not think the boat would have been in danger from us, according to my judgment—we should have struck the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi> further abaft than where the boat was—by her going on, that collision was avoided—we cleared every thing—I saw the lady and gentleman in the water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the boat hooked on, or held on by a man en board the steamer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Hooked on by a hook belonging to the steamer—ours is a seventy-ton barge, and was loaded with forty tons of loam—I think we should have struck the steamer abaft on her quarter, about half a boat's length from the boat—if I am deceived in my calculation, and we had struck the boat, it must have been crashed, and every body in it have been killed—the <hi rend="italic">Emerald</hi> striking us helped us round—we were about twenty feet from the stern of the <hi rend="italic">Victoria</hi>—I could almost have reached her with a hook—I should think the steamer had been nearly a minute in motion at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman. I was in the wherry—it was my wherry—I took off a gentleman and two ladies to put on board the steamer—I went on the larboard side of the steamer—she stopped when I went alongside—one of the ladies stepped on the ladder—the other did not follow, she stopped in the state-room of the boat—she did not come out of the state-room—while the first lady was stepping on the ladder the steamer was set on—that commenced while the first lady was stepping up off the boat on to the ladder—I did not hear any command given on board the steamer—I was hooked on by the hook of the steamer—I suppose she went on account of the barge coming towards her—it</p>

               <p>sunk my boat in an instant, it filled her in an instant—the hook was let go—it unhooked itself, but the hook was fast when the steamer went on—we sunk even with the water's edge—I held fast to the boat—the boat did not sink to the bottom of the river—the lady and Mr. Whistler were washed out of the boat, and the gentleman was lost—the lady was saved—it was spring-tide, and blowing hard from the westward—we generally hold our hat up, or sometimes our hand, when we want to come on board—when we have got our passengers on board we say, "All right"—I had not done so in this case—I had two more to deliver—the gentleman and lady who were left in the boat rose up, but never came forward in the boat—when I found the boat sinking I told them to sit down—mine is a large boat—I have had 26cwt. of ballast in her, besides four grown people—the tide and wind were opposed to each other—in my judgment, the barge was about fifty or sixty yards from the steamer when it went on—if the steamer had not gone on I should have been safe, and my passengers too—we should not have been at all in danger from the barge that was coming—she might have struck the steam-boat on her quarter astern of my boat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How much astern of your boat would she have struck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a boat's length, I cannot exactly say—it would not have been so little as half a boat's length—it was blowing what is called half a gale of wind—there was an Irish boat coming down the river, and one had passed before—they had created a swell—I did not think I was in an awkward situation when I went alongside the steamer, not till I was alongside, and then I saw it—I said to the passengers, "For God's sake, be as quick as you can, for the barge will be into us"—that was when the lady was getting out, when I came alongside at first—Captain Fairbairn as on the paddle-box—he was in a situation to see the boat—I did not hear him call to the man at the boat's head, "Let go"—I think the steamer went on to save herself from the barge striking her on the quarter—I did not see the mizen-mast of the barge go.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Swan-yard, Shoreditch. The prisoners lived next door to me—on Saturday night, 11th Nov., about a quarter-past ten o'clock, I ascertained that all was right and went to bed—I got up next morning between six and seven; went into the sitting-room and found the drawers pulled out and some of them put on chairs—one of the windows was a little Tip—it was down the night before, to the best of my knowledge—I searched the drawers and missed two coats, two pairs of trowsers, a waistcoat, a shawl, a handkerchief, and a table-cloth—I then went down stairs and found the outer door unlocked and the key lying down inside on the floor—my wife had locked that door the night before—I did not hear her lock it—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation to the police about five minutes after—I saw Martin Williams on Sunday evening, 12th—I told him I bad been robbed, and (old him the articles that had been stolen from me—he said it was a very great pity; I might hear of them by and by—he came to me next day and told me he wanted to speak to me in the public-house—I went with him, and he said that he had all my things and I should have them in the evening—he said his son had robbed me, and had robbed him several times before—I went and got a policeman; went back, and asked Martin Williams to go home with me and show me the things—he went home and said be could not find them—we then came down and went to a bed-room down stairs, which the old gentleman said was his room—I saw the policeman turn up the bed there and find two coats, two pairs of trowsers, and a shawl; and a table-cover was in a drawer in the room—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On 12th Nov., in consequence of a communication made to me by last witness, I went into a public-house and saw Martin Williams there—I heard him say he did not know whether the clothes were in his house or not—I told him I would take him there, and we went—he said, "I know nothing about it, but I will go to my house and see if they are there"—on the way to the house he told me to keep all as quiet as I could, not to let anybody know of it—I went with him to the garret of the bouse, but found nothing—he then went into the back bed-room on the first floor and I followed him—there was a box there, and he took a key out of his pocket and tried to unlock it, but the key would not fit—I searched the room, turned up the bed, and there found, between the bed and mattress, two coats, two pairs of trowsers, a shawl, and a satin waistcoat; and in a drawer I found a table-cloth—Martin Williams said nothing then—I asked him before I found them if he knew anything about them, and he said, no, he knew</p>

On Monday evening, 13th Nov. about a quarter to nine o'clock, the prosecutor came to me, and I went in search of the younger prisoner, and found him at a beer-shop in Holywell-lane, Shoreditch—I told him I came about the bundle of clothes—he said, "Oh, I can give a good account of how I came by it"—he said, as he was going home on the Saturday night with a friend of his, he saw a man standing outside the prosecutor's door, and another man came to him to look out of the door, and asked if it was all right; he said, "Yes," and came out; the man came out with a bundle, and, on seeing him, he threw down the bundle, and ran away; he then took up the bundle, and took it in-doors, and put it into the copper; that his father found it in the morning, and told him to take it into Bowie's; he told him he would not, why did not he take it in?</p>

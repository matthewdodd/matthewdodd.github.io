            : On the 13th of November, my master having occasion to ship some goods to Barbadoes, my master ordered the prisoner at the bar to get our truck ready; I went with him, and going down Cheapside; I run the truck against him; he said, I had burst his watch open; not knowing he had a watch, I asked him what he meant; he shewed me the watch, I knew the watch, and he put it in his pocket again; I had just took hold of it when he held it by the string.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose watch was it? - A. I did not examine it then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to say it was your master's watch when you got home, and saw it again? - A. Yes, I then knew it to be my master's, it is No. 106. he had not then been out of my sight; I told one of our men, and the man seeing the string, asked him to shew him the watch; I then took the watch, I asked him how he came by the watch; he said his mother bought it for him.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 35, Chiswell-street, I am servant to Mr. Dobson; I have a silver watch, pledged on the 13th of November, for sixteen shillings, of Joseph Cane. (The watch produced, and identified by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I took the two watches.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take them? - A. Because I wanted money; and my brother who is at sea promised to send me some money, and when I received that money I promised to pay it; I gave them to my father-in-law, and he asked me how I came by them; I told him my fellow-apprentice gave them me; and then he went and pledged them directly.</p>

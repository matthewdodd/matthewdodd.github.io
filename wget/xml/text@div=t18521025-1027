On 5th Oct. my wife took the shilling off the mantelpiece and gave it to me—on 6th Emma Davenport brought me a counterfeit shilling—the prisoner was in the shop at the time, and I told him it was the second time he had been there—he said he had not been there before—I turned round to see whether the shilling corresponded with the first one, and before I turned back again he disappeared—I put the two shillings away upstairs—on the Friday Daven<lb></lb>port came into the parlour, I went into the shop, found the prisoner there, and received a bad half crown from Davenport—I told the prisoner it was the third time he had been there that week—he said I was mistaken, he had not been there before—I sent for a constable—I marked the two shillings and the half crown—I gave them to the sergeant at the station, and saw him give them to Batty.</p>

               <p>R. Wilson. It was about a fortnight before the other witness saw him carry that which he speaks of. I then told the prisoner if he did not take care he would lose the iron; I followed him up the street to see where he carried it; he went into a court, and before I got to the corner, he was out of fight, and I lost him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>R. Wilson. In a court in St. John's-street.</p>

               <p>I never was in that woman's house, or spoke to her in my life, till she came to New-prison, and said she bought the iron of me; she is mistaken. When she said, she bought it cheaper than could be afforded, I said then, why did you not stop the man that sold it to you. Before the justice the constable swore my master was sick, and after that, my master swore his man was sick, and so wanted to keep me another month.</p>

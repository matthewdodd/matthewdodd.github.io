                  </hi>. I am a water-carrier, and live at Richmond. I had a gelding, which I turned out into the meadows at East Sheen, on Saturday, the 5th of June, between six and seven o'clock in the evening—the policeman called me up on Monday morning, between one and two o'clock, and brought the gelding to me—I had not missed it—the prisoner is a stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable</hi> 57) I was on duty at East Sheen, in the parish of Mortlake, on Monday the 7th, about twenty minutes to one o'clock in the morning—I was standing at the end of Blind-lane—I heard the noise as if of a horse coming through a hedge—as I was going towards the place, I met the prisoner in a potato field, leading the horse—there is no road through that field—I asked what made him there, it was no place for him to have his horse—he said as he was taking a pint of beer, his horse dropped over the wall into the field—I told him to come out on to the road, which he did, and I took him into custody—I after<lb></lb>wards showed the horse to the prosecutor, and he claimed it—it was a gelding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He said if he was seen with the horse in his possession he should be taken up by another policeman; I had not the horse in my pos<lb></lb>session; I had nothing at all to do with it, neither was I in the field <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was inside the hedge—I was standing on the footpath which adjoins the potato-field, and is separated by the hedge—I never said what he has stated—he was leading the horse by this halter—which was on the horse—as I was taking the prisoner to the station he took this halter off the horse's head, and said the horse might go on before us—I saw him fold the halter up, as if to put it into his pocket, and he dropped it on the road—I got it next morning—we drove the horse on before us to the station, with<lb></lb>out any thing at all.</p>

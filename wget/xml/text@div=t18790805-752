               <p>Lower Road, Eotherhithe—on Friday night, May 9th, I secured the house and went to bed at 11.30, and on getting up at 4.45 next morning found the drawers wide open, and one pulled out, and the contents strewed about the floor—I missed from the drawers five sheets, a child's coat and cape, an overcoat, a silk scarf, five pairs of stockings, a chemise, a guernsey, and from the cupboard a table-cloth—I called in the police and found the window-fastening in the back yard broken off—and I saw two marks—a person could get over the gates from Maynard Road into the yard—I went to the pawnbroker's at the policeman's request, and saw this shawl and other things there—they are what I missed. Edward Treadaway. I assist Messrs. Adams and Hiilstead, pawn-brokers, 171, Jamaica Road, Bermondsey, and produce a sheet and shawl pledged in the name of Ann Jones, on 10th May, by a woman giving the address on the duplicate—I have since seen and taken pledges from a woman named Ann Jones, but am not sure that she is the same woman.</p>

On the morning of 10th May I ex<lb></lb>amined the premises at 211, Lower Road, and found the back window had been forced by some instrument, and the catch broken—I found the things strewed all over the room—on the 15th I went to 30, West Lane, Bermondsey, the address given on the pawnticket, with a uniform constable, in consequence of information received, to. the second-floor front room, which was pointed out to me as the prisoner's room, and found the prisoner alone, lying on a mattress—I told him I was a police officer, and I should arrest him tor an attempted burglary—he said, "All right"—he was partly dressed and had his boots and trousers on—I searched him and found in his pocket a pawnticket referring to a pair of boots in the name of John Jones, 30, West Lane—I handed him over to the constable and told him to look after him while I searched, and under the mattress where he had been lying I found this rope and. hook (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which is used by housebreakers to throw up to a veranda to pull themselves up—while I was examining the room the prisoner jumped from the top of the stairs to the bottom and escaped—I pursued him, but was unable to find him—he was subsequently arrested by an officer of the M Division—I also found this jemmy—I have compared it With the marks or the impres<lb></lb>sions on the window—these parts produced containing the impressions have been cut out, and they correspond with tike jemmy.</p>

I am wife of Charles Jones of 30, West Lane—the prisoner took a room from me last February, and slept there about three months—I have never pledged anything for him except his own wearing apparel, and do not know these things produced—I pledged things for him at Mr. Adams's, 171, Jamaica Row, and know Mr. Treadaway—I never pawned these goods—my name was never asked, I only gave the name of Jones—there is no other Jones at 30, West Lane, but I believe there used to be—my husband was not in regular employment. Walter Wag (Detective W) I took this jemmy from the prisoner on the morning of 25th December, and have seen it at the police-court.</p>

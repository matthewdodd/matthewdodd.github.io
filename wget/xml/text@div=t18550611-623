                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, Sutherland-terrace, Caledonian-road. On 17th May, I made a communication to the police, and two policemen came and remained in my house that night—nothing happened that night—they were in the house on the 18th and on the 19th—on the night of the 21st they were on the first floor landing in the first part of the night—they went down to the parlour about 3 o'clock—a little after 3, I heard a latch key go in the door, and the latch was raised, and immediately after I heard a scuffle; I went down and saw the prisoners in the custody of the police—I lent a hand, and they were secured—the door was on the latch when I left it—it was shut close.</p>

ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am manager of a shoe business for Mr. Pocock—it is not my business—I have been there about fifteen months—I am not a sporting character at all—I never set any traps to catch vermin—I have sometimes played at skittles—I know Blower—I never played at skittles with him in my life—I never had any transaction with him about skittles—I know Charles Cane—I will swear I never made bets with Blower in presence of Cane, or played at skittles with him—I began to watch on 17th May—I was up the whole night—I was on the sofa in the parlour—I did not keep awake all Friday night—I was in bed about two hours—there are three floors in the house—on Saturday night I did not have more than two hours' sleep—I was on the bed, but not undressed—On the night between the Sunday and Monday this took place, a little after 3 o'clock—the two policemen that were there on the first night were not the same who were there on the following nights—the two that watched on Friday continued down to Sunday—they did not follow me about the house—we sat together and watched generally—I had very little to eat because I was in an excitement—I was in a continual state of excitement from Friday to Sunday—I had a very small portion of beer to drink—I furnished the policemen with beer every night—I can say positively there was not more than three pints of beer any night—we had half a pint of gin—I am sure I did not take more than a glass, and there was always a great portion of what I had left—the two policemen were very abstemious ones—we had gin every night—I suppose it remained on the table—on the night in question I was on the first floor, sitting about the centre of the room, and on the sofa—Mr. Hardy, my lodger, occupies that floor—he was sitting with me—I heard the latch of the street door raised, heard a scuffle, and soon afterwards I went down, in a minute, or a minute and a half afterwards—I know both the prisoners—we had had things stolen from the door of the shop, but no one had broken in.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 381).

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At what time did you begin to get something to eat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps 10 o'clock—we had something like half a pint of beer—we took nothing afterwards—we sat down—the landlord went up stairs the first night—there might have been a drop of gin, but I did not have it—there was some gin in the house—we might have taken it—we were told that it was there to drink if we liked, but we did not wish to take anything to send us to sleep—we were on the landing up stairs till nearly the period when this latch was lifted—we had come down, it might be a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before—the other officer came down a minute or two after me—I came down to try the door—it was fastened—we heard a slight noise, but it was shut—we thought they would come that night; they had come one or two nights previous—the second night they came and opened the door, and got in, but went away again—we were in the front shop—we do not get any extra expenses for watching, unless the person feels disposed to give us a reward—I was sent there by my superior officer.</p>

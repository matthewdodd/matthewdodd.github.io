                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist of 3, Lower-terrace, Lower-road, Islington—on 8th February, about 11 at night, I was at the Blakeneys Head public-house, near Islington turnpike—the prisoner was there—I knew him well by sight, but I had never spoken to him—I treated him with some drink, and he went out with me down the Lower-road—I saw some one following us—we went into Mr. Silcox's public-house, at the corner of church-passage, a quarter of a mile off—I cannot be certain whether the person who followed us came in, but a person who was with the prisoner drank with us—I treated them, and then the prisoner took my arm, saying that he would see me home, and went out with me—there are two steps, and the moment I was off the second step, I was seized behind, and my arms pinioned, and the prisoner came in front of me, took my watch, and gave it a twist—I told him I knew him very well, and could apprehend him at any time—they ran away up Church-passage—I cannot say whether the man who pinioned my arms was the man who had been drinking with us—I gave information of the robbery—I have not got my watch back.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, who keeps the King's Head public-house, Lower-road, Islington—on 8th January, about a quarter or twenty minutes past. 12 at night, Mr. Seares came in with the prisoner—no one else came in with them, but I afterwards saw another man drinking with the prisoner—Mr. Seares was not quite tipsy—he was quite sober enough to know what he was about.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he a little gone? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he did not treat everybody, he only treated the prisoner and his friend—he showed it in this way; he called for a glass of wine, and put down a shilling on the counter, my mother drew it and put down 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which the prisoner picked up, and put 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In the prosecutor's hand, and slid the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. On the counter saying, "You have left the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. On the edge of the counter"—the prosecutor could count, and he walked steadily, but he walked about the bar a little excited—I cannot say how much he had to drink there, as I was not there all the time—he had some brandy and water, and the prisoner had several glasses of wine.</p>

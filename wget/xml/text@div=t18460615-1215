                  </hi>. I am the wife of Phineas Phillips, and keep a stall next to the prosecutrix's, in the Exchange, in Cutler—street. The prisoner came week after week to my stall to purchase articles—on the 28th of May I saw her coming from the prosecutrix's stall to mine—the prosocutrix called out, "I have got my thief"—she stooped over my goods, and caught hold of the prisoner, and said, "You have got a handkerchief of mine"—the prisoner pretended to look over a little basket which she had in her hand—the prosecutrix said, "No, you have not got it there"—she shook her for a minute and a half, and it dropped from under her arm—it laid there till the officer came, and the prosecutrix gave it to him—I am sure I saw it drop from the prisoner's arm.</p>

I was fetched, and when 1 got to the spot where the prisoner was standing, there were a number of people about—several of them spoke, and the prosecutrix lifted up this handkerchief from the stall, from some things that lay there, and gave it to me—I had great difficulty to keep the crowd off—there were a great number of people saying "Lady thief"—the prosecutrix lifted the handkerchief off the top of some things that lay on the ground, and gave it to me.</p>

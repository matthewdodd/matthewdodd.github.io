On the 19th of April, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was behind the counter, and saw the prisoner standing at the corner pane of the window for a minute or two; he then dashed his hand through the glass and broke the square to pieces. I immediately ran out - he was running and turned down a court four doors off, and through several courts; I at last took him in Stanhope-street; I only lost sight of him in turning the corners; I am sure he is the man; I collared him - he said it was only a window broken, and I could not take him, but I detained him; he immediately took off his hat and said "Here is what you want, take it;" giving me this silver chronometer in a mahogany box; I knew it to be master's; our shop ticket is on it now; I had seen it in the window, about an inch from the broken pane, a quarter of an hour before; we have had it six months; I did not see him take it; I produce it - it is marked eighteen guineas; it is worth 10 l.; my master and his family were in the house all the time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I think you were at the further end of the shop? A. Yes; there is an inside sash-spoons and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190024"></xptr>things hang half way down the window; I was three or four yards from the broken pane - the sun was shining all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear at the office that I had a glove on when I broke the window? A. I do not think I did - you had one in your hand as I took you to the watch-house, but when you were searched you had not got it.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was going towards Drury-lane between seven and eight o'clock on this morning - I saw several people running, and heard a cry of Stop him! I found the prisoner in custody - Frost had the property in his hand. I searched the prisoner's hat, and some pieces of glass dropped out; I compared them with the window - they corresponded, and appeared to have formed part of that pane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. From the witness's evidence he stood some distance from the pane, and spoons hung in the glass-case; it is for you to decide whether he could have a distinct view of me: he only momentarily lost sight of me. Now, while I turned the corner could I possibly put the property into my hat? I was passing up a court - a person ran against me, and shoved me; my hat fell off: the watch and case fell down from him; I picked them up, put them into my hat, and ran off - when I was taken I gave it to him; distress made me do that. I had witnesses yesterday to prove I did not break the window.</p>

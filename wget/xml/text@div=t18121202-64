About the beginning of November two odd shoes were missing from my shop; from information I went to Marlborough-street office, and saw two odd shoes, and they were fellows of the two shoes I had. I know nothing of the prisoner; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>DAVID MASSEY. I live with Mr. Harrison, pawnbroker, No. 12, Dean-street, Golden-square. The prisoner came into our shop and offered two shoes to pledge; when Mr. Harrison looked at them he said they were two odd ones; he sent for Foy, the officer; he took the prisoner in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 23rd of October I was sent for to Mr. Harrison's shop. Mr. Harrison detained the prisoner until I came. I asked the prisoner how he came possessed of them shoes. He said he had bought them for eighteen shillings, in Holborn. I asked how it came that he did not buy fellows, one is half an inch longer than the other. He then said, that he had the fellows to them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Them shoes are for the right foot, and these in my possession are for the left, and they are the fellows to them.</p>

               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence.</p>

               <p>Q. You have a servant maid of the name of Wakelin - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she your servant on the 1st of this month - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of that day what time did you leave your house - A. I think it was five minutes past nine. Previous to that time I had been extremly ill, and confined to the house. On that evening I went out accompanied by a friend; I went to the play at Covent Garden; I had locked the doors of the upper rooms, the bed room door, the dressing-room door; four doors I had locked, a cupboard and a closet; the closet and the cupboard were in the bed-room. There is one door leading into the bed-room and one door into the dressing-room. I requested the servant not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150005"></xptr>to leave the house, and to put up the chain when I went out. I returned a little after twelve and found some of the officers at the door; I was very much alarmed. The officers were at the door waiting for me, and some female friends. I did not go up stairs immediately, I was so much terrified. When I went up the officers went with me, I found the dressing-room door broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way had it been fastened - A. It was locked, and the key inside. I went out of that room into the bed-room, bolted that door, and went out of the door that leads into the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into your dressing-room did you find every thing in the same state that you left it - A. No, I found the toilet had been very much pulled about, and my bed had been moved from its place, and the bottom valants pulled off, and I believe one of the side ones; the vallants appeared as if they had been forced off. On going into my bed-room the door leading into my bed-room was open, I believe it was forced open.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us all you observed in the dressing-room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Your bed was not in the dressing-room - A. No. In my dressing-room I only observed my toilet had been moved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. You told me before there was a door that separated the dressing-room from the bed-room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that any thing had been done to that door - A. I cannot say, I was so much alarmed whether it was broken open, or how I got into it. It must have been broken open, or else I could not have got into it; I had bolted it before I went out: the bold was on the bed-room side. I have told you what was the state of the bed. In the room where I kept my trinket box, which was every thing that I had got in it; it was in a small closet on the right hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out had you left that closet locked - A. Locked, and I had the key myself in my drawer, where I always kept it. I found that door broken open; that lock had been forced open, and the screws out.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got into the closet in what state did you find it - A. I found the trunk safe, and the trinket box in the large closet safe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether any force had been used to open the box - A. It appeared to have been a little forced; I went then to the closet where I formerly kept the trinket box, but I had moved it some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left that closet locked or open when you went out - A. Locked: I took the key out and put in my drawer. I found all the shelves broken to pieces, and the bottom part of the cupboard torn up, and the hinges forced off; the hinges were separated from the wood. At the inside of the cupboard was a canvas and a paper on it, it seemed as if there had been a knife through it, to see if it was hollow. The outer bed-room door was locked in the state as I left it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Is your name Jane - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body live with you that pays part of the rent - A. There is none.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you married - A. I am not.</p>

            . Q. You are the servant of the last witness - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first become acquainted with either of the prisoners at the bar - A. It was eight or ten days before the 1st of January Clayton came to my mistress's house, I answered the door; he told me his name was Wilson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Clayton by himself, or was any man with him - A. He was by himself. There were two men on the other side of the way, I do not know whether they belonged to him or not. Clayton said he had a letter for Mrs. Martin; that was the name my mistress went by. He went away.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was the other prisoner at the bar with him - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see Clayton - A. A night or two afterwards he threw things down in the area.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard things in the area - A. Yes. My mistress sent me out with a message, and then I saw Clayton; he asked me to take something to drink; I said no, I would rather not; he insisted upon me having something; we went and had something to drink.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return to your mistress's house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about his coming into the house - A. Oh dear no, nothing at all; I saw him a night or two afterwards, when I went for things for my mistress; I saw him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to drink any thing - A. No, not that time. He did not return with me to my mistress's house; he was then alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him frequently after that - A. Yes, he spoke to me in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever come to the door after that - A. Not till the last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the first time when the letter was delivered to the last time did you ever see the other prisoner Jenkins - A. No; I never saw him until the 1st of January.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 1st of January we understand your mistress went to the play - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after your mistress went to the play on the 1st of January did you go out of your mistress's house - A. It wanted ten minutes to ten. When I went out of the house I double locked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you double locked the door did you see Clayton - A. Clayton ran after me from the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him immediately you went out - A. Yes; I was going to get some sprats for my supper; I immediately when I saw him returned back to the door to get something that I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the door had you got when Clayton accosted you - A. As far as the corner of King-street. about four doors. When Clayton came up to me he said, I saw your mistress go out; I said, yes, my mistress was gone out; he immediately returned with me to the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. How came you to talk then about your mistress, had you before any conversation about your mistress - A. No. We both returned back to the door, and Clayton said, let me go down stairs for about half an hour; he said he would go against she came home from the play; I told him my mistress suffered no men to come after the maid-servant, and the door was open he immediately rushed in.</p>
               <p>Q. The door was open during the time you had that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150006"></xptr>conversation - A. Yes, I had it a jar, and he desired to go down stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Had you a lamp burning in the passage - A. Yes. I and Clayton went down stairs, he sat down: there was a stone bottle on the dresser, he said give me the bottle, I will go and get a quartern of rum: he went away with the stone bottle, I remained in the house. He returned in about five minutes. While he was gone I went into the parlour to stir the fire up. The street door was shut during his absence.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned back how did he gain admittance - A. He knocked at the door, and Jenkins came in after him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they come in - A. Clayton came in first and when the other man came in he said it is all right. Clayton shut the door. I denied Jenkins coming in, and told him I dare not have two, if I asked one I could not ask two; I said it out loud: Clayton made answer and said, it is all bloody stuff; they said no further; then they went down stairs, I went after them. When they got down stairs they drank a glass each, and left a glass on the table for me to take.</p>
               <p>Q. After that what was done - A. Clayton said, I insist upon you to go up stairs; he caught hold of me and insisted upon my shewing him where my mistress's purse of guineas were; I made answer, I never saw my mistress only with one while I was with her, and she said she would sell it.</p>
               <p>COURT. One what - A. One guinea, sir. They then dragged me up stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Who dragged you up stairs - A. Clayton, the other man went with the candle. Clayton went up first, I was second, and Jenkins was behind with a candle, they were dragging me up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way up the kitchen stairs was any thing said by either of them to you - A. Jenkins said it was all bloody stuff, for I knew where the guineas were; I said, Lord have mercy upon me, pray, for God's sake do not touch my mistress's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when you got upon the top of the kitchen stairs what passed then - A. It was then I said Lord have mercy upon me; I spoke it loud, the persons by must have heard; I dare say the gentleman at the door heard me.</p>
               <p>Q. You went up the first flight of stairs the same as you did the kitchen stairs - A. Yes, I went up that flight of stairs by force. He immediately broke the dressing-room door open. The candle went out on first stairs, Jenkins went down stairs and lit it, and returned with the light. Clayton told Jenkins to go and get a light. Then we went up the second flight of stairs to my mistress's dressing-room door; Clayton bursted the door open: he put his back against the garret stair-case, and his footagainst the door, and pushed it open.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the door was forced open where was Jenkins - A. He was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he do anything - A. Not then. I said, pray for God's sake do not; Clayton answered it was all stuff.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you got to the dressing-room did you see any pistol - A. Yes, Jenkins had it in his right-hand pocket, he produced it, and gave it to Clayton, Clayton put it to my head and told me if I made the least alarm he would blow my brains out. He held the pistol in his hand, and put it to the side of my head, and with the other hand he had hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been making any noise - A. All the way up stairs I cried out, the kitchen stairs and all.</p>
               <p>Q. The door being broken open you all three, I suppose went into the room - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was then done - A. They opened the bedroom door, they undid the handle, it was not bolted, he took hold of the handle and opened it.</p>
               <p>COURT. There was a bolt was not there - A. It was not bolted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. When you got into the bed-room what did they proceed to do - A. Clayton went to the closet, he pulled the paper off the key-hole, the keyhole was pasted over; I never saw the cupboard opened before. Jenkins then pulled out a case of little things, screw drivers, picklock keys, and several things, and put them on my mistress's bed; he took the screw driver, or the picklock key for the purpose of undoing the cupboard door; he did not open it; he sent Jenkins down for the kitchen poker.</p>
               <p>COURT. What door - A. The cupboard door on the side of my mistress's bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Who was the man that tried to open the door with the instrument - A. Clayton. He was not able to open the door with the instrument, he sent Jenkins down for the kitchen poker; he went down and returned with the kitchen poker, and Clayton opened the door with the kitchen poker; he put the poker underneath the door, and bursted the cupboard door open; he then bursted the bottom part of the cupboard open; Clayton said the guineas were there; the cupboard was empty, there was nothing in it; he put a pen-knife all over the paper. There then was the cupboard on the other side of the fire place, Clayton forced that open; there was a trunk there that had my mistress's property, Clayton forced that open with a screw driver. They tried to open the trunk, I told them it was of no use, my mistress's property was down stairs, they did not open it. At the time that the attempt was made to open the trunk I heard a noise below; I said immediately the property was down stairs. I thought of getting lower down, they had hold of me; we all came down together and there was a knock at the street-door; I went to the door and opened it, and the officers rushed in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. Are the Bow-street officers here - A. They are here.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Clayton came at first with a letter - A. Yes. He was a perfect stranger to me, I never saw him with my eyes before.</p>
               <p>Q. You had something to drink with him - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. You said this night you were going out on some errand of your own - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not wish him to come down stairs with you - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But yet you neglected your own business - A. I did not neglect my own business; the woman had sold all her sprats, and was gone; she sat at the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the bottle was standing at the dresser<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150007"></xptr>dy - A. Not ready for him; it always stood there.</p>
               <p>Q. He went for a quartern of rum, you went to stir the parlour fire you opened the door, and in they came - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to the public house this night and ask for Clayton - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you knew the pistol was not loaded - A. I did not. He put it to my head and said he would blow my brains out.</p>

            , and Townsend were watching the house with me. Under the direction of the office we watched the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect on what night you went to watch the house first - A. On the 23d of December we watched the house; the first and the second night we got into a house right facing of it, so as to be able to see every thing that came to the door; I saw Clayton one night in the street; I saw him speaking to the servant, the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was that - A. Not exactly at the door, but a little of one side of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him do any thing to the house, or come to the house - A. No. We continued watching the house until the 1st. On the evening of the 1st between ten and eleven o'clock, I was at the public-house and the other four were watching; Read, the two Limbricks, and Townsend were watching opposite; I received an information that the two prisoners were gone in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where is the public-house, how near - A. At the corner of the street, just by. When they informed me I went to them and we all stood about the door; I peeped down, and looked into the area, there is an iron railing goes over; I there heard some loud talk, and I saw a man's hat lay on the dresser, and presently I heard some people coming up the kitchen stairs, I heard the voice of a woman screaming; then they all went up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a noise upon their going up stairs - A. I did, and after they went up stairs I heard a great noise, such as bursting and breaking open of doors, as I supposed it was. I continued at the door a great while untill all was silent, I could hear nothing at all, and then I thought they might be doing the servant some injury; I then got a crow in order to break the door open; in doing that I made such a noise as any person in the house must have heard me, and by that noise they all came down stsirs; me and the other officers rushed in. The door opened, I cannot say who opened it. I and Townsend took Jenkins, and the other officers took the other. We took him to a public-house opposite. I searched him and found this pistol on him, it was not loaded. The other prisoner was taken at the same time all in the passage. After searching the prisoner Jenkins I returned back to the house of the prosecutrix. In the passage these things were picked up, it is a case of small chissels, screw drivers, &amp;c.; it was picked up and given me by somebody there; I did not see it picked up. I went up stairs to see what they had done.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went did you find the house in the state that the girl has described it - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mary Wakelin. You spoke of a case that was put on the bed by Jenkins - A. Yes, this was the same one.</p>
               <p>Perry. There is sixteen instruments to the case.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You were one of the persons that were set to watch the house - A. I was the person that received the information; I first went there on Monday the 23d of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the 23d of December and the 1st of January had you seen either of the prisoners about there - A. I had seen Clayton standing at Mrs. Martin's door; I saw him there three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 1st of January tell me what you saw - A. About nine o'clock the servant girl went out, she returned in about ten minutes with a hackney coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Clayton before that time - A. Not that night.</p>
               <p>Q. In fact when the coach came the mistress went away - A. Yes. In about ten minutes the girl came out and shut the door after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen Clayton between the time of the coach going away and the girl going out - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see Clayton - A. In about five minutes after the girl went out Clayton and the girl returned arm in arm together to Mrs. Martin's door.</p>

               <p>Q. When they got to the door were you near enough to hear any thing that was said by either of them - A. No. They talked at the door ten minutes or a quarter of an hour before they went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at that time the person of Clayton - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see Clayton again - A. In about a quarter of an hour Clayton came out.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did he return - A. In about five minutes with another man with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at that time know who the other man was - A. I did not. Clayton knocked at the door, the servant opened it, Clayton went in, and the other forced himself in; Clayton paused at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe in what manner the other man forced himself in - A. It appeared that Clayton held the door until the other man came round by the shutters and forced himself in.</p>
               <p>Q. So that till the other man came in the servant girl who opened the door could not see him - A. No: he came round by the shutters and forced himself in, and we heard the door bang to. I gave information to Perry, and then we came to the prosecutrix's door we crossed over the way; I looked down the area, I saw a man's hat lay on the table, they all of them seemed to be talking loud.</p>
               <p>COURT. Who was talking loud - A. I heard the men's voices taking very loud.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Were you able to hear any thing that was said by either of them - A. No. I heard the girl cry out, Lord have mercy upon me, what shall I do; she continued the cry all up stairs, she appeared to cry very much; then I heard a great noise as if doors were being broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear anything more than what Perry has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150008"></xptr>told us - A. Nothing more, until they came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. When the door was opened which of the men did you take in custody - A. Clayton, and I took him over to the wine vaults and searched him; upon him I found this knife and a dollar; I then took him to the office, and he was committed. This is the knife I found upon Clayton, it appeared bent, as if it had been pushed against places.</p>
               <p>Mr. Arabin. It is a very common knife - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am one of the patrols of Bow-street office. I was upon watch this night.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the door what did you observe - A. I kneeled down and peeped through the keyhole to see what was passing through the passage; there was a lamp burning in the passage; the first I saw was Clayton and Jenkins and the servant between them both going up stairs; I heard the girl say, do not, my mistress will be ruined, and I shall be ruined myself; I think them are the words; she said it loud, so that I could hear it, and people that were standing outside as well. They went up stairs, and in about three or four minutes afterwards I saw one of the prisoners, which I cannot take upon me to say, come down and light a candle from the lamp; he returned up stairs with the light. I heard a great knocking up stairs for about the space of five minutes; I then saw Jenkins coming down stairs with the candle in his hand alight; I expected he was coming out of the street door, but he went down the kitchen stairs; I saw him return up stairs with the poker in his hand; he went up stairs, and we heard a knocking up stairs, and in the course of about two minutes I did not hear the servant speak at all; I said I am afraid they are doing something to the servant we had better break in; I saw no more than what the other witnesses have told, except after the prisoners were taken we secured them; at the moment I lit a candle and went up stairs; I found this skeleton key laying in the passage; it is a picklock. This picklock fits the case that has been produced; I found it where the prisoners were apprehended.</p>

            . Q. I do not know whether you know any more than what the others have deposed to - A. No more than I saw Clayton go in; I saw him several nights before; the other prisoner I had not. The time that Clayton went in was between nine and ten o'clock, he staid in some time, and when he came out and returned and brought Jenkins with him it was gone ten. Here is the staple of the dressing-room door, which they forced out, and here is some of the paper that covered the key-hole of the cupboard, and here are the screws that came out of the cupboard, which were concealed under the paper.</p>

               <p>Mr. Arabin. You said you knew Clayton before - A. Yes, by being about there before, no other way.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Respecting this cupboard, was any use made of it - A. Not any particular use; it is a cupboard in the wall, even with the paper. It is a part of the house, and covered with the same paper as the roam.</p>
               <p>Clayton's Defence. I am very sorry I have employed a counsel, he is not here.</p>
               <p>Jenkin's Defence. All I have to say I would wish to ask the servant girl whether Clayton did not say I was his acquaintance. I made no force at all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mary Wakelin. You opened the door when the two prisoners came in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the manner in which Jenkins came in - A. Clayton came first, and Jenkins rushed in after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Clayton ask Jenkins to come in - A. No, he rushed in.</p>
               <p>Clayton called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jenkins called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

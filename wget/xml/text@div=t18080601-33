            . On the 23d of May, between nine and ten in the evening, I saw the prisoner in High-street, St. Giles's; she came out of a liquor shop; she took me home to her apartment.</p>

               <p>Q. I suppose you went home with her - A.No; I had an article in my hand which she took away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your article - A. A wire sieve.</p>
               <p>Q. She took hold of the sieve and took you home with her - A. Yes; I did not like to let go, and she took me home with her; she used me violently ill, and said I should not go out of the room till I had paid her some money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you cry out - A. No. I was afraid; I was in a nasty dirty place in <placeName id="t18080601-33-crimeloc183">Dyot street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts did you meet with her - A. Almost opposite Oxford road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs with her - A. Yes, she went up first.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you come out when she used you ill - A. There was a parcel of fellows at the door would not let me come out; she said I should not go out of the room without giving her some money; I took my purse out of my pocket and gave her a shilling; when I got my purse out I missed my purse.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she take from you - A. A half guinea, and two seven shilling pieces; she took all that was in my purse; it was found in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the room - A.Not a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cry out for help - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. So you staid there a quarter of an hour and then you went away - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY LANE. I am a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time in the course of last month see the last witness - A. Yes, about the 23rd of May, between the hours of nine and ten o'clock at night; this boy came to me crying, he said he was robbed of his money; I asked him at what house; he did not know the house nor the name of the street, he said he knew the girl; I took him into two or three public houses, she was not there. I went into another, she was there; he said there she is; I took her to her room, I found the key in her pocket; I unlocked the door, and found the purse under the window with half a guinea, two seven shilling pieces, and a penny in copper.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met with this young man in Russel street, he was very tipsy; he asked me if I had a room of my own, he gave me a shilling; on account of his being so young, I would not have any thing to do with him; I took the candle and lit him down stairs; I found the pocket book on the floor; I was going for a pint of beer, I met the watchman and this young man; they accused me of the robbery; he said I wronged him of so much, at the same time it was a falsity.</p>

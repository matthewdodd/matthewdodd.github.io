            . I went out with my master and mistress on the 19th of January, I left him in the stable. I returned in about half an hour, and found the stable door on the latch, and missed my silver buckles from my shoes, and my box from out of my lodging-room in the stable, the door being broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in that box?</p>
               <p>Hanson. Three shirts, one silver stock buckle, three pair of worstead stockings, one stock, one hone. I found my goods in Aldersgate-Street, at the Black-Horse alehouse; being informed he had confessed they were there, by my fellow servant, after he had been taken up about five days.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear him confess any thing?</p>

            . I am a servant to Mr. Carter. When I heard the prisoner was taken up, I went to see what was the matter. On the 24th of January I ask'd him what he had done with the silver buckles he had taken out of the coachman's room; he told me he had pawn'd them for six shillings; I ask'd him what he had done with the box and other things? He said the hone was at a barber's opposite the Black Horse in Aldersgate-Street; he shew'd me one of the shirts on his back, and own'd the taking of the stockings. He said the box was at the Black Horse, and he had given two shirts out to be mended; he own'd he took three stocks, but would not tell what he had done with them; neither would he own the stock buckle. He told me that he opened the door with the pitch-fork.</p>

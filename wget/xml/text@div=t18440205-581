                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Beard-street, Hendon. I attended the deceased the day after the accident—on removing the dressing of his head there was a long torn wound extending five or six inches to within an inch of the outer corner of the right eye—it went through the integuments down to the bone in front of the head—he died from nervous spasm, from locked jaw, which in my opinion arose from the injury—that is not the reasonable result of concussion—it does sometimes arise after wounds</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184402050073"></xptr>
               <p>of comparatively small importance—we do not usually find locked jaw after injuries of the head—much oftener from injuries to the extremities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you know him before the transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—at the end of the third day the constitution was giving way—there were preliminary symptoms of what is called <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—the nervous system was shaken—there was no fractured skull—I should not have recommended his being driven home a few hours after the accident, but should not consider that accelerated the complaint—there was no <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I saw him twelve hours after the accident—if concussion of a serious character had followed it must have subsided before I saw it—I feared very much for hit life, and was surprised at his going on so well as he did—it was a serious and alarming wound.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">baker, Gray's Inn-lane.</hi> On Saturday, the 6th of Jan., I was in a chaise with the deceased—he was driving himself, and just by Judd-place, in the New-road, at half past two o'clock in the day, I saw one of Mountain's omnibuses, driven by the prisoner—there were two omnibuses going at the rate of nine or ten miles an hour, coming the same road, and the company's <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>, wanting to pass the other, which the prisoner drove—they were very close together—we were in conversation about something very particular, and Hatton was driving at not more than five miles an hour—the prisoner's <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> came in contact with our chaise, lifted it up, and pushed Mr. Hatton, who was driving on the off-side, off his seat—his hat fell off—when the <hi rend="italic">buss</hi> left go of the chaise, Mr. Hatton pitched out on his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did the omnibus come in collision with the gig? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the near<lb></lb>side of the road, it struck the off wheel of the chaise, and lifted the gig up—I should say the road is thirty-five or forty feet wide—there was a great deal more than space enough to pass the gig on the proper side—the gig was on its proper side—I think it was caused by the company's omnibus coming behind the prisoner's—when the omnibus had got hold of the gig, the other omnibus passed by on the other side of the omnibus, there was plenty of room for all three—the gig was within four feet of the curb—the gig was about six feet from wheel to wheel—Mr. Hatton was perfectly sober for anything I know—I had been in his company about a quarter of an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he smell very much of liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He smelt of spirits, decidedly—he was taken to Bid borough-street—I called there about twenty minutes after, and saw him with a glass before him, which, from the colour, I fancy was rum—I interdicted him from drinking it—I understand he went to Hendon in a jolting chaise, which was the most injurious thing that could be done—he swore at me very much after his wounds were dressed, and called me a b—y doctor—if that had been while dressing his wounds, I</p>

               <p>should have thought it was from pain, but as it was after, I thought it was liquor—excitement might come on, but not so soon after the accident—he did not manifest any excitement while being dressed—the accident might reduce excitement if he was intoxicated before—it might be the effect of the injury he received.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, at Thornhill-wharf, Pentonville. On the 6th of Jan. I was at King' s-cross, and saw two omnibuses going at the rate of about nine miles an hour, within three or four yards of each other, I think, but I could not plainly see the Association one which was behind—they were coming towards me—I saw the Great Western omnibus, in at<lb></lb>tempting to pass the chaise, catch the near hind-wheel, and throw the chaise half over, and when it came down again it pitched the deceased out on his head—there was no difficulty in passing—the road is fifty or sixty feet wide—the chaise was three or four feet from the curb, and going at the rate of four or five miles an hour—I think with ordinary care the accident might have been avoided—the prisoner did not stop—I ran after him, seeing Mr. Hatton was bleeding from the head—I said to him, or the conductor, "You had better stop, I think you have killed a man!"—I hallooed three or four times, both the conductor and the prisoner were turning their heads—a gentleman inside put his hand out, and insisted on their stopping.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long was the gig in your sight before this hap<lb></lb>pened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not more than two or three minutes—it was the hind-wheel of the omnibus that struck the chaise—it caught the tires of the wheel—it was sixty or seventy yards from the Cross—the omnibus stopped parallel with the Cross—I have seen the Great Western omnibuses before—I think they are more carefully driven than other omnibuses—the practice of the other pro<lb></lb>prietors is to put one omnibus before, and another behind, to hunt them.</p>

I was in this omnibus—I entered it near Harley-street—it went at a fair pace to the corner of Tottenham Court-road—we started from there at a rapid pace, and I observed another omnibus running at the side of us—both drove at what I considered a fair pace till we arrived at Euston-square—they stopped at the side of the square, as if to rest for a moment, then drove at a very fast rate indeed, till they arrived at the spot where this accident happened—I was in such a state of alarm, that I took out my pencil and entered the number of the om<lb></lb>nibus I was in, and the one that was racing against us—I put my pocket-book back, and in two minutes this occurred—I saw somebody thrown out of a chaise—v sat facing the window next to where it occurred—there were not many passengers, but they were all shook, or raised off the seat, by the con<lb></lb>cussion—I immediately called to the conductor to stop—he took no notice—v called a second time more peremptorily—he then called to the driver, who stopped—a man ran up and told him to stop.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you could see all this, the driver could see it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very likely—he was nearer than I was—he had as good an opportunity or better of noticing the embarrassment of the driver, but neither me or any man ia England, at the time the chaise wheel was turned round, could pull the horses up in time to save the concussion—the prisoner hallooed to him before he pulled the wrong rein—I should say the gig was five or six feet from the curb—there was plenty of time for the gig to pass on the near side of the cart—there might be two or three carriages' width between the omnibus and the other side, but he could not get to that side of the road because two omni<lb></lb>buses were coming in an opposite direction to meet him—I have been in the habit of driving for years, and have horses of my own.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, who keeps the Load of Hay pob<lb></lb>lic-house, in Praed-street, Paddington. I was outside Gilbert's omnibus—before it came to King's-cross it was going at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour—it was not racing with any other omnibus—I observed two gentlemen in a chaise at King's-cross going in the same direction—just as the omnibus got near the chaise the driver pulled the right hand rein and pulled the chaise right across the omnibus, and when the omnibus man saw that he was very near to him he hallooed to the man to tell him where he was going—I did not then see the deceased do anything—the prisoner pulled his horses to get away from the chaise, and in so doing the back wheel of the omnibus I think caught the wheel of the chaise—he could not possibly have avoided the accident, the man pulled so suddenly before him—he did try to prevent it, but could not—he could not have checked his horses mure than he did.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Arlington-street, and am foreman to Mrs. Bull, an omnibus proprietor at Paddington—I was driving a cart in the New-road, behind the deceased's chaise—the omnibus was at the side of me, going at about seven miles an hour—I saw the horses' heads get abreast of the chaise—the deceased on that pulled the reins so as to bring the horse's head to the near side, towards the curb—the omnibus wheel instantly caught the chaise and threw the gentleman out—I saw no racing of the omnibuses—there</p>

               <p>were several things passing at the time, some going to Paddington, and one or two omnibuses coming from the City going in an opposite direction, very close to the spot—I should say that prevented Gilbert from going more to the right, away from the chaise—if the horse's head had not been pulled on one side and thrown the wheel out, he would have got by—I saw he was frightened by his pulling the rein, he nearly stopped—if he had kept straight on nothing would have happened—he had passed me in the same direction—had he hit the horse at the same time he pulled the rein he might have got out of the way—the wood pavement is very greasy there, it is just laid down.</p>

               <p>JOHN BROUGHTON. I went into a booth in the fair, at <placeName id="t18160710-60-crimeloc315">Tothill Fields</placeName>

The prisoner came in after I was there; he caught hold with my ribbon in my medal, and called me a b-r of a guardsman, and asked who authorised me to wear a medal. I told him, persons who knew my deserts, and who had a better right to do so, than he had to call me such a name. Almost directly I discoverd that the medal was gone from the ribbon, I told him to give it me; and he said, he'd be dam'd if he did. It could be only a good whipping, and that he had hait many a time, and did not care for. I offered him five shillings to give me the medal back. He said, very well; give me five shillings, and I'll give it you; but I knew better than that. Then I told him I would give him five shillings if he would come into the next booth; but he would not; so I went and sat down. I told him that I durst not go home without it. He then went out, and came back again, and asked if there was no other reward for it; and I told him there was not, a constable was sent for at this time.</p>

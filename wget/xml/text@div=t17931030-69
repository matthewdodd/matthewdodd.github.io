               <p>Q. When you went there who did you see? - A tall man dressed in black, who opened the door and desired me to walk into the counting house. I took the bill of one hundred and twenty pounds out of my case, I gave it to the man that let me in; immediately a green cloth was thrown over my head and I was thrown on the ground; they took my book from me; there was a person behind the curtain, I did not see that person, I heard his voice; they took the book from my hand, and threatened if I made any resistance they would cut my throat; they put an handkerchief or something in my mouth to prevent my making a noise; the person that opened the door says to the other, where is Jack? he replied he was waiting in the passage; he said, why did he not come in? I heard the door open, they then lifted me up, and took me down into a back kitchen with this over my head, and put me by the side of the copper, and chained my hands and feet to the copper with a padlock which they locked; they then said there was plenty of grub if I made no noise, but if I made the least noise they would come down and murder me, they then left me; I remained in that situation for a length of time; by shoving my shoes off and putting my feet closer together, I extricated myself from one chain which confined my feet to the copper; I went into a small room, my hands were still confined, the chain that confined my hands was not fastened to the copper; I went into an adjoining room, lifted up the sash and made a noise, and somebody came at length and relieved me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to Hatton-garden? - A little after ten, as near as I can tell, in the morning on the 21st of September.</p>
               <p>Q. At what hour was it you so extricated yourself? - A little before four in the same afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Now can you tell what was in your pocket book when they took it away? - Some bills I cannot recollect; there was a bill for sixty-two pounds two shillings upon

I told him to bring a chamber pot; and he took it and he turned himself towards the fire place, and there pretended to make water, at that time I did hear something rustle, I thought it was his linen, afterwards, he had another glass of wine, after that Jealous, Townsend, and some other officers came in, then I began to search him, I then searched him and found two blank checks, which corresponded to that one found filled up by himself; on his going out it occured to me that I verily believed I had not done all that might be done; on some suggestion of mine Carpmeal went back.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had Jones got from the room? - Just got out; Townsend, I, and Macmanus, went with him in a coach to Peckham-rye-lane.</p>

After this robbery I went to the house; there was an express sent down to me directly, I came to town; in the house I found what I have got here, I found these cords; this board and cords, so that putting this rope through the ceiling this board went up to the joists, and kept them up, or thereby the cords might be raised higher or lower.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it go through more ceilings? - No, only through one; here appears to be the handle of a new auger; they are new two-penny cords; there were several round staples; and at the end of the cord there was a wire with a slip noose, so as to be able to put it about the neck immediately. These things were put in after I let the house to Mr. Bradshaw.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Blasson, the subject of your examination was confined to this, who took the house for Bradshaw? it was not with respect to whether he had spoke about the house before, you was not spoke to about that? - I was not. I was not asked the question; in short he was not the person that took it for Bradshaw; that was all I said there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Campbell. You told us you could not give the exact particulars of the bills on Stimson? - I know no more than they were five bills.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Turnbull. Can you state what the amount of the bills were? - I saw them entered in the book; I did not see them delivered; I have got that book here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Crabb. Were those the sort of cords that were bought at your house? - These were not bought at my house, they are about a yard longer, than the cords that I sell, and a better colour.</p>

A number of circumstances have been stated, both by Mr. Garrow and others, as to my situation in life; as when he asked Mr. Wimbold questions, which were totally improper against my character. I hope the Jury will consider that they are to try me from the evidence of the witnesses that have appeared this day, and that they will judge accordingly: and I hope that they will consider, that however heinous a crime is, except a man is proved guilty, he is not to be convicted of it, for the more heinous the crime is, the less chance there is of mercy after he is convicted by your testimony. The indictment, states that I have feloniously assaulted

             Campbell instead of proving it, he proves that I did not take this property from him; that he does not know me, and tells you, gentlemen of the Jury, that he was robbed by some man that he saw there, and that I am not the man; that there was another person in company with this said person, whose voice he has heard; that they were about, after they robbed him for two hours, he of course swears positively that it was not my voice. At the time of my examination, Mr. Addington he did it, no doubt, for the sake of public justice; I have no right to suppose any thing else, he asked me simply this, did you or did you not commit a robbery in Hatton-garden? I must needs own the question was a very extroadinary one; I made a reply and said, certainly not; and spoke as any man in my circumstances would, agitated and flurried. Then the magistrate says to Mr. Campbell, Now, Mr. Campbell, at the time that you was robbed, no doubt, if by Mr. Jones, his voice must have been flurried; his voice on the present occasion is also flurried; do you recollect the voice? he then swore it was not the person to appearance, nor was the voice any thing like the voice of the party who robbed him. I therefore take it for granted that the gentleman of the jury will consider it such, that instead of the witness Campbell proving any thing against me, he convinces you of my innocence of this most horrid of crimes that is now laid to my charge.</p>
               <p>The next witness is Mr. Henderson, who, when up at Bow-street, stood next to me, after stating that Bills had been presented for payment, for some sixty pounds, he was desired to look round and point out the person; he looked at me and my unfortunate brother, there were a number of other persons in the room, he positively declared, in the presence of Mr. Knowlys, that I was not the person. Mr. Addington pointed me out to him, he then says, that he cannot be positive that he did not take notice of the man, but he verily believed that the man that called on him was of a very different complexion, but, says he, our servant maid, a young woman that is present, she took a good deal of notice of him, she is below stairs, I should wish you would call for her. This was the evidence that was given by Mr. Henderson, in the presence of Mr. Knowlys.</p>

This was in the presence of Mr. Knowlys. She came forward on the 9th of October at Bow-street, at that very instant she says, that Mr. Jones came to our house with bills for payment. Now it is very extraordinary if she had not been tampered with, how she would know me from any person present, when she had said on the 2d of October that I was not the man; and you have heard to day that what I have stated with respect to her testimony is true.</p>
               <p>The next witness is Mr. Blasson; it seems he is the landlord of a house, No. 13, Hatton-garden; he proves that he has let his house to some person, and he proves that he did not let this house to me; it seems that very person is to be supposed the person that committed this robbery, or concerned in it; but he does not seem to state that I am the person; he does state that two persons prior to this had applied to him to rent the house; I declare I never have applied for the house, though I believe it would be no crime, nor would be counted such, except in my present situation, but at the same time I must declare that the first time I ever saw Mr. Blasson was at Bow-street; Mr. Blasson says that he did not chuse to let me the house. I humbly conceive in my former situations, prior to my misfortune in attending this bar, my appearance nor address was so despicable as not to have asked me what are you? and who are you? before, on such an occasion, I should have a denial. I verily believe that it is a very extraordinary circumstance, instantly to object to me as a tenant without ever enquiring into my character, good, bad, or indifferent. I repeat the declaration, I never saw him till I saw him at Bow-street, Gentlemen of the jury, this is the whole of the evidence produced by the prosecutors, in which I believe there are not grounds sufficient to convict a man of a common misdemeanor, much less of a capital crime which takes his life. I hope you will divest yourselves of every prejudice that might have been produced in your minds from the reports that have proceeded out of doors, or from the public papers; I do not say that these reports are to weigh in my favour, but that you ought to divest your minds of every impression that might be made previous to what you have now heard, and that you will judge mercifully this very day as you expect to find mercy yourselves.</p>
               <p>I shall now prove to you gentlemen, from respectable witnesses, that I am an innocent man. I should leave my cause as it now stands was it not for my future situation in life; I wish to be honourably acquited, and convince you and the world, that I could not possibly commit such a crime; and if ever I could for a moment harbour the idea of committing such an attrocious deed may God deprive me of life. I hope, gentlemen, you will make some allowance for my present situation, for I must beg you will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Hart. Is it about a year and a half ago that I lived in Houndsditch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wood to Job Moore. What was the date you gave to that transaction you spoke about? - The 28th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that there were a pair of Bracelets sold. Do you know the person to whom they were sold? - I heard the name mentioned of Grey.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect where it took place? - At the Bank Coffee house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the nature of the Sale? and what was paid? - He sold the bracelets for one hundred and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was paid at that time? - It was paid at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the number of these notes? - I cannot positively swear to them, but to the best of my knowledge there was one of them 2,271, and another 9,670.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen these notes since? - No, never; nor before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you the memorandum you made of the transaction? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many tens were there? - There were four.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite certain as to the amount of the draft? was it thirty-seven pounds four shillings, or thirty-four pounds seven shillings? - It was thirty-four pounds seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. This person was a stranger as well to Jones as to you? - I don't know, he might be or not to Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know when this note was drawn? - I think it was drawn the 13th of September, to such a one and bearer. I think it had no time to run, it was due when it was first drawn I presume.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be quite certain of that? - To the best of my recollection it was; I remember there was on it, London and Middlesex bank; that was the reason I recollect it, because I never saw one of that kind before.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you? - A plated buckle maker; I have lived in Birmingham for near fifty years.</p>
               <p>Q. And have bill transactions occasionally yourself? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. This happened on the 28th of September. You know the difference between a bill payable at sight, and one that is a week over due? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300104"></xptr>Q. You, as a man of business, would enquire what was the reason if a week was over due, whether the man on whom it was drawn had any assets or no. Did not you suggest that to Mr. Jones to enquire that before he took the bill? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is a pretty lot of bank notes, two, four, six, and seven bank notes. Did any body make amount of the number of them at the time? - They were casting up the amount; I cannot say whether they made any amount of it, Mr. Jones was looking them over and casting them up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there when they began to treat for these bracelets? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was called in to know the value of them? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Grey give what Mr. Jones asked? - No, at last there was ten pounds difference.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the number of those two you mentioned? - 2,271, and 6,970 to the best of my knowledge, and not 9,670.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath did not you repeat to this gentleman several times over 9,670?</p>

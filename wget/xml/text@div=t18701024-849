                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the Great Eastern Railway Company's Police—I hate been seventeen years in the police altogether—I am better known on the main line than on the Blackwall line—Treadgold was one of the Company's servants, employed as a ticket collector at Fenchurch Street—it would be his duty to collect the tickets at the exit barrier of the Blackwall line—he was not entitled to pass any persons without a ticket or the production of a season ticket—about the middle of July last, my attention was called to matters that were going on upon the line, connected with these tickets, and I gave instructions to Melhuish, and subsequently to Carter and Richardson—I received communications from them daily when they were employed—I also went down the line myself; Saturday, 16th July, was the first day—I went to Stepney that day, and followed Parsonage from his house in York Street, Stepney, to the Stepney Station—he did not take a ticket—he did not go up to the booking office at all, not within two yards—he passed up the staircase on to the platform, on the up-side, got into the train and went to London, Melhuish with him—he had to pass a barrier to get up to the platform at Stepney—he passed that barrier without a ticket—Rutterford was the man employed there, he passed him and got into the train—at Feuchurch Street he alighted from the train, and passed out of the barrier where Treadgold was—there is a double barrier, with a man at each side: he passed on Treadgold's side, with his hand in his pocket, never giving up a ticket; there was a little motion with the head, nodding to Treadgold, and he passed on—I am certain that he did not produce any ticket, or even take his hands from his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187010240071"></xptr>
               <p>pockets; I was within a yard-and-a-half of him, he was the last passenger that passed out; I watched him very narrowly, my attention had been called to him personally; having, passed through the barrier, he passed out of the station in the ordinary way—on Monday, 18th July, I again followed Parsonage from his house at Stepney, he passed through the Stepney Station—he took no ticket, and passed the barrier where Rutterford was, without one—when he got to the barrier at Fenchurch Street, Treadgold was th'ere; he passed on Treadgold's side—he did not give up any ticket—he never took his hands from his jacket pocket—he had a short jacket on—I am quite certain he did not produce any ticket on that occcasion; they nodded to each other in the same way as they did on the Saturday, and then he passed out—shortly after I saw Melhuish and Parson<lb></lb>age talking in the station yard, Melhuish had come up with Parsonage from Stepney—Melhuish took a ticket at Stepney, and gave it up to Treadgold—Melhuish and Parsonage remained in conversation in the station yard, I walked some little distance away as I did not want Parsonage to see me, and shortly after Treadgold came down the staircase from where he was collecting the tickets and joined them, that was two or three minutes after I had seen Parsonage pass the barrier—they then went into Austin's public-house, which is directly opposite the door-way where they came out—they were in there seven or eight minutes; they came out together, and had a little conversation—Parsonage and Melhuish walked away, and Treadgold went up the staircase—about three or four minutes afterwards Melhuish joined me in Fenchurch Street, and made a communication to me—those are the only two occasions upon which I have personally been through the barrier after Parsonage, when Treadgold has been there—I saw Melhuish every time he went up and down the line, and on each occasion, directly he had finished his journey, he made a communication to me, and handed tickets to me which he and I endorsed—this first-class ticket, dated 6th August, No. 6040, from Fenchurch Street to Shadwell, I got from Melhuish on that day—I went to the Fenchurch Street Station with him, and within a quarter-of-an-hour afterwards I met him at another point, and he gave me this ticket—this ticket would not carry to Blackwall, not further than Shadwell—I was present at the trial last Sessions—I heard the prisoner give evidence.</p>

               <p>others were at first charged with felony—I told all of them, on 17th August, that they would be charged; I told Treadgold and Rutterford so—they were not charged before the Lord Mayor, but proceedings were going on, opinions were taken—no proceedings were taken against them until after the trial of Parsonage; it was an understood thing that they would be prosecuted—the other five were taken into custody, and charged with feloniously stealing tickets—I did not know that these men had committed a felony; we only had one case against them, against the others there were many—I think it was the day after I took the Averys into custody that I told Treadgold he would be charged—that would be on the 16th—no one told me to take him, I did it upon my own responsibility—the Company acted against my advice; I can't be answerable for the directors—I did not take the prisoner into custody on 17th, because I had not received direction! from the Company—I had not received directions to take the other five—I don't want directions to take a man for felony; the case against them was very different—I knew that they were also charged at the Mansion House with conspiracy to defraud the Company—I knew that this man was guilty of that—I did not take him into custody then because I had not a warrant—I applied for one when I was instructed to do so—I don't know the date—I have the warrant in my pocket—it was since the last trial—I say that Treadgold violated his duty on 16th and 18th July, at the exit barrier of the Blackwall line, in passing Parsonage without a ticket—Parsonage was the only one passing at that time—he took the precaution to wait till all the passengers had gone off the platform—there are not a number of persons coming there to meet friends who go by train; they cannot get up on the departure side—this was on the departure side—I am quite positive that the prisoner passed Parsonage without a ticket—he did not take bis hands from his pockets.</p>

               <p>other tickets, and I gave information to the police—I afterwards associated with them for the purpose of detecting this fraud, and seeing the extent of it—I have seen him take three or four persons down by the same train, without taking a legitimate ticket, and I have seen twenty-seven persons pass in one night without taking a legitimate ticket—Parsonage knew I was a solicitor's clerk; be knew roe eighteen months, through my friends—I don't suppose be thought I should betray him—I took notes, and gave them to Mr. Russell immediately I left the train—he met me by appointment every night—I am sure I heard Treadgold say to Parsonage "There is a b—detective after us"—I was close beside him—I could not mistake a man I like that, when I have seen him repeatedly; I have been travelling the line I two years.</p>

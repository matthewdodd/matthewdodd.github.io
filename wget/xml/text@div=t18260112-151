On the 12th of December I was putting a mat down at my parlour door, and saw the prisoner come to the window and take a piece of mutton from the shop-board, and put it under her shawl. I arose up, and she walked into the shop, and asked if I had any beef-steaks. I said, "Where is the bit of mutton you took from the board;" I lifted up her shawl and saw it - she said it was not mine, she had bought it in Clare-market - I sent for the officer; she then said, "I beg your pardon, and I will pay you what you please."</p>

I was passing this window, and saw some bits of beef, which I thought would be better to buy for my children than tea, and next day I went in the shop and asked if she had any bits of beef - she said Yes; she then saw the mutton, and then said, "You have got meat enough, what do you want with more." I told her what I have told you now - she said, "This is our meat," and her daughter said, "Yes, it is."</p>

I am the manager of the Upper Assam Tea Company, at 69, King William Street—we have a carman named Davis in our employ—on 21st July, about 4.45, a man came in and asked if there was anything for Davis—he went out and came in again about five minutes afterwards' and said, "Are the things ready for Davis?"—I said, "Yes,"—a van was then standing outside—there was nothing in it—the prisoner was in the van—the man took out the parcels—when he had taken out the fire parcel I went to look at the van—I did not see the name of Davis on the van, and I called Mr. Cook's attention to it—there was the name of "J. Howse, carman," on it, in gilt letters on a red ground—the man who took the parcels away signed this receipt for them in the name of Smith—the goods were worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I was manager of the Upper Assam Tea Company at the time in question—I have since left the employment—on 21st July, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, Monk drew my attention to the man driving up for these parcels—I went out to examine the van and the man—I examined the van and horse very carefully and took down the name, and copied it in a book, "J. Howse, carman"—it was written on a red ground in yellow letters—the horse was a very peculiar one—it had a white face—the prisoner is the man I saw in the van—I noticed him specially, and am quite confident he is the man—I saw the van drive away, it turned round towards King William's statue, the road was blocked up, and he stood up for a minute or two in the van—I saw him again next day in Old 'Change—I was with Hawkes the detective—I said then I would not swear to him because he was differently dressed—he had not a coat on, his sleeves were tucked up and his waistcoat unbuttoned, and he had a different appearance—I said I should like to see him with his coat on before I could swear to him—I did see him with his coat on at the Mansion House, and I was then convinced he was the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective.</hi>) On 22nd July last I saw the prisoner in Old 'Change—I asked him if his name was Howse, and if he was a car<lb></lb>man, he said, "Yes"—I pointed to a van and asked if it belonged to him, he said it did—I asked him if he had any other van besides that, he said, "No"—I then asked him if he had gone to 69, King William Street, to the Upper Assam Tea Company's Offices to receive any parcels of tea the night previous, about 5 o'clock, he said, "No"—I said, "This van was seen standing there"—he said, "That can't be so, for I had charge of the van, and took five parcels of goods from Messrs. Morgan's to the Docks"—Mr. Cook, who was present, said it was the horse and van he had seen the night before at 5 o'clock—the prisoner then said, the van was in his stables at 5, Sidney Street, Mile End, at 5 o'clock—I asked if he had any objection to my going to Morgan's respecting the statement he had made—he said, no he wished me to do so—I went there and saw the warehouseman, Wills—the prisoner said he had started from Cannon Street with the packages at 3.30, and had taken one package to the London Docks, and four to the East India Docks</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200005"></xptr>
               <p>—I reminded him that half-an-hour was a short time to go to both those places, and he said, "I took one to the London Books, and went part of the way to the East India Docks, but found it was too late; finding I was late, I brought them back and left them in my stable to take the following morn<lb></lb>ing"—I asked the prisoner's carman whether he had been employed by his master to take any goods to the London Docks the day before, from Morgan's—he hesitated for a moment, and he said, "To tell you the truth I did; five cases were brought out of Morgan's, they were placed in the cart, I took one to the London Docks, and the others I took home to the stables"—I stated that to the prisoner, and he said, "You can believe me or not, I have told you the truth—I asked the prisoner what time be got home with his van, he said, "Shortly after 5 o'clock"—I asked him if he had let the van to anybody else for any purpose—he said, "No, I was out with the van myself in the morning, and never left the charge of it till I got home to the stables at night, and you can inquire at my place and you will find that is true"—he said he was quite willing to assist me in any way, and I went to his residence in Henry Street, Mile End, and saw his wife—the prisoner was taken to Bishopsgate Police Station—I afterwards saw him there and asked him if he had anything further to say to me—he said, "I may as well tell you the truth, my man took one case to the docks, and I lent the van to a man named Swabey, who applied for it in the afternoon, stating that he wanted it to fetch two pads of mackerel, which he could get a crown out of"—the prisoner then said to his man, who was present, "Did not I meet you at 4.30 in Throgmorton Street, at the Gladstone Wine Company"—the man said, "Yes, you did, you were there some short time, and sent me to St. John's Wood"—the carman said be left the van in Cannon Street, at 3.30 when he received the five cases, and he returned at 4.30, and he then saw his employer, and the van was then empty; he saw no more of the van after that till he saw it in the stables, after he had got back from St. John's Wood, at 8 o'clock.</p>

I happened to call upon Mr. Aires coming accidentally that way (he is a customer of mine) to see if he wanted any thing in my way; he said he had a hundred weight last night, and shewed me the bill of parcels. I went home and inquired of my foreman, and found the prisoner had no order from him to deliver any thing out. I was willing to try him from the Thursday morning to the Monday morning following, and put it in his way to make acknowledgement of it. I asked him if he had called at Mr. Aires's as he had been that way; he said he did call, but was told that he should not want any thing for ten days. Then I took him before my lord mayor, where he confessed he did take the glew, and was willing to pay for it; he also there owned he had no order for carrying it away.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did I not make bills of parcels when my master was at Sturbridge fair?</p>
               <p>Turvile. As to that I have oftentimes given him bills of parcels to carry, &amp;c. but never knew him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175206250018"></xptr> guilty of such a thing before. I don't allow my foreman to deliver out any thing without an order: whenever any of my servants receive an order abroad it is brought and set down in the day book, and from that a bill of parcels is made and delivered to them that carry it out.</p>

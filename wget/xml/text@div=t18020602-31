             sworn. - I am a watchman in St. Catherine's parish, Tower-hill: On the 18th of April, after I had cried the hour of eleven o'clock, I heard a voice cry out murder, watch! murder, watch! I immediately went towards the place, again, and heard the same words repeated with a shrill voice; I went round the corner and caught the prisoner and this old gentleman down flat upon his back, across the kennel; when I saw that, I took hold of the prisoner's collar and hauled him away; as soon as the old gentleman found I had got hold of him, he said, watchman, I give you charge of that man, for he had knocked me down three times, and robbed me; the prisoner immediately said, watchman, he is my comrade; he is very drunk, and I want to get him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that in pretty good English? - A. Yes; then another watchman came up, and I desired him to list the old gentleman up, for he could not get up himself; we took them both to the watch-house, and delivered them up to the officer of the night, who searched the prisoner, and found upon him, in my presence, fourteen pence halfpenny; the officer of the night desired me to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180206020014"></xptr>and see if I could find any thing near the spot; I went, and found two single halfpence, one lying in one place, and the other in another; I dare say it was half past eleven o'clock before I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to you at all to be drunk? - A. He appeared to be very much frightened; but when we got him to the watch-house, he was very steady; indeed he did not appear to be at all in liquor.</p>
               <p>

            (To Wright.) The prisoner says you were his comrade; had you ever seen him before? - A. I declare to God I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Your duty is not on the river, is it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him on board of any ship in the river? -

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. All this man says is false; he was very sick, and vomited; he fell down, and I was helping him up when he desired the watchman to take me up. <rs id="t18020602-31-verdict175" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist. At half-past five o'clock on the 14th of Oct., the prisoners came for a cigar—Keith put down a sovereign, and asked for change—I asked if they had got any change—they both said they had not—I took out my purse, put down a half-sovereign, two half-crowns, four, shillings, two fourpenny-pieces, and took two penny-pieces out of the till—I tried the sovereign; it was a good one, and heavy, a George and dragon one—I got a piece of paper, lit it, and handed it to Wheeler; and while he lighted his cigar, I took up the sovereign, and found it was a counterfeit, and very light—I went round, and accused them of making a mistake—they said, how dare I charge them?—I called my young woman, and she said it was a bad one—I desired her to fetch a policeman—I shot the door—Keith seized my hand and my throat—Wheeler said to him, "Give her the good one, or give me the change"—I heard a something rattling in Keith's mouth—I then found my breath nearly gone, and screamed "Mur<lb></lb>der"—I threw the counterfeit sovereign from me, and it was picked up, and found where I threw it—this is it—I marked it at the station.</p>

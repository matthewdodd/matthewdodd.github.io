                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Burr, of Park-street, in the parish of St. Saviour's, Southwark. I know the prisoner by his coming to my house three or four times before 8<hi rend="italic">rd</hi> June, with another man—the bar-parlour is behind the bar—there is a cupboard in the bar-parlour where the money was always kept in a cash-box, and the silver was loose in a bag—the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185108180014"></xptr>
               <p>and his friend always asked for a private room—the bar-parlour is a private room—on the Friday before 3rd June, the prisoner asked me for change for half-a-sovereign, and I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change from the box in the cupboard—they saw where I got it from—the cupboard was locked, and I put the key into my pocket again—the cash-box was locked—on 3rd June the prisoner and his companion came in a little after 3 o'clock—I was in the bar—they went through the bar into the bar-parlour—I had seen the money safe about half-past 2, when I changed a sovereign for Mr. Wright, and put it into the cash-box—no one went into the bar-parlour between half-past 2, and the time of the prisoner coming in but my husband and myself, and a little child—my brother was not there that day at all—the prisoner and his friend called for a glass of ale, and a glass of half and half—they remained better than an hour—every time I went into the room the prisoner closed the door after me—his companion asked me if he could pass out of the private door into the passage, and I unlocked it, and showed them the way—they went out that way—they did not come through the bar—I went to the cup<lb></lb>board full two hours after they were gone, and the money was all gone—I had had the key in my possession all the time from half-past 2, till the money was gone—there was in the cash-box 73<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. mining share, and one promissory-note for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can<lb></lb>not tell what silver was in the bag—the cash-box was taken away too—the prisoner and his companion have never been to my house since—the officer fetched me to identify the prisoner at the Compter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am brother of Mrs. Burr. I sometimes assist in the business—I was not there on 3rd June—I was there on the Friday previous, the 30th May—I saw the prisoner and a person with him—the prisoner asked for a glass of half and half, and a glass of porter—I drew them, and he asked if the landlord was in—I said, "No; do you want him?"—he said, "No; not particularly, he generally allows me to go into the bar-par<lb></lb>lour"—I allowed them to go in, and I took the glass of porter, and the glass of half and half to them—the prisoner sat behind the door, and shut the door on one or two occasions.</p>

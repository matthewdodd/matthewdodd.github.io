I laid hold of him and clapped Mr Tracy on the Shoulder, and said This Villain has picked your Pocket; then the Prosecutor laid hold of him, and we brought him down the Steps into the Passage, in order to secure him; we were forced to carry him to the Piazzas, and there there was a Mob rose upon us, and we had like to have been murdered; as soon as we came to the Piazzas, he gave a Spring (he is a deadly strong Fellow) and threw my Hat and Wig off my Head, in struggling to get away; at the same Time he pulled out the Handkerchief and threw it away, with Design, as I suppose, that we should take the Handkerchief and let him go; then we got some Assistance, two Soldiers laid hold of him, and carried him into Mr Mitton's at the Shakespear's Head, when we had got him in there, we got some more Soldiers, and then we thought proper to send for a Constable, and he said if he took him into the Street, he would certainly be rescued from him. Mr. Rich said we should go through his House; this was agreed upon, but the Mob arose, and fell upon us with Stones, Brickbats, &amp;c. which they threw into the Shakespear's Head to such a Degree, that we expected to have been murdered; but Mr Rich was so good, as to let us, the Prisoner, and eight or ten Soldiers which came to our Assistance, into the Play-House, through his Ground, and there we were consined about an Hour, and durst not venture out all that Time, though we had the Soldiers with us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask him why he did not say before the Justice, that I took the Handkerchief out of the Gentleman's Pocket and threw it away.</p>

               <p>Mr Mitton . I live at the Shakespear's Head , joining to the Play-House, and as I was standing at my Door, I received a Blow over my Eye, with a Piece of a Glass Bottle; I went behind the Bar to get a little Rum to wash it with; as I was washing it, I saw there was a Disturbance at the Door; I stepped out and endeavoured to pull the Prisoner in, and some how or other he fell down; we put our Hands into his Pocket, and he had got a Parcel of broken Glass Bottles; You Villain, said I, you are the Rascal that cut my Eye just now, but he made no Answer to that. There were a Parcel of Fellows who broke so many of my Windows, as I paid 39s. 4d. for mending, and had like to have been murdered; there are such a Parcel of them that they will not let you stand at your Doors, if you do, you are in Danger of being murdered.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I told the Gentlemen that I had a Pint Bottle with some Gin in it, and that by Mischance, I fell down and broke it. I had no other Glass in my Pocket.</p>

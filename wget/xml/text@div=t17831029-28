             sworn.</p>
               <p>Did the last witness marry your daughter? - Yes, I had forty-five guineas in a japan box, which I saw the morning before the peace was proclaimed, I counted it on the evening of the same day a little while after my returning home, my son-in-law asked me for the keys to go to the drawers, the keys I had all the day, in my pocket, I gave them to him, he was called out by some person, and I believe he left the keys in the drawer, for I received them from my own child, he returned sometime after, I was in the parlour when he went out, and the same time this girl was in the bed-chamber making the bed, on the Wednesday morning I missed twenty guineas; upon missing it, I talked this girl as nobody had access there but her, she made some hesitation, and after some time, she said, she had not got my money; the landlady came and another lady, they said to the prisoner, Honnor, you have surely got your mistress's money, for Heaven's sake, say if you have, for she has left all in America but this little moiety; which she has left to live upon; you know she has been a good mistress to you; the girl was silent, this other lady said, that is not the way, let them have the room to themselves, perhaps she will return her mistress the money; they all retreated, and I sat down, and I told the girl to sit down; Honnor says I, consider with yourself before I take the steps which I shall, I will surely prosecute you.</p>
               <p>Court. You told her if she would confess yon would spare her? - I told her if she would confess, I would shew her as much lenity as I could, I might have said that, but I was unacquainted with the laws of the country, she upon that said, well mistress, and burst into tears, I took your money.</p>
               <p>Court. By the rules of the law I cannot examine you further as to what she said, because you gave her an expectation of favor if she discovered; therefore the law does not suffer it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Were not these the words, Honnor, if you know any thing of the money tell me, and if you have laid out eight guineas, give me the remainder, and nothing shall be done whatsoever? - I told her that if she would return me five guineas of the money, either in money or goods, I would pay her as much respect as the laws of the land would suffer me to do.</p>
               <p>Did not she tell you that twelve guineas was all the money she had taken? - Surely she did, she was known to make a purchase of a gown and two pettycoats, and a pair of stays, I had paid her no wages, for she said she was not necessitated, she came to me on the Sabbath morning, she had been with me not quite a month.</p>
               <p>Had you a good character with her? - Not so very good.</p>
               <p>How came you take her then? - When she first came to me, she passed under another name, there was a piece of deceit carried on, I was a stranger, and easily imposed on.</p>
               <p>Where is your husband? - He is at home, he came in another vessel, I came later than he, he took no account of the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>

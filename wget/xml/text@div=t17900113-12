               <p>I was at home at the time of this robbery; it was Friday, the 18th of December; I suspected the prisoner; she and her husband worked for me; I searched her apron; her work was in it; she had been waiting in the shop for work; I gave part of her work to her, and went into the cellar to fetch up the remainder; and when I returned, suspecting she had robbed me, I searched her; and at the bottom of her apron, was concealed a pair of woman's stuff shoes; they were finished shoes: some time elapsed before the constable came, whom I sent for; and I found another pair upon her, tucked in between her apron string and her waist, under her cloak; that was a pair of woman's stuff slippers; (produced and deposed to); the initials of my name is in the slippers; and I know the shoes by the make and work; she said, the first pair she took up accidentally with her work; when I found the two pair, she begged for mercy, and said it was the first offence.</p>

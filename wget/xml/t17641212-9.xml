            . I am a washerwoman, and live at Lambeth: on Monday, the 3d of December, I brought a bundle of linen in a basket to the end of Billiter Lane, in Fenchurch-street: I left my bundle, as I have done several times, at a cobler's stall, while I went to carry some things to a house; at coming back, I missed out of the basket a bundle, which contained the things mentioned in the indictment, some the property of Mr. Grant, and some of Mr. Edwards (mentioning them particularly). I got them advertised in the next day's paper; and on that day

             were with me: I saw the two prisoners on Little Tower-Hill; Ellis had the bundle; I went up to him, and took hold of the bundle, and took them to the Coach and Horses; there I opened the bundle, it contained the things mentioned in the indictment, with a bill in it, on which was Mr. Edwards's name, by which means I found Mr. Edwards, who sent me over the water to the washerwoman; there were two handkerchiefs, tied one over the other, round the bundle; one prisoner owned to one, and the other to the other; when I took them, Bond said they were all his shirts.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Ringrose. All the separate bundles were tied over with a cord: the man that fits in the bulk used to look after my things, when I was absent, but he was gone out with a pair of shoes.</p>

               <p>I had been to the India-House, and going back, I met with Ellis; he asked me to lend him my handkerchief to tie round the bundle: and I lent it him.</p>

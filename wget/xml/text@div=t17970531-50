               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Who read this over to him? - A. It is some time ago; but Hale read it over to him in my presence, he was an attorney, and a prisoner at that time in Newgate, but since that he has been struck off the roll; William Hale appears to be attorney to the prisoner; Thomas Hale was in prison, and in consequence of that, did not make use of his own name but

               <p>Q. Is Hale here? - A. I do not know.(Mr. Raine objected, that as Hale, who was not forthcoming, bad read it, the Court could not know that it was correctly read to the prisoner before he signed it; which was over-ruled by the Court).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. You were present when Hale read the affidavit? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the affidavit before? - A. No; it was manufactured in Newgate, he brought it out with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read the affidavit? - A. I did not read it over; I asked him if he was satisfied with what Hale had read.</p>

               <p>Q. Therefore, whether Hale read exactly what is contained in this affidavit or not, you cannot tell? - A. I remember clearly, that he explained particular parts of it to him.</p>

             sworn. - I am clerk to Mr. Wright, an attorney; Mr. Wright was the attorney concerned for the present prosecutor, Mr. Chapel; I have in my hand a copy of the record of the judgement of non-pros from the Treasury-office of the King's-Bench, it is an office copy,(produces it): I examined it in the office with the roll, it is a correct copy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Who examined this with you? - A. The clerk of the office; I examined them both ways. (Mr. Raine objected, that the bond in the judgement of non-pros being for 4000l. and the bond stated in the affidavit being only for 2000l. it could not apply to the same).</p>

I have known the prisoner about three years and a half; he lived with me on the 31st of March; this money was in a drawer behind the till, in a bag - it contained 5l. 10s., all in silver - but what coins I cannot say; I counted it just before I put it into the drawer; at half-past three o'clock, or a quarter to four, in the afternoon of the 31st of March, which was the last time I saw it; the prisoner was not in the house then, but came home in the evening, between six and seven, and about eleven I missed the money; the prisoner had been out - he had been at home from six to ten o'clock; I think he was at home when I missed my money - he was in a little parlour; I went into the parlour, my wife was there with him - I asked her, in his presence, if she had been to the till, and taken out the silver? she said, No; I said,"Then I am robbed;" my wife came out of the parlour into the shop; the prisoner said he was very sorry to hear it: he stopped about five minutes, and then went to bed; I went up that night to him in bed, and asked him if he had been and taken my money? he said No, and then said, "Why do you think I took it?" I said, "My suspicions are on you, Mr. Godwin;" he asked why I suspected him - I said, I considered he was the person, because there was nobody in the shop but him and my maid; he said he was innocent: after that my wife went up to him - I was not present; he dressed himself, and came down stairs; I then got the watchman to take him to the watch-house; he dressed himself of his own accord; he kept on saying he was innocent of it - he came back again; he was not searched at the watch-house; he stopped in the house a little while, and then I took him and the servant to the watch-house again; he kept denying it; I brought them both back, and then he went to bed - he got up about eight o'clock next morning; the officer came and saw him in the parlour; I saw the officer search him in the dining-room, and find 9s. 5 3/4d. in his pocket - then he took off his trousers and found three sovereigns in one pocket - I said my money was all in silver: he then said he had changed the silver he took from me into gold - we continued to search, and found 20s. in silver in one of his trousers pockets, and 21s. 6d. in the other; he said it was mine, and begged for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Before he said any thing about the money, had you not said it would be better for him to confess, and you would give him a sovereign into the bargain? A. I did; he could have concealed the money if he liked; he bore an honest, industrious character.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was it you said he had better confess? A. The evening that I missed the money; not a word was said to him in the morning.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for on the 1st of April, about eight o'clock in the morning, to the prosecutor's house, and found the prisoner there; I searched him, and found 9s. 5 3/4d. in his waistcoat pocket, three sovereigns in his right-hand breeches pocket, and 2l. in silver in his other pockets; I said I understood the money was all in silver; he then said, "Yes, it was so; pray forgive me, Mr. White, it was all your money; I have changed 3l. in silver for sovereigns:" no promise or inducement was held out to him in my presence - I found four shillings more on him than was lost.</p>

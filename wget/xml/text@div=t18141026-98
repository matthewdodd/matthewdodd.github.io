He set them at the counting-house door, where we usually take the money; he then went into the shed again, where he remained some time; during which, I examined the leaves of deal he had brought up, which were divided into two parcels; I took the money and attended the gentleman; I asked him, what number of leaves of deal he wanted; he stated the number to be the larger portion, taking no notice of the smaller he had put of one side; he said, he wanted as many as the larger parcel contained; the larger parcel contained five or six leaves; the smaller parcel was three leaves. I made the entry in the Cash-book. I cannot tell the exact price. I think it must be seven shillings. I gave him the opportunity; he took both parcels. I saw him take them both.</p>

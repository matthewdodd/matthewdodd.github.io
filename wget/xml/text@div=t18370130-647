                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 38.) I was on duty on the 21st of January, in the Acton-road, in Hanwell parish. I met tone wagoners, who complained that they had been ill used, and robbed of a scraper, and they wished us to go in search of the thieves—we went back to the Green Man, at Ealing—the wagoners there pointed out four persons as being concerned in the robbery; and one in particular, who bad the scraper with him—I took that man into custody, and was taking him towards Ealing to the station-house—I had seen this prisoner in the tap-room, he was not one of the parties accused—it was said he bad assaulted the wagoners, hut I did not take the prisoner into custody then—I took another man—when I was going along the prisoner struck me a violent blow on the left side, and the prisoner I had escaped at the time—I tell I suppose ten yards, and got up and took the prisoner and called my brother officer, Cook, to take him—I ran after the man who had ran away, but I could not find him—it was entirely through the prisoner striking me that the other man escaped—he sprained my thumb.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 45.) Holland has related correctly all that passed. I saw the prisoner knock him down, and in con-sequence of that the prisoner he had in custody escaped—I was leading this prisoner and he got from me and struck him—the man that escaped took the scraper from Holland's hand—the prisoner offered us half a gallon of ale if we would let him escape.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am one of the officers belonging to Lambeth-street, Whitechapel: In consequence of an information received on Thursday the 22d of June last, I went with my brother officers to No. 7, in <placeName id="t17970712-51-crimeloc279">Baillie's-place</placeName>

               <p>Q. In what state was the press? - A. In a proper state for working, it must have been then at work.</p>
               <p>

            Describe now what you found in the cellar? - A. By the side of the press we found these halfpence (producing a large quantity), just as they sell from the dies, unfit for circulation, they were not coloured; on the other side of the press, a vast quantity of blanks ready for seeding the dies; those which are struck, we tried with the dies, and they correspond exactly; I found two pair more of dies, in the same cellar where the stamping-press was, they are what is called the Irish-harp (produces them); I found a vast quantity of halfpence corresponding with them, in the rounsing-sack; produces another die for a halfpenny), this is a George the Second's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any finished halfpence? - A. Yes; there are a vast quantity of harps, Mr. Knowland will produce them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between you and the prisoners? - A. The three men, except Rimes and his wife, all acknowledged being there, and begged for mercy; they said we had caught them there, and hoped we would use them well; Mr. Rimes afterwards came in, and helped us to take the press to pieces; he said, I have been more used to it than you, I will help you to carry it up stairs, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any habitable part of the house besides? - A. The whole house was occupied by Mr. Rimes and his family.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the person of any of the prisoners? - A. I did one of them, but found nothing upon them.</p>
               <p>JOHN KNOWLAND sworn. - Examined by Mr. Cullen. I am another officer of the same office: On Thursday the 22d of June, I went, in company with the other officers, to No. 7, Baillie's-place, Aldgate; I went to the back door with Mr. Coomes, and the back door was opened for us by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179707120036"></xptr>the officers that went in in the front; I and Smith went into the back cellar, where we saw a candle lighted in the collar of the press; I looked round in the cellar, and saw Broome and Barrett standing close by the press, stripped in their shirt-sleeves, and both their hands black and greasy; I saw Smith in the other cellar concealed under the stairs, his hands were black; I asked Barrett what he was doing there, and he said, he was out of employ and was very glad to get any thing to do; I then searched his pocket, and found, some halfpence that correspond with all these dies. (Produces them)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time of the day was this? - A. About one o'clock? - A. I then secured him, and examined the press; the dyes in the press were quite warm. After we had secured all the prisoners, I went up stairs with Mr. Coomes, and in the one pair of stairs, there was a turn-up bed tead, I searched the bed, and I found these harp halfpence, which are unfit for circulation, they exactly correspond with the Irish-harp dyes; we found an edging-tool, which is to make the edges of the halfpence smooth; and a sieve in the one pair of stairs, which is for sifting the halfpence after they are taken out of the rounsing-sack, to clean the saw-dust from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is master of the house? - A. Mr. Rimes; I asked him, and he told me so himself; he said he had lived there four or five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the woman his wife do you know? - A. I do not know, she may be for ought I know. (Produces the sieve and the press).</p>
               <p>Q. From your knowledge of these things, are there a complete set of implements for coining, from the cutting out to the finishing state, fit for circulation? - A. There are.</p>
               <p>ROBERT COOMES sworn. - I am an officer: the first thing I found was the rounsing sack, in the cellar, fixed to the ceiling; we found these halfpence, (producing them), mixed with saw-dust in it as it is now, they correspond with the harp dies; after they were secured, I went up stairs and found this rounding tool fixed. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Elizabeth Rimes's defence. My hands were clean; I shewed the officers my hands, they were quite clean, I had been shelling peas, and they saw the pea shells lying about.</p>

               <p>The other prisoners did not say any thing in their defence.</p>

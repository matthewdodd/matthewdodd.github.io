                  </hi>. I carry on business in Chiswell-street—on Thurs<lb></lb>day, 12th June, at half-past 3 in the afternoon, I was in Moor-lane, felt something at my pocket, and saw a man, who I believe to be the prisoner, walking away—he was then about ten yards from me—I walked on a little way and missed my pocket-book from my coat; I turned back to the corner of Fore-street—a communication was made to me and I went into a public-house at the corner of Moor-lane and looked for the prisoner, but was surrounded by three or four young fellows who appeared to be associates of thieves—I was afraid of having my pocket picked again, and came away—this is my pocket-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are memorandums in it and postage-stamps.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Cuthbert, an oilman, of Oxford-street—on 12th June, I was at the back part of the shop and saw the prisoner on Mr. Abbott's, the publican's steps, eating some bread—I saw the last witness pass; the prisoner followed him, lifted up his coat, took out his pocket-book, and went into the public-house—I beckoned to the gentleman, made a statement to him, and we went into the public-house together, but could not see the prisoner—I saw him next day, at half-past 1, in the station with the police—he is the person.</p>

                  </hi>. On 12th June, about 4 o'clock, I was passing the corner of Moor-lane, and heard some women quarrelling in a public-house respecting some property which was not equally divided—Mary Oxley was one of them, and also a person who was afterwards taken in custody for disposing of stamps, and who was discharged at Guildhall—I did not see the prisoner while the quarrelling was going on, but I saw him next day in Moor-lane station-house, when he was charged with stealing the pocket-book—he said, "You have got it hot for me now"—I found three-halfpence upon him—he gave his correct address.</p>

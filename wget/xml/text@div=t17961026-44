               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon her? - A. No; then we sent for a constable, and Kennedy came and searched her, but before that time Hutchins slung the print which was in her cloak, on to the counter, but I did not see her do that myself; the print was given to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the colour of it? - A. A dark ground with a little sprig upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she near enough to have pulled it out when you saw her pick it up? - A. She was close enough to it to pull it off; and then I went into the shop and told the gentleman of the shop of it; I don't know any thing about the other woman, she was standing looking at a shawl at the door; she was not high the other woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her brought back? - A. Yes.</p>

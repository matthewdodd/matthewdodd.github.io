               <p>Q. Was this of the same sort that she had cheapen'd?</p>
               <p>Elderton. No: it was a separate piece. Produc'd in Court and depos'd to.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you value it at?</p>
               <p>Elderton. I value it at four shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jourdan. About the fifteenth of September I happen'd to go into Mr Elderton's shop, and into a little back room, there I saw a woman, whom I believe to be the prisoner at the bar; there was a little stir; I enquired what was the matter; they said she had stole a piece of black lace; she was search'd, and a piece was found under her stays.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It appears to me since, upon enquiry, that the prisoner has lived very well in the parish, and necessity has drove her to do this; and I am very sorry for her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jourdan. I made strict enquiry and cannot find that the woman has ever been guilty of such a thing before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

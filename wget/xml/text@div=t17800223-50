I wrote a letter of advice and inclosed a bill of parcels on the came day. The things were sent on the 1st of April, but the coach did not go till the next day.</p>
               <p>Had you any particular directions from Mr. Eden to send them by that coach? - We usually send by that coach unless he orders them to be sent by the waggon.</p>

               <p>What is the form of booking them? - The form is to Number them, this was</p>
               <p>"No. 10 value 12 l. carriage paid, 3 s." It lies in the warehouse till the coach goes off; when the coach is going off they are called over by the coachman to see that they answer to the book; they did answer right to the book that night. When they are called over, the porter carries them from the warehouse to the coach. The prisoner was porter to the house at that time.</p>

               <p>Do you remember receiving that box from Nevill? - I do not remember receiving it from him, I remember the box; I put it in the cupboard where we keep the Liverpool goods. I was present when they were called over, but did not checque them off, Misterset did, the porter is to take care of the warehouse, and deliver the goods.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any reason for remembering that the prisoner was there on that particular night? - There is a person in court can give a better account of that.</p>

               <p>Was the prisoner porter there that night? - He was.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember who the porter was that night? - I remember very well the prisoner was there, in the room of Powell who is the regular porter, that was the last night of our slow work when we go out at ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he porter some time before that? - Yes.</p>


               <p>A week or more? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you called over the parcels do you remember calling over this particular box? - Yes; we have a strong travelling box where we put our small boxes into, that locks up, this was too large to go into that. I called it over twice; it went through my hands three times I believe.</p>
               <p>Who do you deliver them to when you have called them over? - It is my business to load the coach; the porter brings out the things to me to load the coach.</p>
               <p>Do you remember whether this box was, or not, delivered to you? - I cannot say whether I did load it or not, there were many articles that night, I believe thirty-seven or thirty-eight. I had a candle to load the coach by, if it had been day-light I might have observed better.</p>
               <p>Can you say this box was not delivered to you when you loaded the coach? - I cannot say whether I loaded it or not.</p>
               <p>As you saw this box, and took particular notice of it before, and tried to put it into the box, for which it was too large, should you not have taken notice if you had not loaded it, and enquired for it? - We load so many things; we do not take notice after we have called them over; I never had a complaint before; I have driven the coach many years; I did not think any thing was missing.</p>
               <p>You drove to St. Alban's; do not you deliver a number of parcels between here and St. Alban's? - No; I never take up any parcels for that short space; I have never delivered any since I drove the coach.</p>
               <p>Can you take upon you to remember that no parcels were delivered before you came to St. Alban's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you come to St. Alban's, and have delivered the bill of the parcels, you have nothing more to do with the coach? - I have done with it.</p>
               <p>You cannot say then whether any thing is taken out there? - I can safely say there was nothing taken out; I generally stand by the coach till it sets out again.</p>

               <p>I see there are several other boxes, besides No. 10, that are not marked off? - Perhaps there is B put against them, which means they are in the strong box.</p>
               <p>Some with the B are marked off, some not; what is the reason of that? - Perhaps they were to be left at Wellington, they have the key of the box at Wellington; I never mark off the things in the strong box, I cannot come at them.</p>

               <p>Did you know him before? - Yes; I knew him before, but had not seen him for years. I asked him what he would take for them? He said 18 s. a pair.

               <p>Did you buy any? - Yes, eighteen pair.</p>

I desired him to leave them two or three days, and I would enquire his character. I enquired his character and then bought them of him. When I first knew him he lived at Hartford, about six miles from Leeds; he lived servant with a gentleman; his father was a cloth-maker; I believe the prisoner at first was apprentice to a cloth-maker.</p>

               <p>These have been out of your possession? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where had you the two cases from, which you produce now? - From Coventry; I sent them there to have movements put into them.</p>

               <p>"SIR,</p>
               <p>"I received a letter from Mr. Wall and Holt about some watch-cases I bought, I shall be glad to serve you with any assistance I can concerning them; the man I bought them of is named

            , he lives about seven miles from Leeds, trades in cloths, goes to London about once or twice a year; he told me he got them from London in payment for some cloth. I believe he is at London. I wish you would let me know when they were lost, and how many of them. I have none of them by me, but if you desire it I believe I can get you a sight of some of them."</p>
               <p>Did he say how he came by those watch cases? - No; he said he had one pair by him in a bag in his room; I went and found them.</p>
               <p>To Nevill. Look at that case, is it Mr. Lathwaite's make? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Court. Is there any mark on that case to enable you to tell what time your master made it? - Yes, within a year. I cannot tell nearer than that.</p>
               <p>Your master made a great many in the year? - Yes, some hundreds.</p>

               <p>Can you tell who made that? - Yes,

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I work for Mr. Lathwaite. I made this case for Mr. Lathwaite. It was made last year by the letter of the Hall mark, which changes every year; but I do not know what month it was.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Denham. How soon did you receive advice from Liverpool, that this box was not received? - On the 8th of April the advice was dated the 6th. The coach is two days coming to town.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner continue in your service then? - He did, but I had no suspicion of him in the least.</p>
               <p>How long did he continue in your service afterwards? - I cannot say, he went down to Yorkshire soon after, I cannot recollect the day.</p>
               <p>Was it commonly known in the yard that the box was lost? - It was known in the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Was it not known to the porters? - I do not know that. We do not make these things known to the porters. I thought the box was sent, and they might have made some mistake on the road.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence to my counsel.</p>
               <p>(It was admitted by the counsel for the prosecution that the prisoner bore a good character.)</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a haberdasher's shop in Blisset Street, Green<lb></lb>wich. On Saturday evening, 6th Feb., the prisoner came into the shop about 7 o'clock, and asked for a halfpennyworth of black thread—I served him, and</p>

               <p>he went away—Jane Spinks was in the shop at the time—about ten minutes after he had gone, I missed a roll of calico; it had been by the counter, opposite the door, not where the prisoner was; I had not seen him near that counter, only where I was serving—I had seen it safe five or ten minutes before the prisoner came in—about 10 o'clock that same night I went to a marine store shop, and there found it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father in Blisset Street, Green<lb></lb>wich, a few doors from the last witness. On Saturday evening, 6th Feb., I was in her shop—the prisoner came in behind me—I had seen him before that with a man who has escaped—I heard the other one say, "Go in and get a halfpennyworth of black thread," and the prisoner came in and stood behind me while I was served—I came out before him—I went across the road, and when I came back I saw the one who has escaped and the prisoner walking up Blisset Street together—I stood at our gate and watched them; the other one went into the shop, and came out with some<lb></lb>thing on his shoulder and walked across the road, and they went away, and I saw no more of them—I had seen the other one three or four times before—I knew him by sight; he used to be potman at a public house close by—I did not see the prisoner after that I saw him go across the road and the other one follow with something on his shoulder—I should not think it was quite ten minutes after the prisoner went in for the thread that the other man went in and got the roll—they had been loitering about there nearly all the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Shay, a butcher, at Royal Hill, Greenwich. On Saturday evening, 6th Feb., I was going down Blisset Street—I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the way to Miss Sprules—he was in company with the one that has escaped—he crossed the road to the shop and went back again—I can't say whether he went in—I then saw the other man go into the shop and bring a roll of stuff out on his shoulder—I went and told Miss Sprules—I did not follow the man with the roll, I had got some meat on my tray.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, R</hi> 40). In consequence of information, I went along the road to the George public house, Blackheath Hill—I there found the prisoner—I called him out, and told him he was charged with steal<lb></lb>ing a roll of calico from the shop of Miss Sprules, in Blisset Street—he said he did not take it, he knew nothing about it—he said he went in to buy a half<lb></lb>penny worth of thread—I did not find the calico at the marine store dealer's; I found it at Miss Sprules' shop—the marine store dealer has left, and I have not been able to find him—I believe he left that same night.</p>

I know nothing at all about the crime; I was along with my sister, who came from Sydenham; we went to the George public house to have a drop of beer, and I was there all the evening; I got a halfpenny worth of thread to mend my trousers, and then went straight away to see my brother about a job of work; I stopped to have a drop of beer with him, and the policeman came and took me into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, in partnership with my brother—the prisoner was in our employ for about two years and seven months—he had to attend the shop and to take money—on the morning of 27th of April, I left my shop about half-past eight or nine o'clock, leaving him in charge of the business—I returned about eleven, and examined the till—there was no money in it—when be received any money he was to put it into the till, and enter the amount in a book kept for that purpose—I said nothing, but at five o'clock Mr. Preen came in, and in consequence of what he said, when the prisoner came home, I asked if there was anything to go down in the book, or he had sold anything—he said, "No"—I said, "What has become of the pair of kid shoes that were in the case behind me?"—he said, "I know nothing about the kid shoes"—I said, "I mean the pair of kid shoes that you sold to the old man at Coat's"—he seemed confused, and I said, "How long have you been going on with this game?"—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther he made any answer—I sent for a policeman, who I believe put some questions to him—I heard him say, "This is the first time I ever did it"—he said he had made use of the money, and intended to account for it some other time.</p>

On the 27th of April, I went for a person in Mr. Coats's shop, in Whitechapel, to Mr. Hart's shop, to purchase a pair of shoes—I purchased them of the prisoner—I gave him two half-crowns, and he returned me sixpence—they came to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to the shop again in the afternoon, and said something to Mr. Hart.</p>

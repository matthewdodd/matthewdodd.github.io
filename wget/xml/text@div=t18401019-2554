                  </hi>. I am in the employ of John Taylor, a linen-draper, in St. John-street-road, in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. On the 6th of October, between six and seven o'clock, I received information while I was in the shop—I went into the street, and into Arlington-street, I saw the prisoner running, twenty or thirty yards off, and about three hundred yards from the shop—he had a piece of flannel on his shoulder, I saw him drop it—I pursued, and took him, and gave him to the policeman—I went hack to where the flannel was dropped—a policeman picked it up in my presence—it is the property of my employer, and worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had seen it safe not more than ten minutes before I left the shop, standing in<lb></lb>side the door-way, at least one foot—the shop leads to the dwelling-house, and is part of it—master sleeps in the house.</p>

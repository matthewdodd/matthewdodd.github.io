                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hillier, who keeps the King's Head, Brook-street, Ratcliffe. On Saturday evening, the 18th of May, Mr. Williams came to our house, with a person he called Mary Ann, (I think it was Ash,) and another young woman without a bonnet—Mary Ann Ash called for a quartern of brandy, which Mr. Williams paid for—he and the females drank it—Richard Bragger and Nicholson came in afterwards—Mary Ann said to Nicholson, "Where is <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>? "—I do not know his reply, but she went towards the door, and <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> came in—Mr. Williams said, "<hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, where is the half-sovereign?"—he accused him of taking it—that led to quarrel—a scuffle took place between him and Richard Bragger—Mr. Williams called him a b——rogue, and offered to fight him—Bragger got out, and held him by the coat, and said, "I do not wish to strike you"—Williams offered to strike him—Bragger let go of his coat, and they struck each other—Bragger struck him on the left eye, which bled—I said he ought not to strike an old man—he afterwards assisted in washing the eye—after that they appeared on friendly terms again—Mary Ann went away about half-past nine, and Bragger and Nicholson also—Williams took what appeared to be two notes out of his pocket, and some silver and gold—Nicholson picked them up, laid them on the counter, wrapped them up, and gave them to him—Williams left our house at twenty minutes to twelve, rather in liquor—the others had left a considerable time before—Williams fell from his chair, on his right side, in the course of the evening, about half-past eleven—shortly after he got up, he put his hand to his head—I asked if his head was bad—he said, "Yes, very bad"—my house is about five minutes' walk from Brunswick-place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live in High Shadwell. On Sunday morning, the 19th, about ten o'clock, I saw Mr. Williams at Nicholson's house, with Mrs. Williams, a seafaring man, Mary Ann Ash, and Rosetta Bragger—I saw he had a black eye—about half-past three in the after<lb></lb>noon, as I was going to callfor Mary Ann Ash, at Nicholson's, and she called me in at the Lamb—George Bragger and Nicholson were there—shortly after,</p>

               <p>Mrs. Ash came and called some one to the assistance of Mr. Williams, as there was a man ill-using him—George Bragger went first, and I followed closely after him—when I got to the house I found Williams lying on the ground, and Horstead leaning over him—no one else was in the room—Mr. Williams had a little blood on his chin, and his upper lip was a little swollen—after George Bragger picked him up and put him on a chair, Williams said we would not have seen him ill used had we been there, and I said I would not—I have known him some time—I am not an unfortunate girl—I asked Mr. Williams who had struck him in that manner—he pointed to Horstead, and said that was the man that had done it—Horstead told him he owed him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Williams denied having two, and said it was but one—Mary Ann Ash came and ordered Horstead out, and he left the room—I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself to ill use Mr. Williams in the way he had, and he threatened to serve me the same—I bathed Mr. Williams's temples while he was sitting there, and I moved him into the kitchen—Horstead came in again after that—he was very tipsy—he showed a paper or letter which he either said Mr. Williams had ordered him to write, or had written himself—I saw some blood on Mr. Williams's shirt when I was bathing his temples—he com<lb></lb>plained of his head very much, and said he was going mad—I noticed that the fender was very much bent, as if some one had fallen on it.</p>

I took Horstead into custody on Monday morning, 20th May, at his own lodging in Brunswick-place—I told him I wanted him to go along with me to the station, that he was charged with assaulting Mr. Williams—he said, "Very well, I will go with you, I know nothing about assaulting him, I recollect being called over on the Sunday by the old woman (meaning Rebecca Ash). I went inside the house, and some quarrel occurred, but who caused it I do not know. I was very badly treated myself. I received four or five blows about the head and face. I recollect seeing the old woman, and Mr. Williams and some other parties in the house, but who they were I do not know, I was very drunk at the time, if I had not been I should not have gone in."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the boys of Ratcliff-school, and live in Dor<lb></lb>set-street, opposite the Railway. On Sunday afternoon, 19th May, about half-past three o'clock, I was under the Railway, very near Brunswick-place. I heard the smash of a window, which took me to a house in Brunswick-place, I do not know the number—I looked in at the window, and saw Hor<lb></lb>stead beating Mr. Williams, who was lying on the floor—Horstead had his fist up, and hit him, kicked him, and jumped on him—I saw him do that—the two female prisoners, another man, and an elderly woman were in the room at the time—I saw nobody touch him besides Horstead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in High-street, Shadwell—I was called to see the deceased on Sunday night, 19th May, about ten o'clock—he was sitting in an arm-chair in the kitchen quite insensible, his head inclin<lb></lb>ing on his breast—I noticed his face more particularly on the following morn<lb></lb>ing—I then noticed a bruise under the left eye, and a cut on the internal part of the lower lip—he was quite insensible then—at that time I saw no other marks—his face was swollen on the left side—I noticed a small quantity of blood on the front of his shirt—I visited him several times during the Monday, he was insensible the whole day—he died about eleven o'clock at night—as<lb></lb>sisted by Dr. Pereira, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the external marks of violence were, a bruise under the lower part of the left eye, a cut on the inter<lb></lb>nal part of the lower lip, and a bruise on the scrotum—we opened the head, and on reflecting the anterior part of the scalp, and examining as far as the orbit, we found no internal injury corresponding with the blow on the eye—the skull was then removed, and on cutting into the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi>, a large quantity of dark coagulated blood oozed out—that was more particularly on the left side of the head—there was also a quantity of extravasated blood on the under surface of the anterior part of the left hemisphere of the brain—the escape of blood on the brain was the cause of death—that was caused, I should say, by external violence, a blow or a fall—a blow on the mouth which knocked him backwards with his head on the fender, causing a dent on the fender, might produce it—I should say the blow or fall on the Saturday night could not possibly have caused the effects produced—supposing the blow or fall on the Saturday night to have caused extravasation of blood, insensibility would have come on in a short space of time, I should say half an hour, but I cannot positively say—I should say that the blow had been inflicted a very short time before he complained that the pain in his head was making him mad, and his becoming insensible—I should say perhaps half an hour, or not so long.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Can you pronounce any opinion on such a question as that, with any degree of certainty whatever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think I can—I found one bruise on the scrotum—I carefully examined internally, and found no</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184406100047"></xptr>
               <p>injury corresponding which could produce death, it was quite superficial—the blow that inflicted the injury on the lip might produce the extravasated blood on the brain—it was not a very severe cut—it had bled—there were, pos<lb></lb>sibly, half-a-dozen drops of blood on his shirt, or more—I cannot positively say—if the man was in an excited state on the Saturday, I should say a slight blow or fall would be very likely to produce such appearances, as I saw—my opinion is, that the blow given on the Saturday had nothing to do with the cause of death—I found no mark on any part of his person that would denote he had fallen on a fender—if he had fallen with any violence on a fender I should have expected to find some external appearance—it is not necessary there should have been a wound—this was a case of compression, not concussion—we could not trace out which vessel it was that had been ruptured—there was a large quantity of blood extravasated—I cannot swear positively as to in how long or short a period the extravasated blood would make its appearance, but certainly within two hours, if the hemorr<lb></lb>hage was going on—the only blow indicating violence to any extent was the one on the under lip—I think that blow might produce compression of the brain in a man of his age, with the vessels in a brittle state—he was fifty-eight years of age—at that period of life the vessels of the brain are more liable to give way—I was not in the least puzzled to find a cause for the extrava<lb></lb>sation—I cannot swear whether the violence was caused by a blow or fall—it was either one or the other—the shock from a blow or fall would cause the concussion and rupture of the vessels—when I say concussion, I mean the shaking—the shaking of the brain would account for the rupture—that might have happened from an accidental fall—even in temperate persons, the vessels are much more brittle in the decline of life—it would be more so with a person of intemperate habits—a blow then would be more likely to lead to compression, which would be followed by stupor and death.</p>

I keep a public-house in Great Wild-street On Thursday, 11th July, the prisoner came about eleven o'clock in the evening for a pint of fourpenny ale—she gave me a shilling—I put it into my waistcoat pocket to keep it distinct, having noticed it—the prisoner was just going out, there was a crowd, and I did not follow her—I marked the shilling in the presence of one officer, and gave it to another officer—it had never been out of my sight till I gave it to the officer—my wife is very ill, and not able to leave her room.</p>

On Friday evening last, 12th July, the prisoner came and called for a pint of fourpenny ale, which I served her with; in payment, she tendered a counterfeit shilling; I said immediately it was a bad one, and called my husband, who recognized her directly, and sent for an officer, and gave her into custody—I delivered the shilling she tendered me to the constable.")</p>

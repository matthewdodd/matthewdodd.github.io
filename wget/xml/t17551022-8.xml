               <p>Blest. I was sitting in my back room. I went to look, being well assured he had taken one, but I found two gone. I pursued directly, and took him with the cheeses upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he gone?</p>
               <p>Blest. He had gone about 40 yards from my door.</p>

On the 20th of July, being Saturday evening, about ten o'clock I had occasion to go that way to Leadenhall; I was in the street, and going past Mrs. Beard's door, I saw the prisoner and another man reconnoitering the door way; it struck my recollection and gave me a suspicion that they had intent to rob the house; I watched them, I turned back and they were just behind me, I got a glimpse of them; I did not take any particular notice, least they should do me an injury; I crossed the way opposite to Mrs. Beard's house with an intent to alarm the family, that there were some suspicious people at the door, and to take care of their property; just as I got across the way I had not time to inform them before the prisoner and the other were at the door, I saw one man, I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or the other go into the shop while the other stood on the step, and fetch out some bed furniture; I did not know then what it might be; they walked away both together towards Lime-street; I directly ran across the way as they came from the door, and informed them that two men had robbed the shop, the shop was a being shut up, the door was open and the man was gone in for another shutter I believe; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110179"></xptr>ran immediately after the prisoner, and they followed me, just as we got to the corner of Lime-street, they were just turned into Lime-street, one with the furniture under his arm; we went up to them to know what they did with that furniture; the one that had not the furniture parried several strokes at me by way of keeping me off, and they found they could not keep the furniture he dropt it on the ground, they made an attempt to get away, but I never quitted them, they tried by knocking us about; I never lost sight of them after they committed the robbery, I called out thieves, least we might not secure the prisoners; some people came running, and I took hold of one side of the prisoner, and another person of the other side and secured him, the other made his escape; he was among the people; had I any body with me that I could have consided in we could have took both; the furniture was picked up by somebody, it is in the possession of the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner out of your sight from the time you first saw him? - He was out of my sight after the furniture was stole, but not after the furniture was dropped. We brought him back to the house, and that is all I know of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - He said something to the purpose that he was not the man, but I cannot swear that he was the man that dropped the furniture, but he was one of the two men that had got the furniture.</p>

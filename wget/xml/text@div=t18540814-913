                  </hi>. I live at No. 33, Euston-square. I am foreman to Mr. Holland, a builder—on the morning of 18th July, about twenty minutes past 3 o'clock, I was awoke—I was sleeping in the back parlour, on the ground floor—I heard footsteps softly on the carpet in the front parlour—I awoke up, apparently without any noise, but there must have been considerable noise from the force that was used to the conservatory door, as well as to the kitchen door—I suppose it was the noise that awoke me—I raised my head from my pillow to ascertain whether it was a sound or not, and while it was so raised, I distinctly heard the shutter bar move, that is, the shutter to the conservatory window which opens into the garden, the door of which had been forced before—I jumped out of bed, opened the folding doors, and saw two men at the window, attempting to open the shutter bar of the window leading to the conservatory—there was no window open at that time—as soon as the men saw me, I inquired of them their business there—they made no reply, but rushed to the front window, threw the sash up, and leaped on to the kerb of the area, and over the iron railings—I ran to the window, and shouted "Police"—there were persons coming down the New-road who saw them leap over the wall, and in a few moments I saw the officer running down the New-road after them—they had got in at the front parlour window—it was not fastened that night—it was shut down at the time they came in—it had been left open in the early part of the night, and an officer rang the street door bell at 1 o'clock, and told me it was open; I then shut it down—I had left it open because it was a very hot night, and I did not deem it necessary in such an exposed place to shut up the house—I did not think thieves would attempt to enter the house—I closed the window down when the policeman told me at 1 o'clock, and it was down when I was awoke at twenty minutes past 3 o'clock—it is very easy to lift the sash up—they could not have got in in any other way—I saw the men, but in the momentary excitement, and being so early, I could not swear to them—it was light—I have no moral doubt that the prisoners are the men, still I would not swear to them—I believe they are the men from what I saw of them—Mr. Abrahams, the surveyor, is the owner of the house, but I am the landlord of it, and live in it—it is in the parish of St. Pancras—it is at the corner of the New-road and Euston-square.</p>

On the morning of 18th July, I was up at 2 o'clock; at half past 3 o'clock I was going along the New-road, and saw four persons get out of the window of a house at the corner of Gower-place and New-road, Euston-square—they ran to the window, and jumped out two at a time—two of them jumped over the wall at the side of the house—I did not see what the other two did; I only saw one get over the wall in front of the house—they all had hats on—the one that jumped over the wall in front, took off his hat, and turned the Square, crossed the road, and came round into the New-road—I saw the prosecutor in his shirt at the window, and he pointed and called to the policeman, "There is one"—that was the one who took his hat off, and as he went to run, he dropped it; he ran towards Seymour-street—a policeman ran after him, springing his rattle, and calling, "Stop thief!"—the prisoners are two of the men that got out of the window—I noticed one more than the other; Smith had a rough coat on—I had three horses with me; I was riding one, and leading two—I did not wait to see whether the men were taken, but went on to the railway—I did not see their faces particularly; I speak to them by their clothes, and by their height.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a professor of music, in New Ormond-street. I was coming down the New-road with a friend, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning of 18th July, from Tottenham-court-road, towards Euston-square—about midway between George-street and Euston-square we heard cries for help and police, and as we hastened on towards the house, I saw a nightcap protruding from the window, and a gentleman in his shirt was calling for help—at that moment I saw the two prisoners standing in the road by the corner; I did not see them jump from the wall—I saw some one jump from the wall, and after he had jumped from the wall he spoke to them, as he passed one of them, and immediately ran—those are the two persons.</p>

               <p>some footmarks—I found this carpet bag, this iron crowbar, and this bit of wood was in the area—it had been split off from the door—I took the pri<lb></lb>soner's shoes from their feet after they were in custody, and found that Smith's shoes corresponded with the footmarks in the garden—I made an impression by the side of the mark, and likewise tried it afterwards in the mark—the two impressions exactly agreed.</p>

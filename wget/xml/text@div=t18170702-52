            . I am an officer. On the 25th of May, in the evening, I was at the Coach and Horses in Charles-street, Drury-lane, which is about four hundred yards from Castle-street, Bloomsbury. The prisoner came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020022"></xptr>into the house just at eleven o'clock, with a watch in his hand. He asked the landlord if he would let him leave a watch, and lend him 3s. till the morning-the landlord refused. I heard him use the word "watch." He inquired for some person, and went out up Charles-street. I followed him till he came to the end of Short's Gardens, and asked him what he had got; he said he had got nothing. I said,"have you not got a watch?"-he said he had. I asked him where he got it; he said he bought it in France when he was discharged. I asked him what he gave for it - He said 15s., but it had been in pledge, and his mother had taken it out for him the Friday before. I took it from him and secured him.</p>

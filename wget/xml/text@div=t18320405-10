            . I am a constable. On the 27th of February, a little before eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in Brunswick-square, and saw the prisoners in company together, going from door to door, with scouring-paper; I suspected, and followed them round into Henrietta-street, Brunswick-square, and saw them try the area gates - they came to the bottom of the street, and I observed them both tie their two rolls of scouring-paper into one parcel, and Milliner put it under his arm; I saw them try the lock of the gate, No. 1, Henrietta-street, and saw Sly go down into the area, after opening the gate - I do not know which opened it; they were close together- Milliner walked to and fro; I observed him beckon to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050013"></xptr>Sly, and then saw him push the area gate open, which had drawn to; he reached his body inside, and took something up out of the area - I could not see from whom he took it; it looked like a dark bundle - Sly then immediately came up, and crossed the street away from Milliner; I crossed over, and collared Milliner - I felt his bundle, and found it was silver; Sly immediately ran off - I called Stop thief! he was near enough to see me take Milliner; I have the bundle I took from Milliner - it contains four table, five dessert, and six tea-spoons, two ladles, a fish and a butter-knife, five forks and two salt-spoons; Sly was taken in about two minutes - I never lost sight of him; he was getting over a fence, and a boy held him till I came up - he said to me, "I don't know that man, I never saw him before in my life" (meaning Milliner); he had the plate in a japanned bread-tray.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Sly was taken in about two minutes, had you looked at the bundle before he was taken? A. No - I chinked it, and found it was plate; I was looking round at Sly - he never got out of my sight; he was the only one running in the street, but when I cried Stop thief! about two more persons ran- nobody told me I was mistaken in Sly's person; he was never out of my sight - the house is in St. Pancras parish.</p>

I know this plate to be his; I had the care of it, and had seen it ten minutes before the alarm, in the pantry in front of the house, in the bread-tray; there was a curtain before the window - nobody could see it; I was on the second floor at the time - there was no servant below; there are only four in family - I saw the prisoners about the premises two or three days before, both of them - they were standing looking steadfastly down the area when I was coming down stairs about ten o'clock in the morning; I saw them through the half window - our area gate was locked at this time; it is never open; there are no steps - he must have jumped down seven or eight feet I should think; the kitchen door was on the latch - a person below could reach any thing up to a person who was stooping down; I had been up stairs about ten minutes - a gentleman knocked at the door, and gave an alarm; I found the plate gone, and the doors all left open - the house door was latched before, and shut, but not locked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The area is seven or eight feet deep? A. It is; the door of the coal-cellar being pulled open, any person might climb up it - there are ledges on the inside of the door; the door is three or four feet high - there are no iron bars; I cannot tell whether the cellar-door was open - it is never locked; the area rails are four or five feet high, with spikes at the top.</p>
               <p>Milliner's Defence. I was going about my business, and on coming by the area there was a lad down there; it was no the prisoner; he asked me to give him a help up- I asked how he came there; he said the servant had been giving him some bread, and said "Here it is" - I took it up, and the officer immediately took me.</p>
               <p>Sly's Defence. I was walking along, selling pincushions, and coming from a door, where I had just sold the last; when I came out a mob was hallooing Stop thief! I ran before them, and this man came up to me, and said, "That is him, stop him before he gets over the paling" - they were looking over the paling, thinking the boy had got over, and he said, "That is the boy who gave him the silver."</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Sly a good character.</p>

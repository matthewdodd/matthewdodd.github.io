                  </hi>. I live in Sheep-lane, Hackney, about forty-eight yards from Clark's. On Wednesday, the 13th of January, about a quarter to two o'clock, I and my wife were standing at our door, and saw three men lurking about the garden in front of Clark's house, in a very suspicious manner—one of them, who was dressed in a light jacket, opened the garden-gate, went in, and walked towards the house—he stopped about as long as it would take a person to receive an answer, and returned again—I cannot see Clark's house from mine, only the garden—when the man re<lb></lb>turned to the gate, the other two joined him, and all went towards the house—they then returned again into the lane—they then went into Clark's garden again—I could see their backs when near the house, but no more—two of the three then left the garden together—the prisoner was one of those two—he was dressed in a dark rough Petersham coat—the one in the light brown jacket came out after the other two, in about half a mime—he had a bundle under his arm—he joined the other two in the lane—he handed the bundle to the man in a green coat, who took off his neckerchief and put it partly round the bundle, so as partly to con<lb></lb>ceal it—he then handed it to the prisoner, who put it under his arm and walked a little way with it—he then handed it to the man that brought it out of Clark's garden—they then walked down the lane, past the footway leading to my house, together—my wife then started to go to Mrs. Clark's, and inform her what we had seen—she called me, and I pursued the three men down the lane—as soon as the man who had the bundle under his arm saw the running, he ran away with the bundle—he turned into Waterloc<lb></lb>terrace, and I lost sight of him—the other two walked on—I pursued them about three-quarters of a mile down Hackney-road, as far as Warnerp<lb></lb>lace—when I got to the top of Warner-place, they were about a dozen yards before me—they turned round and looked very hard at me, and made as if they would come into Hackney-road again—I directly said, "I shall not leave you two gentlemen till I see a policeman"—they said, "What for? I don't know what you mean"—I said, "I will explain my meaning directly I see a policeman"—they walked down Warner-place—I kept close to them, and they still said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "I will satisfy you in part, I have seen a person in your company with stolen pro<lb></lb>perty; he has made his escape; if you take my advice you will call that party to restore the property to the lawful owner, and you will get into no further trouble; but if you do not, you will"—with that they took to their</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100054"></xptr>
               <p>heels and ran away—I pursued them, but they escaped—I saw no more of the prisoner till the 7th of April, when I saw him in the Kingsland-road walking with another young man, between twelve and one o'clock in the day—I said nothing to him, but got a policeman and had him taken into custody—the prisoner was quite a stranger to me—I never saw him before the 13th of January—it was broad daylight when the robbery was com<lb></lb>mitted, and I spoke to him face to face—I was with him some minutes in Warner-place, and I have a firm recollection in my own mind that he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I was with my husband on the 13th of January. I only saw the side face of the men—the dress and size of the prisoner is exactly that of one of the persons that passed me at the top of our footway—he had on the dress he has on now—when they saw me coming up the footway, they turned their heads away—the side of his face now corresponds with the side of the face I saw then—I call his coat a dark brown—one of the other men bad on a green coat, and the other a fustian jacket.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Swan-court, Swan-street. On the evening of the 28th of November I was in Great Garden-street—the prisoner came to me, and we walked a few steps together—he asked me if he could go with me—I said, "No"—he said I seemed cold—I said I was—he said he would give me something to drink—he put his arm round my waist, and I saw him draw my pocket through my frock—I looked and saw it outside my frock—I had a sixpence and three penny pieces in it—I put my hand into my pocket, and the money was gone—it had been there a moment be<lb></lb>fore when I met him—I told him he had robbed me—he said he had not—I collared him, and asked him for the money—he would not give it me—I called the officer, and gave him in charge—I had never seen him before.</p>

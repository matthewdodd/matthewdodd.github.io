               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; she was in my house about three or four hours to assist the servant; never more than that. That was on the 18th of November. I did not miss the watch until the officer informed me of it. The officer came to me, and said he had found upon the prisoner the duplicate of a gold watch, which she had pawned for four guineas. I went to Bow-street; there I saw the watch; I swore to it. I am sure it is my watch; it was deposited in a drawer in my bed room. I suppose I had not seen it for a month before. I am sure it is my watch; I have had it about thirty years. It is a gold watch.</p>

            . The watch was pledged with me on the 19th of November, by the prisoner. She at first pledged it for two pounds; on the 6th of December she had two pounds four shillings more upon it. I produce the watch.</p>

            . I searched the prisoner; I found the duplicate of a watch upon her, pawned for four guineas. This is the duplicate.</p>
               <p>Goodyear. That duplicate is mine; I delivered it to the prisoner for the gold; watch she had pawned.</p>
               <p>COURT, to prosecutor. What is the value of that watch - A. It cost me about fourteen guineas; if it was worth that thirty years ago it may be worth more now.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to her character.</p>

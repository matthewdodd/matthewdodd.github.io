On the 15th of January the prisoner came into the room of the house where I lodge, about two or three in the afternoon; I thought he came to pay me for work I had done for him; he sat down in a chair by my bed-side, where my watch hung; he staid till between five and six; he said he had three halfpence, and desired me to be two-pence for a pot of beer; after that he wanted a dram of gin; then I went to go down, he said I need not, for he would take it at the bar; after that I said, I must go up and lock my door; he said he would; he went up and took my watch, and locked the door and came down.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he took your watch?</p>
               <p>Robinson. Because he owned it; I went directly up stairs after he was gone, and missed it; I went to Justice Girdler and got a warrant; after that I heard he was in New Prison; he was taken before the bench of Justices, there he owned it; he said he had pawned it at the end of Featherstone-buildings for a guinea and a half.</p>

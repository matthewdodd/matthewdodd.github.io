               <p>I have the care of Mr. Wesley's building; the chapel and coach-house. I went out between eight and nine in the evening, to fasten the gates, and see all was safe, last Wednesday was a week; and as I came underneath, I saw a man stretched across, ripping up the lead; I called to him, and asked him what he was doing? he said, nothing; I said, you had better come down; he came down; I secured him, and sent for an officer; and the lead was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240181"></xptr>ripped up from the bottom better than half a foot.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see the lead before that evening? - I was looking at it that day; it was whole, entire, then.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing about the prisoner? - I examined him, but found nothing; I apprehended he, himself, had thrown it over into a large timber-yard adjoining; I searched that timber-yard, but could not find any thing; but I found a piece of his breeches, which I apprehend he tore off.</p>

               <p>I did not see any lead there, nor know there was any lead there; I was distressed for a lodging, and went there to sleep; I had been up all the evening before; the constable knows my father very well; he told my father my time would not come on till to-morrow.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

On the 6th of this month my wife and I had been in the bar, we had put 4 l. or upwards all in silver in a bag; she thought I took it, and I thought she took it, so it was left on the bar; we did not miss it till three days after; the prisoner had worked in the brick-fields, and used our house; the moulder that he worked for was sick, so he had nothing to do. We observed he had cloathed himself with some good things; we judged he took it, he having been in our house several times between the time of leaving the money, and missing it; we asked him how he came by his cloaths; he said his brother and sister had well cloathed him. We took him in custody yesterday; at first he denied it, but at last he fell a crying, and owned he took it from the top of the bar, and said he had been in the country and cloathed his father, and had no more than 9 d. left; his father lives at Tooting in Surry.</p>

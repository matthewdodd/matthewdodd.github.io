                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger at 141, Fleet-street—on the evening of 25th November, about twenty minutes to 6, I was in St. Paul's-church-yard going to Cheapside—I was about turning the corner by Butler's the chemist's, and I felt a great pressure on me, which drove me short round; there were several men about me—I thought it very strange, and tried to extricate myself, but the more I tried, the more the pressure came—I found myself pressed by two men against the wall—the prisoner had his back to me then, and I was fixed completely against the wall—the prisoner then turned, and with a restless motion appeared to be doing something, and it struck me directly that he was robbing me—I looked down and saw one of his hands at my waistcoat, and my watch chain dropped at that moment—I had a watch attached to my chain in my right-hand waistcoat pocket—I looked him in the face and said, "You have got my watch"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You have, and I'll never leave you"—he said, "I have not"—I then felt the pressure relax right and left, and felt myself at liberty—the prisoner immediately turned round to make for the corner of St. Paul's, but I kept close on him, and went in front of him and said, "You have got my watch," and called "Police!"—the waterman at the cab<lb></lb>stand came up and said that in the absence of the regular officers, he had the privilege of taking a charge, and I said, "I give him into your charge for stealing my watch"—we walked on to the corner of the Old Bailey, where we met a constable and he was handed over to him, and taken to the station—he was there searched, and no watch found, but after the charge was booked, as I was returning up Ludgate-hill at a good pace with a pair of gloves in my breast-pocket, I felt something drop from them into my pocket I put my hand in and there I found my watch—when I last saw it it was in my waistcoat pocket—I did not see it in the prisoner's hand—it was safe as I was turning the corner, and there was nobody near me but those three men—the bow of the watch is gone; I have never found that.</p>

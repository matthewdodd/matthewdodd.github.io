                  </hi>. I live in Steven-street, Lisson-grove. I met the prisoner outside the Phoenix public-house on the 30th of June—he asked me for a lodging, and we went home together—when we got to the door I asked what he would give me—he said, "Half-a-crown," he gave me two shillings and a sixpence, which I put into my pocket-apron, where I bad some other money—I put my pocket-apron under the bed in the back-kitchen, where I live—when I awoke in the morning I said I wanted some water—the prisoner turned up the bed-clothes and took my money—I got my clothes on, and went to the Globe public-house, where I saw him—I said to him, "Give me that 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or I will give charge of you"—he said, "Never mind, come have a drop of gin"—he was going into the public-house—I took hold of him, and he hit me on the side of the face—he went in and called for some gin—he threw down a shilling—I saw the woman side of it was almost worn away—I said, "I will swear to that shilling, it is one of mine,—the officer took him—I said he gave me two shillings and a sixpence, and the sixpence had got a cut in it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 50.) I took the prisoner—the prosecutrix said there was a new sixpence which had a cut in it, and it would be found on him—I searched him, and found this sixpence (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>ducing it</hi>) which exactly corresponds with what she described—here is the shilling with the woman side worn away.</p>

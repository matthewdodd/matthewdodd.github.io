                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable V</hi> 291.) About a quarter to two in morning of the 25th of Dec. I was on duty at Shepperton—I saw Norcott come out of the farm yard belonging to Mr. John Saunders, of Shepperton—I asked what he had been doing—he said he had been to see <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Jiggle to order some barge horses for Mr. Mason—I allowed him to pass—he had nothing with him—he was going towards London—on turning from him I saw two more men come out of the same gate—one of them I took into cus<lb></lb>tody, but being stronger than me he made his escape—I believe the one I did not take to be Humphreys—the man I caught had two large bundles, and the other man, who I believe to be Humphreys, had a smaller bundle—after the man escaped, I took the bundles he dropped back to Mr. Saunders—the man, who I believe to be Humphreys, dropped his bundle, and it was picked up later in the morning—one of the bundles I took up contained a goose and a turkey—the other a goose and a fowl—I have the legs of them here—I traced Humphreys to Weybridge, between nine and ten in the morning—I after that went to Egham, found both the prisoners together there, and took them.</p>

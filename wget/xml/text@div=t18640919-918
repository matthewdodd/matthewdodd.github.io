                  </hi>. I am a draper, in High-street, Borough—Baylis was in my service as shawl-buyer and salesman—he served behind the counter—previous to the day I gave him into custody I gave some directions to a police-constable—on Friday, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> September, about 11 in the morning, I saw Hempsted in custody—I was fetched from the City—I had seen him many times before in my shop, but I did not know his name or his business—Baylis has been in the shop at the same time, and Hempsted has waited till he was disengaged, I fancy—I never saw him buy any goods in the place—I went with the officer after Hempsted was taken, and fetched two shawls which had been left at a public-house close by—I brought them into the shop, and said, "Who sold these shawls?"—Baylis immediately replied, "I did"—I said, "What did you sell them for?"—he said, "Seven shillings"—I went and looked on the check-file, and found that 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been paid to the cashier—I then said to Baylis, This is a very strange business, your selling such goods as these for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and I then inquired of the men generally what was the cost of the shawls—one cost 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and the other 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I knew from the tickets what they had cost, I marked them myself—I have not got the tickets; they were not on the shawls when I got them from the Black Bull public-house—one ticket was produced by a young man—I saw it, but I imagine it was destroyed—there are no tickets now on the shawls—there are tickets on all goods that go out of my house, with the selling-price marked in characters, not figures—I know the value of the goods; the value, to buy them, is 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. the two—the price, to a wholesale buyer, would be 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said to Baylis, "It is a very strange thing that you sell goods like this," and he said, "I know I have done wrong; I will make it up if you will forgive me"—Baylis had directions as to price—if it was a wholesale customer he was to sell at the wholesale price, and if a retail customer at retail price; no deviation whatever—I gave those direc<lb></lb>tions to Baylis, and to every other salesman—I took this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) off the cashier's file; it is Baylis's handwriting—it is not signed by any one—it ought to have been signed by some one—every bill ought to be examined by another person, and his initials put on it, to show that it is correct; and in case the bill is wrong, he is fined for examining it wrong—these shawls are my property—they have been in my shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long has Baylis been in your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About ten years—I had a very good character with him—he has been shawl-buyer for eight or nine years—these shawls were his own buying; he buys them on his own judgment and responsibility—I know what they cost from the ticket—the young man who is subpœnaed on your side has the ticket, I believe; he showed it to me—the last time I saw it was the day Baylis was given into custody—it was not given into my hands, I only saw it—the young man's name is Mountfield—things have been going up in price lately—shawls eighteen months and two years old are as sale<lb></lb>able as shawls of the present season—these are not fancy goods; they are everyday-going things—I cannot admit that fancy goods vary in price, and become less valuable according as the pattern is old; some things, I dare say, may do so—shawls may do so in some trades, but I have got a trade for these things, and I can sell them at all times for the first value—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186409190107"></xptr>
               <p>mine is a plain trade—I don't call these fancy goods at all—it was reported that one of the shawls was a little soiled, but I don't see much of it myself—it is only in the crease where it is folded—I say it is not soiled; nothing to harm the shawl; not to make it of less value—I believe the witness Mountfield, is outside, he came away from the shop this morning before I did—he is in my service now—I have not seen him here this morning—he has been in the shop this morning—we open at half-past 7—I have been in Scotland, shooting for three weeks, bat I stick to business very closely generally—Baylis is one of my head men, and Mountfield is another—the bills are shown to another person to see if the items are added up rightly—I don't think that is always carried out when there is only one article; it should be done—I mark the shawls with my own hands, at all times, when I am in town, and when I am out Baylis does it—I cannot tell you what date these shawls were purchased, or how long they have been in my establishment—the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. marked on this document, as payment for the shawls, has been received by me—it is in Baylis's ordinary handwriting—I should know, if I saw it, that he had received 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the shawls—he did not say, if he had done wrong he would make it up—he said he knew he had done wrong, and he would make it up—he told me at once that he had sold them for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I don't know whether he knew that Hempsted was in custody then or not.</p>

               <p>some directions from Mr. Ewin—on 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> September, about a quarter to 9 in, the morning, I was at the corner of King-street, High-street, in private clothes—I was about thirty yards from the shop, I should think—I could see who entered—there was somebody employed in the window of the shop—I saw Hempsted standing at first in front of the shop—Baylis came to the door, and spoke to him—some other person was then engaged close by in the window—Baylis then went into the shop, followed by Hempsted—I did not see what occurred in the shop at all—I then saw Hempsted come out with a parcel under his arm, and shortly afterwards Baylis followed, not more than a minute afterwards—Hempsted was not more than thirty or forty yards from the door when Baylis came out—they went into the Bull public-house in High-street, a few doors from the prosecutor's premises—they remained there some three or four minutes, when Baylis came out, and returned to the prosecutor's shop—a minute or two afterwards, Hempsted came out—he had nothing with him then—I followed him down High-street into the Westminster-road—he then went into Mr. Alderson's, another linen-draper's—he came out with two parcels from there, and went to a pawnbroker's, of the name of Barnett, near the Circus—he came out of there with only one parcel, and went back again in the direction of tin prosecutor's shop—I followed him down the Borough-road into Blackman-street, where I stopped him—I asked him what he had got—he said he had some head-dress pieces—I told him I was a police-constable, and I wished to know what he had—I asked him if he had any invoices with them—he said, "Yes"—I then asked him if he had been into any other shop besides Mr. Alderson's that morning—he said, "No"—I said, "You had better be careful," and he afterwards said, "Yes, I have; I have been to Mr. Ewin's"—I asked him what he purchased there—he said, "Three shawls"—I asked him if he had any invoice for them—he said, "No"—I then asked him how much he gave for them—he said, "Seven shillings"—I told him he would have to go with me to the station.</p>

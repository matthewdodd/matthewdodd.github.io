                  </hi> I am clerk to George Harker, a dry-salter, of Arthur-street, City. On the 21st of December the prisoner called at the warehouse—I knew him by the name of Gillingham—he inquired if Mr. Harker was a buyer of Reading sauce—I said, "If it is not Cocks' genuine Reading sauce, it is no use to offer it, for Mr. Harker will not buy it"—he offered it at 15 per cent. under Cocks' selling price—Cocks' price is, I think, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, and then 20 per cent. discount, which would bring it to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen, that is Cocks' price—I said, "How is it you are enabled to offer it at 15 per cent. less than Cocks' price?"—he said he had made an exchange with Cocks for soy, and that enabled him to offer it at the reduced price—I said Mr. Harker was not within, and told him to call next morning—when I said Mr. Harker would not take it un<lb></lb>less it was Cocks' genuine, he produced a paper to me, which he called an invoice, that convinced me it was Cocks' genuine sauce—I concluded the thing to be perfectly fair—he went away and came again next day—I was present when he saw Mr. Harker—they had some conversation, and Mr. Harker bought twenty-four dozen, and gave a cheque on Prescott's bank for 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the prisoner gave a receipt—I have both the cheque and receipt here—the sauce was packed in two hampers—I have tasted the sauce—it is not Cocks' Reading sauce.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a drysalter. In December I remember my servant Hayes communicating to me what had passed between him and a person named Gillingham—I afterwards saw the prisoner—he told me he had offered my clerk some Cocks' Reading sauce—I asked him if it was the real genuine article—he said it was, and he had convinced my clerk of that, that the sauce he offered was the genuine sauce—he said he had con<lb></lb>vinced my clerk of the fact—Hayes said, in his presence, "He has shown me the invoice from Cocks"—the prisoner said he had sold Cocks some soy,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184204040006"></xptr>
               <p>and had taken this in barter for the soy—as he had often called before, and offered me soy, I took it for granted it was right—I think he said the price was 35 per cent, discount, that is, 35 per cent, off 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—Cocks' discount is 20 per cent., and twelve months' credit—I told my clerk he might take it—I might have told the prisoner he might send it in—I wrote a cheque for the money, and gave it to my clerk to pay him when he delivered the article—it was not delivered in my presence—Hayes afterwards returned me this receipt as given by the prisoner, and this cheque came back from my bankers in due course—if I had known it was any thing but Cocks' genuine Reading sauce, I certainly should not have bought it—it was valueless—even if it had been better, it would not have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe your conversation with him was exceedingly short? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very short—I was induced <hi rend="italic">to</hi> take it by what he told me himself—what my servant said had nothing to do with it—I asked the prisoner the questions, and he answered’ me—my clerk said he had seen an invoice—I do not remember that he showed me an invoice—I believed what my deck said on the subject, but I was induced to take it by the prisoner's representation—what my clerk said to me had nothing to do with my in<lb></lb>ducement—I thought the prisoner a respectable man, and what he said sufficient—I thought he had bartered it for soy—he said he wanted the money immediately, which was the reason he sold it—I knew he had offered soy at my house, and that made me think it likely—it strengthened what he said to me—I think I had seen some of the bottles at the time I agreed to purchase them, but I am not quite positive—I desired my warehouseman when the sauce came in, to look at the labels—the bottles were not there when the prisoner came—I left the cheque with my clerk to pay for them when properly delivered.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

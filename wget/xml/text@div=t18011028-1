            , myself, and William Pearson, the younger; the prisoner was employed in our warehouses; I know nothing of the transaction.</p>
               <p>RALPH WATTS sworn. - I am an Excise-locker: On Thursday, the 24th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in the warehouses at Paul's Wharf; the prisoner came down with the rest of the men to the lower room, I rubbed him down, and heard something rattle, which was the coffee running down through his breeches knees; I then called my partner to my assistance, and we secured him; we took nine pounds and a half of coffee out of his breeches; we got a constable, and took him before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have generally a bye word for a man that goes out of the warehouse? - A. No, we rub them down.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a bye word, get on as fast as you can; walk away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you a bye word without which persons cannot get in and out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reward upon the conviction of a man for robbing the warehouse? - A. I never made any enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard what the reward is? - A. I did not know till I made enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by telling me you had not enquired what was the reward? - A. A guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not search the men when they came into the warehouse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore a man might bring coffee into the warehouse if he pleased? - A. We have nothing to do with that.</p>
               <p>Q. But you expect a guinea if this man is convicted? - A. No, I don't care a halfpenny for the guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell this man he might have the sweepings? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Brady? - A. Yes, he is the Custom-house-locker.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation had you with Brady before you rubbed him down? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. I had no conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who stopped him first? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A. Yes.(James Brady and one other witness corroborated the testimony of Watts.)(John Wainewright, the constable, produced, the property.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Gossett. This is the same sort of coffee that we had in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been a very little while in the coffee business, and Brady and Watts told me I might make a shilling or two, and he made motions with his hands to his breeches, and seemed very much surprised that I did not understand his motions; and he said, why don't you go; I told him I did not know where to go; and then I took the coffee; and when they rubbed me down, I was surprised at their taking me into custody; this was sweepings; it was impossible any man could attempt to go out of this door, when he was sure to be searched, without it was with the approbation of these officers; it is they that commit the depredations.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.(To Gossett.) Are sweeping allowed as a perquisite? - A. No.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I set out about eight o'clock in the morning, and went to Highgate. I locked up the door of my house, and pin'd the windows of my house and shop. I did not shut up the window shutter of the back house, but pin'd the window down fast. When I came home at night I found my house entirely open, and the back window. One pane of the sash was broke, and there was blood upon the table under the window. This pane was broke in order to unpin the sash, and the windows and doors I found open. There are three houses all of a row, mine is one of them. I found they had taken the money out of the shop; I cannot tell how much I had there; but in all I believe I lost upwards of 10 l. out of the house and shop. Some was in my drawers above.</p>
               <p>Q. What goods did you lose?</p>
               <p>Alien. I lost four caps, three cambrick handkerchiefs, two linen ones, one linen apron, one muslin apron, and some bacon.</p>
               <p>Q. What pieces of money did you lose?</p>
               <p>Alien. There were seven guineas, one half guinea, one nine shilling piece in gold, the rest was silver and brass, and a green purse. Two men pursued those prisoners, as I had reason to suspect them, and took them at Bushey in Hertfordshire; and I had them before a Justice there. When we brought them back we had them before Justice Holt; Royan discovered to me before this Justice, that as they were at dinner the next door to me, she said she wanted some bacon. Kelley said, if she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174812070011"></xptr> would go, she would tell her where she might get some. Accordingly she went, she said, and broke the pane in my window, and took up the sash, and went in, and took out my linen and bacon. This was the first time she went in; then Kelley asked her if she had any money, she said, no; he said if you'll go again, I'll tell you where it is,</p>
               <p>Q. Was Kelley ever in your house?</p>
               <p>Alien. He has lived in the neighbourhood ever since harvest, and has been at my house several times for bread, cheese, bear, &amp;c. When she had done that, he bid her open all the doors of the house, that they might not be suspected of the fact. She confessed she went in again, and did accordingly, and took the money out, and 27 shillings was found upon her. This was before Justice Cooper at Bushey: and before Justice Holt she said the same. Kelley denied it all.</p>

            . I am constable of Kentish town. After this Mrs. Alien was robbed, she sent to me in the night to come up to her house. We found the persons, we suspected, had set out for Ireland. I and another man took horses, and rode after the Prisoner Royan, and took her between Bushey and Watford, this was on the 15th. Then upon her confession, Kelley was taken up; she and her husband was together. She owned on the 18th, before Justice Holt, the taking the things which the widow had lost. Kelley would not acknowledge any thing. Here is her own confession she made before Justice Cooper. I saw her sign it Nov. 15. at Bushey. The Justice delivered the money to me; there was a guinea in gold, and a 5 s. piece.</p>

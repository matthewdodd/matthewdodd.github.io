             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a butcher in Clare-market, the prosecutor came to me to look at a pig, on a Friday morning, I bought it of the Tuesday, he said it was his, there is a mark round the neck it is a very remarkable one; I was sent for to buy this hog, in St. Giles's on Tuesday, where the prisoner Roberts lived, they were all there, it was a private house, the first time I went, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178302260105"></xptr> would not have any concern with it, the pig was then in the yard, tied up by the leg.</p>
               <p>Were all the three prisoners there the first time? - Wenham and Roberts were together the first time, there were six or seven of them in all, it was offered me to sell by Roberts, he said, will you buy this pig? I said no, I would not, I did not think it was come honestly by, I asked Roberts where he got it, he said, he bought it in Kent, and I said, it would not suit me.</p>
               <p>Where was Wenham at this time? - I do not know whether he was there.</p>
               <p>Where had you this conversation with Roberts? - In the yard.</p>
               <p>Was any other person in the yard? - I cannot be sure.</p>
               <p>Did you hear either of the other prisoners say any thing about this pig? - No, I did not, I went away, and came home, I told two or three people about our place, that there was a hog so and so, and I thought it was stolen; and I was persuaded to go and buy this hog, and get these chaps to bring it down, I went and agreed with Roberts for fifteen shillings, and they told me they could not bring it down till it was dark, there were six or seven playing at cards.</p>
               <p>Were the other two prisoners there at that time? - Yes, they were all together.</p>
               <p>Was this discourse about the pig, and agreement for it in their presence? - Yes, they were all together; I told them to bring it to Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Which of them was it that said, they could not bring it till it was dark? - Roberts, and I think Wenham, they gave me no reason why, this was in the middle of the day about one; all the three prisoners brought down the hog, after it was dark, tied in a string, they drove it before them, I told them to put it into the shop, and they did so; I had an officer waiting from Bow-street, and he took them.</p>
               <p>PRISONER WENHAM's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, I have to say in my defence so far as this here: I had the misfortune to break my thigh; my mother lives in St. Giles's, to be sure she is a very poor woman, and all my friends; I went to Roberts's house, he was playing at cards, and I sat down, and played with him; and while I was playing, Mr. Marks came, and Roberts went out with him, at night Roberts asked me to go with him, as he was going to drive a pig, the liquor had got in my head, as I had not drank any for a twelvemonth, then I was taken up.</p>
               <p>PRISONER ROBERTS's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This here pig came into the yard about twelve on Sunday night, and it laid there for three days, so I asked one and another, whether any body had lost such a thing, all about Tottenham Court Road, nobody owned it; so then Marks came and asked me to sell the pig, I asked him a guinea and an half, he offered me fifteen shillings for it, he bad me to drive it home to his house; he came twice to our house after the pig, the first time he asked me to take a shilling earnest, I would not take any money, without I had it all together.</p>
               <p>PRISONER ALLEN's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was in Roberts's house playing at cards, and had some liquor, and Mr. Marks came in about a pig, and Roberts asked me to go down with him, and then the gentleman asked me, if I would take the money, I said, I had nothing to do with the money, and pointed to Roberts, who, I said, belonged to the pig; then I was secured.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Allen called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

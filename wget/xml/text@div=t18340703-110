               <p>MARY CRIMP re-examined. These are my things - they were all in my charge - some of them belong to myself - I never gave the prisoner liberty to dispose of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has she been a good deal at your house? A. Yes; I got her a situation, clothed her, and put her in it - it was a foreign toy shop in Gracechurch-street - I never recommended her to any other place - to no other situation did I send her, I am quite certain - the toy shop was a respectable shop.</p>

            . I am a calenderer, and live in Printing-house-square. I know the prisoner, and had a very high opinion of her - she was at home with her father working at shirt making, until the prosecutrix got her to leave her father's home, and recommended her to a notorious place in Mulberry-court, Petticoat-lane - the prosecutrix herself told me she gave her the recommendation, as she thought the woman respectable when she kept a rag shop, and that is the cause of her getting into this situation - the prosecutrix said, the woman she recommended her used to buy things of her when she kept a rag shop, and the girl when she went there had rags to sleep on, and was asked to sleep with the nephew.</p>
               <p>MRS. CRIMP re-examined. When the prisoner came to me, she came from the employ of a tailor somewhere down Petticoat-lane, but I did not recommend her there - she did not complain that she was obliged to leave the place, and come in rags to me - she had been at home with her father - she came without a shoe to her foot - she was decent, but had no shoes - she seemed satisfied with the place - she did not complain to me that it was a disreputable place - they are respectable people as far as I know - I think their name is Malcot - she is a woman who had done business with me when I kept a rag shop - I did not recommend her to that place - I never spoke to Harris in my life but once, and that was since she left me - I know nothing about him.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HARRIS re-examined. I was at the Mansion-house after the girl was committed - I spoke to Crimp before the policeman - I told her it was through her recommending her to that place - she said, she thought it was respectable, because the woman dealt with her.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father - the prosecutrix took her out of Sir John Cass's school, where she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030054"></xptr>was a house girl - the girl was at home with me at work - she used to call Crimp "granny" - she told me her granny had got her a place to learn the tailor's business, at 3s. a week, if I did not object to her going - the prosecutrix has acted the part of a mother in every degree to my children - I do not think she meant any harm by placing my child there.</p>
               <p>MRS. CRIMP. The bonnet and shawl did not belong to the prisoner's sister - they were taken from my drawers.(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

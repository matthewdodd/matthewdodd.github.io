                  </hi>. I live in Southampton-street, Strand. The prisoner came to me on the 4th of November, and asked me to lend him a toilet-glass—I asked him who he was—he said his name was Cetta, and he was in partnership with his brother, in Brook-street, he travelled with a horse and cart, and his brother attended at home—I said, "If you are his brother, I should not object to let you have it"—I knew his brother very well—after he had one, he said, "You had better lend me another, to have a choice; and if I don't sell them, I will return them to-day, towards the evening," and if he sold them, he would bring the money that day—he never came back—the next evening I went to his brother's—he was in the country—his wife said her husband had no partner—I have not had the glasses or the money—I trusted him on his brother's account—I author<lb></lb>ized him to sell one—he was to bring back one, and the money for the other.</p>

I said, "I have not got the money to pay," but I gave my name; I said, "You know my brother;" he sent a boy to bring the glass down; I saw there was a speck in it; I said, "There is another by the window;" he said, "You can take two, and sell them both, if you like." <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

                  </hi>. I reside at 17, Cray's-hill, Bayswater—in con<lb></lb>sequence of an advertisement I saw in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on 7th February I went on 8th February to 65, Mount-street, Grosvenor-sqnare—I have not the ad<lb></lb>vertisement here—I was accompanied by my brother William Thomas.</p>

               <p>Makins—Matthew came out of the stable when I knocked at the door—I went into the stable with him, showed him the advertisement which I had cut out of the paper, and asked him if he had the horses advertised—he said, "Yes," pointing to the only two horses in the stable—he told me he was groom to the Honourable Mrs. Webb, of Ambleside, and she wanted to part with them in consequence of the death of her husband, and the horses were sound and free from vice—I took them on a month's trial—I asked him if he could give me authority to take them—he said Mr. Milton could give me the permission—he said that the Honourable Mrs. Webb was desirous of parting with the horses to a stranger in order that she might not see them again—in consequence of what passed between us he took me to Harman in John-street, Berkeley-square, which is close to Mount-street—when I arrived there I saw Harman and told him what Matthew told me about his being groom to the Honourable Mrs. Webb—he said he was a commission agent for the sale of horses, he also warranted them—he said he was the agent to sell the horses—on this I purchased them under the condition that I was to take a month's trial—I gave 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the receipt—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "February 8th, memorandum of agreement, that I have received this day 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my two bay cobs, which I warrant sound and free from vice; further, if Mr. Makins does not approve of them he has the option of returning them within twenty-eight days of this date")—I gave Matthew 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was induced to purchase them, believing they were the <hi rend="italic">bonofide</hi> property of a lady, and who wished to dispose of them—I had them examined the same night—I sent them to Professor Gamage in the Queen's-road—one of them went lame the first time I rode it—I went the next day to Harman's stable with my brother, but could not see Matthew—I then went to John-street to look for Harman and was told he was gone to the Isle of Wight—I did not ask for the money back because I did not see anybody to ask but a boy—I did not tender the horses back to that boy—this was in John-street—the first place I went to was Mount-street—when I got there I saw a tall young man—that was the time I tendered the horses back—I did not get the money back—the horses were not left there—the man seemed reluctant about taking them in—I did not give a card or a paper—from what passed between me and that man I went in search of Harman—he also gave me the address of Harman—I did not find him—I have sold these horses at Mr. Stedmond's—I received 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them.</p>

Mrs. influenced me to buy them—I certainly should not have seen them trotted out if 1 had not understood they were the property of a lady.</p>

Mrs. Webb, of Ambleside, that they had belonged to her husband, and she wanted to get them out of her sight, and sell them to a stranger, so as she might not see them again—he said they were sound, and that he had ridden and driven them—I asked him if he had the sale of them—he said, "No; Mr. Milton has the sale of them," and he volunteered to take my brother to Mr. Milton—I stayed while my brother went—he did not say he was the son of Milton—he said he was the Hon.

             - A. Yes; I was present at the sessions-house, Clerkenwell, at the time she was convicted in June, 1806, she was convicted of being a common utterer of counterfeit money, and was sentenced to be imprisoned one year, and at the end of that time to find sureties for two years more, she remained in custody to that time and found sureties by the order of the court.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is the prisoner the same woman - A. She is; I have known her for the last seven years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have no doubt about it - A. No doubt at all. I have had her in custody since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing her on the 16th of April last, and where was it - A. On Monday the 16th of April, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in St. John-street, the prisoner passed me, I spoke to her, she immediately crossed the way and went out of St. John's-street into St. John's lane, I followed her; she went down St. John's-lane, until she came into St. John's-street again; she went into Mr. Warwick's, the Hat and Mitre, in St. John-street; she had not been in the house above two or three minutes before I went in; I found the prisoner in the act of taking up some halfpence off the counter; I then asked Mrs. Warwick what the prisoner had to drink; the prisoner was standing by all the while, she told me that she had a glass of gin; I asked her how she paid for it; she told me with a sixpence; I asked Mrs. Warwick where that sixpence was; she told me that she had put it in the till, she should know it again, because she had no other there; on my looking at it I discovered it to be a bad one; I desired Mrs. Warwick, in the presence of the prisoner to mark it, so that at any time hereafter she might be able to speak to it; she marked it and gave it to me; I have had it ever since; this is the sixpence. I proceeded to search the prisoner; in her right hand pocket I found one counterfeit shilling, and two other counterfeit sixpences; I have had them ever since. In her left hand pocket I found two thimbles, some thread and tape in small quantities, and under her left arm pit, between her shift and gown, I found this paper containing six other counterfeit sixpences, and seven new halfpence; I have kept them by themselves ever since; these are them. I then took her in custody before the justice in Hatton Garden; she was committed.</p>

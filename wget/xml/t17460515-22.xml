               <p>Q. Well, what happen'd there?</p>
               <p>Spear. There came a Gentleman-like Man up to the Coachman, and held a Pistol up against him, and bid him stand; and when the Coachman stood, he (the Prisoner) came up to the Window on the Left side; then there was another on the Right-hand Side of the Coach came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the Person that made the Coachman stop was on the Left Side.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174605150034"></xptr>Spear. Yes, my Lord, and the other came to the Right.</p>

               <p>Spear. Both on Horseback.</p>
               <p>Q. Then what happen'd?</p>
               <p>Spear. Him on the Right-hand Side of the Coach demanded my Master's Watch, or he would shoot him.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his Words, as near as you can remember ?</p>
               <p>Spear. He said, Sir, your Watch, or I will shoot you.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his Hand.</p>
               <p>Spear. A Pistol, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What follow'd next?</p>
               <p>Spear. Then the other on the other Side demanded of Miss her Watch and Rings, and put his Pistol in at the Window.</p>
               <p>Q. Who demanded her Watch and Rings?</p>
               <p>Spear. It was one Keys. Master said, I have never a Watch, nor ever had one. Then they stood still; and he on the Left-hand Side of the Coach bid me, I think, look another Way. I did not say any thing to him, but thought of my Watch; and looking down to see if I could see the Seals out, he perceiv'd me, and came up and took my Watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Spear. He said, if your Master has got never a Watch, I see you have, and I will have it. I said, I hope you will not take mine. Yes, said he, I will, or else I will shoot you.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe, upon your Oath, that is the Man that took your Watch?</p>
               <p>Spear. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it? how was he dress'd then?</p>
               <p>Spear. He was dress'd in darkish Clothes, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. What Sort of a Horse had he?</p>
               <p>Spear. As near as I can guess it was a Bay Horse.</p>
               <p>Q. What follow'd after this; after he got your Watch?</p>
               <p>Spear. They rode off both towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. What Day was this?</p>
               <p>Spear. On Saturday, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Q. Then when you went out what then?</p>
               <p>Brown. I went to one Mr. Pardy just by, and I told him the Case; he came along with me, and went for some Assistance; when I came back again, they had some Suspicion, and I met Keys at the Door; he asked me whether I had found my Master; I said, no, I had been at one Place, and I would go to another; and he said, D - n your B - d, give me the Watch: (I had it in my Pocket to shew it to my Master) I said, I had not got it, I had left it. He said again, D - n you, give me the Watch: With that he put his Hand in his Pocket, and turned himself on one Side; I saw him turn himself, and I whipt across the Way: Upon that the Person I went for, came up. Keys call'd after me, and he went in and call'd the Prisoner at the Ear, and when he came out, the Person caught him in his Arms, and the other made his Escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the Man?</p>
               <p>Brown. I have seen him two or three Times; he brought me a Gold Watch; and I know that is the Watch, I have had it in my Custody for six Weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the Watch?</p>
               <p>Brown. Yes, my Lord, by the particular Marks.</p>
               <p>Court. You have behav'd extremely well, you deserve Commendation.</p>

            (to the Prisoner) Now is your Time to make your Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In regard to the Watch the young Man that I was in Company with, desir'd me to go with him to pledge it, he not being used to the Town?</p>
               <p>Q. What is he?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was a Vintner, but not in Town.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I liv'd with one Mr. Miller, Attorney, in Hare Street, Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose your Master is here, or some of your Friends?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He (the young Man I mention'd before) desir'd I would pledge this Watch; he went off as the young Man had said before. I can't say but I had heard something of his Character before; I doubted he came by it in a clandestine Manner. I went to make my Escape, but I was taken into Custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no further Witness than the young Man that brought the Watch.</p>

            ) What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Macdore. I believe this is the Man that robb'd my cousin of his Watch at Mims, four Miles beyond Barnet, a Quarter before Four o'Clock in the Afternoon, at Mims Wosh; there were two Men upon two brown Horses came past us in the Wash.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, when they came past you, what then ?</p>
               <p>Macdore. They came up to us, one took hold of my Cousin's Bridle, and the other came up to me, so they robb'd my cousin of a Silver Watch and Three Guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he lost any Thing?</p>
               <p>Macdore. I was in Company with him, and saw it. I believe the Prisoner was the Man, but I can't swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. That Watch you are sure was the Watch that was taken?</p>
               <p>Macdore. Yes, the other Man that attacked me I refused; the Man that robbed my Cousin he said, D - n the Dog, shoot him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the Watch again when it was taken in December ? how came you to see it?</p>
               <p>Macdore. It was advertis'd; it was at Col: De Veil's; he had also the Key of my Cousin's Bags. The Watch I know, I have had it in my Hand many Times</p>

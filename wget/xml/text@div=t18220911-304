            . On the 15th of September, I saw the prisoner, between one and two o'clock, and went into a house with her. I gave her money, and went to bed - I rolled up my trowsers, and put them under my pillow. I got up about eight o'clock - I missed her long before that. My trowsers were in a different place from where I put them. The paper which contained the sovereigns, I found on the floor. I went to Bow-street, and returned with the officer. We found her with five or six more at breakfast, and she was taken. I had been drinking, but was sensible.</p>

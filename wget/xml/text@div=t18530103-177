                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last witness, and the wife of William Davis. On 14th Dec, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I was in the back parlour—my son called me, and gave me a shilling—I looked at it, and I say decidedly it was bad; I have no doubt of it now, and I had no doubt then—I said to my son," Who gave you this shilling?"—he said, "This man"—I said to Thomas M'Donald," You knew it was a bad shilling"—he said, "You are a lying old b—r"—I said, "Let me be what I will, decidedly this is a bad shilling"—I wanted to go to the next door, to get them to let the errand boy go for a policeman; but Mary M'Donald took me by the neck, and would not let me go—Thomas M'Donald said, "Give me that shilling back, and I will give you a good one"—I said, "No, not till I get the good shilling"—Mary M'Donald gave him a good shilling, and he gave it me—I gave him change, and gave him the bad shilling back—he put it into his mouth, and swallowed it—he looked over the counter, and said, "Now, you old b—r, what can you do now?"—the prisoners escaped then, but they were afterwards taken, and the next morning I was at Bow-street, and saw them there.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you sure this was the man that was in the shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was not an acquaintance of mine—two men and two women came into the shop—the other man was going to give half a crown for what they had, and Thomas M'Donald said, "I will give a shilling"—when the boy said it was a bad shilling, the other man and woman ran away—these two prisoners stayed—I will swear it was this man that called me by that name, and nobody but him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 95, in the Strand. On the 16th of April the prisoner took apartments at my house—he spoke English tolerably well—I understood him, and he appeared to understand me, with some little difficulty—he occupied two rooms on the second floor—I arranged with him to take the apartments by the month, paying monthly at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—after he had occupied the apartments a few days, I missed a silver cream-jug, and an opera-glass—on the 29th of April I had him apprehended—these are the articles—I know them to be my property—one was lost from the kitchen, the other from the parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Herbert, pawnbroker, Farringdon-street. This silver cream-jug was pawned by the prisoner, on the 25th of April, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in the name of John Eyres, No. 16, Abchurch-street—I took down the name and address from him—I asked him all the questions particularly—he spoke English sufficiently well to be under<lb></lb>stood.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is impossible for the pawnbroker to know me, but, be<lb></lb>cause I was a stranger, he went to the Court, and said, "That is the man;" I have never been in the shop. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I have no doubt of him, from his appearance and voice—I am able to speak positively to his being the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Among the Jurymen perhaps there is some gentleman or a merchant, and he will know that it is impossible for any shopman, supposing 200 or 300 persons go in the same day to a house, to identify the man; in London there are many foreigners, and in the pawnbrokers' shops all kinds of persons go there; when he went to the Court he said, "That is the man," before I spoke at all.</p>

               <p>had the first floor, but when the second floor was complete he took posses<lb></lb>sion of it—he staid nine or ten days altogether—he had not quitted my apartments before he was taken—these things were not taken from the rooms he occupied, but from places where he was not to go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> While I was lodging there you have admitted different parties. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> There were other parties in the house—the opera-glass was lost from the parlour—it was always lying on the mantel-piece there—my own parlour was undergoing repairs when the prisoner came—he was is the habit of going out in a suspicious way, rather early in a morning—I knew everybody else in the house, and had reason to believe they were honest, and my suspicion fell on the prisoner—I called in a policeman, who traced the property—I took the precaution not to give him into cus<lb></lb>tody till I was quite certain—I walked with him near to the pawnbroker's, and when we were crossing the road, in the direction of the shop in Pickett-street, where the opera-glass was, we were walking quietly with the policeman, and the prisoner ran away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> What he says is not the truth; I said my profession did not call me into the City, and I did not like to take a walk with him, which was the reason I went away; I was taken before the Magistrate and dis<lb></lb>charged. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was the first time, when only my evidence was taken—I had not found the property then—I gave him notice to leave, and when he came to take his luggage away the policeman had discovered the property, and I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have been living in a house for the space of six months; if the parties were here they would speak about my character; I said I would live at an hotel while they were repairing it; Mr. Bodman offered me the first floor, to avoid any expense; I accepted the offer; the theft has been committed in the house, and because I was a foreigner, Mr. Bodman went by force into the rooms, and I was accused; all the time I was there my con<lb></lb>duct was that of a gentleman; he had workmen, with liberty to go to any part of the house they thought proper, and to go away at their pleasure; the opera-glass was taken from the parlour, and the cream-jug from the kitchen; it was impossible for me to have done so; I do not know still where the kitchen is situated, or the parlour, where I have never been; if you look at the dates of the tickets, you will see they correspond with the days the workmen were in the house, in the parlour and the kitchen; the</p>

               <p>shopman has been here without any proof whatever, and compelled to say so by the prosecutor, taking advantage of my silence, and that I cannot ex<lb></lb>plain myself well in English; it was easy for him to take this advantage, and accuse me of this theft; I wish I could explain myself in the English tongue; it all depends upon the Judge and the gentlemen at the bar; the best thing is to give a good explanation; men that cannot explain them<lb></lb>selves cannot convince the other party; speech is the mirror of the reflec<lb></lb>tion, and it is through that that two parties can have communication; I have not taken the things, nor pawned them, and it is impossible for the pawnbroker to identify me, not having seen me more than once; why should I not be believed as well as the witness; in my pocket-book you will find my correspondence with the Consul and other parties, which will show I have been well connected in France; I came into this country as an engineer, with my family, and had letters of introduction to some fami<lb></lb>lies here.</p>

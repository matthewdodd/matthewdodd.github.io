I lire at Camden Town—I was with the last witness—I followed close behind her—I heard her say to the prisoner, "Oh, you have taken my purse"—I do not think he made any answer immediately, but within a minute afterwards he said, "It is a mistake, I am innocent"—she replied, "I felt your hand in my pocket"—he said that was a mistake—I laid hold of him—he had a railway wrapper over his arm.</p>

I was taking part of the luggage up the stairs—I heard the lady say that she had been robbed, speaking to the prisoner, and the last witness took him, and gave him into custody—I searched about the balustrade rails, and in about five minutes afterwards I found this purse close to where the prisoner was standing.</p>

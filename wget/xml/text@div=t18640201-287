                  </hi>. I live at No. 35, Regent-street, Blackwall, and am fireman and watchman to the Thames Iron Works Company—on the 21st January I received information that a coil of rope had been stolen, and I took a boat and rowed to a barge in which the prisoner was—I did not see the coil until I got on the barge; I then saw it in the hold—I asked him, "What about the rope that you have taken from the wharf?"—he said, "I have taken it to make fast a barge out in the river"—I said, "You know we do not find ropes for you to make barges fast out in the river"—he said, "I know that"—I said, "You must go ashore; you have no right to it, "and he said, "No"—when I got ashore I asked him the name of the barge he was going to make fast—he said, that it was the <hi rend="italic">Two Sisters</hi>—she has been at our wharf several times, but not since the 5th November—the value of the rope is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had seen it upon the wharf about ten minutes before it was missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer at the works—I discharged the pri<lb></lb>soner's barge at the wharf on 21st January—I cannot say whether this rope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the rope by which the barge was moored to the wharf—I saw, this rope on the wharf before the prisoner's barge went away—I saw him pull the rope off the wharf into the barge—I made a communication to the fireman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You saw it plainly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were several men running the <hi rend="italic">muck</hi>, out of the barge, and they all saw it—I don't know that when a vessel with a bad head-stall comes up the people take the rope to give her a lift up—I have been employed at the works for three months—I was standing on the top of the wharf when I saw the prisoner pull it off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman—on the 21st January I was work<lb></lb>ing up to the Thames Iron Company's wharf with a vessel—she had only part of a head-stall, and to get her to the wharf I required a stronger rope, to keep her in safety—the prisoner told me he was going to the wharf with the <hi rend="italic">Pioneer</hi>—I said, "Very well, look out with a rope for me and give me a turn, for the rope I have is not strong enough"—sometimes we load one barge and sometimes another, but this was a barge that happened to have a bad head-stall—it was the barge <hi rend="italic">William</hi>—I think I gave the prisoner the name of the <hi rend="italic">Europe</hi>—if he had brought me the rope it would have been taken up again—that is a general custom—I have been a lighterman ever since I was fourteen years of age.</p>

               <p>Mr. WILBY. This gown was at the bottom of the prisoner's box - it is called a livery gown, and was worn by sister Morley; it is found by the Governors, and when a sister dies it becomes the property of the hospital - I said to the prisoner "You cannot say this was given to you, it is the property of the Governors;" she said, it must have been put there by somebody to implicate her.</p>

            . I saw this gown found, and the prisoner said she did not know how it came there; her box was not locked; it was so full it could not be shut when I saw it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This gown laid on the bin - I never put it into my box, I only laid it on the top of the box with the other things - Morley told me to take it, and said when they had been there twelve months, it was their own.</p>

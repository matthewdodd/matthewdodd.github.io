                  </hi>. I am shipping clerk in the house of Calvert and Co, brewers, of Thames-street—Edmond Sexton Pery Calvert is one of the partners. On 7th Nov. I received an order for twelve barrels of porter, which were to be sent by water—the puncheons were filled, and were sent to Hayes's wharf for shipment—they all bore Calvert's brand, and the con<lb></lb>signee's name—in consequence of something I heard, I went with White, on 12th Nov., on board the <hi rend="italic">Director,</hi> which was lying in the Commercial Docks—I found the prisoner on board, as master—I examined four puncheons and identified them as four of the twelve which had been shipped—I examined them, the corks of two of them had been disturbed—I had the corks of all four drawn, put my rod in, and found two gallons were gone from two of them, the other two were full—the master of a vessel has no privilege to break bulk under any circumstances—the beer was in such a state that there was no danger of the casks bursting.</p>

Calvert did not authorize such a step as giving the master of a vessel liberty to take beer from the vessel—I have had fourteen years' experience there in the shipping trade—when beer is shipped to go a long distance, we send a cooper on board to vent it, or else the confined air would burst it—this vessel was only going to Ipswich—I never went there by sea.</p>

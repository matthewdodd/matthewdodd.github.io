                  </hi>. I am a boot maker, of 79, Bethnal Green Road—about 12.30, on the night of 6th April, I was awoke by the police—I went down and examined the shutters—I found the edge of the shutter cut—I had seen it about 11 o'clock, it was not cut then.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 77). I was on duty near Mr. Roach's shop, on the evening of 6th April—I saw the prisoner and two others standing there—the prisoner placed his back against the prosecutor's shutters, when persons passed; and when all was quiet he turned back, and I saw him at work—the inspector came up the street, and the prisoner and another man walked into Old Nicholl Street—I walked up and caught bold of the prisoner—he had a jemmy up his arm, and when I caught him he threw it in the road—I took him to the station, and found this clasp knife on him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I examined the shutters, and found they had been cut recently, and loosened from the bar.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

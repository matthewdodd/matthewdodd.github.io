                  </hi>. I am a traveller, and live at 152, Beresford Street, Walworth—on the afternoon of 3rd May I was at Mr. Barnes', a grocer, in the Kent Road—I there saw a man named Fletcher, who introduced me to James Baldwin, who said that he had a quantity of cochineal, and asked if I could find a purchaser for it—I asked him for a sample—he said that he had not got one—I said, "Can you get me one now?"—he said that he could not, and said, "Do you think I should be fool enough to keep it in my possession?"—I told him I should call next day—I did so and he was out, and the next day and he was out again—I called again on the 6th, and he gave me this sample (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and said that I was to be particular not to show it to anyone, except where there would be a purchaser—I said, "I shall go and offer it to Boor, of Bishopsgate Street"—he said, "For God's sake, do not go there, for it was through his man that three of them were convicted"—I said, "You do not mean to say it is the stolen property from Whitechapel?"—he said, "So help me God, it is "—I afterwards went to his premises, in Falstaff Yard, and saw Storey and Mowitt—I called there about six times, and saw them there about four times—I asked Baldwin the reason these men were always there—he said, "Richard Storey is the one who stole the goods at the first onset"—I went to Southwark Police Court; but they knew nothing of it there—I then went to Leman Street, White<lb></lb>chapel, and gave my evidence—I afterwards acted under the instructions of the police—I met James Baldwin on the 10th—I took with me an apparent purchaser, a friend of Mr. Carrick's—coming over the bridge Baldwin said that he was just the man who would suit him, and he should be able to do a good business with him; and if I succeeded in selling the whole of it, he should be able to put about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year into my pocket—I asked him how much more he had—he said he had not got much more, because he had sold five bags to an oilman in the Goswell Road, at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound; but did not mention the name—I made an appointment to meet him next morning at the Willow Station, Bricklayer's Arms, for the delivery of the cochineal—on Tuesday, the 11th, Baldwin gave me a receipt in advance of the sale of the ten barrels of cochineal, for 138<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., signed, "Bellaney"—the goods were sold on the Monday—he said that he would make it out in a false name, he was not going to sell in his own name—the receipt was for Mr. Gerrard, the supposed purchaser.</p>

                  </hi>. I recollect some men being charged before the Thames Police Magistrate last January—I conducted the prosecution—I examined some person from Boor's, the druggist, to whom some cochineal had been offered—I think he was a messenger, who had formerly been a police-con<lb></lb>stable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Storey's Defence.</hi> On 23rd November, I received twenty-four begs of cochineal from two warehouses, and proceeded 'with them on my route to Fresh Wharf. At six o'clock, having had no dinner or tea, I stopped at a coffee-shop, as I was very faint, and left the boy in charge of the horse and cart. When I returned they were gone. I informed three constables of the loss within a quarter of an hour. One of them sent me to Seething Lane Station, and from there I was sent to Leman Street; they referred me to Mr. Hartley, who had left when I got there. I found him at his friend's house, and he told me that I must go and find it. I went to Leman Street again, and they had not heard of it; then to the City Green Yard; then to Old Street Road, Shadwell, and Bethnal Green police-stations. I stayed out till 12 o'clock in the morning, trying to recover the goods. I arose at 5 o'clock next morning, walked to Deptford, and saw Mr. Hartley, who told me I must go and find it. I walked back in the evening, and told him I had had no success. He took me to Mr. Carriok's office. We went to Leman Street again, and they told me to enrol myself as a kind of amateur detective, to see if I could see the boy who I left in charge of it, and give him in charge. I did as I was ordered on the first day, and continued to do so up to Saturday, when I went to the office about 10.30, and Mr. Carrick gave me in custody. I was taken before the Magistrate on Monday, who said that he saw no evidence against me, but Mr. Young opposed my being admitted to bail. I was afterwards bailed, and surrendered to my own recognisances twice. The case was withdrawn, and that of the other prisoners proceeded with, who were convicted here last January. When I</p>

               <p>asked for my papers, the police would not produce them, because they knew that they were evidence in my favour. Nobody can feel the loss more than I do. I have searched night and day, but because I was unsuccessful they gave me in charge. Three-fourths of the evidence is a tissue of falsehood.</p>

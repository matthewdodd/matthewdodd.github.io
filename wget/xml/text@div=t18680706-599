                  </hi>. I am a debt collector and accountant, of 40, Part Street, Dorset Square—on 19th June, about 9.0 at night, I was crossing Berwick Street, going towards Regent Circus—Howard came and took hold of my chain, and Cooper came behind me and threw me on my back—I missed my watch—my chain was hanging down—the prisoners ran away—I called "Stop thief!" and some parties went after them—I was picked up by the crowd—I found my watch on the ground—I saw the prisoner after<lb></lb>wards at the station, and recognized both.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 10, Foley Street—about 8.30 on this evening, I was walking along Oxford Street, towards Regent Circus, and saw Cooper come behind the prosecutor and catch him by the lees—he fell, and as he fell, Howard caught him and snatched his watch and chain—they then went down a turning—I followed them, and attempted to capture them, and three or four of their friends interrupted me in every possible way—they got into a van, they were brought out from there, I was knocked down, and my lips were cut, by a blow from Cooper—I captured him at last.</p>

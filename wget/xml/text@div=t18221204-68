               <p>MR. ABRAHAM VAN OVER. I live at Nine Elms, Batter-sea. On the 31st of October, between three and four o'clock, I was standing on 'Change, talking to some gentlemen near the centre - my handkerchief was safe a few minutes before. I did not see the prisoner until a gentleman tapped me on the shoulder - he had hold of the prisoner's hand with the handkerchief in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and live in Denmark-terrace, Penton<lb></lb>ville. On the 25th of January, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I met the prisoner in Gray's Inn-lane, and went with her to a public-house at the corner of Baron-street, New-road, Pentonville, near the Angel—we had some gin and water—we did not stop long, and I walked back with her as far as Cromer-street—it was then near two—I found myself minus my handker<lb></lb>chief, and accused her of taking it, and my snuff-box—she then gave me two handkerchiefs—I took my own, and gave her the other, which did not belong to me—I said, "If you have one article, you have the other; you had better return it"—she did not return it—I took her to the station, and told the inspector I had lost a snuff-box, he said he did not think she had it—I in<lb></lb>sisted on her being searched, and it was found on her—that produced is it.</p>

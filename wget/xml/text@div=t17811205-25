               <p>Upon the 17th of August last, as I was coming over London-bridge I was accosted by a person whose name was Smith, he entered into a conversation with me, and asked me where I came from, I told him from Dartford, and he asked if I knew a Mr. Cook of Dartford, that he was a brother psalm finger of his, and he wanted some psalm books of the new version, and asked me if I would not carry that message to him, I told him I would; I said I would call upon him and tell him; he said if you will walk in here, that was the <placeName id="t17811205-25-crimeloc131">Swan, Fish-street-hill</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17811205-25-crimeloc131" type="placeName" value="Swan, Fish-street-hill"></interp>

West then asked me if I had got any notes, I gave no answer; directly Simmonds came in, West asked if he would play any more, he rather refused playing at cards, and said he would toss up for money. West said you should give some chance. I pulled out my notes, thinking to change a small note, and thinking to get some part of my money back again; with that Mr. West gave me his assistance, there was a 10 l. two 20 l. and a 25 l. and West told Simmonds to make the bet good for that sum. West took the notes up and handed them over to Simmonds, and told him to make the bets good for that sum. I was very much confused at that, and told them I did not mean any thing of that kind; West asked Smith if he would be concerned, Smith had a note and West had another, I believe, I rather think they were not bank notes; it was handed over to the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050050"></xptr> and I being much hurried and confused at that kind of behaviour; West asked me to cut the cards, I refused, and I threw them off the table upon the floor, with that West takes up the cards, and cut the cards, and there came up a court card. I then desired them to give me my notes, but West cried double or quit, and there came up another high card; he then cried double or quit again, and that instant the prisoner ran out of the room with the notes followed by Smith; with that West shoved some cards into my hand directly, and said, put them in your breeches or pockets, or any where, and he ran out of the room directly. I being much confused went into the courtyard where the public-house was, and I saw the waiter or landlord, and asked if he had seen any thing of the gentlemen that were in that room; he said no, he had seen nothing at all of them, nor knew nothing at all of them; then I ran into the street myself looking up and down, some person in the street asked me if I was looking after the three men that was in that house, I said yes; says he, they are just shot down Thames-street, running as hard as they can. I did not find them. That the amount of his notes were 75 l. That he afterwards met with Simmonds on Ludgate-hill, and had him secured.</p>
               <p>Upon his Cross-Examination</p>
               <p>It came out that he was to have all above five, and the other all under five. That there was a secret in it, and the cards were made of different lengths, in order to defraud people of their property. And it appeared he had been tricked out of his notes by a gang of sharpers, upon a pretence of this Squire, as they called Smith, having money left him. That he had not told the master of the house of it that he had been robbed; that he was ashamed of having lost it as he had in that company. That he had seen Smith since, but did not offer to take him him up. He owned that he took twenty-eight guineas of them, Mr. Prothero and one Swift, said they would get him 50 l. upon condition he would give them 10 l. He owned he had been sharped out of his money, and told Prothero he had been tricked out of it. That he gave a receipt for 29 l. 8 s. that a person got for him; the receipt was August 8, 1781, received of

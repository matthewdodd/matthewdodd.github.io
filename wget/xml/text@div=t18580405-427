                  </hi>. I am a publisher, of No. 80, Church Lane, White<lb></lb>chapel. On 14th Feb., my daughter called me into the shop about half past 8 o'clock—I saw the prisoner then, she had a shawl over her head, and I could only just see her face—my daughter pointed to a half crown—I bent it in the detector, and sent for a policeman—I told her it was bad—she had 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her hand, which she offered me to pay for the book—a policeman came, and I gave it to him—the prisoner was taken to the station, nothing was found on her, and I said I would not press the charge—I am sure she is the person.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody—on the way to the station I asked her how she accounted for having the half crown; she said that she was a bookbinder, and work being very bad, a gentleman gave it to her to go home with him, and she should know him again—nothing was found on her, and she was discharged—she had no bonnet on, and a shawl was put over her head—I saw her again at the Man<lb></lb>sion House about a fortnight afterwards—I did not hear her speak at first, I was standing behind her, and said, "I think I have a doubt whether she is the woman;" she turned round and said, "No, I am not the woman;" I said, "Iam quite confident now that you are"—I had not the least doubt when I heard her speak, and saw her full face—she was in custody about half an hour on the 14th.</p>

On Tuesday evening, 2d Feb., the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco, and put down this shilling (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I put it in the till—she came next evening and gave me a half crown for some and sugar; it looked rather dark, and I tried it and found it was bad; I told her so, and she said, "Is it?"—I knew her about the neighbourhood for some time, and gave it back to her, and she took it away.</p>

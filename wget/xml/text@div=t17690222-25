Presently I heard a knocking at my door, and a watchman said, Mr. Dale, your house is broke open. I got up immediately, came down, and found my front window was brok open, the iron bar being bent, and the glass of the sash broke. They gave me a hanger, and said, Be careful at entering your kitchen: I went in; there was no body there; and, I believe, no body had been in the house: had I not come down when I did, they would have been in. The prisoner was taken, and I heard him confess before Sir

               <p>Q. As you say, you believe no body had been in the house, was the window so fastened, that a hand must have been put in to unfasten it?</p>
               <p>Dale. The screw of the sash that fastens it down I found was undone, and a hand must be put in to unscrew that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you ascertain that that screw was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220017"></xptr> made fast over night, or the key in on the inside?</p>
               <p>Dale. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>The putting a hand in is as much an entering as walking in at a door. Here not being proof in this particular, the prisoner was <rs id="t17690222-25-verdict149" type="verdictDescription">

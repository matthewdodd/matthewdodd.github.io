On the 28th day a man came and gave me an information; and I applied to the public office in Bow-street, this man had left my service for a day or two; we went in search of him, and at his lodgings we were told he was gone out with his wife; the constable broke open his door, and we found five printed books my property, which I have here; eighteen pawnbroker's duplicates or there abouts, we collected from these pawnbrokers, four table cloths and two silver tea spoons, in consequence of this, I had him taken to the magistrate in Bow-street and committed; the books I swear to be my property, by my hand writing in them, and the table linen will be proved by a servant of mine. These books I produce, has my hand writing in every one of them; I cannot take upon me to say how long I had seen them before in my house, this man had lived with me I believe about three months; I searched his lodgings the day I received the information, the 28th of January, when I took him to Bow-street, he signed a written confession that he had stole these things my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing previously said to him? - Nothing by me, nor by the magistrate, neither promise nor threats; I don't know whether it was read over to him or not; I saw him sign it, and I saw the magistrate sign it; and I witnessed it; I have not a doubt but it was read over to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, of Holloway—on Sunday evening, 15th August, I was passing along St. Paul's Road, Canonbury, and saw the prisoners come from a gateway two or three doors from the prosecutor's house—they went into another gateway, and then to the prosecutor's house—Frost jumped over the railings, as the gate was fastened—I was too far off to see what he did next, but Evans was standing outside—I went up the street, passed the house, and came down the other side and watched behind the bushes—Evans stood there, and when any one came along the same side he gave a low whistle—in about five minutes Frost climbed over the railings, and they went down St. Paul's Place—I followed them—they turned back and kept looking round, and then went back to the procecutor's house—I got a con<lb></lb>stable, and we followed them and found Evans outside—we searched the</p>

               <p>back of the house, and presently the prosecutor returned with his wife and another lady—Evans said that he had been with a friend to see a young lady home—I asked him why he was leaning against the post—he said that he felt rather sick—the prosecutor said "You don't look sick"—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GEOHEGAN</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mrs. Stanley was called at the police-court—she is not here—the prisoners were asked at the police-court whether they would like her to come here, and they said "No"—I heard them say that she gave them permission to go in, and she was called to negative that—they were not represented by Solicitor or Counsel at the police-court—I believe one of them has 10 years' good character—I saw no signs of drink about them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman N</hi> 170). On Sunday evening, 15th August, I was on duty in St. Paul's Road, Canonbury, and accompanied Bilton to No. 23—I saw Evans standing outside, and asked him what he was doing there—he said that he had just left a friend, who accompanied a young lady home—I said "You have no business here now"—he said that he felt sick—I sent Bilton for another constable, and we then examined the premises, and found everything pretty correct back and front—two ladies came up, and went in with us—we went down to the breakfast-parlour—the door was locked—one of the ladies produced the key—we went in, and found Frost lying on a couch—he pretended to be asleep—I asked him what had brought him there—he said "All right, governor; I am out of work; I thought I would come and lie down"—the shutter was broken, and the window down—it was a wooden shutter, with a bar fixed to it, which was uppermost—Mr. Stanley came in by the breakfast-parlour window—Frost said that he got in by Mrs. Stanley's permission; she con<lb></lb>tradicted him—her husband was not then present.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. and Mrs. Stanley did not come up together—nothing was disturbed or taken—the sofa was not next the window, it was on the other side—we walked down the stairs to the breakfast-parlour—I had my usual boots on—I did not turn the handle—the lock turned easily—I know it was locked, because Mrs. Stanley opened it with a large key which she took from her pocket—when we got in we found Frost still lying on the sofa—he did not say at once that Mrs. Stanley gave him permission, not till five or ten minutes afterwards—Mrs. Stanley and the young lady were there, but not Mr. Stanley or Evans—I did not mention at the police-court that Frost said that Mrs. Stanley gave him permission to enter; I forgot it—Mrs. Stanley was called, but not bound over—Frost also said that he had gone in the previous night with Mrs. Stanley to hang up some pictures—I did not mention that at the police-court—I asked Mrs. Stanley about it, and she contradicted it—it was mentioned at the police-court</p>

               <p>by Frost himself—he also said that she invited him to come next day to shake the carpets—that was said in the charge-room, before we went before the Magistrate—Mrs. Stanley is a young lady—there was a carpet down in the breakfast-parlour—the window was not open when I went in—I did not try whether it could be raised up—I mean to tell you that while we went down and while we opened the door Frost lay on the sofa all the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I heard the solicitor request the Magistrate to bind Mrs. Stanley over—Frost said that she told him to come at 11.30 at night to put down the carpets, but that was not in her presence.</p>

On this Sunday evening Bilton fetched me to 23, St. Paul's Road, and I saw Evans detained by a constable at the garden gate—I entered the house by the breakfast-parlour window, which was closed, but I lifted it up—when I got in I found the left shutter was broken off at the hinges, and was lying on the floor—Frost was sitting on the sofa, detained by the constable—I asked what was the matter, and the constable told me—I said to Frost "You hear what the constable says?" and he said, looking at Mrs. Stanley, "She told me to come here between 11.30 and 12 in the morning to take up some carpets and hang some pictures"—the word "morning" was used—I asked him "What time?"—he said "In the morning"—I asked Mrs. Stanley if it was true—she said "I told him he might call on Sunday morning to know whether he was to come on the Monday—I saw this (<hi rend="italic">a short club</hi>) in the room in the prisoner's presence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not make a note of the conversation, there being a very few words—Frost said that he had been there the previous day—I have found out that one of the prisoners has injured his arm, and was an in-patient at the German Hospital, Dalston—they both bear good characters—Frost is in Mr. Fisher's employ, a stationer—no one but Mr. and Mrs. Stanley live in the house that I know of—I have not seen any servants—Mr. Stanley came in just after me—the prisoners were sober.</p>

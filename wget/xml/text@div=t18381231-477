                  </hi>. I conduct the business at the Archers public-house, in Osborn-street, Whitechapel, for Robert Paasmore. The prisoner was waiter there—on the 27th of December I went up stairs, as I required something out of a large chest—I found the chest had been broken open, and the principal part of the contents gone—suspicion fell on the prisoner—I called in a policeman, and desired him to go and open the priaoner's box, where he found a great many things—I have lost wine out of the cellar, also three coats, and a number of other things—the articles found in the prisoner's box are mostly mine, but the rest are-Robert Passmore's.</p>

I am servant at the Archers On Thurs<lb></lb>day morning last I saw the policeman take part of this property out of the prisoner's box—about five weeks ago, I saw a bottle of sherry wine in the prisoner's room; and about three weeks ago I saw two bottles there, with about one glass out of each—I accused the prisoner of it—he first told no he bought it in Leadenhall-street, and paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—he must have taken them out—they are not here now.</p>

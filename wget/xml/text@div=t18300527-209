On the 22nd of May I saw the prisoner take seven bound books from his shelves - he came first and moved them, then came a second time, and took them away; I ran after him, but could not overtake him - I returned to take care of the shop; he was brought back in less than ten minutes - I am sure he is the boy - I saw him twice that day; I had not seen him before; he dropped the books on the shop floor, as I came down stairs - he did not see me: he had carried them about two yards.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What distance were you from him? A. Up stairs, about seven yards off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I went three times, and I went in but once. Witness. No, I did not; he had passed the door three times - he then came in, moved the books, and then took them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the prisoner in Hartshorn-court, about six hundred yards from the prosecutor's - he saw some persons at the bottom of the court, and turned back; a butcher caught hold of him - I came up, and took him; he was about two hundred yards from the prosecutor's when I first saw him; the witness was pursuing him, crying Stop thief! and he was taken in five minutes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

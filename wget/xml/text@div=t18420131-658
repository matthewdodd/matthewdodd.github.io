               <p>28th of December I went home about five o'clock—the prisoner, my wife, and a little boy, named James Brown, were there—the prisoner and my wife were having a few words—she was trying to get him up stairs to bed, as lie was drunk—he said he should not go to bed before he chose, he should go and have some more beer at the public-house—I said, "If you intend to go out any more to-night, you will go for good"—he said, "Never mind, <hi rend="italic">Jack,</hi> you shall suffer as well as me; I will suffer, and you shall suffer, but I will do it"—my wife then arose him from the chair, and led him by the arm into the back-room—he was gone about ten minutes—my wife returned first—I sent the little boy into the room soon after<lb></lb>wards, to see whether he was gone to bed—he slept up stairs—the little boy returned, and said, "Uncle, <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> has got a knife in his hand, and he is coming into the room to you"—the prisoner followed the boy into the room—I did not myself see the knife in his hand—I said to him, "Joe, what have you got in your hand? if you have got a knife in your hand, throw it down"—he said, "What I have got in my hand I mean to give to you"—he rushed on me, as I was sitting in the chair, and stabbed me in my right arm—we both fell together—we had no struggle, no further than he tried to do what he could to me—as soon as I recovered myself, I found myself on the floor, and he was sitting in a chair by the fire—my wife pulled him off me—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe,</hi> if I had been aware of your going into the back-room to fetch a weapon to me, I should have been apt to give you a blow"—at the time I was on the floor, my wife hallooed out, "Fetch a neighbour in"—the little boy went for a neighbour, named Harding, who came in after it was all over—a policeman was sent for—the prisoner remained, till one came and took him away—the wound was in the thick part of the arm, above the elbow, by the side of the muscle—it was a deep cut—it went to the bone—I went directly to the hospital, and had it dressed—I have been there five weeks, and am an out-patient now.</p>

            . I live at No. 25, Whitecross-street, and am a butcher. On the morning of the fire I saw a person go by my window with the tea trays - he appeared to me to have a white fustian jacket on.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it was flowery - A. I cannot say - the man was taller and stouter than the prisoner; I do not think he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not swear the prisoner is not the man - A. No; he seemed to me quite a different man; I did not see his face; I was looking out of the first floor window; there was flower on his shoulder - I know nothing of the prisoner - he found me out somehow.</p>

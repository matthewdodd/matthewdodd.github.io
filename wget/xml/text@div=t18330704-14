            ALLEY. Q. Has the prisoner ever complained of late hours at your house? A. No, I always wished her to go to bed sooner than she wished to go - sometimes people stay there late; a baker named Stevens serves us with bread; we do not send beer to his house, but he sometimes comes to our house and has beer - if the prisoner had served him with any beer that day, she must have drawn it herself; she did not say she had served him with some beer that day, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183307040033"></xptr>taken of him the money which she had in her hand - we have only been a short time in the house; Mrs. Wheeler lived there before us - she gave the prisoner a good character; I stated to the magistrate that I had found the prisoner's hand in the drawer.</p>

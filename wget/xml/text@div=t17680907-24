            . I was sitting drinking a pot of beer upon the keys, I saw two men go up, and Ryan followed them; they had a parcel, I believe it was pimento; they soon came back again, and Ryan went to that apron under the cask with pimento in it; there were six or eight pounds of it when the prisoner was taken.</p>

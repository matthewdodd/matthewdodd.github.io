On the 25th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop, and bought articles amounting to 2 s. 2 d., for which she offered me a 1 l. Bank note; on looking at it I saw it was forged, and immediately told her so. She said she did not know it, but she could change it from where she had it, and wished me to return it. I kept it, and asked her where she got it? I told her it was quite new, and had no writing on it. She said she would not tell me, but she got it honestly; at last she said she got it from a gentleman at No. 13, Seacoal-lane, whom she had picked up in the street, and he took her there, and gave her this pound note that evening. I asked her how she got her livelyhood? she said it was the first time she ever submitted to this, and that she worked as a shoebinder for Mr. Miller, in Skinner-street. She said she went into the front room on the first floor with the gentleman, and he paid 3 s. to the mistress of the house, for the use of the room, in addition to the pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give any other account of herself - A.She said she was married, and her husband's name was Turner, that he was a hackney coachman, and named the number that he drove, which I do not remember. I asked her where she lived? she said at No. 108, Saffron-hill, with her mother, whose name was Adams, and that her name was Adams. I said,</p>
               <p>"You told me you was married to Turner." She said he had deserted her, therefore she went by the name of Adams. I sent for Godfrey, who came, and I told him the note was offered to me, and I was sure it was bad; I gave it to him - the prisoner was close by. Previous to that she had called my wife to the back of the shop, and said she wanted to go into the yard; Godfrey stood at the counter with her - the shop door was open; we have a very strong light in the shop; about a dozen people were collected round the door. A boy rushed into the shop between her and Godfrey, and asked for a pennyworth of something? I said we had not got it, and he went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come in like a customer - A. No. He came in violently, and seemed to try to get between her and the constable. My wife proceeded to search her, but nothing was found on her, except 6 d. While we were searching her, immediately after the boy went out, a mob of fifty or a hundred persons collected, and broke my windows, so that I was obliged to shut up. We sent for several neighbours, and took her to the watch-house; she went quietly, but several of the mob called out,</p>
               <p>"Rescue!" As soon as the mob dispersed, I and the officer took her to Seacoal-lane.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170026"></xptr>We said we came respecting a forged note which the prisoner said she had taken there that night of a gentleman; The woman said,</p>
               <p>"She has not been here, for I have only had a certain number of persons here to night, and I know them all." I said the prisoner said she had been taken into the room on the first floor. The woman said she was positive she had not, and asked her to describe the furniture? she did so, and the woman's answer was,</p>
               <p>"That description would have done very well nine months ago, but it is quite different now" - we waited some time to go into the room, but it was engaged. We took her to Mr. Miller's; the foreman recognized her person, and said he had seen her there some eight or nine months ago, and she had then been in the habit of bringing home work for a person who worked for them, but they knew nothing of her now. I then left her in the custody of Godfrey and another officer, to take her to Saffron-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. When you refused to give the note up, what did you do with it - A. I placed a weight upon it on the counter, and as soon as Godfrey came he marked it; it was never out of my sight till then - I saw him mark it - (looks at one) - this is it. My wife said, in her presence, that she found a memorandum on her. When she was at Seacoal-lane, she began to state the situation of the bed in the room, and said the furniture was a chintz pattern, and such a colour, and that the window-curtains were the same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not send a boy with the note to a neighbour to see if it was good - A. No; I sent him for Godfrey, but the note was not out of my presence until Godfrey came and marked it; he then took it out to ask an opinion on it. The boy never touched the note.</p>

            , No. 108, Saffron-hill" - that she met a gentleman that evening, who took her to No. 13, Seacoal-lane, to the front room on the first floor, and paid 3 s. for the use of the room. She said she was a married woman. The prosecutor then stated that she had wanted to go backwards, and he wished her to be searched. We took her into the parlour, where Mrs. Harwood and I searched her, and found 6 d., with a written address on her.</p>
               <p>Q. Before that did any thing happen - A. While I stood with her at the counter, a boy rushed in in a violent way between me and the prisoner, though we stood very close together, he forced himself through. I suspected from his manner that he came for no good purpose, and put him on the other side of the woman - he asked for a pennyworth of something, Mr. Harwood did not serve him, and he went out. Before I searched her, I took the note out to a friend and shewed it to him - it was never out of my sight. I brought the same note back, and marked it then - I rather think I did not mark it till then - (looks at one) - this is it - it has my mark on it, and is the same note Harwood gave me. I did not give it to any person, nor did the prosecutor - it was not out of my sight till I marked it. After the boy left the shop a mob collected to a very great extent, and when we had nearly searched her I heard some glass break in front of the shop. Some neighbours came in; the prosecutor then shut up, and we took her out. I suspected an attempt to rescue would be made, and requested assistance. We went out of the private door - there was immediately a great groaning and hissing, and the mob pressed round me, but the neighbours came round me. The mob cried Rescue! we at last got her to the watch-house, sent for Worrall, another constable, and then took her to No. 13, Seacoal-lane; I there saw a female, and asked her if she had any knowledge of the prisoner? she looked at her, and said she thought she had seen her at that house. I asked her if she had seen her there that evening? she said she had not. The prisoner said she had been there with a gentleman - the woman persisted that she had not. The prisoner said she had been in the front room one pair of stairs; the woman said she had not been there that evening. I asked her to describe the room, as we could not have access to it - she said she thought she could describe it. I asked her what kind of a looking-glass there was? she said she could not tell. She said it was a fourpost bedstead, with chintz-pattern furniture, rather dark, and the window-curtains corresponded. The woman of the house said that might have been the state of the room sometime back, but now there were light curtains to the window. Finding we could not get access to the room we came away, and then took her to Miller's; she went in with great reluctance, I forced her in. Mr. Miller said he did not know her. A young man there looked at her, and after sometime seemed to recollect her - that she used to bring home work eight or nine months back, but he knew nothing of her now. She endeavoured to make herself known to him, by stating who she brought the work from - he then recollected her, and said it was eight or nine months back - we took her to the Compter. I went to Saffron-hill myself next morning, into the garret, as she said her mother lived in the garret. I found nobody at home in the garret, I then came down to the bottom of the house - it is a green-shop. I asked the man if he knew Adams? he said there was a woman of that name in the house, who had a daughter, but he thought she did not live with her mother, but she came backwards and forwards occasionally. The house is let out in tenements.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not the note handed to several persons, and compared with two or three more - A. No, it was not - one note was taken from the till and compared with it; it was an older note than that, I had them both in my hand at the time. She did not ask me to go to Seacoal-lane, I suggested it. The note was not out of my sight till I marked it.</p>

            . I am servant at No. 13, Seacoal-lane, and remember the officers and the prosecutor, bringing the prisoner to our house, between eight and nine o'clock, I think. The prisoner had not been at the house that evening, nor in the front room up one pair of stairs. She attempted to describe the furniture of the room - she at first said it was white, then she said,</p>
               <p>"I mean to say a white counterpane, and that the bed furniture was dark chintz, and the curtains the same." The furniture is a dark chintz-pattern, but the window curtains are a leopard-pattern, and quite light. About nine months ago they were nearly alike, any one might have made a mistake then, but they cannot now. I am certain she was not there that night. The room was engaged when they came. There is another servant, but I am the only one who receives the company, and shew them up stairs. I am certain I saw all the company that had been there that evening - I think there had been only four people. The persons who were in that room had been there from half-past five o'clock, and nobody but them had been in that room that day. The prisoner said she had been there at four o'clock, then she said it was after five, and then, that it was just before she went to Harwood's. She said there was no glass in the room, which there was. I think I saw her at the house some months ago.</p>

She worked in the name of Nickling, or Nickley.</p>

            . I live at No. 108, Saffron-hill, which is let out in tenements. I have every reason to believe the prisoner lives there, by her coming in and going out at night. Her mother's name is Adams. She generally came in at night, when I was abed, but we knew her footstep. I have only lived there four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any interval during those four months when you did not see her - A. No, I used to see her almost every morning, or two or three times every week.</p>

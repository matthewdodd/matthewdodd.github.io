                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Angel-lane, Stratford. The deceased William Beech was my son—on the 16th of Aug., near eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the marshes, near Temple mills, and saw the prisoner second Charles Gilson, in fighting with my son—I do not know how it began—they had had a fight the day before, and also that morning—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230196"></xptr>
               <p>I first saw them in the evening, they were going down the marshes, and a great many people with them, to see them fight—I followed—I tried to pre<lb></lb>vent their fighting in the morning, and so I did in the evening, but could not—my son was past my jurisdiction—he told me if he did not fight, he should be called a coward—he was turned twenty years of age—I saw them fighting, and saw my son get weak—Slennet said to Gilson, "Now is your time; give it him; follow him up"—after that, Gilson hit him on the side of the head, knocked him down, and fell on him—my son became stupid, and did not speak any more—he only groaned—he died at half-past eleven o'clock at night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Stratford. I saw the de<lb></lb>ceased about half-past ten o'clock on the 16th of Aug.—he was quite insen<lb></lb>sible, and breathing with great difficulty—I bled him, but it did not relieve him—he died about three quarters of an hour after—his death was caused by extravasated blood on the brain—I opened the head thirty-six hours after the death—there was a blow externally on the left side of the head—it seemed a violent blow, and in my judgment was the cause of his death.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the fight, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening. The prisoner was taking part in it; at least I think it was him; but there are two brothers, so alike, that I could not swear it was him—the parties were quite agreeable to fight, and there was nothing unfair in it—it did not last longer than ten or fifteen minutes—I think the injury the de<lb></lb>ceased received was principally through falls—there were not many very severe blows—he had a very severe fall or two backwards, in the struggle, and he fell undermost.</p>

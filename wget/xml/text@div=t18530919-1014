                  </hi>. I know the prisoner. I was present on the 21st Oct., 1850, when he was married at St. Philip's Church, Bethnal Green, to Susanna Miller—I was a witness to the marriage, and signed the paper—they lived together after the marriage till last March—I then lost sight of them—his wife is now alive.</p>

                  </hi>. In Jan. last I was a widow, living in Wright's-row, St. George's in the East. I became acquainted with the prisoner in Jan. last—he was wearing a deep hatband at the time—he said he was a widower, with two children—he afterwards stated that he had been living with his deceased wife's sister, and that the two children were illegitimate—I continued my acquaintance with him till Aug.—on the 25th Aug. I was married to him at St. Mark's Church, Mary-street, Whitechapel—I lived with him afterwards as his wife till the 6th of this present month—in consequence of something I heard that evening, I went to a public house; I there saw a woman who claimed him as her husband—I told her he bad married me, and if she would be quiet I would give her a proper explanation—we had a proper explanation—she was very angry—the prisoner denied that she was his wife, and he wished to go home with me that night—I told him I could not allow it, while this woman claimed him as her husband—he went away, and I saw him no more till I gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was at work in Liverpool; she sent for me, and told me if I wished to come to London she would send me money to come, and she put up the banns herself in London, and sent me word that if I could not work her business would keep me, and it did not matter if I got a place if it was not so good wages; I had no money to be married with; she sent me money, and paid for it; she lived near where my wife lived when I went away; it would not have taken two minutes to have gone and inquired; she is not like a young girl that had never been married before; I was not aware that my wife was living.</p>

On Sunday night, at half-past ten o'clock, I was coming across the water to Greenwich in a boat—I saw the prisoner sculling a boat—he said he would give me threepence to take him on shore—he had not strength enough to scull the boat—I took him to the stairs, and then he said he would give me sixpence to take the boat on board—I said, "Where are you going?"—he said, "I am going to the Captain"—he changed half-a-crown, and gave me a shilling—I was going to give him threepence—he went away, and left me the shilling and the boat—I took the boat on board.</p>

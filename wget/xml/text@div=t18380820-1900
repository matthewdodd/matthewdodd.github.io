                  </hi>. I live in Barnsbury-road, Islington, and am a green-grocer. On Saturday, the 11th of August, about noon, I met the prisoners at a public-house, and went to the Merlin's Cave, Rosoman-street-about two or three o'clock in the afternoon I was in a public-house in Exmouth-street—I was sober enough to know that I had some money—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., a sovereign, a half-crown, and several shillings—I was awoke at nine o'clock in the evening, and missed it—it was not in a purse—I was then in Merlin's Cave—the prisoners, and a man named Underwood, were with me in Exmouth-street.</p>

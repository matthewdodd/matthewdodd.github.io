            , Esq.; he had a ewe sheep which died of disease on the 26th of December - it had been under my care; I skinned it on the 27th, and hung it in an open shed - about ten o'clock the same night James Peet called me up, and asked if I had left a sheep in the shed - I said I had; I did not go out, but told him to take case of the sheep till the morning - I had cut off the feet, and taken the entrails out; I knew the prisoner before.</p>

I was returning home that night, and heard some one coming along; I concealed myself, and saw the prisoner coming up with the carcase of a dead sheep on his back; he threw it over some palings where I was - I went, and took him; I put the carcase on my father's premises for that night - the prisoner said he got it from an open shed of Mr. Paris'; he appeared intoxicated, and made no resistance - I knew him before.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner at Cock-Forster, where he was drinking at a public-house, about six o'clock on the 20th of December - I believe he had been in the habit of sleeping in Mr. Paris' shed - the prisoner said he was going to take the sheep to hang against the constable's door, at Enfield, because he had used him very ill once, but he was tipsy or he would not have done it.</p>

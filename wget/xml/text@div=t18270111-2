On the 31st of December, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was in the parlour adjoining the surgery, and heard a weight fall off the lock of the door - we had placed it there to give an alarm when any one entered; the door was shut, and the catch had fastened; I did not hear the door open, but heard the weight fall; I immediately went into the shop, which is part of the dwelling-house, and missed my hat and gloves. I found the door open. I went out, and saw the prisoner turning the corner about thirty yards off, with a hat in his hand; I followed him across Nutford-place - I had lost sight of him for about a minute and a half, when he turned the corner - nobody else was near; I went directly to the corner, and saw him cross Nutford-place into Little Queen-street - he had still got the hat, and is the same person; I followed him across Great Queen-street into Newland-street - I called Stop thief! there - two other persons were standing a few doors down the street; they made no attempt to follow him, and about fifty yards before I caught him he threw the hat away - I still followed; he ran right against a dead wall, stopped short, and turned round towards me, walking, and I collared him - I am quite positive he is the person; I asked what he had done with the hat which he had taken from the shop - he denied all knowledge of it; I called to Poole, the watchman, who took him - a person brought me my hat and gloves immediately after I took him. When we got to the watch-house he said he was sick - we said it was no such thing; he then said, "I am not sick - I am drunk," but he was not so. I returned home, and missed my great coat from the same seat the hat was taken from - I have not found that. I saw nobody but him when I first went into the street. I went to the shop about three minutes after I heard the weight fall.</p>

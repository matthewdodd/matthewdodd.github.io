On Saturday evening, the 18th of January, a little after five o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and pointed to two gold rings, which he wanted to see - I shewed them to him; I stood by him all the time - my mother was in the shop. The price, 12 s. 6 d. was marked on them each. He offered 10 s. for one; my mother refused to take it, and after asking for other things, he put one on his finger, and had the other in his hand, and then went out of the shop; I pursued, calling Stop thief! and only lost sight of him for a moment, while he turned the corner into the pig-market - my father was crossing the market, and stopped him. They have not been found. I am certain he had them.</p>

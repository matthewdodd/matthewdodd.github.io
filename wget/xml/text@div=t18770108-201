I am the wife of William Woodrough, a labourer, of 8, Lower Road, Durham Hill; we have lived there five years—the prisoner lived at No. 11—at the end of August last, I was present when this child of her's was born, she had no baby linen ready for it, and I lent her some of mine for three weeks; I then took it away as she was a great deal better able to obtain baby linen than I was—I saw the baby, it was a plump healthy child, and I have since seen it, sometimes three times a week, I have seen her nursing it sometimes, I have never seen her feeding it, but I have seen her wet nursing it, she was very well able to do so, I saw the baby from week to week, but it grew worse, she told me sometimes that it would not wet nurse, and she had to feed it—it was sometimes wrapped up in an old coat belonging to its father, but it had no petticoats, and I do not think it was ever properly cleaned or washed since the day it was born—it was not properly wrapped up when I saw it—I have very often seen her drunk, between the end of August and December, I live close to her, I cannot say whether she was often away from home—on Thursday, 14th December, I saw her go out at 10 o'clock in the morning, and she staid away until 7 o'clock in the evening—about 12.30 that morning, I saw her husband walking up and down with the baby which was crying, and he was crying too—I said "What on earth is the matter?" and took the baby from him and nursed it—it seemed very hungry, I then went and fetched Mrs. Richards—I saw the prisoner come home at 7 o'clock and spoke to her; I said she ought to be ashamed of herself being away from the baby all day, she told me to mind my own business—the child only had a little gown on that day, and the father's old handkerchief round its neck.</p>

I am a widow, of 6, Durham Hill—I have known the prisoner about four years—I remember her last child being born, about the beginning of September, and next morning I went to the house and saw the child; it was a very healthy, strong, full-born baby, a beautiful creature—shortly after that I went hopping for three weeks, and a week afterwards I went to see the prisoner—the baby was then in a very low condition, dirty and filthy and starved—I asked the prisoner if she fed the baby, and she told me to mind my own business—it had no clothing, it had only an old coat—about the beginning of December I was passing the prisoner's house again and heard the baby crying very bitterly—that was about 10 o'clock in the morning—I went into the house and the prisoner was lying drunk on the head of the table; I spoke to her and shook her, but got no reply—the baby was lying in a corner, either on a chair or on the floor</p>

I am relieving officer, of the Dover Union—the prisoner's husband had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week relief on 2nd December, and 65. on the 9th—that was discontinued on account of this case coming to the notice of the guardians—an offer was made on Saturday, 16th December, for the workhouse, for the whole family or any of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "Well, gentlemen, I am very sorry it has happened, and I have never starved my child; I own to neglecting it and not dressing it as it ought to be, and as to being out I only left my child one day, and I haven't been out on a Saturday night, more than three or four times since the child has been born, and then I have not stayed more than an hour or an hour and a half. My husband has sent the children for the grocery, and I have gone on a Sunday morning for the meat; the only time I ever left my child was on that Thursday, and then I shouldn't have stayed so long only I thought my husband would have given the child a little food; I am given to drink at times, but I am not half so bad as they make out."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner produced a written defence, stating that she was not guilty of Starving the child although she had neglected it, and had not provided sufficient clothing for it; that at the time it was born she had everything ready for it hi a gown, which Mrs. Woodruff lent her; that Mrs. Duff came to nurse her and got drunk constantly with brandy which she purchased by taking money from the till, and had taken a dislike to Mr. Bishop, when he found her out, which she now vented upon the prisoner; and that four of the female witnesses were the worst women in Dover, and turned against her when there were no more clothes to pawn for drink; that she saw Mrs. Biggins nearly drunk with her baby, and called a policeman who made her give the child up, that she had been drinking off and on for four months, and had no milk for the child, but that she was not drunk on the night she let it fall, but to weak to turn it over, drink having taken away all her strength; and that her imprisonment would kill her husband who is seventy years of age.</hi>

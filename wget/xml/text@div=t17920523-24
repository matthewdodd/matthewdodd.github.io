Mrs. Ironsides was in the shop; I don't know what she is; I have heard that she is a mantua-maker, and that she has kept gen-men's houses.</p>

Mrs. Ironsides was in the shop at the time of this robbery; Mrs. Ironsides lives, I believe, in Charlotte-street; the narrow white ribbon was not on a roller; I have had the possession of them ever since; they were taken before Sir

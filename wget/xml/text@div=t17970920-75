             sworn. - On the 18th of July last, I lost some pieces of iron; the prisoner worked for me; as I was sitting at the Marquis of Granby, in Winslow-street, Oxford-street, I saw him coming out of my yard with his hands in his pockets, and he appeared in some measure agitated, in consequence of which I concluded he had something about him that did not belong to him;

             and I followed him till he got to an iron shop opposite St. Giles's church; I went into the shop, and found him in the act of putting iron into the scale; I seized him, and asked him if he was not a villain to treat me in this manner, after the manner in which I had treated him; he said, he was very sorry for what he had done, and continued employing his pockets; I desired Peckham to tie up the iron, and I took the prisoner to Bow-street, and there a man of the name of Taylor searched him, and found some trifling pieces of iron upon him; the woman denied having bought it; she said, it was offered to her, and put into the scale, but she had not bought it.</p>
               <p>JOHN PECKHAM sworn. - I saw the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's yard, having something apparently more than he ought to have; we followed him to an old iron shop, opposite St. Giles's church, where we found him putting it in the scale.

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him an excellent character.</p>

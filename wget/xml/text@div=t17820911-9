               <p>I am a pawn-broker in Broad Sanctuary, Westminster. I have the prosecutor's gold watch, which I received from the prisoner Claddenboul, he brought it the same morning about 8, and offered to pledge it for a guinea and a half; he offered it as a metal watch, I suspected him; he said first he had had it about a year and an half; afterwards he said about six weeks. I asked him who his Serjeant was, he was in a military frock dress; he said one Macmillan, in Stretton-Ground; I sent, and there was no such man, he was gone abroad. I asked him how he came by the watch, and whose it was; he said it was left him by an uncle at Canterbury; he said it was brought him up by a Captain of Horse; I asked him to produce that person; he said he would write to him. I was still dissatisfied; he then went and brought the other prisoner Taylor. I asked Taylor if he knew this man, he said he used his house, he kept the Duck, in Duck-lane; he said he knew Claddenboul had a watch, he had frequently left it in his care, and that he had at times lent him money on it. I said this watch is gold; he says it is metal; says Taylor, I always understood it was metal. I would not part with the watch, and I went to Bow-street, soon after the prosecutor came to give information of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178209110016"></xptr> the loss of his watch, and he swore to it there. The prosecutor went home with me, and the people from Bow-street went to Taylor's, and he pointed out Claddenboul. I was not present when he was taken, but my young man was, the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>(The watch shewn to the prosecutor, and deposed to by him, only a gold seal taken off.)</p>

               <p>Taylor spoke very diffidently of this prisoner when you spoke to him? - He said he used his house.</p>

               <p>We went down to Westminster to look after Claddenboul; I applied to prisoner Taylor for Claddenboul, and he gave me every assistance about it. I told him it was the soldier he had been to the pawn-broker's about; he sent out a man, and the man returned back and told us where he was. I asked him to go with us to shew us the man, and he did, we took him; we desired Taylor to come with us, and he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Then Taylor was in no shape backward to shew you the man? - He gave us every assistance in his power.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing of blue in the prisoner's dress? - No.</p>

               <p>I came off guard on Wednesday, and went to bed about 3 in the afternoon, and never got up till 5 next morning. I went to work, going through Westminster-Abbey, I met two soldiers, they asked me to drink, and then asked me if I knew of any place where they could dispose of a watch, I said no. I asked a woman of the town, she recommended to the prisoner Taylor's; they sent me to sell the watch, I offered it to Taylor, he looked at it and tryed it with aqua-fortis; he said he would give but a guinea. I came back and told the men; they said they would sooner pawn it; I took it to pawn, and then the gentleman stopped the watch but not me. I did not know what to say, I recollected in my own mind that the watch certainly must be stolen; Taylor said if they would let him have the watch for two guineas he would go and get it, and say it was mine, and that he had known me to have it a year. I never saw the soldiers after, they belonged to a marching regiment; but as I am no scholar, I could not tell the number on their buttons, they said they would satisfy me. I did not think of any thing of this kind, I sent for my Serjeant, but he is not come.</p>

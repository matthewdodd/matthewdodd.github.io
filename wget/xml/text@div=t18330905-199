I purchased the chest of tea stated in the indictment, at the June tea sale; it stands in my list in the third class, and is described by the Company's tea tasters, as middling Congon - I had it at 2s. 2d. and the duty is the same, which made it 4s. 4d. per lb.; it was left in the warehouse as is usual till it is wanted, and I had never made out any order at any time for its being delivered - about the 12th or 13th August, I heard it was gone I then missed it from my warrant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you know that there is such a thing as smuggled tea? A. I have heard there is - if tea is exported we do not pay the duty; if a person were to take tea to the opposite side of the channel and smuggle it back, he could have it without the duty - I had paid the duty for this; it was a lot of nine I had paid for; this chest was No. 677 by the Edinboro; that number was marked on the chest; I did not pay the duty on this chest myself, but my clerk did; I have no partner - I know Collins, he keeps a store shop and deals in very thing - I think it is likely that he deals in tea as well as other things, though I have no knowledge of it; I never heard that the prisoner was his servant - I have no recollection of hearing that before the Lord Mayor; I will not swear that it was not distinctly stated as the ground of the prisoner's defence that he was the servant of Collins - I preferred a bill against Collins on the evidence of Thompson, a servant of mine, who had been robbing me; the Lord Mayor sent him to the Compter - as soon as I missed the tea, I inquired of Thompson, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183309050125"></xptr>he made a statement, on which I admitted him as evidence; I preferred a bill against Collins, which was thrown out by the Grand Jury - I had not seen Collins after I was at the Mansion-house; he has not been at my house nor I at his; I have no knowledge of his being a man of property - I never heard any intimation that money was no object; I never heard a sum of 150l. mentioned.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you generally have possession of your tea warrants? A. Yes, every night; on the 5th of August, I delivered this warrant to Thompson; he had to clear with the warrant; the other eight chests had all been permitted, and sent to different persons in the country before that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If I understand you right, he had been entrusted with the warrant from time to time, which would authorize the clearing of nine chests, and to your knowledge he had only cleared eight? A. Yes, he took the warrant to the India-house, to clear those chests we had occasion for - there is no mark made on the warrant as to what was to be cleared, that is done on paper called a request paper; I gave no request paper for this chest, but Thompson could do that himself - I have never seen the warrant again; it becomes waste paper after the last chest is cleared.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever ask for it? A. I asked Thompson for it, and made every search for it in every way; they are sometimes left at the India-house - I have not been able to get it.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see the chest in possession of the prisoner? A. No, I saw it placed on the knot of a porter, to carry it out - I stole the chest of tea - I don't know whether the duty was paid or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known Collins? A. I had seen him, and spoken with him - I don't know that the prisoner was his servant - Collins keeps a marine store shop - I had sold a chest of tea to Collins before of my master's - he keeps a shop for the sale of grocery, and all sorts of necessaries for persons going abroad.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You sold to the prisoner as an agent of Collins? A. Yes, and I received the money for this tea of Collins - my cousin took me to the prisoner, and I knew that I was going to deal with a person on behalf of Collins - it went to a person named Taylor in the Borough.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you remember how many chests were on the warrant for that day? A. Only one was then remaining, I had cleared the other eight at different times before- I could get at the warrants before Mr. Nicholson came to town - Collins paid me on my taking a letter from the prisoner about two hours after I sold it.</p>

            . I am a labourer. On the 5th of August I was employed by the prisoner to carry a chest of tea to Mrs. Taylor in the Borough - I took it, and she refused to take it in; I brought it out of the house, to look for another person of the name of Taylor, and the prisoner came to me and said, "Take it on to my house;" he went with me, and showed me where his house was, in Great Suffolk-street; I took it there, and carried it up one pair of stairs - I don't recollect the marks on the chest, but it was a chest of congon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you known the prisoner before? A. Yes, I knew him in a respectable line of business - I found there was some mistake when I got the chest to Mrs. Taylor's; he went into Mrs. Taylor's house, and had some conversation with her, and then he came out and said, "Take it on to my house" - it was between twelve and one o'clock in the day - I carried it on my knot - and the permit was in my pocket, which I gave to the prisoner when I got to his house - Collins' house is No. 8, East Smithfield - the prisoner's house was nearer to Mrs. Taylor's than Collins'.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the prisoner go with you to get the tea? A. He stood outside the gateway while I went into the warehouse in Crutched-friars for it - he said he should go with me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did any one go up the yard? A. No; I did not see any one that had any control over it; I took it by the permit which I got from the prisoner - I saw no warrant on it - I saw Thompson, but he did not say anything to me about it; I took it to Stone's from Mr. Taylor's, and the next day I took a chest away from Stones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who paid you for carrying the chest? A. Thompson paid me directly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say when he paid you? A. He met me at the gate and said, "Here is the money for carrying this tea," and he gave me a shilling, which was the proper porterage to the Borough.</p>

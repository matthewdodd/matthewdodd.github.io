                  </hi>. I keep the Salisbury Arms, Bear Street, Leicester Square. On Tuesday morning, 28th July, about 3 o'clock, some persons came to my house with two females—I had closed the house, but they knocked, and I let in Jones and Gough—there were also two men, who are not in custody—they were the only four customers in the house—they drank to the amount of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked for payment, a watch was tendered to me, and I was asked to lend 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I did, and took the watch—I had seen Gough several times before—they remained till about half past 5 o'clock; I then missed one of them, and was seized from behind by an arm round my throat—they then all rushed round, seized me, and rifled my pockets—I had got two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, nine sovereigns, and a lot of silver—with what I picked up, I had 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. remaining; I lost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the watch, upon which I had lent them 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—all the four men took part in it—I noticed Gough and Jones at the time it was going on, but should not like to swear to Liversage—I have an indistinct recollection of seeing him just at the time I was attacked—I became insensible—I struggled very much, and broke a great quantity of glasses—I heard one of them say, "Give it him tighter;" and when I recovered, I found myself in a pool of blood behind the bar—I got up, and sent for a policeman.</p>

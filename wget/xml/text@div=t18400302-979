                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Skilton's-lane, Green<lb></lb>wich. On Friday, the 28th of February, in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop with a silver tea-spoon—he laid it on the counter—I was busy at the time, having no one else in the shop—I suspected it was stolen—I took it up, looked at it, and was not able to make out the initials—the prisoner said, "It is old silver"—I said, "I suppose you want to sell it then?"—he said "Yes"—I asked his name—he said, "Smith, my mother sent me with the spoon, and the name of Smith is on it"—I put it on one side a little time, went to the door, and called an officer—I then told the prisoner I thought he had either found or stolen the spoon—he said he had found it on Deptford-bridge—I said the spoon appeared to have been used where there was a family—it seemed to have been bit—I asked him on which side the initials of "Smith" were—he said, "On the back"—it was "W. S." on it, which I believe are the initials of the person—I said it was Mr. Benjamin Smith's, the proprietor of the wharf—he said it was not, and I gave him in charge—he said afterwards his name was Robert Elliott.</p>

I was called into the shop—the prisoner was having some conversation with Mr. Dowson—I asked him his name, and he said, "Smith"—that his mother's name was Smith—I asked where he worked—he said, for Mr. Smith, at Deptford-bridge—I said, "How do you account for the spoon?"—he said he had found it on Deptford-bridge—I took him into custody, and received the spoon from Mr. Dowson.</p>

I know the prisoner—he is employed by my master to do any thing about the wharf—he comes into the kitchen sometimes—I had left a spoon on a mangle in the kitchen—this is Mr. Smith's spoon—I cannot swear he took it off the mangle—I left it there, and lost it—he was in and out of the kitchen on the day in question.</p>

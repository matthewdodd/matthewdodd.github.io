               <p>I came from High Wickham to see after a place; I was disappointed of the place, and did not know where to go for a lodging; I met a young man in the street, who took me to a public house, and asked the landlord if I could lodge there; he said, no, his house was full; the prisoner and another woman came in; she said she could lodge me; I went home with her, and went to bed; I told her I was not able to give her any money, I would give her my handkerchief I had on my neck; I pulled off my things and laid them by my bedside; when I waked in the morning I missed my waistcoat, my hatband, and also a knife out of my pocket; there were some women there in the morning; they laughed at me; I saw the prisoner at the door about two hours after, and took her up.</p>

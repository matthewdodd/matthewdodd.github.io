                  </hi>. I keep the Fox public-house, Fox's-lane, Shadwell. On the 30th of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in, with two other people, and soon after they drank together—the prisoner called first for a pot of beer—Mrs. Feather refused to serve him, because he was drunk—the other two men followed him, and had a pot of beer—they drank it, and then went out; and the prisoner came to the bar, and abused Mrs. Feather for not serving him, and said he would serve her out for it—I went to the bar and pushed him out—he had a rough coat on, and a pot fell from him, which I did not identify; but when he got out another fell from him—I took out my knife and marked it, and can identify it—the other two men, who were coal-heavers, came back, and insisted on my letting the man go, and I let the prisoner go—he was afterwards taken—I have heard that when the prisoner gets a little drink he is rather deranged, so that I would not wish to be hard with him.</p>

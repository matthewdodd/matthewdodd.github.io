                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Hearing this hat was taken, I met the prisoner, about half past one o'clock, in Westend-lane, Hampstead, with he hat tied in a handkerchief under his arm—I asked him what he had got—he said, "A hat"—I said, "Where did you get it?"—he said he found it on the side of the road—I asked him where he had been since eleven o'clock at night, when I had seen him—he said he was lying asleep on the side of the road—but I know that was false, as I had gone down the road six times—on the way to the station-house he asked me to let him ease himself, which he did; and when the buttoned his breeches up, he made a start and ran away—I ran and caught him, and he tried to slip out of his jacket to get off again—I then knocked him down, and had him secured—I found him about a hundred and fifty yards from the public-house—he had a hat on his head besides.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I had been playing at bowls, and got a good deal of beer—I sat down to rest, and fell asleep on the road side, when I awoke I was very cold, and thought I would go to the house and ask for a bed for the night—the publican was in bed, and as I came back again, the hat was on the road side—I took it up, and met the policeman, who asked what I had there—I said, "I found it on the road side."</p>

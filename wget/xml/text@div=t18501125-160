                  </hi>. I reside at Thornton-hall, near Bedale, in Yorkshire; I was in the eleventh batallion of Artillery. Hart was my servant six weeks—I left the regiment, I left Woolwich, at the end of Aug.—I remained a short time in London, and then went to Thornton-hall—before leaving, I told Hart to look after my baggage—I after<lb></lb>wards wrote this letter to him, and I received this reply (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—to the best of my belief, this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)letter is Hart's writing; I never saw him write—I never received the property I had left behind me—it was never sent to me in Yorkshire, and, in consequence, I wrote to Captain Cannon—my property consisted of a chest of drawers, containing clothes, a gun and case, a pistol, saddle, a portmanteau and trunk, a carpet bag, some arm-chairs, and furniture of all descriptions, worth about 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe this letter to be Hart's writing, in consequence of the answers it gives, I cannot conceive how anybody else could have written it—I never sent any servant from the Euston Hotel, to Hart for the things, and I never gave any servant of mine an order to Hart to deliver the things—all the orders I gave are contained in that letter of 21st.</p>

                  </hi>. I am quarter-master-sergeant of the 11th battalion of Artillery, at Woolwich. Hart was a gunner and driver in that battalion—I remember Captain Dodsworth leaving about 30th Aug., and I received directions to place his baggage in the store, of which I have the control—I received the packages, consisting of three large boxes, a plain deal case, a gun-case, a bag, and other packages—they remained in my possession till 2nd Oct., when I delivered them to Hart, who said he was going to send them to Captain Dodsworth, in the country—he said he was going to take them to his own house, and I lent him a hand-cart for that purpose</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250174"></xptr>
               <p>—on the 12th I heard that Captain Dodsworth had not received the baggage—I went and found Hart in the barracks, and told him Captain Cannon wanted to see him—he went with me to the captain, who asked him what he had done with the baggage—he said Captain Dodsworth's servant had called for it on the previous Tuesday; that was 8th Oct., with a light van, and taken it away with him to London—he was asked if he knew him to be Captain Dodsworth's servant—he said he did not know him; that he had brought a note from Captain Dodsworth, desiring the bag<lb></lb>gage might be given up to him; that Captain Dodsworth was residing at the time at an hotel in Euston-square—Captain Cannon asked him whether he knew the man—he said he thought he should know him—Captain Cannon said to me, in Hart's hearing, perhaps the baggage might be deposited at the hotel in Euston-square at that time, as it was as short a time, and directed me to write to the landlord of the Victoria Tavern—I did so, and received an answer—Captain Cannon asked Hart if he knew Captain Dodsworth's writing, and if he believed the note to be in his writing—he said he believed it was his writing; and the man gave such a description of the difficulties under which Mr. Dodsworth was labouring, that he had no doubt it was right—Captain Cannon asked him what had become of the letter—he said he could not tell; it must have been torn up by the children, or the man must have taken it away that took the baggage away—he said he followed the man with the things some distance, to see whether he would take them by railway or water to London; but it being near his stable-hour, he was obliged to leave, and go to duty.</p>

Thornton-hall, near Bedale, Yorkshire—"I shall be obliged if you will send all my things off as soon as possible, directed to me as above—I give you all my things, such as silver spoons, crockery, &amp;c, which you packed up in the hamper —I shall only want all the boxes, tin boxes, gun-case, and carpet bag—you had better put my cloak in the sofa-box—I will give you my regi<lb></lb>mental frock coat, trowsers, and such things that I last wore, and left at the hotel—I will also give you the dog <hi rend="italic">Skie,</hi> but the other one,<hi rend="italic">Sailor,</hi> you must send with a ticket round his neck—the other dog you may sell or do what you like with—I also give you my tub and all the crockery in it, but I am afraid there is nothing worth having—send the baggage by train, to be left at Seeming station; write when you send them. I sincerely hope you will remember what I am about to say, which is, to be steady, and I have no doubt you will get on—you have my best wishes for your welfare and happiness in this world, and believe me yours truly,—M.

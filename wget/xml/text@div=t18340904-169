               <p>RICHARD JOHN COX WHITE. I live in Spencer-street, Clerkenwell, and had a warehouse in <placeName id="t18340904-169-crimeloc948">Addle-street</placeName>

The prisoner was in my employ - on the 10th of May, I went to Croydon, in the afternoon, leaving the prisoner at Addle-street, and directing him to come to my house, in Spencer-street, the next morning - on Monday morning, I went to my warehouse in Addle-street - I missed two coats, a waistcoat, and a leather hat-box - they had been safe when I left the prisoner there on the Saturday, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183409040088"></xptr>found the prisoner's jacket on the counter - he should have come to me on the Sunday morning to have received his wages, but he did not come - he should have slept at Addle-street, but he was gone - no one but him and myself had access to the premises.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long had the coats been there? A. They were there when I left on the Saturday - I remember going to see the Trades' Unions walk - I had not one of those coats on that day - I was arrested on a disputed account - you did not get bail, my lawyer got it - you went to Mile-end-road - you left the key of the warehouse with my mother, but that was a fortnight before - I do not know any thing of Mrs. Stevens and another woman ransacking the warehouse.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were you arrested? A. On the 2nd of May, and I was bailed on the 3rd - I swear these articles were in my warehouse on the 10th.</p>

             (police-sergeant C 8). The prisoner was brought to our office on the 18th of June, about one o'clock in the morning - the officer stated he had given himself up, as there was a charge against him, but he was quite innocent - the next morning he said he was not innocent, he meant to retract what he had said, and he should plead guilty - he said one coat was a Petersham, which he had given to a friend - he had not pawned it.</p>

             (police-constable G 106). The prisoner gave himself up to me - he asked if there was not a black mark against one named Shepherd - I said, not that I knew of - he said, "Yes; there is - I am that Shepherd, I do'nt say that I have robbed my master; but I am down" - the next morning he said he should plead guilty, and he had given one coat to a friend - he did not say in my presence what coat it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About the latter end of February, I went to live with this Mr. White - about the latter end of March he told me he was going to run away, and asked me to assist him - I told him I would, if it would not put a blemish on my character - I assisted in taking his things - he was then a hatter and furrier - he asked if I would have any objection to go about and sell his caps; and I took some to Mr. Saunders in Ratcliff-highway, and sold 26l. worth - he never gave me one farthing for it - he then went into the country, and while he was gone I had a quarrel with his mother, and I said I would go away - when he came back he said, what was I going to leave for - I said I should, and I did.</p>
               <p>MR. WHITE re-examined. Q. Did he tell you he should go away? A. No; my mother and him had some words while I was away, but that was passed over - there was 4s. due to him when he left.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Bartlett, a pork butcher, of Fleet-street, gave the prisoner a good character, and engaged to employ him.)</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was it not in consequence of some conversation between Donovan and the prisoner that you were induced to call upon him to make these purchases? A. Yes, it was, but he was no spy - he was not employed to let me know where counterfeit coin was sold, that I might get the money for prosecuting - the prisoner spoke to me after he had spoken to Donovan, and without any introduction; I had told Donovan to go and ask the prisoner to let me have some things - I had not derived my first information from Donovan.</p>

            's Defence. The first time Tripp came to my house, he spoke to my wife, wanted to seduce her away to Birmingham, and said he was a good hand at passing them - she told me, and I went to Mr. Powell and told him of it; it was not him only, but he sent a woman - I met that woman, and threatened that I would have her taken into custody; she said my wife had no business to let her husband know - they struck my wife, and gave her a black eye; I told Mr. Powell this, and he told me to live on as good terms as I could - Tripp then came again, and my wife said I was gone to the doctor's, but I should be there at three o'clock; he came again, and met a young lad at my door, who had a red handkerchief with something tied in it, and he took it from him - a person who is now in the Middlesex-hospital saw him do it: he then came up, gave my wife three shillings, and said he wished he could get some dinner - she said she had some fresh fish for dinner; he said he liked that very well - he then took out of the handkerchief some whiting or plaster, and he pulled out these nine half-crowns; he said, "Here are some which are not finished;" I took them to the window to examine them, when I gave them to him again - he said he was forced to leave that morning, but there was a man at the Cock, who would finish them for him; he asked me to go and give them to him - I said, "I don't know what man to give them to;" he said, "I will go and show him to you;" we went out, and he had the officer ready to take us - the first time I saw him; he said he had been at Birmingham, and saw a young man named Neale, who gave him a breakfast - he came to my place worse dressed than I was, and I gave him some tea.</p>

               <p>RICHARD TRIPP. I had a fustain jacket on, and huff trousers, and a silk hat nearly new; the first time I saw his wife, which was when I went to his room, to ask for him I told her I knew a person named Neale, who was gone to Birmingham, and he told me to go and ask for some things - I did not ask about any dinner, nor pass myself off as a person in the same condition of life; I merely asked her to let me have some things - I had been at Birmingham, but I did not tell them so; I did not say I had a brother who drove a waggon to Covent-garden-market, and that he could pass the bad money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you mena solemnly to declare that you never held out any inducement to his wife to go to Birmingham, or say what he has stated? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You found a person on the stairs? A. Yes, the person whom I had seen in the room the first time I was there; he knew I was going in, and he went up and gave three knocks with his hand - I had given him no sign, and was not in company with him.</p>

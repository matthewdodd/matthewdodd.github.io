You have got your master's purse"—a knock came at the door before she gave me an answer, and she went away to open the door—she was gone five minutes—in the meantime I look the trowsers, and found there was no purse in them—the prisoner came down into the kitchen, and asked for a wine-glass—she took one, went back with it, and was away perhaps five minutes longer—she then came down again, and Mr. Littlejohn was then up and dressed—he said to her, "Mar<lb></lb>garet, you must have my purse"—I said to her, "If you have got it, for God's sake, give it up, and take your clothes, and go about your business"—she said, no, she had not—I said, "You shall not leave this kitchen till I search you"—she hesitated, and, after a minute or two, she walked over to the dresser, and began to undress—Mr. Littlejohn went up stairs—the prisoner dropped some money—I said to her, "You have dropped some money"—she said, "It is only a sixpence, it belongs to me"—I turned to get a candle, to see what it was, and she stooped and picked it up—I walked over to the dresser—it laid on the dresser, and was a sovereign—I said, "Here is a sove<lb></lb>reign lies here; you know we are not in the habit of laying our things about like this"—she said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "You must; I heard the knives and forks rattle, and you have laid the sovereign close by them"—I called Mr. Littlejohn down—he took the sovereign—he said to her, "Let me feel your pocket"—she pulled out her handkerchief or her handkerchief and shook it—a shilling fell, but whether from her handkerchief or her pocket I cannot say—Mr. Littlejohn took it up, and said, "Now I am convinced you have got my money, I know this shilling"—she said it was a shilling of her child's money, belonging to herself—she stood there a minute or two, and I begged her to give the money up—she turned black in the face, and I said, "You are swallowing it"—she said, "No, I am not"—she asked for a drink of water—I said, "No, you shall not have it, you are swallowing the money"—policeman came in, and she was given into custody—she has a daughter, thir<lb></lb>teen years old, who has been in service.</p>

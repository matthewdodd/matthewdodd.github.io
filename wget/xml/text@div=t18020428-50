               <p>Q. In what manner was it used? - A.The bottom part of it was a board, about twelve inches long, and six inches broad; there were two pieces about ten or twelve inches long, one let into each end of the bottom, and a brace that went on the top, and in each of these places were two holes, into which two rollers were let in.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you had it from himself, that all the implements and tools were left with the brother? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had it from himself, that his wife went to the brother to get these things? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that the plates were thrown over the bridge? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen, at any other place, at any other time, any implements like that that you saw him using? - A. I have seen another kind of a press the same as that.</p>
               <p>Q.Where? - A. In Wardour-street, and in Dean-street; I am certain I did not see the same there.</p>
               <p>Q.When you left Liverpool, how were you disposed of? - A. We were brought first of all to Old-street, and from that to Cold-Bath-fields, where I have remained ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Put into separate confinement? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not seen each other since that time till now? - A. Yes, in prison, very often.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were separated, did you receive any letters from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his writing? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many letters did you receive from him? - A. Two, I received them from him at separate times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Point out to me which you received first, and where it was you received them? - A.This is the first. (Pointing to it).</p>
               <p>Q. In what prison was he at that time? - A. In cold-Bath-fields; we were brought there.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I thought you were separate? - A. We were separate in the prison.</p>
               <p>Q.You had an opportunity of speaking to each other? - A. Not long at a time.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you separately or together, at Bow-street? - A.Separately.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he present when you had your examination before the Magistrate? - A. He was in the house, but not in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he present at Bow-street when you made your confession? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.When was it you was examined and made your confession? - A. I think it was the 29th of March that we came to town, and on the Tuesday following I gave evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you given evidence before you received that letter? - A. I believe about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q.Having had all this time to reflect upon the dreadful situation of the prisoner himself, and of your own situation, you have disclosed to the Solicitor of the Bank, and to the Magistrates, all that you know? - A. I have, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q.Let me exhort you to consider where you stand, and tell me if it is true, as far as you have related, that the prisoner was so concerned? - A. Every thing I have said is true.</p>
               <p>Q. You are aware you have called God to witness the truth of what you have said; and also, of the dreadful situation of that man? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me call your attention back again to Weston street; all the implements that were made use of there, you learnt from him, were destroyed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What notes were struck off from any of the implements that he had at Weston-street when you saw him at work - what sums? - A. Five pound notes; nothing else at Weston-street.</p>
               <p>Q. And after this it was, that you received from him this five pound note that you gave to Miss Siddons? - A. Yes.(Two letters from the prisoner to Gillington, read as follows:)"My Dear Gillington,"I have seriously considered my situation, and how I stand for mercy at their hands if I do not exert myself in time; for by lying by dormant, and saying nothing, would never get me off; therefore it is the best to take advantage of what little time there is left, to persuade them to accept of my plan, and so soften them to save my life for transportation; for if I receive sentence of death they cannot save me, as the public clamor would be so great against me then. - What you alone have said is sufficient to do me out, though I know you cannot help in on your own account, but be as light as possible on me, as I hope that Dick will be sent to Canterbury out of the way. I am very much in doubt of my plan being accepted, as there was a man of the name of Weston suffered six years ago, who offered another for the same purpose, but they would not listen to him; and by their eagerness at present, in prosecuting me, I sear they are determined on my ruin; but they never shall know a word of it without saving my life first.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280049"></xptr>"I write you this, that your sears might not take the alarm, as you might think I wanted to get the inside of you, as an evidence, by my sending letters out, and thereby you might conceive a dislike to me, and so injure me the more on my trial; but may I never see God if I have the least notion any longer of such a proceeding, nor had I since you done so yourself. If nothing does to save me, let my death be a curse on England for ever; indeed, it is the only consolation I have, because, if England had not stirred up a rebellion in Ireland for its own purposes, and so set us all starving, we never should think of doing what we have done.</p>
               <p>"If I'm cast, offer to transport yourself to save me for the same, as I intended to do so for you, because we might get off for America from the Bay. If I die, I intend to have a merry death, for I will petition the Bank to allow me an Irish piper, from the time I receive sentence, to play in my cell, and promise to give them the plan before I am turned off, but disappoint them after in giving it.</p>
               <p>"I intend from this out to pester them with letters, and enlarge on the merits of my plan, and tell them what advantage it will be to them, and the nation at large, (for it really is a capital one) as by it their credit will be firm, &amp;c. &amp;c. and it is impossible to imitate it without a speedy detection.</p>
               <p>"I must put a great deal of blarney and boasting in it also, as there is nothing like impudence and persuasion in such a desperate case as this, for it will do more than the interest of the Court with them, or the first man in the land, for instance, Governor Wall for that.</p>

               <p>"If they reject my offer, I must change my battery with them after sentence, and get friends out doors to annoy and frighten them into compliance by the transparency, and threaten to spread it like wild-fire, over town and country; this, or something like it, saved Lane."</p>
               <p>"Dear James,"If Betsey has stagged on us our sate hangs on a wire; therefore, you must only make the best of it on the trial to clear up the point about the girl's knowing of it. I am sorry you did not tell it at first more clear, and it would have saved you from anxiety of mind; as well as me, if any thing bad should happen to you, I have no chance at all.</p>
               <p>"If in case that my plan is rejected, and that "I am doomed to de gad," (which God forbid) they will, of course, get a letter from abroad about the transparency; of course, you will be questioned about it; do you then deny any knowledge of the party or parties concerned, but that you believe that there are a great number of my particular friends who know it, which I have told it purposely to, in case any thing had should happen me; you may say there are three or four in Ireland who know it, as you heard me several times say so, and those are relations of mine, (young men); say then that I have a great number (you believe) of acquaintances from different parts of Ireland, for that I have been in a great many towns in my rambles through Ireland, and that I have lived in Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny,&amp;c. &amp;c. where it was impossible for you to know my acquaintances, as you never were in any of them towns; besides, I was twelve months, or more, here before you came.</p>
               <p>This is the way Newell worked on the Secret Committee, and so horrified them to proclaim Martial Law.</p>
               <p>If you see the Griffin then any way thoughtful, or thinking what to do, take advantage of it, and say that you also heard me often talk of a plan I had in view to prevent forgeries, but that I said I was afraid of their having some knowledge of me, which prevented my ever offering it; pretend to be innocent of my having any discourse with you in the prison.</p>
               <p>If all this does not do, and that you don't stand my friend so far, the Lord have mercy on my soul! I communicate my last thoughts to you on this paper having a confidence in you, that you won't betray my intentions, even if it was to save your life, which it would not if you were cast.</p>
               <p>I would have wrote to them about the plan before, only I knew when you would hear it you might suspect it was about other business, therefore I thought it better to defer it till I communicated my thoughts to you on the subject, to make your mind easy; however, if you have any doubts still on your mind, tell me candidly of it to day.</p>
               <p>By writing to them in time, they may take my letter into consideration, and it might hinder them from looking for evidence to swear against me, as I have put off so little - and they might overlook the printing of them, &amp;c. As Dick would be a sufficient meal for them to satiate their vengeance on, and they might say the rest were sled.</p>
               <p>In case I die, and that you survive, petition to have me buried in Pancras, Sommers Town; but I cannot tell, in case of forgery, whether my friends or the b - y doctors can have my body; I would like my friends to have it of course, and to be buried six feet deep.</p>
               <p>I believe Lymbery is in custody since the day he went to Pentonville, as he would have gone to tell Dick of what happened; it is natural to think so, as being an acquaintance, same as Miller; besides they might have doubt of your information, which would make them keep him; it was lucky, however, for had Dick heard of our being in custody he would have come forward without asking, or running away, which you may judge from his letter, and so swear every thing plump, as to leave no hopes for either of us.</p>
               <p>"Lymbery gave me to understand that he heard some broad hints of the cran from Lauglin, &amp;c. &amp;c.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280050"></xptr>so I told him about it, for the purpose of bringing me news, but he never got one, as I knew he had not the courage to do it.</p>
               <p>"I will write to Carolan to-day, watch for him at the window at one the next day, and at three o'clock also; if he puts up both his hands in the air, it is a token that he got two letters from me, and one for Beisey. And if he points to Pentonville with his hand, it is a token that she got it safe. - If he is determined to stand my friend he will put his hand on his breast. - If there is a shark in the house he will take off his hat.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gillington.) Q. Do you know who is meant by Dick? - A. Power.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Power a man connected with you in this business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Matthew Power the same person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is meant by the word cran? - A.Forged notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is meant by Carolan? - A. He was an apothecary.</p>
               <p>Q. What connections had you two with Carolan? - A. We were very intimate with him two years; and latterly, we joined in a medicine, he was a proprietor, and we gave him money.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you become possessed of that money? - A. By forged notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know, of your own knowledge, or from any thing the prisoner has told you, where it was he frabricated the paper, if he did fabricate it? - A. I saw him compleat it in Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you know from him how he came first to forge a five pound note? - A. I believe, by the instigation of Power.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company when there was any conversation between him and Power upon this business? - A. I was; Power told him it would be better for him to engrave a five pound plate; he said, there was no more danger, or not so much, in passing a five pound note than a one; this conversation was at Bath, and the prisoner agreed that he would engrave the plate if Power would get him a good copy.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by a good copy? - A. A new note; a new original Bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Power procure him one? - A. He did, for cash, at the Bank, which e gave to Fennell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go to Bath? - A.He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he commence his work of engraving? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the plate that he afterwards worked at Pentonville? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of his having been in possession of any other plates at any time? - A. Yes; a two pound plate I saw him engrave.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that? - A. He told me he left it on the step of a door, somewhere about the neighbourhood of Clerkenwell, or Grays-Inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q.When did he say that? - A.About August last.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever, in your own custody, that plate? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q.How did it get out of your hands? - A. I gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. And he told you he had left this plate at the step of a door as you have described it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When you had the possession of the plate, and had an opportunity of taking notice of it, was there any thing upon it, by which you can safely say you should know it again? - A. Yes; it was bruised on or near the edge of it, as if by accident, and the maker's name stamped upon the back of it, it was delivered to me by his wife.</p>
               <p>Q.Just cast your eye upon that, and say, if you think that is or is not the same plate that you delivered back? - A. There is a mark on this that there was not on that, here is the remains of the mark yet, and there was something on the plate then that does not now appear.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, or not, believe that that is the plate you delivered back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there an x at the back of it? - A. Yes, there is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing about the maker's name that leads you to believe it is the same? - A. All that I remember of it is, that there is an x in it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was this mark over the figure of 2 upon it when you had it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. Did he tell you why he desired to get rid of this plate? - A.Because there was no paper made for one and two pound notes, and he should have the trouble of making another machine, for the engraving was altered in the two pound notes, and that was of no use to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else? - A. He said, out of a joke, he would send it to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were examined against the prisoner on the Tuesday after he was brought to town? - A. Not against him; on my own account.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you were first examined against the prisoner? - A. I do not exactly remember the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you were brought to town? - A. I believe about a fortnight, or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you were examined before the Magistrate, you were examined at the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. My learned friend asked you whether you had disclosed the whole to the Bank, and you said you had? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you give me within a trifle, the number of forged Bank-notes you told the Directors of the Bank you had put off? - A. I believe I did not tell them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280051"></xptr>Q. Now speaking quite within compass, can you tell us how many forged Bank-notes you have put off, one hundred? - A. Yes, more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Two hundred? - A. More.</p>
               <p>Q. Three hundred? - A.More than that, I suppose five or six hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. You know them all to be forged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You was taken up at Liverpool, and when you was brought to town, and charged before the Magistrate, you knew perfectly well you were charged with the crime of forgery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, with a consciousness in your own mind of having put off five or six hundred, and that you were in custody upon that charge, I take it for granted, you began to think your days were numbered, that your end was near? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. It then occurred to you, that it was a more convenient thing to be hanged by proxy than in person? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told the Bank, if they would save you, you would give evidence against the prisoner? - A. I told them I would tell all I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not expressly state that you would give evidence against the prisoner, if they would spare you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them so to understand? - A. I told them I would tell all I knew concerning the forgery, and all who were concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you named Power to them, did you? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You named the prisoner to them? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And Miller? - A. No, he was not concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. He was your very particular friend? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. You offered to give evidence against these persons, if they would save you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard that Miss Belley Evans was seduced by the prisoner, under a promise of marriage - was she not living in the house with him and his wife? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was lodging in the same house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you were confined, you and he were both confined in Cold Bath fields prison? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw each other frequently? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw each other after you had given information? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you intended to do it before you did it? - A. Not long, it was asked of me.</p>

               <p>Q. You knew perfectly well you should be hanged if you did not - A. I did not know.</p>
               <p>Had you the least doubt that you should be hanged? - A. I thought I should.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew you should be tried? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that you should be hanged? - A. No, I did not know whether I should or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any doubt? - A. I was tolerably sure I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in order to make sure that you should not, you knew it was convenient to get his hand; did you not tell him, if he wrote to the Bank, it might save him? - A. I told him it might.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not get the letters from him for the very purpose of producing them in evidence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What then? - A. That he might save himself, because he told me his plan would save him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not desire him to write these very letters for the purpose of you yourself giving evidence of them? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you desire him to write them for? - A. I did not desire him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say, you desired him to offer his plan to the Bank, with a perfectly friendly view to serve him? - A. Yes, certainly I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not told any body before hand, that you could get a little writing from him? - A. No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not suggested that it would be convenient to get a little of his writing to confirm the evidence of a man like you? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. It passed but lately - you have been telling us the transactions of months and years past, you might tell us what has passed within these six weeks? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You were kept separately - for what purpose was it you were suffered to talk to him, was it not on purpose to get something out of him? - A. No, it was not, the room that I was in was at the top, and he was at the bottom, and my door was left open, so that I might have gone down into the yard, and spoke to him through his window.</p>
               <p>Q. The door was left open that you might go and converse with him? - A. Not for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not these conversations for the purpose of getting evidence against him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you never wrote to him with a view to get any thing from him? - A. Not any thing to give in evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never write to him with a view of getting an answer from him of any sort? - A. I wrote to him about some money that he owed me.</p>
               <p>Q. About nothing else? - A. And to tell him to exert himself with his plan, and send it to the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Any thing else? - A. That I would serve his wife if I could.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not write with a view of an answer? - A. I expected he would send an answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you employ as your messenger? - A. The turnkey.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner then in Cold Bath-fields? - A. No, in Newgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280052"></xptr>Q.Did you not send by the turnkey a pencil, for the purpose of getting an answer? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the turnkey to take a pencil with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now man, look that Jury in the face, and say if you did not write that to get an answer to give in evidence against him? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is as true as all the rest you have sworn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Though you would utter five or six hundred forged Bank-notes, I dare say you would not tell a lie for the world, you are a man of great veracity - have you never said, you would not mind how you swore? - A. I don't understand you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say, you should not much regret a false oath? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never said, you would no more mind taking a false oath, than swallowing an oyster? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What axis's were they? - A.They were two single rollers.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they of the same size? - A. Nearly so; there might be a little difference, but that I don't take any account of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any part of the work left undone at his desire? - A. He said there were some holes to be made, but he would make them himself.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him after that? - A. About a week after; I delivered it to the prisoner in the street; my wife was along with me; he said, he had no money about him at that time, but he would give me something the next time he saw me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw him again? - A. It might be a fortnight, or three weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. When was that? - A. I cannot justly say; it might be a month, or five weeks, before I was taken up for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you get from him at that time? - A. I was out; he left a box with my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of that box? - A. His wife came to me.</p>

A piece of cloth; John Fennell and his wife opened the paper, and took out three square pieces of copper; two had writing, and the other had none; Fennell's wife put one in her pocket, Mrs. Gillington took another, and the other was left with me; they called me out, and gave me three plates, and I dropped them over a sewer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drop them through the grating? - A. I cannot tell; I let them fall out of my hand, and whether they staid out, or got in, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. I went through Charing-cross to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the box? - A. There is a part of it at home, and part of it my wife burnt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you, yourself, taken up, charged with participating in this offence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were admitted to be a witness against your brother? - A. I cannot tell what they did; I did as they desired me, and I they put me to my oath; it has hurt my character very much; they know they have nothing against me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280056"></xptr>Q. What time of the day was it you went to Charing-cross with the plates? - A. Nine o'clock at night.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you ever said you threw them over Blackfriars-bridge? - A. No; I told his wife that same night I had thrown them over Westminster-bridge, to make her a little reconciled.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say so when you were examined before Mr. Winter? - A. No, only that night.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you the examination of the prisoner? - A. I was not present at the time this examination was taken, but this is the Magistrate's handwriting; I was present at a subsequent examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q.(To Perry.) You have told us you apprehended these two men at the Post-Office? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was it? - A. The 25th of March.</p>
               <p>Q.When you apprehenced Fennell, did he say any thing? - A.When I took him into custody, I asked him if his name was Fennell; he said, it was; I took one in one arm, and one in the other; I said to Gillington, your name is Gillington; he said, it is; I took them into the Post Office, and, having no assistance, I took a pair of handcuffs out of my pocket, and handcuffed them; I was obliged to stand behind them to do it, having no assistance, and to take care that neither of them should escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Having done this, what did you afterwards do? - A. I attempted to search them, and the prisoner at the bar resisted; I said, it was too late, and I must take all from them; I searched them, and found a quantity of money, gold watches, one upon each, bank-notes, breast-pins, and trinkets of that nature; I sent for a hackney-coach, and took them before the Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Fennell at this time say any thing? - A. I never heard him speak from the time I took him into the Post-office till I got him before the Mayot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How long have you been an officer? - A. About five or six years, belonging to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You did your duty by these men as you did by others, and secured them? - A. I did my endeavours.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you told us every thing you found? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no conversation with him? - A.Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask what charge there was against him? - A. He did afterwards; I believe it might be in the coach, or the jail, but I don't know which; I mean in the stage-coach coming to London.</p>

               <p>AMY DANSEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a plate of copper at any time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When was it? - A. I don't know the day of the month; it is six or seven months ago.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you find it? - A. At the end of Sassion-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on any Fair day? - A. Yes, on Peckham Fair day; I found it at No. 11, Little Saffronhill, on the third step of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, and say whether it is the same? (shewing her a plate.) - A. Mr. Pontisex's name is on it, Shoe-lane.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you take it to? - A. To Mr. Butler, of Wood-street, Spa-fields; it was mentioned to the Gentlemen of Hatton-garden, and I was fetched there directly; Mr. Butler took me and the plate together, and there it was left.</p>
               <p>Mr. GARNETT TERRY sworn. - Examined by Mr Fielding. Q. You are engraver to the Bank of England? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that five-pound bank-note? - A. It is a forged one.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that plate - how long have you been an engraver? - A.Thirty years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to form any judgment whether the engraving of that plate and the five-pound note are done by the same person? - A. I examined them by two impressions, and I believe they are done by the same hand; the same mode of applying the tool, and the same mode of finishing the up and down stroke of the legs of the M's and N's, in each, of them; we find no difficulty; we know different person's work, and we know the mode of applying the tool, and cutting the stroke.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that now produced? (shewing him a round piece of wood.) - A. This appears to be a bit of box, and this to be a part of the bottom of another press.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that flat board? - A. I never saw it before; it seems to have had whiting on it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it to lay work upon? - A. Such a thing as this would do as a plank to put between two rollers for printing, and then the impression would be made; this is what we call the part of a cross, which is applied to a spindle.</p>
               <p>Q. Would that be an effential article to complete any thing printed? - A. Yes, it is stained with printing-ink, I perceive.</p>
               <p> - CARPMEAL sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are an officer? - A. Yes, I searched the lodgings of the prisoner, in Weston-street, on the 27th of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any graving tools? - A. Yes.(Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Terry. This is a proper graving tool; this we call a draw-point, or burnisher, but I don't think it has been used for that; they are part of such tools as must be used in engraving.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the paper which was found there - is that a paper upon which a fabrication may be made? - A.It is not such paper as the note is; it is extra thin post.</p>
               <p>Mr. Terry, Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say that note, which you have examined, and the paper, are not of the same quality? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to the press, it is not complete? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Now, are the other things in such a complete state to be used without something else belonging to them? - A. No, there must be something else.</p>
               <p>Q. Every engraver must have a complete press for the purpose of taking off impressions? - A. Yes, he could not do it with such as these.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, the papers which were found in Mr. Gillington's possession, which he says were of my writing, are nothing but a gross forgery of his own, I fancy; I have some witnesses to prove Gillington's oath is not to be taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Gillington, the witness, who has been examined here to-day? - A. Yes, he lodged at my mother's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known much of him? - A. I have known him for about three years.</p>
               <p>Q.Is he a man, who, from your knowledge of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280058"></xptr>him, you would venture to believe upon his oath? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why would you not believe him on his oath? - A.Because I have heard him make frequent declarations that he would not mind taking a false oath if he had any interest at stake.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he more than once repeated that, or once particularly? - A. I recollect a particular circumstrice; there was a dispute about whether any Lord was called upon to take an oath, and one said, he only said upon his honour; and then Mr. Gillington said, it was all nonsense about an oath, he would no more mind swallowing an oath than he would swallowing an oyster.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. What were they talking about at this time - about the united Irish? - A. No; some one said, a Lord was not called upon to take an oath, only to declare upon his honour; and another said, a Lord was sworn the same as any one else.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it that you were singled out to-day to tell us this? - A. I don't know I am sure.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This was in a public-house where they were all drinking? - A. Yes, about nine months ago, as near as I can recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. Who was the company? - A. A man of the name of Moore, and another of the name of Sarson; I only saw the prisoner two or three times with Mr. Gillington; he came to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. It shocked you very much to hear a man talk so? - A. I thought it a very improper expression.</p>
               <p>Q. What countryman are you? - A. An Englishman; I was shocked at the expression, or I should not have remarked it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. A tailor.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Gillington, the witness, who has been examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been in his company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any conversation about the Orange men, in Ireland? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing particular? - A. I met with Gillington at a public-house, in Poland-street, and the conversation was with respect to a man who had fled from Ireland, and for whom there was a reward offered; Gillington, at the same time, got me to write a letter to this young man; he had fled for a rape committed on a young lady, a relation of the post-master of the town where Gillington came from; he fled, and two men were hung; there was a reward for him; I wrote a letter for him, and saw Gillington some time after, and asked him if he had sent it off; he said, no; but he had copied it, and put another name to it; he wanted me to have this man apprehended, and I received a letter from Mr. Fennell some time after, not to have any thing to do with the man's life; I talked to Gillington respecting the affair; he laughed at me, and said, he would think nothing of taking a thousand false oaths to hang an Orange man if it came to that.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you quite sure he cautioned you not to keep company with him so far back? - A. He cautioned me to have nothing to do with the man's life; there was no mention made of the badness of Gillington.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen Fennell and Gillington in company together since that? - A. They were in company.</p>
               <p>Q. They were very intimate - were they not? - A. I cannot say particularly.</p>

               <p>Q. How long since? - A. The last time I saw them was in the beginning of last August; there were a great many in company.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at those two letters? - A. If those are his hand-writing, it is not similar to any I have seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it is or not? - A. I do believe it is not, but I cannot say it is not upon my oath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. How long have you been acquainted with him? - A. I have known him about four years, and have been in his company a dozen times; I have seen his letters to his wife.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you read the whole of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a fourth time? - A. I cannot swear to the fourth time; I might see him write many more than four times, but three I will swear to.</p>
               <p>- KIMBER sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. Do you know the prisoner's hand-writing? - A. I don't know, whether I do or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen him write? - A.Only five or six weeks in another man's books; I have known him to write, but not seen him write; I have been concerned in business belonging to another man, and he has wrote in the book; I have not seen him writing, but I have seen his writing.</p>

               <p>Q. You do allow prisoners pens and ink, but see what they send out - was Gillington allowed pen, ink, and paper? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. You ordered no pens, ink, and paper to me before I was sent to Newgate? - A. No, I did not, probably my father did; prior to your last examination, you wrote letters privately to Gillington, that is a convincing proof you had pens, ink, and paper.</p>

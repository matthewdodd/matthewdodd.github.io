            . I live at Messingham, in Lincolnshire, near Brigg; it is fifty miles from Grantham - the prisoner was in my service as a drover off and on for nearly five years. I had a lot of one hundred and sixty-nine sheep; the prisoner was a <rs id="t18320705-9-viclabel46" type="occupation">general drover</rs>

               <p>Q. Were you in his debt at that time? A. There might be some little settlement - I do not fancy that I owed him 5l.; I am sure I did not owe him 10l.; I used to give him money, and he paid the expences on the road - I gave him no authority to sell the sheep; I went to the Spread Eagle at half-past four o'clock on Sunday, and waited there till five o'clock; I then got a boy to show me the way to Smithfield; I met Shelton at the Red Bull, Islington; and, in consequence of a conversation with him, I got Turner, the officer, that Sunday evening, and on Monday morning, the 16th, I found the whole one hundred and eighteen sheep at Smithfield market, in possession of different salesmen - Shelton saw them afterwards; I was offered a guinea each for the sheep at Grantham - on the 21st of April I received a letter from the Mayor of Colchester, and found the prisoner in custody there on Monday, the 23rd; I had no warrant for him, and they refused to deliver him up; I afterwards got a warrant from Hatton-garden, and he was brought to London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. The prisoner had been employed by you for four or five years. A. Yes, off and on, as a drover, not as a regular servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you swear before the Magistrate, you never in your life authorized the prisoner to sell any sheep or beasts, unless you were present at the time, or else somebody to take the money? A. I stated that before the Magistrate; I say the same now; I left a note at Newark for him to sell some beasts, if I did not come - I expected to send George Taylor to meet him, but when I got home, he was not at home; the prisoner sold three beasts there; I did not recollect that before the Magistrate; I do not recollect his selling two hundred and sixty sheep at Stamford fair in November, 1829, but I know he never had sheep to sell for me, unless he had a man with him to take the money; I do not recollect his receiving 200l., and giving a receipt for the money - he received no money whatever for those sheep, for I now recollect it, and I sold them myself, and received the money; I forget how much it was, or who bought them - it was not money, but a bill - I received it afterwards; I think they were sold to Skill, a farmer, at Bicknell, sixty miles from me; I did not at first recollect he had bought them - I received the bill myself, and believe it is now laying at Jones', in Smithfield; I passed the prisoner returning from Stamford fair, when I was on a coach, between Sleaford and Lincoln, and then re<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050030"></xptr>ceived a letter from him which he brought from Skill, but no money; the letter contained a draft of Skill's for the two hundred and sixty sheep - I left him at Norwich in May, 1830, in charge of one hundred and twenty beasts - I did not desire him to take sixty of them any where to sell them; he was to wait till I came there, and not to sell any of them - I went there to him the week following; I never told him to sell sixty-eight sheep at Market Dereham - I sent him to different places, but he never had authority to sell at any place; I do not remember any thing about meeting him at Doncaster, and his paying me for beasts sold at Lyan; he never sold beasts without somebody being present; I know a man named Dan - I have frequently trusted him to sell; I do not recollect sending the prisoner to Spalding with ten beasts which Dan had not sold - I have sent him with different lots to Welburn, and other people - I did not, in November, find that Welburn had thirty-three sheep more than had been left; I do not recollect thirty-three sheep being over at all - I swear I never, on any occasion, gave him permission to sell beasts; he sold these for less than what I was bid for them - after recovering them, I put them with four different salesmen, and they sold them for 82l. odd - some of them made about three halfpence per 1b. - no respectable person would buy them, because they would have to attend here.

               <p>Q. Did you not give the prisoner orders to dispose of these sheep at all events? A. I did not; I was to be here myself to sell them - the prisoner gave me no account of them at Colchester; I did not see any money produced from him there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you dispose of many thousand cattle in a month? A. About one thousand; I farm about six hundred acres, part of which is my own - I employ several drovers; I never in my life employed the prisoner to sell, except when another person was present to receive the money: I had a particular reason for that, from the first time he came to me - the sheep were worth about 24s. each, which would be about 150l. - I was obliged to make something of them; I am sure my appointment with the prisoner was to meet at the Spread Eagle, on Sunday, at half-past four o'clock.</p>

            . I live at Edenham, near Bourne, Lincolnshire - On Saturday, the 14th of April, I saw the prisoner coming from Whetstone; he was coming out of the country, towards London, and had one hundred and 18 Scotch sheep- I asked him where he was going with them; he said to Smithfield - I asked if he would sell the sheep: he said Yes - I asked him whose they were: he said they were his own - I did not know him before - I asked what he wanted for them: he said 28s a piece - I said he asked a great deal too much, but if he could set them at a sovereign a piece I would give him a bid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say why he sold them on the road? A. Yes; he said he should like to sell them there, because he must go back to St. lves market, to meet his brother, who was to sell some beasts there - St. lves is in Huntingdonshire, not Colchester way; after handling the sheep over he put them into the stable, and then we went to a public-house: this was Saturday night - I bid him 16s. each for them that evening, but he wanted 26s., and on Sunday morning, at half-past four o'clock, when I came down, he stood against the public-house door, and said "Good morning;" I asked if he was ready to go; he said "No, he was not going yet; I said very well, I must go" - I went on five or six yards; be then came to me to know where the man's house was at which he had put his one hundred and eighteen sheep - I showed him the house; I then bargained with him for them, and he agreed to take 16s. a piece - I took the sheep to town, and placed them in the hands of different salesmen at Smithfield - I kept twenty of them for myself - I saw Sowerby on the Sunday evening, at the Red Bull, Islington, and on the Monday morning he found the sheep out in the market himself, in the hands of the different salesmen, who I had placed them with - he got a Policeman and took them; they were afterwards sold on his account.</p>
               <p>Q. You applied to the prisoner first to sell the sheep? A. Yes, I asked if he would sell them: he said Yes - he said in the morning "What do you say about these sheep:" I said "What I told you last night" - he endeavoured to get as much for them as he could, and I tried to buy them as cheap as I could - it wanted about a quarter to five o'clock on Sunday when we concluded the bargain; I left Whetstone about that time - none of them were sold before Sowerby claimed them; the salesmen were to sell them for what they could fetch - I believe fourteen were finally sold alive, and the rest dead - Sowerby ordered them to be killed- I consider I bought them at a fair price; they came to 94l. 8s.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were they fit to kill? A. Most of them were - some, I thought, more fit for store; I did not consider it any bargain - there was more chance of losing by them than winning.</p>

            . I am sergeant-at-mace for Colchester. On the 18th of April the prisoner was at Colchester - that is not the way to Huntingdonshire; I first saw him on Wednesday, the 18th of April - he was detained by a constable, from information I had received; he was taken at a lodging-house for travelling beggars there; I went myself to take him - the constable (Betts) had detained him by my direction; when I apprehended him he said nothing -Betts said, in his presence and hearing, "Is this the man you want?" I said it was - he appeared very much agitated - I then took him before Mr. Spurling, the Mayor, who took down in writing what passed, and ordered him to be detained; at that time we knew nothing about any sheep; he had in his possession 50l. in notes, 41l. in gold, and 10s. in silver, which I took from him, in the presence of the Mayor - I asked him, as we went along, how he came in possession of so much money - he made no answer; he said nothing that I recollect, except before the Mayor; there is a sailing packet from Colchester to Hull, and I have heard there is a passage from Hull to Canada; the prisoner had booked himself to go to Hull - that was mentioned at the Mayor's room; after we took the prisoner we went to the captain to inquire if there was any luggage; there was none at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Perhaps you know that Hull is the cheapest way to Brigg, in Lincolnshire, where the prosecutor lives? A. I know nothing of that; he did not tell me he was going the nearest way to Mr. Sowerby's, when I took him - he admitted, before the Magistrate, that he had received the money for the sheep; I found he had agreed to pay 10s. for his passage to Hull,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050031"></xptr>if he found his own provision; he had no luggage - I never heard him say he was going home with the money to his master.</p>

            . I am a constable of Hatton-garden. I went to Colchester, and received the prisoner in charge on the 3rd of May, and on the road to town, on the coach, he told me his master owed him 28l. or 29l., and if he had not done as he had he never should have got the money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you he was going to Hull, as the nearest point to Brigg? A. No; I do not know of any vessel going from there to Brigg.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How did you pay the prisoner? A. I give him money when he wants to pay it away on the road - he agreed with me for 3s. a day - that is what I regularly give drovers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Here is a book with an account where I have been selling for him these five years for him - when he started me with these sheep he ordered me not to return till I had sold them; I gave him at Grantham what money I had received; he never confined me to any price, as some of them were dying every day, and they were getting worse, he said I must go, and not return till I sold them; if I could not sell them at London to sell them at Romford, or any market I could; I sold them, and was returning home the cheapest way. to give him the money - I could get from Hull to within four miles of where he was for 6d., and if I had gone by coach it would have cost 2l. and more.</p>

            . I am a drover, and know the prisoner. I have driven for Mr. Sowerby, and had a job from the prisoner myself, and have known the prisoner entrusted to sell beasts and sheep for him at different places, when Mr. Sowerby has not been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Who received the money? A. The last sheep he sold, was in Linconshire; he employed me to take some beasts from Lincolushire to Newell - the prisoner received the money for them next morning; Mr. Sowerby had gone home the day before; the butcher at Lincoln paid the prisoner before my eyes - I do not remember how much it was, and at Stamford fair I saw him sell a lot of beasts, and receive the money, which he put into his pocket; Sowerby was in the fair, but the prisoner put the money in his pocket - I was at Boston when he sold nineteen or twenty of Sowerby's sheep, and took the money; Sowerby was at Boston, but was not present, and at different fairs he was always entrusted to buy and sell any thing - I have known him go out with sheep or beasts to sell where he could.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You know nothing about these hundred and nineteen sheep? A.

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. His brother travels the country? A. Yes; he was in Mr. Element's employ, in Lincolnshire, in April last.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother. I lived with Mr. Sowerby myself three years; I first went to him on the 24th of April, 1829, and have been with him occasionally since - I was last in his employ in February; my brother was sent to different places to sell sheep and beasts; I can relate many instances in which he sold, when Mr. Sowerby has not been present - the last was at Peterborough fair, which is held on the 10th or 11th of July, but last year Sunday intervened, and on Monday we had sixty-seven beasts left.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean? A. My brother and me; they were Mr. Sowerby's; Sowerby came up to the Blackmoor's Head, where we stopped - he took us a little aside, and desired us to take the sixty-seven beasts to Norfolk; we came to Wisbeach market on the Saturday, and the prisoner took twenty beasts, and left me grazing, with the forty-seven in the lanes; they were not sold - we went to Norwich, and sold some there; I do not recollect how many - Sowerby was there himself; we left Norwich on Saturday, and he allowed the prisoner to take twenty-four which were left, to sell at Lynn, as he was himself going to the Northern fair; he came to Lynn with them - I went to fetch more, and understand he sold fifteen; Sowerby did not say where he was going - he had gone home; I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you know of Mr. Sowerby appointing any body to receive the money? A. Nobody; his sheep<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050032"></xptr>had private marks on them, so that I knew when his sheep were sold.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. I ask do you know any instance of his selling sheep and receiving the money when Sowerby was not there? A. Yes, at Market-Weighton; the prisoner took the money home for three bullocks he sold there - I did not see them sold, nor the money paid; he had ninety cheviot ewes, and two hundred and eighty lambs last harvest, at Weighton-market; they were not sold, but left to grass - the prisoner and I met Sowerby next day, and he ordered us to bring them to Maldon fair, to ask 23s. each for the ewes, and if we could get a sovereign to take it, and to offer the lambs at 9s. 6d. each; my brother left us to go there - nobody went with him: he said if he could not get 9s. 6d. for the lambs that he knew how they were brought, and if he could get 1s. on each, to do it, for if in a fortnight he could sell a thousand, a shilling profit would be 50l., the prisoner was to receive the money; last harvest I heard him send him to Boston, and tell him to sell as many beasts as he could, and what he could not sell to take to Spalding; nothing was said about who who was to receive the money; I understand my brother went - I have been present when he has received money for Mr. Sowerby's cattle, when neither Sowerby nor any body from him was present; this was at Market-Weighton and Newark; I cannot mention any other particular place, I have seen it at so many.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you in Mr. Sowerby's service as a drover? A. Yes - I used to go one way and the prisoner another, and sometimes we went together; I never had authority to sell, unless the sheep got lame, and even then I had no authority, but if I could not get on with them I sold them; Mr. Welburn was occasionally in the habit of acting for Mr. Sowerby - Taylor was only a drover; he never allowed him to sell; I have heard him say Taylor was not qualified to sell - the prisoner has no other brother; I think I was at Mr. Element's last April - he lives about fourteen miles from Sowerby's, in Nottinghamshire; I was not in Huntingdonshire on the 14th of April, nor at St. Ives - I did not see Welburn at Market-Weighton, when the beasts were sold, and do not know whether my brother delivered the money for the lambs to him, he might; I was not at Spalding, and cannot say whether he paid Taylor for what was sold there - I do not know the price of Scotch sheep in April; I saw them in the fold in February; a good many of them died, and Mr. Sowerby said, "There are so many dying, take them away, and sell them where the devil you can."</p>
               <p>MR. SOWERBY. The last witness has been several times in my employ as a drover; I remember some sheep being sent to Weighton-market - Welburn was there, and received the money for them, and so he did for the ninety ewes and two hundred and eighty lambs; Taylor was always with the prisoner, if he went to sell any thing at Spalding and at other places; when I was not there Welburn or Taylor were for me.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. They told you so, but you was not there yourself? A. No; Welburn is now in Yorkshire: I saw these sheep in the field - there was not one dead to the best of my knowledge; I had them up from another farm, where six or seven died - I did not tell the prisoner to take and sell them where the devil he could; I told him nothing of the kind - I may owe the prisoner a little - he has paid expences when he has been out, and may have spent more than I gave him; I think I have seen that book before - there was never any receipts passed between us for expences paid; he has paid me for lame sheep which he sold, but I gave him no acknowledgment for it - Taylor was always with him at sales.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you on any occasion authorize him to sell sheep or beasts, except when yourself or somebody has been present to take the money? A. No, except when I left the beasts at Newark, and then I expected Taylor would be there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he ever apply to you for money and you refused to give it him? A. Never; he paid me for the lame sheep at Grantham - he did not then say I was in his debt, or ask for money; I gave him money when he left Grantham - there was an Irishman with him, and I said, "Mind that fellow don't rob you."</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I had two more witnesses, but have not seen them since they were seen talking to the prosecutor at the corn fair - Taylor never received a shilling of the money: I have worked for the prosecutor two years, and though he knew I was starving, he would not give me money to subpoena witnesses and get counsel.</p>

            . He was at Mr. Sowerby's at work the winter before last, and he desired me to add up his book, which I did and furnished Mr. Sowerby with the bill - he said he would settle it some time, but did not, and last winter I gave him the account again; he refused to settle with any body, and we said we never would dirt our hands with his work till he did - then his mother died, and that put an end to it; he said he would settle with me first, and he paid me here last Thursday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent to him time after time; he never would pay my wages; I wanted 29l., but not a farthing would he let me have to get victuals - he said he would pay me one day and then another; he never sent Taylor nor Welburn to take a farthing of money - I would not swear as he has done for the world.</p>
               <p>The Jury found the prisoner GUILTY, but that he did not intend to steal the sheep at the time he received them from his master. - <rs id="t18320705-9-verdict48" type="verdictDescription">

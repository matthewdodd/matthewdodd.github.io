                  </hi>. I live at No. 134, Blackfriars-road. On Friday, 13th Oct., about half past 9 o'clock in the evening, I was in the Borough-road, carrying a basket of bread—I had a silver chain; the chain was round my neck, and through my top button hole, out into my pocket—at the end of the chain there was a padlock—I do not wear a watch at night—as I was going along, I felt a blow upon my forehead; it was given me by the prisoner—it made me rather bad, and knocked me right down upon the ground—after that blow, three men held me, while the prisoner took my chain—I saw him four times before I was knocked down—I saw him first coming home with my father, and then going for the bread, and then coming back again, and once before that—I saw him at the time I was struck, before I was knocked down—I saw him after I was down, and I saw him get up—after I was down, I saw him doing something to my chain; I could not tell that he broke it—it seemed to come out by a pull from him—it is broken—when that was done, they ran away across the road, and I ran after the prisoner, to look at him—I saw something in his hand like that (<hi rend="italic">part of a chain</hi>)—I have half of the chain; the duplicate half is</p>

               <p>missing—the half in my hand was left on my person, after I had been assaulted—what the prisoner had in his hand resembled my chain—he made his escape at that time—the three other men did not run; they walked to the Swan, till they saw me going to my house, and I saw no more of them; that was after I had been so ill-treated—I have no doubt that the prisoner is one of the four men who so ill-treated me—it seemed a heavy blow—I was told that it was with a life preserver—there was quite a little hole in my head—I found blood all about my hands; I cannot say whether it came from my forehead or not—I had no blow before that—I went to a surgeon, Mr. Edmonds; he looked at my head—it was he who said he thought it was done with a life preserver.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DUNCAN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half past 9 o'clock in the evening; I saw the person the moment before he knocked me down—he was at my side—he was playing about the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—there were not a good many <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> there—I was minding my business—the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> were on the stand—I did not see the prisoner attempt to make a blow—the other three men were all there; they were all together—I saw this man, immediately alter I was down, rise from me—I did not see the prisoner, or any one, make the blow before I felt the force on my head—I took particular notice of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why do you think that man struck you down more than the other, or any one else, if you did not see him; the only thing that makes you think so is because you saw him rise from the ground? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him; I saw the man before, when I came with my father, about half past 8 o'clock in the evening—my father noticed him—I had never noticed him till about half past 8 o'clock that night—he did not wear a hat; he had a cap—he did not speak to me about half past 8 o'clock—we thought they were up to something, because they were playing about, I mean running round the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, coming close to me—I was not held down by the three men long; I dare say it was two or three minutes—this was the man that got hold of my chain—when I got up I followed him half way across the road—I next saw him in custody—I did not see him again on that night, nor the next day, nor the day after that—I was knocked down on the 13th, Friday—it was two or three days before I saw him again—it was in the day time, in the light—I picked him out from three other men—I went with the policeman—he was in gaol.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 110). On Friday evening, 13th Oct., I was on duty at the corner of the Borough-road, about a quarter before 9 o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing, with his back towards the Swan, beershop—there were three other persons near him—I know they were companions of his—I have seen them daily together—I spoke to the prisoner—he had on a cap—after I saw him he crossed the road, in company with the other three—he crossed the L division, towards Surrey—it was at the corner of Blackfriars-road, about thirty-six paces from the place where this occurred—I measured it myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At what time did you observe him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a quarter before 9 o'clock; I particularly remember that he had on a cap—I spoke to him, and he spoke to me—he very frequently wears a hat—there was only one out of the four that had a cap.</p>

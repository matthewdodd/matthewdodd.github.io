On 6th September, at 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in plain clothes in St. Martin's-lane, and saw the three prisoners—I followed them for upwards of half an hour—I saw them go down St. Martin's-lane as far as Long Acre—they went up to an old gen<lb></lb>tleman, pulled him down on the ground, and John Donovan held him down while the others rifled his pockets—I saw Pratt take something from the old gentleman's left pocket and put it into his own; it was some pieces of paper—I went to take him into custody—he made a blow at me which missed me, and they ran away—I followed Pratt 'down New-street into Bed<lb></lb>fordbury, where he was stopped by another officer—I saw him then throw away this saw-setter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); I picked it up, and took him into custody—on the road to the station he said, "It is the first time, and it will be the last, that I ever was in trouble. I was with two thieves, one of the name of Donovan"—I took him to the station and found this silk handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his right pocket—I asked him how he came by it—he said, "I do not know"—shortly afterwards he said "I bought it of my companion who I was with, and gave 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—the inspector told him he was charged with loitering in Long Acre for the purpose of committing a felony—he said, "Well, I was there for that"—on the day of the remand I was at Bow-street, and saw the two Donovans go into a public-house at the bottom of Bow-street—I went in with 39 <hi rend="italic">F</hi>, and took William Donovan—I told him he was charged with highway robbery in Long Acre, on the 6th—he said that I was mistaken, he could prove where he was at the time I had mentioned, two o'clock in the morning—I had plenty of opportunity of seeing his face; I had followed them for half an hour—I also knew them by sight previously, and have no doubt of them.</p>

I am a labourer, of 6, Priuce's-court, Newport-market—on 6th September, about 10 minutes to 2 in the morning, I was standing at the corner of St. Martin's-lane attending to a coffee stall—I saw an old gentleman cross from the Cranbourne hotel to the hoarding where the new street is being built—three men followed him, and when they got about thirty or thirty-five yards from the corner where I was, they pounced on him and dragged him to the ground—I saw the men run across and grapple with one man—somebody halloed, "Stop thief," and they ran down St. Martin's-lane—one turned into Long-acre and one kept straight on—a policeman came up to him in Cranbourne-street, but three women came to where the old gentle-man stood and took him away—I went to the middle of the road and picked up this stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which the old gentleman had—Pratt is one of the three who pounced on him, but the other two men were much shorter than the Donovans—I did not pay most attention to Pratt—I had a woman at my coffee-stall, and had four shillings' worth of halfpence in one of the cups, and I paid most attention to them—I will not take my oath that I saw Pratt robbing the old gentleman, but I saw the policeman grapple with him.</p>

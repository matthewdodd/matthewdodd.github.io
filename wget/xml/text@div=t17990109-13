               <p>JOHN COWELL sworn. - I was passing up Chiswell-street on the 28th of December, and observed the prisoner with this large piece of baize upon his shoulder, I am sure the prisoner is the person; I acquainted Mr. Burrough with it, and we both followed him, and caught him with the baize on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>Burrough. I believe this to be my baize, there is no mark upon it; there was a cord round it when I lost it, which was cut, and, in cutting it, he has cut through the baize in seven or eight folds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. A man put it on my shoulder, and told me he would give me one shilling to carry it to Old-street.</p>

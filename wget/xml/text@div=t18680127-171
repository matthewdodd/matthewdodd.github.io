                  </hi>. My master keeps a stationer's shop in Lang<lb></lb>ham Place—on 10th January, about 7.30 p.m., the prisoner came in for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of penny stamps—he gave me two florins and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and went away—I put the money in the stamp drawer, separate from the shop money—there were no other florins there—in about ten minutes he came back, nobody having been in for stamps in the meanwhile that I am aware of, and asked me if I would exchange the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of stamps for seven shilling stamps, which I did—I had not taken any florins in the meantime—I then went to the till and saw that one of the florins looked bad—I put it to my teeth, found it was soft, and gave it to my master, who put it in a drawer in his room, where there were no other florins—shortly afterwards the prisoner came in a third time for seven shilling postage stamps—he gave me two florins and three shillings—I saw that one of the florins was bad, and said to my employer, in his presence, "This is the third time this man has been in, and he brought me another one"—I went round to the prisoner and said, "This is the third time you have been in, and you have given me two bad florins"—he said, "As the Almighty is my Judge, I have not given you two bad florins"—I said, "I am quite positive you have, and unless you give me your name and address, and tell me where you got them from, we shall have it seen further into"—he at first hesitated, but at last gave his address—a policeman came in two or three minutes after—I accused him—I then asked him again where he got the money, he said that he should be a flat to tell me, and I gave him in custody with the florins.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you not very intimate? A. No; I have drank in company where he has been, in the brickfields, eight or nine years ago - there was nobody round the table but him and three of his party; a woman was by the fire-place, three or four feet from the table - I did not agree to fight any body, nor give the prisoner the sovereigns as a stake; I was taken up, about three years ago, for an assault and acquitted, but was never accused of attempting to rob.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate woman. I was at Smith's public-house, in Tothill-street, and saw Meads; there were three people there besides the prisoner; I saw two sovereigns and some silver in Meads' hand - I did not see the prisoner take it, but saw him run out; Meads attempted to follow, and somebody struck him by the side of his eye - I went out, and saw no more; Meads complained of being robbed of two sovereigns before he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you near enough to hear their conversation? A. I did not notice it; I heard nothing about a fight - I was three or four feet from the table; when the prisoner went away the prosecutor had the pot in his hand; I cannot say he was drinking - there were two men in the room besides Meads and the prisoner; they were not drinking with Meads; the landlord was not there- Meads had not been many minutes in the house; the other men were there before him - I went to Chelsea with Meads that day, to take the prisoner, and I heard him say at the watch-house that he took the money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you go to Chelsea for? A. To look after the prisoner, as we heard where he lived.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 8th of June Meads gave the prisoner into my charge, in Queen'syard, Jews'-row, Chelsea; he said he had taken two sovereigns out of his hand at a public-house in Tothill-street; the prisoner denied it going to the watch-house - he said he never had them, not that they had been given to him to hold as a stake; the prosecutor asked how he could be so ungrateful after knowing him so many years, and he said,"I did not take the money;" he again charged him with it - the prisoner then said, "I did take it, and if you will allow me to go, I will restore it to you again;" I think he said in a quarter of an hour; I found 4s. 11d. on him, and a bad crown-piece - it was about five o'clock in the afternoon; the prosecutor was struggling with him in the yard when I took him - the prisoner was on the top of him, and there were a number of thieves and prostitutes there, assisting the prisoner, to prevent his being taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That woman was never in the room; the prosecutor was there, drinking, three or four hours before I went in - he was falling out with a gentleman I did not know, and he threw the money down to me to hold; he was going to fight the gentleman - he said, "If your friends are agreeable I will fight you directly for the money;" I said I did not wish any thing of the kind, for the prosecutor was too much in liquor; the young man then said, "Well, I will have nothing more to do with it;"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080028"></xptr>I then gave the gentleman his money - he threw it down, and put it to me again; I went about my business, and left the money on the table - he put his handkerchief up to his eye, and was crying drunk.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Chequers, where this happened, and have been there eight months. I was there the day this happened; the prosecutor was there nearly the whole day - he came in about nine o'clock, and left about an hour or an hour and a half after this happened: Johnson was never in the house - I have seen her several times: I supplied the prosecutor several times with drink - he was far from sober when he left; I heard him several times challenge a man to fight, and he put the money down on the table; he put above 3l. down at one time- it was two sovereigns and some silver; I was out of the room when he left - he, the prisoner, and the persons at the table were all chatting together; I should think there were ten or twelve persons drinking there while he was there - he came in before the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prosecutor very drunk? A. He was - a man named Easy Chapman had been drinking with him; the prisoner was drinking by himself: the prosecutor went away between two and three o'clock - I have known the prisoner two or three years, by seeing him; he did not frequent the house; I lived seven years with Mr. Muston, of Grosvenor-place - he died, and the establishment was broken up; after leaving there I was thirty-two weeks in the hospital, and sixteen weeks before I went to the Chequers; I have never been in trouble myself.</p>

             re-examined. Q. How did you become acquainted with the prisoner? A. I was not acquainted with him; I have seen him at Chelsea, and considered that he was a bricklayer; I have seen him at buildings, and at public-houses, where he was drinking -I saw the prosecutor put his money down two or three times, but he took it up and put into his pocket again; I never saw it after he said it was lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say he had lost it before the prisoner went away? A. No; Chapman and another came into the room, and he gave charge of them too, but the Policeman would not take them.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you receive the money for his liquor? A. No, he paid at the bar; I am positive Johnson was not there: he told me he had thrown two sovereigns down on the table, and the prisoner had taken them up and gone away with them; I had not been out of the room above ten minutes: the prisoner had left during that time.</p>

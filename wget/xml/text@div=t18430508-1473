                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 6th of May I saw the prisoner driving up the New-road on a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, not more than a mile and a half from High Holborn—he had no whip—I had received information from an<lb></lb>other cabman, went after him, and overtook him in Seymour-street, Euston-square—he went on the stand there—I went up to him and asked if it was his <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said, "No"—I asked where he got it—he said he found it in the New-road—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said he was looking for the owner—I took him in charge; and after I got to the station, asked him how long he had had the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in his possession—he said, "About three hours," which would make it about two o'clock—I searched him, and found a badge in his pocket, with "1890, driver," written on it—that has nothing to do with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—a <hi rend="italic">cab-</hi> man is obliged to have a badge—I asked him at the police-court for his license—he said his master that he previously drove for had it.</p>

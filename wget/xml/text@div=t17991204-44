             sworn. - I am a tallowchandler: On Tuesday evening, about six o'clock, the prisoner at the bar brought a haver sack full of tallow to my shop, No. 17, Gray's-inn-lane, in order to sell it; I told him, we did not buy tallow; I asked him who it belonged to; he said, it belonged to himself; I asked him, what business he was, besides a soldier; he said none; I then asked him, how he came by that tallow; he said, it was his; I then observed to him, that none but a tallowchandler had a right to have such a thing in his possession; I saw it had been split up, after it had been marked, for a tallow-chandler's use, and it was English tallow; if it had been foreign tallow, I should not have had that suspicion; he then said, it did not belong to him, but to a comrade that was quartered with him; he then wished to take it away, but I retained it; he made a great deal of resistance; I told him, he should not take it away till he brought his comrade, or let me send for him; then he said, he would go for his comrade, and I sent my man with him; he said his quarters were in Covent-garden; then he attempted to snatch the bag away by force, he got away from me by force; I sent for a constable, he then went out of the shop in a hasty manner, and proceeded to the corner of Liquorpond-street; I turned back into my own shop and got assistance; he was pursued and brought back to my shop, and then he was taken to Hatton-garden; at the office he said, that his quarters were at the Belvidere, at Islington, and after the examination, I went to Mr. Collier's, knowing that his house joined the Belvidere, and there we learned that he had lost some tallow.</p>

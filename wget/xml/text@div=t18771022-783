                  </hi>. I am a wholesale clothier, of 38, Upper East Smith-field—on 18th October, about 3 p.m., I was in the billiard-room of the "Woolpack, Minories—the prisoner came in, made a remark upon the manner in which some one made a stroke, and then he said that he would play any one for a half-sovereign or a sovereign—Mr. Arnett answered him in a joking kind of way "All right, I will play you!"—after the game which was being played was over, the prisoner took up a cue and attempted to strike a ball, and Mr. Arnett and the prisoner appeared about to commence—they both made two or three ineffectual strokes, knocking the balls about, and the marker said "I will have none of this nonsense, there are gentlemen waiting to play," and took the cue out of the prisoner's hands—the prisoner then walked across the room to a young man on the opposite side, saying "I will have my half-sovereign I have staked"—to my perfect knowledge, he had never drawn any money out; in fact, the marker said that he would not have any gambling—I am positive he never staked any money—several persons said at once "You never staked any money!"—he then attempted to strike the young man—the marker got between them and said "You shall not fight!"—he attempted to catch the marker by the throat, but he was too quick for him, and caught him by his throat with one hand and by his wrist with the other, and pushed him towards the door—I opened the door, and the marker put him out, and told some one to ring the bell—the potman came up, and the prisoner was put downstairs—hearing that he was making a disturbance downstairs, I saw him outside on the pavement, and some coppers rolling about which were handed to him, he picked some up himself, and from a stooping position he turned towards the door, looked round deliberately at everybody standing there, drew a pistol from behind him, and presented it at my head—I was about two feet from him—I had never spoken to him—I ducked my head to avoid the shot, and the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> thing I saw was that Mr. Brown had collared him on one side by the right wrist, and Detective Hutt on the other—the pistol was in his right hand—on the way to the station I saw blood on Mr. Brown's hand, and at the station I saw the inspector draw seven charges from the pistol—the prisoner said to me "I am sorry I did not shoot you, you son of a bitch,</p>

I live at 3, Devonport Street, Commercial Road, and am a stevedore—on 18th October I was playing at billiards with Mr. Arnett, and saw the prisoner come in—he wanted to play Mr. Arnett for half a sovereign, but Mr. Arnett would not—the prisoner took up a cue and said "This is the way to hit the balls!"—Mr. Arnett took a cue and did not hit the balls—the marker said "I cannot have this nonsense," and took the cue away—the prisoner went up to a young man and said "I demand my half-sovereign I deposited with you"—he said "You deposited no half-sovereign"—the prisoner got into a fighting attitude—the marker got between them, and the prisoner was put out—I was after<lb></lb>wards told that he had a pistol in his possession—I went down, saw a little scuffle in the passage, and the prisoner was shoved out on to the pavement—he got up, put his right hand behind him, and drew a revolver and pointed it at Mr. Levy—I caught him by the hand, and took hold of the revolver, and the nipple came down on my hand; here is the wound it made, so that it must have been at full cock—he was given in custody—I had not seen him give any money to any one.</p>

                  </hi>. I rent the billiard-room at the Woolpack—on 18th December the prisoner came in about 3 o'clock—four gentlemen were playing at billiards, and he challenged the worst player of the four to play for a half-sovereign, but playing for money is not allowed—he went down and came up with his coat <hi rend="italic">off</hi>, and began knocking the balls about—I picked up the balls as he was talking a lot of nonsense, and said "This won't suit me; you had better go somewhere else and play"—he said to a gentleman there "I will take my stake money"—he said "What do you mean?" and the prisoner squared up at him—I went between them—he tried to seize me by the throat, but I was too quick for him, and seized him—I asked a gentleman to ring for the potman, who came up, and I said "Show that gentleman outside"—I did not see the prisoner produce any money.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember going any where in search of some fowls? - Yes, to the house of Edward Collins, he is a labouring man, father in law to the prisoner at the bar; I went to the house with a search warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the fowls there? - I did not, I found some feathers in searching about the cellar; I found the sack with five others in it, and I knew that Mr. Hamerton had frequently lost sacks and flour; and his man had been employed about the mills. I am not certain whether he was employed by Mr. Hamerton, or Mr. Hamerton's Bargeman; he worked on the wharf, I was informed; so by the person that keeps the wharf; I took the sack and acquainted Mr. Hamerton of it. This is the sack, I have kept it till now.</p>

               <p>I am son in law to Mr. Hamerton, the sack is the property of the king, I superintend the mills, and I have looked at the sack, and know it to be the king's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - I have seen him at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he ever employed in the business of carrying meal? - He has once or twice, I have seen him in the barge.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether they ever sell any sacks belonging to the crown? - They never sell any sack, and this is a new sack.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way has the prisoner been employed? - As an assistant in the barge, at the time of unloading wheat; we send away our barges empty, and receive them full of wheat, and return them full again, either with meal or flour; we receive the sacks from Deptford, in our own barges.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this sack appear to have had meal or flour on it? - It appears to have had wheat in it the last time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from that circumstance you judge it has not been returned to the King? - It does not appear to have ever carried flour.</p>

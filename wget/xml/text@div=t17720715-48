I then went to the Mansion House, and got Mr. Tinsdale to go with me; we took him back to my house, and then went to his lodgings, where we found about 14 or 15 pieces of silver, makeing about an ounce, which Mr. Tinsdale has got.

               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Have you allowed him to take silver to do a job, provided he would account properly for it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never in my life gave him any such permission; he never asked any such thing.</p>
               <p>Mr Tinsdale. I went to Mr. Bickerton's house; the prisoner was there, and he confessed he had robbed his master at different times; I went to his house; when we came there he denied he had any thing of his master's in the house. I searched, and found the silver in a china pint mug; he then acknowledged he had taken it from his master.</p>

On the Wednesday following (the 28th) he brought me another pair, the fellows of them, and asked me to lend him two pounds upon them; I had taken down before where he said he lived, which was No. 1, Clerkenwell-close; I asked him, as before, how he came by them; he gave me the same account; I asked him if he had a bill and receipt; he said he had; I said I would keep the candlesticks till he went and brought it; he went, and returned in half an hour, and said he could not find it, but if I had a doubt about their being his, I might go to his lodging; I would not, but said if he would call in half an hour, I might let him have the money; he wanted the candlesticks; I said I would keep them till he came again, and would speak to my master about it; he went away, and I went to Sir

            , who kept the Queen's Head, Spittle-fields, brought a box to my house one evening, the latter end of August, or the beginning of September; he said he had an execution in his house, and begged I would go with him; I went to his house; I believe there was a man put in possession the next day; he brought the box, not mentioning what was in the box, neither did I ask him; he desired me to take care of it till he called for it; then he was removed into the rules of Charing Cross, I went to him at different times to see him; I was there on Saturday, and he desired me to come on Tuesday, and bring the box to him; and he would pay me what he owed me, upwards of 9 l. I went on the Tuesday as he appointed; he was gone on board a ship, and I have never heard of him since; I kept the box till after Christmas, before I knew what was in it. In the middle of January, I was distressed for money; I opened the box, as he owed me money, and I could hear nothing where he was; I found the property; I took two candlesticks to pawn; I never took the paper off; I did not see the whole of the things then; I only saw the candlesticks; I pawned them in my own name, in case he sent for them, to take them out again if he paid me the money; I did not know but they were his property; they were nailed down in a thin deal box; I broke the box as I was getting it open, so I put them into a box I had by me; when I kept the tap, I was a single man, and the porters and coachmen brought parcels into my cellar; I never took any charge of things that were brought in my life; my cellar is open to all the coachmen that go on the road; this Jones used to mind my business for me when I wanted to go out to order liquors, or see a friend, which is very well known; I expected witnesses; I wanted my trial put off; I employed a counsel who is not here.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went to the tap-room when I found it was missing, and the prisoner said as he has now, that his vault was public, and he was not accountable for the things.</p>

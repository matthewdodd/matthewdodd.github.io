                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. James Smith, of No. 14, Soho-square. On Friday night, the 28th of March, about eight o'clock, the prisoner knocked at the door, and gave me a note to take to my mas<lb></lb>ter, and I was to bring him an answer—I took it to my master, and he told me to send the boy up—I saw no more of him until about twenty minutes after, when he knocked at the door again—(I had not seen him go out)—he asked me for liberty to stop in the passage until his master came—I told him I would go up and ask my master, which I did, and he told me to let him stop for a while—he stopped for about half an hour—as I was going up stairs with a tray and some tea things, the prisoner said to me, "I don't suppose my master will come to-night, it is getting rather late"—I said, "I dare say not, it is getting on for ten o'clock"—he stood np, and as I went out of the passage I heard him open the street door and bang it, as I thought, after him, but whether he went out or not I cannot tell—about ten minutes before six o'clock in the morning, as I was in my bed-room, I thought I heard footsteps on the stairs—I went out, and thought I heard the chain drop from the street door—I hurried down stairs at quick as I could, and saw the prisoner on the step at the door, putting on my master's boots—he had a bundle, in which I had seen a coat of my master's—another coat laid by it—I took it up, and said to the prisoner, "What brought you here at this early hour in the morning?"—he said he came about his master's business—I said, "No, I think you are about my master's business"—with that he took the bundle and ran into the street—I ran after him, and hallooed, "Thief, thief!" as quick as I could, till I lost sight of him—he let the bundle drop in the street—I afterwards picked it up—it contained the spoons, handkerchief, boots, and ladles, stated, which are my master's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable C</hi> 111.) I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and stopped the prisoner as he was running along Carlisle-street—I did not see Callaghan, but, from information I received from parties who were after him, I took him back to No. 14, Soho-square, where Callaghan imme<lb></lb>diately identified him—the bundle containing this property was given to me—it was about five minutes before six o'clock when I took him—I will swear it had not struck six—I found this hone on the prisoner—the pro<lb></lb>secutor's house is in the parish of St. Ann.</p>

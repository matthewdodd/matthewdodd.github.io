I am a silversmith, and live in Ludgate-street, On the 23rd of June, at half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was in the shop and heard a smash at the window, I turned round and saw the prisoner hit her hand against the window, knock it through, and take soem spoons out—I went out and took her ten or twelve yards off—I took he into custody with six silver tea-spoons—these are them.</p>

I am a physician, and live in Weymouth-street, Portland-place, I have been subpoened in consequence of the prisoner having been frequently a patient of mine, at the Finsbury Dispensary, for the last three years—I cannot take on myself to say distinctly she is not of sound mind, but she has been brought to me on several occasions from suffering under epilepay—I never saw her in a fit—she has on many occasions exhibited great imbecility, and great excitement, but she got better, and has been discharged.</p>

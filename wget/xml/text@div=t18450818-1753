                  </hi>. I am a stone-sawyer, and live at Woolwich; I have been lodging at Driscoll's since Christmas. On Sunday the 13th of July, about dinner time, I was sitting in the kitchen between Dris-coll and another man—Banks was sitting at the table at bis dinner—he came up cursing, swearing, and blaspheming, took out four or five half-crowns, clapped them on his hand, and said he would fight any man in the house—he had had a drop of drink, but was sober enough to know what he was about—he put himself in an attitude of fighting, and struck me in the face with his open hand—he then took me by the breast, pulled me up, struck me, and knocked me down, and when I was down Sarah Banks put her finger in my mouth, pulled my cheek, and caused a wound—she struck me frequently with this iron bar, at least, with some instru-ment; I could not see what it was—Banks had hold of me while I was down, and pulled my whiskers out of me—when I got up I could not stand on my leg; it was broken—I stumbled—Ronan's mother helped me out of the way—I was very much hurt.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 13th of July I heard screams of "Murder!" from Driscoll's house, which is next door to mine—I went and saw Pickett lying on the ground, and Banks kicking him most violently—I saw Sarah Banks go to the fire-place, take a bar of iron which is used as a kitchen poker, and strike him across the back part of the neck, once across the bottom part of the leg, and once across the thigh—she then put the poker down, put her hand inside his mouth, and tore it with vengeance, from whence the blood issued in torrents—I do not suppose Banks would have let go of Pickett had not a man said, "You are no man," and then he ran after that man; but he eluded him, and ran away—I saw nobody else do anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon.

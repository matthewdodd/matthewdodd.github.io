            . I am the nephew of Mr. George Wright. On the 12th of July, in the morning, the prisoner came to my uncle's shop - I did not hear my uncle speak to him, but he told me to ask Mr. Stevenson, one of the young men, if the prisoner wanted his account - I asked Mr. Stevenson, and he gave me an invoice, which was missing; I took it to Mr. Wright, who looked, and found it right - he counted out 13l. 13s., which he gave me, and I took it and paid it to the prisoner on account of Mr. William Jenkins - the prisoner signed his name.</p>

            . He used to bring his money, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160065"></xptr>enter it in a book - he came home, and said Mr. Wright would have paid him if he could have staid, but he was fearful I should be offended had he waited; I do not recollect his saying any thing about Mr. Paterson - it was evening when he returned.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. What was his duty? A. To do what was wanted - I have not brought the book; I generally use it in business, and I did not know it was necessary - Mrs. Jenkins is not here; he has sometimes brought home sums that have not been entered - he may have paid me money in the street; he has paid Mrs. Jenkins money in my absence - I do not recollect his being charged with having received money, and not entering it when he had paid it to her; he did not state at the office that he had paid these sums of money, nor any sum of money; he brought an account from Mr. Fountain that evening, but said nothing of these - I do not know whether he was at home the greater part of the day, when 7l. were paid; he had been one year and three-quarters in my service - I was not told by the Magistrate it would be necessary to produce my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect a day you went to a dog fight, charging the prisoner with having not paid a sum of money which he had received, and finding the week after that Mrs. Jenkins had had it? A. No; I went to a dog fight once, but cannot tell when.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you recollect that very day you received a sum of money of the prisoner? A. I think not; if I had I think I must have recollected it; I will not swear I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not receive it of Mr. Tidcomb, of Knightsbridge? A. I have no recollection of it; I know Tidcomb, he has brought money from him: my only reason for this prosecution was not because I found five sovereigns in possession of his wife; I know Morgan Rawlinson - I did not say I had any doubts as to these sums of money; the prisoner did leave me some time ago, and returned at my solicitation - he was useful to me, but I had not a high opinion of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did he leave you? A. I think somewhere near about Christmas; I gave him in charge on the 23rd of July - he absconded, and went into the country - I pursued, and took him.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was before the Magistrate; there was something said about the money, but it was not gone into; the lady was out of town, but Mr. Wright was there - the prisoner was charged with doing this, but he said nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect any conversation about five sovereigns found on the prisoner's wife? A. No; there was something said about five sovereigns; he said he had taken five sovereigns from him when he apprehended him, that is all I heard said - that was the only money he found on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day I am charged with this I paid 7l.; I might have taken the whole had I been disposed, and other money too.</p>

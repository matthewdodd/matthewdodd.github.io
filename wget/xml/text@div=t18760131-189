                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker in London Street, Greenwich, and also at Lewisham and Peckham—I bought the business at Greenwich in May last, from a Mr. Nash—I took over the whole stock, and engaged the prisoner—he and his wife lived on the premises, and he was manager.—I did not see the child's robe before it was found—I have seen the bed—I purchased one in Mr. Nash's stock that cost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Mr. Nash's pri<lb></lb>vate mark was "May flowers"—there was "M. O. O." on the bed, which means 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was no other bed marked in the same way—I have seen the bed-tick which I believe to be the same—I used to go to the business as a rule twice a week—the card of lockets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in the window—there was a locket hauging on each hook, all new ones—these were not taken from Mr. Nash, but purchased since—I first knew there was a locket missing on the 26th November, the same day the prisoner was dismissed—his fellow-assistant, Arthur Tilling accused him—he came into my room and told me privately—I told the prisoner to go into my room—Tilling was there and Rawlings also—I told him to produce his watch chain; he went to an adjoining room—I said "Lon't take anything off," he said "All right"—he was absent three or four minutes, and when be came in there was neither locket, seal, nor coin on the chain, and I re<lb></lb>turned</p>

               <p>it to him—I said "There are a seal and key missing from a chain from the window, and you have been seen wearing it"—he said "No, I have not'—he afterwards said that he had made the seal and key good in stock for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "You have no right to do so," and "there's a locket miss<lb></lb>ing off the card in the window," he said "Yes, it cost 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—Tilling said "No, it cost 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—produce the locket and let Mr. Balls decide"—I asked him where the locket was, and he said "I have sold it for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said "Who have you sold it to, a person in my shop?"—he said "No, I met a man in the street and sold it to him for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said "You had no authority to do so"—I had not myself seen this locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) hang<lb></lb>ing to the card—I said "Tilling has told me that he purchased a coin during your absence for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and you have been seen to wear it on your watch-cbain, where is it"—he said "I have lost it"—I asked him if he had seen one like it since, and he said 'Yes' he had taken one in pledge of a man for 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said "You had no right, and according to your own account you have robbed me of half a crown"—he said "I paid into the stock 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—which was the money given to the man in buying it—of course all profits belong to me—I had not given him any authority to take any article out of my stock—no assistant of mine is allowed to do so—noth<lb></lb>ing is allowed to be bought without being entered in the purchase-book, nor sold without entry—there is no entry with reference to the coin, seal, key, or locket—I afterwards found this locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) upon one of the hooks on the card—I cannot say which figure it was over—15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was a blank—I have never seen that locket in the prisoners possession—it was never bought for the purpose of Stock, to sell—it never was in my stock at all—the greatest value of it is half-a-crown—I have been a pawnbroker for over thirty years—after the prisoner's dismissal I found among the pledges this duplicate(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and it his writing—I never saw a coin like it—it is a foreign coin, very remarkable—I cannot say whether it is current or historic—I do not know if it is Persian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have three establishments—Rawlings was next in command to the prisoner, only in a different department—he was a salesman—when the prisoner came into my service he had an inventory of his goods—I wished it to be so—he has complained to me of Rawlings—I have charged him with stealing a bed ticking and child's robe—I did tell him to leave my shop and not to come upon my premises again, but as his wife is in the family way and likely to be confined she could remain—he packed his things on the Monday when he came and took them all away, I do not know what in, I was not present—I have not found the seal and key—I have been told a bed of his was left behind—I have not found a bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> His complaint about Rawlings was that in a former employ<lb></lb>ment he had been guilty of some dishonesty—I made inquiries and continued Rawlings in my service; he is in my service now—my people were not allowed to alter the prices of goods marked in my shop, nor any discretion for taking lower prices, only in taking pledges—all goods to the value of 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. must be entered in the book—sales must all be entered in a distinct book—I did not buy all my stock, only for the Peckham house—I bought the lockets at the Peckham house and transferred them to the Greenwich house—the prisoner had authority to buy.</p>

I shall exchange mine for this one"—he pointed to the one marked 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after that I noticed there had been a change, and his own put on the 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I had seen him several times with the locket produced—I cannot say I handled the locket when he asked the value of it; I have handled it. I can swear this is the locket—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in which entry would be made of pur<lb></lb>chases by the prisoner—this is his handwriting upon this page—there is no entry on the 25th September of the coin for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the till money, which I reported to him—Mr. Rawlings keeps the sale book—it is his duty to enter, if the prisoner is himself the purchaser—I remember the stock-taking on the 7th November; the stock was deficient—I made a communication to, Mr. Balls upon that—I was present when the prisoner was called into the room and asked to produce his watch chain; he went into the next room, his bedroom; he was there two or three minutes—I heard Mr. Balls call out to him "Don't take anything off"—I heard a jingling sound—when be came in he showed his chain—there was an old-fashioned seal and key upon it; the key I have seen on former occasions, but not the seal—the coin was not there—I don't recollect whether Mr. Balls said anything to him about the seal and key—there was a something said about the locket—I told him what I knew about it, and he said he had sold the locket to a stranger in the street—he said that it was worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said "It cost 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said "What stuff"—I said "It is false, Mr. Ball's judgment will prove whether it cost 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the gold coin was mentioned—I told him I had bought it for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said "What is it worth, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.?"—Mr. Balls said You have robbed me of baif-a-crown"—he said he had lost it—no refer<lb></lb>ence</p>

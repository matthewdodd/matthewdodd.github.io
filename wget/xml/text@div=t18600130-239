                  </hi>. I am a single woman living at Woolwich—on Tuesday, 27th December, I was in the Standard public-house near upon 12 o'clock; there were several soldiers there—the prisoner was there by himself—no other of his corps were with him—he did not speak to me in the tap-room—he followed me to the bar of the Standard, and gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a glass of brandy—I did not have any, I put the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—after that I went into the back-yard—he followed me there—he wanted to have something to do with me but I refused—he took hold of me—I broke away from him—I went from the yard to the street-door, and at the street-door I got away and went into the street—he followed me, and asked me if I would go with him for the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "No," and then he called me very bad names, and struck me twice in the breast with his fist, and tore my clothes off my back with his hand—after that he put his hand into his pocket and drew out a sailor's knife, with a lanyard or piece of cord to it—I have not seen the knife since—he opened it and attempted to stab me in the neck—by my holding my head down, he stabbed me in the head instead of the neck—I received one blow with that knife—he struck me again with his fist after that—I was bleeding—I was taken by Sergeant McPherson to the union workhouse—I was under medical treatment nearly a month I am sure the prisoner is the man who did it—I saw Ann Ragan and Ann Smith by us—they had an opportnuity of noticing the man.</p>

I am a single woman, of Woolwich—on the night of Tuesday, 27th December, a little before 12 o'clock, I was going by the Standard public-house—I did not go into it—I heard a noise and crossed the road—I saw the prisoner strike Ann Fawcett two or three times, and he made at her head with something in his hand, but I could not see what—I mean that he hit her with something in his hand—it was with some<lb></lb>thing large, I think; I don't know whether it shone—it was something sticking out of his hand—a little after that I spoke to him—I said, "For God's sake, leave the poor girl alone; have you not done enough for her now?"—I saw blood streaming down from her head—I am certain that the prisoner is the man—I don't know that I had seen him before, but I saw him so much that night; I stood a good many minutes looking at them—no police-constable came up while I was there.</p>

I am a single woman residing at Woolwich—I have known the prisoner about six months—when I first knew him he was a recruit—I have seen him several times since—on the night of 27th December last I was going down home past the Standard public-house—I heard cries which came from Ann Fawcett—I walked over and saw the prisoner strike her twice in the face with his fist—I did not see him hit her with anything else besides his fist—the blood was streaming from her head, not from her face, when I went over—I did not see that blow given—I did not notice anything in the prisoner's hand at any time—I am sure he is the man that struck her in the face.</p>

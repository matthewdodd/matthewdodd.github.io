            . On the 24th of October, between 11 and 12 at night, I went to have a pint of beer in a night-cellar, in the <placeName id="t17641212-60-crimeloc319">Hay-market</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When I was stopped, I heard the cry, Stop thief: I turned to see who it could be: a gentleman ran out of a house and laid hold of me: he said, Here he is: the man came up and said he had lost his hat: said I, What is that to me? I did reprimand him, and threaten to strike him, for accusing an innocent person: I struck at him: then he said he would swear I took it: I saw, when before the magistrate, he did not care what he said to affect me. Is it possible a man could see me at the turnings of two or three streets, and at the distance of thirty or forty yards? I am entirely innocent.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What became of the other two men?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They ran after me, as I ran after the prisoner: I did not mind them; he must have thrown the hat away as he ran, but I did not see him do it.</p>

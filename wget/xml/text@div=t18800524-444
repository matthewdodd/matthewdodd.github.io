Annie Jackson. I am a servant in the employ of Mrs. Nash, of 11, Fawcett Street, West Brompton—the female prisoner came to lodge there at the commencement of February, in the name of Mrs. Buhl—she said she was going by the name of Mrs. Lonsdale—she stayed nine days—one day my mistress asked her for some silver that she had lent her to pay a cab fare—she said she would go up and ask her friend if he had any—that was the man who was living with her; he came on the Sunday afternoon—she came down and said her friend had not any money with him; but if Mrs. Nash would change a cheque for her she would pay all she owed her—she said her friend had 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the bank in Lombard Street—the man was in bed at the time—she left next day—I did not see the gentleman at all.</p>

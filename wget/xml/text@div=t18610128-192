                  </hi>. I am a stone merchant of 1, Northampton-street, Lower-road, Islington—on the evening of Tuesday, 15th January, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was in Fore-street, Cripplegate—I went into a public-house there, at the corner of Moor-lane—I had had a glass of wine too much—I went in at the private door of the public-house, the bottle entrance, I think they call it—I called for three-pennyworth of whiskey and warm weter—I put it to my lips, and declined to pay for it—the landlord said that if I did not, they would put me out, and they did so, and when I came out the prisoner was on the pavement—he knocked against me—I felt the blow on my chest, and instantly he turned from me And ran away—I looked down and found my watch gone, and my chain hanging down—he ran away in the right direction, up Moor-lane—18 guineas was the value of my watch—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the chain—it is what they term a patent swivel—this part was pulled open so violently as to straighten it quite—I shouted that a fellow had taken my watch, and the witness, Emma Sydham, came up and ask me if I had lost my watch—I requested her to come to the station—we went together to the station house—there was no other person near me when this occurred—next morning I went to the station between ten and eleven—I was shown I think five men, but I am not quite certain—Is</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the 5th of April, I was on duty in Marylebone-lane, and saw the prisoner in company with another man, (not Willard), he had a roll of something under his arm, and was talking to Moss, a Jew, who keeps a clothes-shop - in consequence of what Moss told me, I watched them to the shop of Barnett, a clothes-dealer, then to the shop of Lazarus - the prisoner still had the goods under his arm - I accosted him, and asked, what he had got there? - he said a piece of silk - I asked if it was his own - he said it was - I asked what he was? - he said, a porter - I asked who to - he said he was a job porter - I said I had seen him go to several shops, which I thought was not right, and asked what colour the silk was? - he said he believed it was red- I asked if he knew how many yards there were - he said he did not - I took hold of him, and the other man, who was afterwards discharged - in going to the station-house, I asked where he lived? - he said, at Bayswater - at the station-house, I asked if he really lived at Bayswater? - he said, "Yes," and he would tell me all about it - I told him to reserve what he had to say, for the magistrate - he said, he was at work at Messrs. Broadwood's, and a man named Willard, who was an under clerk, had given him the silk to sell - he produced a piece of paper Willard had given him, to make a return on it, as to what the silk sold for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He gave you Willard's address? A. Yes; I afterwards saw Willard, and made him write his name on a piece of paper, to see if the handwriting was the same, and it was.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he say Willard called on him to sell the silk, or what? A. He said, Willard gave it him to sell - nothing was said about calling on him - Willard is an under store keeper at Broadwood's; and the prisoner was a French polisher, employed there.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in Wigmore-street, at Mr. Romanell's. The prisoner called at Mr. Romanell's shop, on Friday evening, and told me he had a piece of silk to dispose of, and he wanted clothes in exchange, part in clothes, and part in money - he brought the silk - I showed it our shopman, who told me to have nothing at all to do with it.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Harding and Smith, silk-mercers, Pall Mall. This is one of three pieces of silk which I sent to Broadwood's on the 25th of March - it is a double sarsnet, used by pianoforte makers, and is wider than is generally used - there are eighty yards of it, worth 12l. - this is the wrapper I sent the silk in to Broadwood's - and the mark on the block of the silk corresponds with the mark on the paper.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Friday, Willard came into the shop at Mr. Broadwood's, and said he wanted to speak to me. I went to the bottom of the stairs. He said he had a piece of silk given him by the gentleman (who served Messrs. Broadwood with silk), as a Christmas-box, and he had had it some time - he asked if I knew who was likely to buy it. I said, "No," but if it was his own, and he came honestly by it, the Jews would soon purchase it - he said, "As you go home, you pass several shops, would you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100106"></xptr>go and inquire?" I said I would; and, as I went home, I called at the Jew's, and said, I knew a person who had silk to dispose of - he said, "Let me see it; if it suits, I will buy it." On Saturday, Willard asked if I had spoken to any body? I said, "Yes, and they would look at it"- he brought the silks in his hand to the pay table, in Windmill-street, about half-past six o'clock. I went with him to a public-house - he asked the bar-maid to give him a pen and ink - he wrote me the direction where I was to call. I was not to ask any price for it, but to go, and let him know if it suited the party, and he would call himself, and arrange the price. I went to the shop about the silk, and directly I opened it, I thought it was not his own. The Jew said, if it was gown silk, he would buy it - I was bringing it away, and when I got to Marylebone, (Proctor, my shopmate, was with me,) a Jew caught hold of my arm, and asked if I wanted to buy any thing? - then the policeman caught hold of me, and asked what I had? I said, "Silk." I said it was not my own. I said I was a polisher - I did not say I was a porter - at the station-house I said, "I am drawn into this, and dare say I shall suffer for it, although innocent."</p>

            . I am the prisoner's uncle. He is in my employ - I am a French-polisher - Willard is in Mr. Broadwood's employ, and is called under-foreman, I believe - I remember seeing him on Saturday, the 5th of April - he had a paper parcel in his hand - a light-brown parcel, from ten to eighteen inches - I spoke to him - Willard was in the habit of going into my shop to fetch young men out, to go on errands - the prisoner has been in my employ five years, and always attended to my business.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Willard was employed at Broadwood's? A. Yes; and my nephew was employed on their premises by me - I was employed there by contract - I know they use silk in their business, but I cannot say it was silk - it was a paper parcel that I saw - I never knew a mercer give away silk as a Christmas-box - it might be so for all I know.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HENRY THOMPSON re-examined. I produce the paper the prisoner gave me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When you took the prisoner was the piece of silk rolled up in the same manner as it is now? A. Exactly the same.</p>
               <p>JURY to T. AYLING. Q. Could a person employed under another have access to the silk, he being a French-polisher? A. Not without my consent or Willard's, who had access to it.</p>

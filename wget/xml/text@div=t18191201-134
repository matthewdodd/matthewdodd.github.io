            . On the 13th of November, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was going into <placeName id="t18191201-134-crimeloc780">Drury-lane Theatre</placeName>

I was within three feet of the pay-place; the prisoner was on my right, he pressed against my nephew; I desired him to walk in, he said he should presently. I heard some silver drop, and found my right-hand pocket turned inside out - I told the check-taker of it. I saw the prisoner afterwards at Bow-street, and am sure he is the person who was on my right hand - he was close to the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not take him then - A. There was a pressure at the time. I did not like to interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any one near enough to take it but him - A. Several were behind, but I had my great-coat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You cannot say he committed the offence - A. I will not swear it. The passage was so narrow, it will not admit more than two persons abreast.</p>

            . I am a constable of Bow-street. I was on duty in the theatre, and in the pit entrance several persons cried out that they were robbed. Mr. Ellis pointed a man out to me, whom I took. The prosecutor described the prisoner as the man who robbed him. He came into the theatre again in about an hour, he was pointed out, and I took him.</p>

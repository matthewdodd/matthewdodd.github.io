                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of St. James's Infirmary. I was called on to examine the person of the deceased, on Monday, the 18th of January, in Angel-court, King-street, St. James's, by desire of Sir Na<lb></lb>thaniel Conant, to ascertain whether he was in danger—I found him free from any symptom of injury of the brain at that time—his functions were all performed—he was free from head-ache—he slept well the previous night, and took nourishment—I understood he had received a blow on the head on the Saturday night previous—I examined the wound—it was of a very triffling nature, and nearly healed—it was on the back part of the head, on the left side—the skull was not depressed, that I could discover—it was a small wound—the man was about sixty years of age, neither spare nor robust—he was sober when I saw him—I reported to the Ma<lb></lb>gistrate, that there was no reason to apprehend any danger from the injury he had received—I was called to see him again on the Thursday following, being informed he was still ill in bed—I went to see him in his own house, and saw he was affected with symptoms which I referred to an injury of the brain—there was a dryness of the tongue—his mind was quite ra<lb></lb>tional, but he was in a low condition, his pulse depressed, and he had not much nervous energy—I consider those symptoms were connected with a blow he had had on his head, and then thought them of a dangerous na<lb></lb>ture—I recommended them to apply for admission into St. James's Infir<lb></lb>mary, but application was not made—I considered his case of so much danger, that I recommended the overseer to send him to the Infirmary, but he was taken to St. George's Hospital—I never saw him after the Thursday—he was not in a state of <hi rend="italic">coma</hi> when I last saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a private watchman at St. Jame's Theatre. I was in Angel-court, and heard a scuffle—I opened the door, and saw a man run from a house to the other side of the court—I do not know whether it was the prisoner—he came about nine yards from his door, and put his hand on the deceased's shoulder; and the moment he did it the man fell down on his back—I never heard him speak a word—nobody attempted to pick the man up—I went up, and met the policeman coming down the court, in about ten minutes—I went to pick him up—he was not sensible then—I considered his insensibility arose from drunkenness; for I consider a child might have knocked him down, from the way I saw him before he was knocked down—he was standing, supporting himself with one hand, against the water-spout—the water-spout did not belong to the prisoner's house, but to the house facing his—the man bled at the back of his head, but not a great deal.</p>

                  </hi>. I was surgeon at St. George's Hospital. The deceased was brought there on Thursday afternoon, the 21st of January—he was in a very low, depressed state, and gave me an account of having received a fall on the Saturday previous—I ordered him to bed directly, and he shortly recovered from the state he was in—he was perfectly sen<lb></lb>sible—he complained of no pain in his head—there was no external wound, but an appearance where a wound had been there was no appearance of fracture of the skull—I saw him about two hours after and ordered him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010105"></xptr>
               <p>some medicine—he said he was much better—I saw him again about twelve o'clock at night—he was rather worse, wandering and delirious—I ordered him medicine—he had a very quiet night, and awoke better in the morning—about eleven o'clock he was suddenly seized with symptoms of pressure on the brain, and died in about an hour and half—he was examined next day—I found a large quantity of extravasated and coagulated blood on the surface of the brain, and in the brain—on removing the membranes I found a small fracture at the base of the skull—that was quite sufficient to cause his death—the fracture might have been caused by the fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the appearances you found after death, in your judgement, suf<lb></lb>ficient for you to ascribe his death to what produced the fractured skull? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is my opinion—it is possible he might have died from other causes, but there was quite sufficient in my mind to account for his death—the pressure on the brain occasions the injury—but in this case the frac<lb></lb>ture did not press on the brain, but the coagulated and extravasated blood did, and that occasioned the pressure—the extravasated blood was not in the seat of the fracture—I cannot exactly ascribe the extravasated blood and the pressure, to the skull being fractured—the concussion from the fall might rupture the vessel, and the skull have nothing to do with it—I ascribe his death most probably to the fall, but the fracture alone was not sufficient to cause death unless there had been the rupture of the vessel, and that was too far removed from the fracture to have caused it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If I understand you right, you ascribe his death in the pressure of coagulated blood on the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just so—independent of that fall, the fracture was at a distance—I could not ascribe the pressure of the blood to the fracture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Hearing he was in liquor very much that night, suppose he had made, under the influence of liquor, any violent exertion himself, might it not have produced the coagulation of blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Exactly so; and he might have had a fit of apoplexy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there any difference in the appearance of extravasation, when death is caused by apoplexy, or from intoxication? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he would be more likely to have apoplexy if in liquor—it is impossible to decide whether the rupture was brought on by his drinking improperly, or by the fall—a fall sufficient to cause fracture, might have been sufficient to cause a rupture of the vessels—I cannot undertake to say, but the inclination of my opinion is, the fall was very probably the cause of the extravasation; but still, apoplexy might arise without that—if he had been visited with apoplexy, symptoms of sickness would of course ac<lb></lb>company it.</p>

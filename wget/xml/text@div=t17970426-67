             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I keep the Swan public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the deceased and another man, coming to your house on the 25th of March? - A. Yes; the door was shut up, and Allen, and Withers came up, and said, they would break the door open, if I did not let them in, then they said, they would have but one pot of beer, and be quiet; they came in, and had a pot of beer, and the moment they had got the money, they began to fight; the first hit me, Mrs. Withers then got hold of my hair, and began pulling as hard as she could; I begged for peace, and desired that there might be no fighting.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. They did not make this attack upon you, without your having said something, or done something? - A.Nothing at all; they fixed upon a man that lodged at my house, and said, he was gone out of the house upon something that he should not have been about, and then they began fighting; we got them out of doors, and we had a scuffle out of doors, and the patrol came up, and I did him command peace.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. After you got them out of the house, what passed there? - A. They pulled their cloaths off, and tried to beat us to conquer us.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body fighting when they came up? - A. Yes; Withers and I were both upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Allen doing at that time? - A. I do not know, but I heard Mr. Baker commanding peace.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the blow was struck? - A. No, I did not see that; I had got into the house first.</p>
               <p>GEORGE HUGHES sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am ostler at the Swan: On Saturday night, I was sitting in the house, when Mr. Withers, and the poor man that is dead, and another man, whose name I do not know, came to the door, they swore they would come in; Mr. Colley begged of them not; they begged very hard for a pot of beer, and they were let in, and as soon as they had come in, they pitched upon a young fellow that sat behind me, I do not know his name, and Withers said, he had run away from him the Saturday night before; no, says the young man, I do not know that I ever saw you before in my life; they had some words, and he pitched a top of this young fellow, and Withers hit my master twice in the mouth, and I got up and tumbled him down in the house, and I told him that was the second time he had been there, and always tried to kick up a dust; we got them all out of doors, and then Withers, and I and my master were all down together.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Allen doing at that time? - A. I do not know; while I was down, Witchers bit my ear; I said, do not bite my ear off, and then the patrol came up, and my master applied for peace; my master got in with Creedland, and I staid out, and this Allen was bullocking very much, Baker and I were standing together.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, had Creedland gone in doors with Colley? - A. Yes; then Allen ran at Baker, and pegged at him, and told him he would beat his head off; he ran at him twice, I cannot say, whether he caught hold of him or not; he said, you had better be quiet, for I will not be handled by any body; he had his fist clenched, and he told him he would hear his head off, and his eyes out; Baker and I both desired him to be quiet, and advised him to go home, he swore he would not, and he ran at him again, with both his hands up to his face, and then Baker struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he aim to strike Baker? - A. I believe he would if he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the deceased after this happened? - A. Yes, on the Thursday following; I had part of two pots of beer with him, and he said, he was very sorry for what he had done, that he could blame nobody but himself.</p>

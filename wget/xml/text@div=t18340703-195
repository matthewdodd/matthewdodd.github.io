               <p>AZARIAH LLOYD. I live in Shepherd-street, Golden-square. On the 3d of July I had been drinking rather freely with my friends, in Jermyn-street, at the Harp Tavern- I left there about a quarter before one o'clock in the morning- I went up the <placeName id="t18340703-195-crimeloc1088">Haymarket</placeName>

             (police-constable C 60). I apprehended the prisoner in Regent-street; she was not with the prosecutor - I had received information from him, and took her from his description, having seen her in the street - I said, "Have you got that man's watch?" - she said, "Yes, I have"- I said, "Give it me" - she said, "I will not" - I took a bag out of her hand, and on opening it, at the station-house, I found the watch - she said he had given it to her - I also found a sovereign, three sixpences, and two half-pence on her - the prosecutor was asked if he had lost any money - he put his hand into his pocket, and said he had lost a sovereign, and, he thought, about half-a-crown - the prisoner, said, he gave her the watch, but a gentleman gave her the money.</p>
               <p>A. LLOYD re-examined. I am satisfied I could not have given her the watch, because I would not part with it for 5l. - I missed it directly I parted, from her - I will swear I did not give it her - I kept my money in my left hand pocket - I can undertake to say, I did not give her the money - I know what money I had when I left the tavern; and missing my watch rather sobered me; I directly complained to the policeman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you give me the watch, and say, "Come up here with me, I have no money to give you, here is my watch?" A. I do not believe I did - I will swear I did not.</p>
               <p>H. LOWMAN re-examined. She told me she had got the watch directly I asked her, and at the station-house she said he gave it to her - here is a half-penny, with five holes in it, I found on her.</p>
               <p>A. LLOYD re-examined. I can swear to that half-penny and sixpence.</p>

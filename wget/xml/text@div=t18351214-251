Richard Taylor's—I have sent the prisoner for money, which it turned out had been paid to me; but it was not in his hand-writing—when he handed up the book to me, I found his entering quite correct—It was my business to enter a debt as received from Mr. Hop wood—I sent for it, and Mr. Hop wood said he would call the next morning, as he went to the City—I forget it was paid—such a thing could not happen to the prisoner—the book was always to he had, if he asked for it—I know Messes, Castles and Co., wholesale haberdasher—I never sent to them for money I had received before—It never did</p>

Robert Taylor, and "The Age of Reason," and a great many of Carlisle's works; and I have heard him declare that he believed in the Bible, but believes it to d—d lies.—I stand here to be convicted or acquitted on his oath, which I consider is not binding on his conscience; because he does not believe in Holy Writ—as regards the ac<lb></lb>count in question—I feel convicted that I paid it to him or Mrs. Godby—he sent me to apply for an account at castles and Co., and they showed me the receipt for it, in his own hand-writing.</p>

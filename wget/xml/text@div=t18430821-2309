                  </hi>. I live in Tabernacle-square. I employed the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's horse and cart to remove some goods for me on Saturday, the 25th of July—we ascertained the time he had been employed was an hour and three quarters, and he said it would be two hours before he returned to his mas<lb></lb>ter's yard—I knew the charge was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour—I objected to that, and tendered him half a crown, and he received it, saying he should receive none of that for himself—he said that by way of an inducement for me to give him something more—I gave him the half-crown for his master.</p>

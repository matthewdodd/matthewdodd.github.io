                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Lynes, No. 4, Little Marylebone-street. I have known the prisoner's wife about three years and a half, and him about two years—they have been married about a year and eleven months—at the time of her death she had a child about nine months old—I used to take care of it for her, and have done so since it was about a fortnight old, while she went to work in the day-time—on Saturday morning, the 30th of March, about eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner going down Marylebone-street, and spoke to me—he said, "I think she has <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> it "—I asked what he meant—he said, "She has not been to see me this morning," speaking of his wife—I said she was at work—I saw no more of him till about twenty minutes to seven in the evening, when I was cleaning the stairs of my house—his wife was then up stairs in my room—she had come up there to suckle her child—a little girl, named Sarah Simpson, who is under my care, was in the room with her—when I saw the prisoner he was going to pass me on the stairs—I said, "Stop, wait, <hi rend="italic">old chap</hi>, I have wiped two stairs, stop till I have dried them"—he said, "Oh!" and said, "Is my mistress up stairs?"—I said, "Yes"—he stopped while I dried the stairs—I did not notice anything particular in his manner—when I had wiped the two stairs he went past me,</p>

               <p>and his wife was singing, "Fare thee well, love, I am going;" and as soon as he put his foot into the room, the song ceased—Simpson cried out, "Mother, mother"—I instantly went into the room, and found the prisoner standing with his left arm against my chest of drawers, wiping a razor—the woman was lying dead, with her cheek against the wainscot, bleeding from the neck—I took the prisoner by the shoulder, and asked how dared he ill-treat his wife in that manner—he made no answer—the child I believe was lying under the deceased—I did not see it—it was not crying—the prisoner said, "If one man is not enough, twenty was not too many, you b—r"—he said that, speaking, as I thought, to the corpse, and then went out, down stairs—he walked as fast as he could—the little girl said, "Mother, don't you see the blood?" I ran after him, and called, "Stop him, he has cut his wife's throat"—I stopped him myself in the street—he got part of the way—Davies, my landlord, ran after him—he got three parts of the street—when he saw he was pursued, he turned back to Great Chesterfield-street, where he was living, and I caught hold of him, and said, "Oh, Crouch, how could you do so?"—he never answered me—I left him with Davies—when the policeman brought him up to my room-door again, he shook his head, and said, "Is she dead?"—I said, "Yes, you villain, she is"—he said, "Well, well, I did it, I could not help it"—he was asked what he had done with the razor—he said he had thrown it away—I said, "No, policeman, he has got it, whether it is in his waistcoat pocket, I don't know."</p>

On Saturday evening, the 30th of March, I was called to No. 4, Little Maryle-bone-street, and saw the body of the deceased Mrs. Crouch lying dead on the floor—I found a wound extending from the angle of the left jaw, dividing the left jugular vein, the left carotid artery the windpipe entirely through to the spine, and the right jugular vein and right carotid artery; it was only the spine which kept the head on; that of course would kill her instantly—the wound might be inflicted by a razor—I saw the prisoner about a quarter of an hour after I had examined the woman—my attention was called to a wound in his neck, which had been sewn up when I saw it—I saw him at the workhouse up to the time of his committal, but did not attend him for that wound; he was under the care of the workhouse surgeon—it was not at all a serious wound, dividing merely the integuments, perfectly superficial; I attached no importance at all to it—the prisoner said nothing to me when I first saw him—he was in a state of stupor—that was a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the murder had been committed—that was at the station—I saw him once or twice after, and he expressed great remorse.</p>

               <p>lead you to imagine such is the fact? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have only known that one case, which was under my observation a year and a half; but it is my belief it would be so—there are instances on record where men of unsound mind have recovered their senses by concussion—where one man who is mad might become sane, twenty, in different circumstances, might become insane—after the prisoner left the hospital, he was, by my advice to Sir Laurence Palk, taken to a cottage at Kenton—I did not see him after he left the hos<lb></lb>pital—the opinion I formed of his case, and expressed at the time he left, was, that the great probability was he would not be a useful or good servant, that he would become "a mazed man," as they call it in Devonshire; which means that his intellect would be unsound—the expression means a man cracked or crazed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You meant be would not be able to follow the calling he previously occupied, attending the horses might tend to excite him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I thought he was not to be trusted to drive and ride valuable horses—I did not consider him entirely unfit for the duties of life—he was fit to strap a horse, but I would not trust him to ride a valuable pair of horses—I had done all I could for him as a surgeon, and he was discharged from the hospital—it depends on circumstances what kind of madness concussion would produce—if combined with heat, as I have mostly seen it, he might take a sword and run a man through, <hi rend="italic">run a muck</hi>, as it is called—in India it is generally so—I have not seen it in this country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it likely a person having such a concussion of the brain as you de<lb></lb>scribe the prisoner to have had, having taken liquor calculated to excite his brain? is it probable such a person would be calm and orderly in his demea<lb></lb>nour, so as not to excite the attention of anybody who saw him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot tell you in this country, but, I should say, in India be would be violent—I have not seen madness arising from concussion of the brain—I have seen that man incapable of doing his duty—in my opinion, a person having re<lb></lb>ceived concussion of the brain, and taking alcohol, would, generally speak<lb></lb>ing, exhibit an extraordinary degree of excitement and irritability.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Kenton. I have been in the profession forty-five years, and know Sir Lawrence Palk—I had charge of the prisoner on the 6th of Feb., 1839—I knew him before he sus<lb></lb>tained this accident—he was a very civil, good tempered, active man before the accident, and a good servant—I attended the family, and know he was valued there as a servant—he was a lively and bright man—I first saw him after the accident on the 6th of Feb., 1839, when he was brought from the hospital by direction of Sir L. Palk, and placed in a farm-house under my care—when I saw him he appeared to be labouring under concussion of the brain—the symptoms were clearly those of concussion—when first under my charge he was in a state of great weakness of mind, almost amounting to fatuity when 1 first saw him—the state of the brain was very greatly im<lb></lb>paired—he remained at Kenton five weeks I think—the last memorandum I have of seeing him at Kenton was the 10th of March—I considered it my duty to see him daily—my opinion at the time was that his mind would be affected probably for a considerable period, probably for life—I have known instances of concussions of this nature which have resulted in derangement, both violent and quiet, you can hardly call it morbid—I should not be sur<lb></lb>prised to hear of a man having laboured under such an affection very sud<lb></lb>denly committing a violent act without a motive, and hearing that, I should attribute it to injury of the mind, arising from the concussion he had received—I should not be surprised at his suddenly committing a violent act—I knew an instance about twelve years ago of a servant having met with con<lb></lb>cussion of the brain from a blow, the kick of a horse—without fracture, his brain suffered severely from concussion, he was kept a long period in a quiet state, watched by his friends, and appeared to recover; he was well</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184405060025"></xptr>
               <p>for seven or eight months, and suddenly being by a cider-press drank con<lb></lb>siderably of cider, and became suddenly excited—he drew out part of a plough and attempted to murder his master with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he in a great state of intoxication? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not—I was sent for, and only saw him in a state of great excitement—I knew no<lb></lb>thing of the circumstance of provocation on the part of the master—I was not present—I knew nothing of the circumstances—I suppose it very likely for a person of that sort to be soon excited by liquor, or any exciting cause.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In proportion as the concussion was more or less severe, would the duration of the liability to that sort of derangement continue a longer period? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I believe a slight concussion might so disable the brain as to produce a long confinement, and a violent concussion a short—I should not be surprised to find such a case taking place after five or six years—I should not consider the length of time the patient was in a quiescent state, if I heard of a violent act under excitement.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is concussion of the brain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the consequence of a blow to produce pressure on the brain from a ruptured blood vessel, or from coagulation and stagnation of blood, and disturbing or taking away the functions of the brain, producing in some cases paralysis—it does not always produce death—the brain may remain in a diseased state for life—it would most probably cause an irregular circulation of blood in the vessels of the brain, and in some instances a change of structure in the organs of the brain itself—I had a case of recovery after six years—the son of a surgeon in the navy, at the end of three years, having been kept quiet, was permitted to be rated again—he was sent to a warm climate, but he was obliged to be sent home, but at the end of six years became serviceable again, and was sent out.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does taking a quantity of liquor or ardent spirits by a person having had concussion of the brain produce violent or quiet madness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It en<lb></lb>tirely depends on the constitution of the party—in one it might produce vio<lb></lb>lent madness, and in the other merely unsoundness—I believe, from what I know of the prisoner, it would excite the brain in that way so as to produce a kind of depression, not render him furious or fierce—from what I recollect of his habit of body, I believe it would have a very different effect to that of a person of a more excitable habit—I do not think it would produce violent symptoms so as to call the attention of an ordinary observer—when he left my care, I did not advise that he should be restrained or confined in any way—I wrote to Sir Lawrence, saying he was not to be trusted, and the sooner he got rid of him the better—I did not consider him incapacitated from per<lb></lb>forming the ordinary duties of life—I thought he was by degrees getting into a state to enable him to do his duty.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Horse and Groom, in George-yard, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square—the prisoner was one week in my employment, as waiter and postman—he came from Mr. Fisher to me—he did not suit me—he was not able to perform his duties—I formed an opinion of his state two hours after he was there—the parlour bell rung, and he was in the tap-room smoking his pipe with the customers—I told him of it three or four times—he did not appear to understand me, for he was there three or four times the day after—if one order was given him up stairs, and he was called away for something else, he would forget both orders—he did not appear capable of un<lb></lb>derstanding</p>

               <p>the duties of his situation—he was very dull and depressed in his appearance—I thought he was very lazy—he was subject to drowsiness—he would not get up in a morning—we could not get him up, that was one thing—I thought he was not so sharp as he should be, and that was the reason I did not keep him—I parted with him about ten or eleven weeks ago—I cannot exactly say.</p>

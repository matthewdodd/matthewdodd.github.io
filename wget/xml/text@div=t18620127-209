                  </hi>. I am an assistant in the establishment of Messrs. James Allan and Badger, Cheapside—the prisoner was in their employment as packer, and had been about five years—I was not present when Gaylor the detective, produced three felt hats—this hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I know very well, and these two I have not a doubt about—I know that by the mark inside,</p>

               <p>it is a private mark, the selling price, that is not removed when we sell the hat—I do not know that it has not been sold, only it was found at the prisoner's house—I know it was once the property of my employer—they are worth 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; they are quite new.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the detective officers of the City—on a Saturday, at the latter part of December, I went to Messrs. Allan and Badger's warehouse, in Cheapside—I there saw the prisoner—I asked for his address, and he gave me 15, Aldersgate-buildings, Aldersgate-street—I went there—I saw his wife and family there—I found there the three hats I have produced, and a thin paper bag—I brought them back to Messrs. Allan and Badger's—I showed them to the prisoner, told him where I had found them, and asked how he accounted for the possession of them—he said they were Messrs. Allan and Badger's; that he took them home that morning from the top warehouse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You did not find them secreted in any way, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were in a paper bag between the bedstead and the window, on a box or something.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not take the hats with the intention of stealing them. I intended to return them on the Monday. I was asked by a young man to buy him a felt hat, and seeing these three, I thought I would take them and try them on, and he would very likely give an order for three or four more. I knew I could get a reduction on the price, and so earn an honest shilling or two for my trouble, and return them into stock again on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. OLDACRE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). The prisoner was not allowed to sell any hats without consent—if persons in our employment ask our permission, we sometimes let them take a thing out on approbation; but not without having them first entered—I have no recollection of the prisoner's ever having done such a thing.</p>

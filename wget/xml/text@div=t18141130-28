               <p>Q. Did you see her any more in your shop that day - A. No; she was alone when she came into my shop; we were busy, taking in two bags of biscuits. My brother in law, father in law, and a ship lad were in my shop. While we were taking in the biscuits, a boy came in, and told me we were being robbed; about half an hour afterwards Mary Welch came into the shop; I asked the boy by who, and where, and immediately went into the street. I saw no person; I asked him by whom I was robbed; he said by two women, they had broken a pane of glass, and had taken the bacon out. He pointed to the other side of the way, saying, the two women were in conversation together; the boy is here. I went across the street by the boy's direction; one of the women had a great coat on, I saw her walking towards Long Acre; her name is

I brought her back and sent for the parish constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the bacon in her apron - A. Yes, it is the sort of bacon I had in my shop; there was nothing in to distinguish it from other cheesemonger's bacon.</p>

I was in Belton-street between six and seven in the evening talking to some of my playmates; and while I was talking, a boy came up to me and said this woman had broken the window and taken out some bacon; I did not see it; the boy that told me is not here; I said I would stand a little time, and see if she would do so again. I saw a woman with a great coat on go to Mr. Gosling's window; she seemed to stand a little time with her face towards me, and then she turned her face towards the window; she stopped there about half a minute, and came away with one piece of bacon in her hand, under her coat, with the other arm across, holding the great coat over it; she crossed over the way to another woman that she joined, and they both went to a passage together, they seemed to come out of the passage nearly together; this woman with the great coat on walked up a little towards St. Giles's; she came back again and walked across the way to the window again, and came from the window in the same manner. A little time after I went up Belton-street with the lad, and gave Mr Gosling intelligence; we then saw the same two women in conversation together, that is all I saw. I told Mr. Gosling.</p>

            to Gosling. These are the same women that the boy Bradey pointed out to you; are they not - A. He told me they were the two women; he did not point them out, he said two women, I had no clue at the moment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window of your shop broken - A. The glass was cracked, probably there might be a hole for a finger and thumb to go in; there was not a whole big enough to take bacon out; the pile of biscuits were piled up, so as to screen the window from my sight; afterwards when I took the women, almost all the glass was cut; I found the bacon was gone, and then I found the glass was broken. I examined, with Saint John the constable, and my father; my bacon laid near the window that was so broken.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the bacon the constable has produced - A. The bacon that I had in the window looked like this bacon; this bacon answers to the description of my bacon; I am confident it was taken through the window; the window was broken on purpose to take it out.</p>
               <p>Galloway's Defence. I work for a woman that lives up at Mr. Gosling's house, in the army clothing; when I was stopped, I had no bacon about me.</p>
               <p>Welch's Defence. In going through Belton-street a woman asked me to buy a bit of bacon cheap; I gave her half-a-crown for a large bit of bacon, and fifteen pence each for the other bits.</p>

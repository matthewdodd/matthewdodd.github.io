                  </hi>, I am a widow and live at 3, Albion Place, Camberwell New Road—on 3rd August about 8.45 p.m. I was in a tram car, riding from Westminster to Camberwell—one of the prisoners sat on my Tight side, but I did not see her face, the other prisoner sat opposite—the one next me fidgetted very much, and I thought she wanted room—they both got out at the Elephant and Castle, and I found my. dress disarranged—the conductor spoke to me—I put my hand in my pocket and missed two purses, one of which contained 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other some pawn tickets—they were safe when I got in—the conductor went after the prisoners and I followed and gave them in custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of my purses, with the contents—I have not seen the other since.</p>

On 3rd August I was conducting a tramway car—the prisoner got in at the Obelisk while I was on the top collecting fares—they sat one on each side of the door—Andino sat next to the prosecutrix and Glover opposite—they got out at the Elephant and Castle and Andino gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for the'two—I then spoke to the prosecutrix and in consequence of what she said I went after the prisoners and took hold of Andino's left hand which was under her shawl, and of Glover by her skirt and held them till a constable came—I told him to be careful that Andino did not drop the purse, as it was in her hand then.</p>

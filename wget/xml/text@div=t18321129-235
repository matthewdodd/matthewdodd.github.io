            . I am a biscuit-baker. I am an acquaintance of the prosecutor's, and knew the prisoner lived with him - I met him on the 28th of November, in the Minories - he saw me, and turned down John-street; I followed him through several streets, when he turned the corner, he ran, as I could perceive, by the distance he got- I at last came up to him, and said it was useless his trying to run away, as I should give him in charge - he said he would go with me; I delivered him to the officer; I said he had acted very foolishly in going on as he had - he cried, and said the only thing he had taken was a seal.</p>

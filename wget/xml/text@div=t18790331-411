                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector K</hi>). On 20th January I received information of the burglary at Mr. Wood's, and at 8 o'clock that morning I went with Sergeant Rolfe to 29, Devonshire Street, St. George's, which is a brothel, end found Graham there in bed with a prostitute—two other officers were outside—I told Graham I should take him in custody for a burglary at 111, Devonshire Street, Mile End, on Sunday morning—he said "All right, I will go with you; I know nothing about it"—he dressed himself and put on this coat, (<hi rend="italic">One of those identified</hi>)—I handed him over to another officer—he is known among his companions as Knocker—I then went to 11, Roberta Place, about five minutes' walk off, where Neil occupied the front parlour—I told Neil I had got <hi rend="italic">Knocker</hi> in custody for housebreaking, and was going to search the place—he said "He don't live here; I don't know anything of him"—I do not know of my own knowledge whether Graham lived there—we searched the room, and I saw Rolfe find in a cupboard this large nail (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I said to Neil, "What is this for? is it a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>?"—he said "That is what we use to hang the meat on"—Rolfe asked him what the rag was tied round it for—Neil's wife said, "It is to prevent the children knocking their eyes against it under the mantelpiece"—there was a hole under the mantelpiece, and Neil said that the nail was put in there to roast the meat—I saw the children; they were not tall enough to be in danger from the nail—the nail would not go into the hole on account of it being turned up—we took possession of it, and as we were leaving Neil said "You had better go round to my landlord round the corner at the grocer's; he will give you my character; he will tell you we are respectable, hard-work<lb></lb>ing people"—he did not give the name—I went round to the shop he mentioned, and it was Tannebaum's, 7, Thomas Street, about fifty yards from Neil's—Tannebaum's same was up—it is a chandler's shop—I saw him, and said "I have got a young man in custody this morning for house-breaking; he lives at 11, Roberts Place; I have been there and searched the place, and they deny all knowledge of him, and say that they are hard-work<lb></lb>ing people, and refer me to you for a character"—he said "They have been my tenants for some years, and are respectable, hard-working people; in fact 1 cannot say too much in favour of them"—I left, obtained a search warrant, went back between 12 and 1, and said to Tannebaum, "You remember seeing me this morning; did you buy an umbrella on Sunday?"—he said "No"—I said, "Now be sure"—he still said that he did not—I said, "Then I have a warrant to search your house"—he said, "Let me see it"—I handed it to him—he went to the window, read it, handed it back to me, and said, "Yes, I think I did buy one"—I said, "Let me have it, then"—he went upstairs, and I followed him to the corner of a room where there were 10 or 12 umbrellas, handed one to me, and said, "Here it is"—I said, "This is not the one I want, I want one with a buckhorn handle"—he went to a wardrobe in the room, opened the door, and after two or three minutes produced this umbrella from behind a number of coats hanging up—I said,</p>

               <p>"Did you buy anything else with it, a plated mug and sugar basin?"—he said "No"—I told him I should take him in custody for receiving the umbrella, well knowing it to have been stolen—I took him in custody, and left two officers in charge of the house—I went back afterwards, made a further search, and found two mugs, a sugar basin, this fusee case, and the overcoat which Mr. Wood has on now, which was given up to him by the Magistrate's permission—the fusee case was locked up in a bureau—I saw Sergeant Rolfe find some gloves in the pocket of the coat Fox was wearing, which he took off and threw on the sofa—the coat Mr. Wood is wearing was hanging up with the umbrella—I found a great deal of property there, which we took away in a cart and two or three cabs; there was a couple of van loads altogether—there were more than 1,000 articles; I made a list of them—I compared this nail with Mr. Wood's window, and it tallied exactly, and also with some marks on the jamb of the drawing-room door at Mrs. Cordingley's, 6, Addington Road, Bow—on the Sunday week, 9th February, I went to Neil's house and took him in custody for being concerned with Knocker in breaking into 117, Devonshire Street, and several other places—he said "All right"—I told him some of the property had been found at his place—he said, "I have got the bills relating to them"—Sergeant Rolfe took possession of some duplicates—I said, "It is nothing to do with the tickets, it is the gloves"—he said, "We have had them a long time;" I think he said about 12 months; "my wife bought them in the Lane"—the gloves had not been produced then—these are the three pairs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the way to the station I said, "The <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> corresponds with the marks at 111, Devonshire Street, and also on the door at No. 6, Addington Road"—he said, "I told you before it is what we use to hang the meat, on in front of the fire"—he made no answer to the charge at the station nor yet before the Magistrate—I got this card, "Lewis Tannebaum," at Tannebaum's house—this wedge was found in the pocket of the coat Graham was wearing when he was searched at the station.</p>

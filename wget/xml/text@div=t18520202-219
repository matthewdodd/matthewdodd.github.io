                  </hi>. I am one of the Hertfordshire police. On Monday night, 12th Jan., by the directions of my superior officer, I went to the premises of Mr. Kemble, at North Mimms—I concealed myself in the rick-yard, under a shed there—there was a load of clover hay in a cart, ready to go to London, on the top of which was a truss of clover hay—about 20 minutes to 3 o'clock Plummer came—he stood about some little time, looked round him, and afterwards went directly across to the rick-yard—there was a stack of meadow hay there, which I had put a mark into; and when he got over into the rick-yard, he went to the meadow hay, cut a bundle of it, and tied it up—I after<lb></lb>wards found that bundle tied to the front of the cart, what is called a swinger—I afterwards saw him bring it out of the rick-yard, and lay it down by the side of the cart—I saw him set out about 3 o'clock—I and Ryder followed the cart to the Swan with Two Nicks, Finchley-common—Reynolds is the ostler there—I did not know him before—Plummer drew the horses up in front of the house, and went up the yard—I stood by the cart—he went up the yard, and was gone several minutes—he came back, got on top of the cart, and took a bundle of clover hay off, which he took round the house, to the yard at the back; but I lost sight of him, because I stopped with the cart—after some time, I had a signal from Ryder—I went and assisted in taking the prisoners—I found the swinger tied on the side of the cart, and in it I found my mark (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). I was with Bourne—I saw Plummer put some meadow hay on the cart, and about 3 o'clock in the morning he started for Loudon—when he got to the Swan with Two Nicks, at Finchley, he stopped, and went to the stable door—he called out, and Reynolds, the ostler came—they conversed together about five minutes, but I was not near enough to hear what was said—Reynolds then went into the back-yard, and Plummer went back to the load of hay, took part of the truss of clover hay from the top, put it on his head, and carried it about fifty yards into the back-yard, where Reynolds was standing on a short outside step-ladder leading into a loft—Plummer said to Reynolds, "Where will you have it?"—Reynolds</p>

               <p>said, "Bring it up here"—Plummer got two or three steps up the ladder—Reynolds was in the act of pulling it; I cannot say whether he touched it, but he saw me, I suppose, for he said three times, "Take it down; I told you I would not have it"—I gate a signal for Bourne, and the prisoners were both taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. Plummer was in my service, his duty was to take the load of hay to town—he was allowed about a truss of clover hay for his horses, whieh was loaded with the hay on the cart—it ought to be under the cover—he had no authority to leave it anywhere, or to dispose of any portion of it.</p>

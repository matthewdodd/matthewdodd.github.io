The prisoner came into my service on the 6th of November, and left on the 25th of January; about six weeks after, we missed a pearl brooch, with other articles. I did not see her again until the 5th of May, when I found her in service at Mr. Woodroe's, in Smithfield; I asked her what she had done with the articles she took when in my service; she fell on her knees, and said she hoped I would forgive her; she denied taking any thing; I found the brooch at Muncaster's, the pawnbrokers, on Snow-hill; I had not seen it, perhaps, for twelve months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. She was not above six months with you - A. No; I had a good character with her, which I found false.</p>

            . The prisoner was in our service, and some time after she left we missed a pearl brooch, among other articles; it was kept in a box locked up in a cup board, in an upper room; I kept the key of the box; I saw it in the box about a fortnight before the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140016"></xptr>left; I have seen it at the pawbroker's, and know it to be ours.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in St. Dunstan's-court, Old Bailey. The prisoner lodged with me, both before and after she was in the prosecutor's service. I saw a pearl brooch in her possession a Sunday or two before she asked me to pawn it; this was in March - she said it had been pawned before, but did not say where. I pawned it for her at Muncaster's, and gave her the duplicate, and money - she waited outside the door the while.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She knew you dealt at the shop - A. Yes. I think I should know it again; but not if I saw it among others - there was a pearl or two out at the end of it.</p>

On the 4th of December, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought a pair of pumps, which came to 10s.6d.; he tendered me a 5l. note, I asked him his name? - he gave me the name of "George Meson." I asked him where he lived? he made a motion with his hand, and said, "through the turnpike, (pointing towards Cambridge-heath). I asked him if it was Newmarket-terrace? he said, "Yes." I indorsed the note"G. Mason, Newmarket-terrace, 4, 12, 17," (looking at it)-this it. I gave him four 1l. notes, and the rest in silver - He went away. About three weeks after I went to Newmarket-terrace to inquire, but could find no such person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. It was about seven o'clock in the evening. I had never seen the man before. He had a great-coat, striped waistcoat, leather breeches, and top-boots-the leather breeches appeared dirty. I paid the note to Mr. Neave, at Aldgate.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was he in your shop-A. Not more than ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour (looking at him) - I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COE. I am a tax-gatherer of Bethnal-green. There is no person of the name of Mason on Cambridgeheath - They may be lodgers.</p>
               <p>JOHN EDEN. I am servant to Mr. Pocock, shoemaker, who lives at Shoreditch. I remember the prisoner coming to my master's shop about a month before; he gave me a note - He was with a friend, who bought a pair of shoes, and left a pair of pumps. On the 14th of October, which was a month after, I was standing at the door, he came in, and asked if his friend had called for his pumps? I said he had got them for him. He asked to look at a pair of Wellington boots in the window - He tried them, and bought them, they came to 15s. He pulled out about 12s., and said he had not got enough, and I must give him change for a 5l. note. He gave me the note, I asked him his name? he said, "Perkins, Nelson-terrace, City-road"-(looks at a note) this is it - I indorsed it. I went to Goddard's to get it changed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I had seen him about a month before - He had a snuff-coloured coat on. About six weeks after I heard the note was forged. I saw him on the Monday at Cold-bath-fields; a great many people went with me to see him - He was brought down by himself.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. How long had you an opportunity of observing him - A.About ten minutes the first time-the second time, I delivered him the pumps, knowing he was the man who had been with his friend to buy the shoes - He was in the shop about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>CHARLES PAUL THORPE. I am a shoemaker, and live in New Inn-yard, Shoreditch. I know the prisoner. On the 13th of November, about six or seven o'clock in the evening, he came to my shop, and bought a pair of shoes, for himself, and a pair of boots for his wife, as he said - They came to 15s. - he was there about a quarter of an hour - He gave me a 5l. note; I asked him his name - He said, "Mason, Nelson's-terrace, City-road," which I wrote on the note-(looking at one)-that is the note he gave me; it was fastened together, which I observed to him; he said, he had half from the country one week, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140024"></xptr>other the next. I went out, got change, and gave it to him, he went away. About a fortnight or three weeks after I saw him coming out of Gregory's shop, in Shoreditch (the note had then been returned to me). I did not see his face. I followed him into Brown's-lane - He went all the back way; I followed him about half a mile. I got a glimpse of his face, and knew him again - He went into a public-house. I found out where he lived, and went home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. It was between six and seven o'clock in the evening. I am positive it was the 13th of November; he was dressed in a grey great coat, corded breeches, and top-boots; he had a black enamelled ring on his finger - He had not got pantaloons on. I was fetched there to see him by Gregory's shop-man, who followed him, with me, into the Laurel Tree public-house. I saw Locke, the beadle, and told him my business; he said if he was the man, he could find him any day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not offer to take him, if you was sure he was the man-A. I believe he did. He was taken a week or a fortnight after. I never said I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said to Miller, the officer, that he wrote the name and address himself-A. No.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 13th of November I saw the prisoner in my husband's shop; he bought a pair of shoes, and a pair of boots for his wife, between six and seven o'clock in the evening; we had a lamp and candles in the shop-(Looking at the notes.)-the hand-writing on the back is my husband's-the prisoner told him what to write. I saw the prisoner again in the parlour of the Fir Tree public-house, Whitechapel, soon after. I went into the room-there was about twenty gentlemen there. I had not been told that the prisoner was there - I picked him out immediately; I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. A person fetched me there. I went into the parlour alone - I went into the middle of the room and sat down - I knew him immediately.</p>

On the 7th of November, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop; he bought a piece of Irish and two squares of muslin, which came to 4l.5s.; he tendered me a 5l. note; I asked him to write his name and address on it - He wrote "Collins, 17, Little Moorfields;" I put my initials to it-(looks at it)-this is it - I took it to the Bank next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the change-A. No; I told him I must enquire if he had given a right address; he said I could send my lad with him - I told him I should go myself; he walked gently to the door, while I was taking the change, and going to the door I found he was gone, and had left the goods - I could not find him.</p>

I saw him again last Saturday in Newgate, with five or six more, and picked him out without the least hesitation; I asked him if his name was Seckerson? he said it was, and that he knew what I came about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. He was then under a charge of forgery; I am certain he is the man; he had on top boots, dirty leather breeches, and a light coloured frock coat.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CHRISTMAS. I am an inspector of bank notes to the Bank of England. The note uttered to Scrase is a forgery-it is neither the bank plate or paper, nor is it the signature of the person it purports to be-(looking at the four other notes) - They are all forged in every respect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner - A. Yes, at the Hope public-house, in Pollard's-row, on Saturday night, the 18th of December; there was about twenty persons in the room - He was one of them. A gentleman of the name of Jordan said he had heard that Seckerson had uttered a 5l. forged note to a Mr. Thorpe, of New Inn-yard, Shoreditch; that Thorpe had afterwards watched him to several places, and that it was supposed he went into different houses to avoid him; that they then watched him to a pawnbroker's, opposite Brown's-lane; the prisoner admitted that he had been to the pawnbroker's, but denied going to any other place. Jordan said it was necessary the prisoner should clear his character; it was hinted that I being in the room was not acting right, by not making enquiry. I asked the prisoner to go to Thorpe with me; he refused - I asked him to appoint some other time, which he also refused. I then said he must-several of the company came round, and abused me, and said I should not take him; I got assistance, but did not take him away that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I live within eleven doors of the house, and go there frequently. I do not remember seeing the prisoner there before. Messrs. Wood, Homewood, Wilson, and Jordan were there; neither Mr. Homewood or Mr. Jordan abused me; it was on the 20th. On the Monday the prisoner attended at the office-Homewood engaged to produce him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you would take him into custody, or that he had better put himself under your protection - A. I said he had better put himself under my protection, and I would see him righted.</p>

The same day I went with Mr. Wood to Mr. Homewood's, the Hope public-house, in Pollard's-row; Mr. Welch, who was there, told me I had been followed by a man who had taken a bad note, and thought it was me, and if he could have sworn to me, I should have been apprehended, as the officers were with him; the company laughed at the mistake; I thought no more about it-it was mentioned one night when Mr. Christmas was there. On Saturday night, the 20th of December, three weeksafter, the conversation was brought up again; Mr. Christmas, who was one of the company, told me to put myself under his protection - He at length told me I must go with him - I felt indignant at it, and refused; my employer and Mr. Homewood, who was there, offered 1,000l. for my appearance. I remained in the room for an hour and a quarter-Miller and Freeman, the officers, came - They said information was given them of a person like me, but they were satisfied I was not the man; they said if I would come to the Fir Tree, public-house, on Monday at twelve o'clock, they would collect the persons who had followed me; to this I agreed, and was there punctual to the time. I there saw Thorpe, who said I gave him a 5l. note, and wrote the name on it myself, and that his wife would know the man in a moment; I was desired to write my name to compare with the note - I begged that Thorpe's wife might be sent for - She came, and staid in the room at least ten minutes; the company were told to stand up with their hats off; at length, from my having a coloured coat on, she went out, and asked if I was not the man. I do not mean to say that the witnesses swore wantonly against me, but, from my likeness to somebody else, they are mistaken. After Thorpe had seen the note, he said he wrote the name himself.</p>

               <p>RICHARD WOOD. I am a silk-weaver, and worked with the prisoner in December last, and for six months before that; he lived in George-street, Bethnal-green, I lived there with him for four months. When I went to work at eight o'clock in the morning, I generally found him at work; I used to leave off work at eight o'clock at night, and, from the quantity of work that the prisoner did, he must have worked till ten. When he went out he was either dressed in a blue or green, and not a striped waistcoat, chocolate coloured trowsers, a blue coat, and a grey great coat. I never saw him in a different dress, except in a different waistcoat; he had got a chest, which contained his clothes - He generally wore shoes, I have seen him wear Wellington boots. On the 6th of December he moved to Wellington-place - He worked for Mr. George Ransom. On the 4th of December I was finishing my work in George-street, in order that we might move on the Saturday; we wanted to knock the looms down, and take them away-they were taken down on the 5th; I had an opportunity of seeing him on the 4th; I was there in his house at work from half-past eight o'clock in the morning till a quarter to nine; I boarded with him - He worked with me the whole day. When I left him at a quarter to nine o'clock he was at work - We were both at home the whole day; I work in the same shop with him - He could not be absent without my knowledge - He was in his working dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the 12th of November-A. I do. On the Wednesday morning the house was broken open, and his work, which was a damask scarf, was taken away-it was between the 11th and 12th. On the 13th, in consequence of the robbery, the prisoner and myself went to Mr.

            's, in Church-street, Bethnal-green, to get his cane to make fresh work-this was about four o'clock, we went out together - I left the prisoner at the corner of Pollard's-row.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is Middlesex-place, Hackney-road, from where you work - A. About a mile and a half from George-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he on the 4th of December so long absent as to go a mile and a half and return without your knowledge - A. It is impossible. I saw him about half an hour after I left him at the Hope, public-house, in Pollard's-row, which Homewood keeps; he had his cane-it is about a quarter of a mile from his master's-Mr. Bartlet and Mr. Homewood were with him - He had neither boots or breeches on, he had pantaloons on. I staid at Homewood's with him till about five o'clock - He went away to go home - He came to the Hope again about half-past six, with his master; he did not bring his cane with him-his dress was not changed; we staid there together till about nine o'clock. When he left I remained there with Ransom - He continued to work till he surrendered himself to the magistrate. Homewood's is about a mile from New Innyard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. I worked in the same room with him - I believe he did not go out of the room - I am sure he was not absent - He worked late to finish his scarf on the 4th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he was not absent an hour on the Friday evening - A. Yes - He was taking down the looms.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CLARK. I have worked for the prisoner ever since Whit Monday. I used to go to him at six o'clock in the morning, he began to work then. Wood and him worked together in the same room-the prisoner left off work at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day he moved from George-street to Wellington-place - A.He did move - He took the looms down on the Sunday morning; I think it was Tuesday morning that he moved.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether he was at work in particular on the day before the looms were taken down-A. He had a fresh cane, he was ill with the govt-he used to wear a brown jacket, black waistcoat, trowsers, and buckled shoes to work in-when he went out he used to wear brown trowsers, a mixture coloured great coat, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140026"></xptr>a blue under coat. I had an opportunity of seeing his clothes, I used to put them away - He had got a pair of boots without tops - He mostly were shoes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. He was very bad before he moved, and could not walk.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went to live with him on Whit-Monday; where did he live then - A. In Castle-street; he moved from there to George-street.</p>
               <p>Q.Was what you have been telling us when he moved to George-street, or when he moved from George-street to Wellington-place-A. When he moved to George-street; I remember his moving from George-street to Wellington-place not long before Christmas; at that time the looms were taken down on the Friday, and he moved on Saturday. Wood worked for him in George-street - he used to come at eight o'clock in the morning, and dine with my master; my master was hard at work to get done, to take the looms down - We worked till ten o'clock on the Thursday night, and finished on Friday at one - I was in the house all day on Friday-my master was not out of the house all day. What I said of his having the gout was before he moved from Castle-street.</p>
               <p>ROBERT RIGG. I am a carrier. I moved the prisoner's looms from George-street to Wellington-place on Saturday, the 6th of December.</p>

            . I am a silk-manufacturer; the prisoner worked for me. On the 13th of November, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, he came to me - I know it was the 13th, because he was robbed on the 12th; I saw him with Wood at the corner of Pollard's-row - I stopped with him about a quarter of an hour - He then went to the warper's, in Quaker-street-Wood left him at the corner of Pollard's-row. I saw him at the Hope, public-house-the prisoner came there with his cane about half-past four o'clock, I left him, with Wood and Bartlett, about five. I returned to the Hope about seven o'clock, and found him there, and left him there after eight o'clock-he had brown pantaloons, a blue coat, grey great coat, and shoes on - He had not got leather breeches, or top-boots on, I never saw him dressed so; from the quantity of work that he did, he must have worked twelve hours a day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing Thorpe at the Fir Tree, public-house-A. Yes; there was a quarrel about a note-to the best of my recollection, Thorpe said the man wrote the name on the note himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. He must have gone to the warper's himself, they would not have given the cane to any body else. I saw him again between four and five o'clock at the Hope, public-house. New Inn-yard is full a mile from the Hope. On the 8th of December he brought to me sixteen scarfs.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOMEWOOD. I am the landlord of the Hope, public-house. The prisoner has frequented my house two or three times a week, for an hour or two in the evening; I have known him seventeen years. There used to be a party of neighbours meet at my house in the evening - I remember in November last, the day after he was robbed, he came to my house with his cane, Messrs. Bartlett, Ransom, and Wood were with him. I found him there at five o'clock, when I came down stairs; he was in my house about an hour after that time - He returned about a quarter or half-past six o'clock-Mr. Ransom came again. I remember the 20th of December-it had been rumoured that he had been followed on suspicion of having passed forged notes; I told him of it for three weeks or a month before the 20th. Mr. Christmas used to come to my house every night for many years-the prisoner had opportunities of seeing him there, and knowing what he was. On the night the accusation was made there was some words between Mr. Christmas and the gentlemen - I offered 500l. for the prisoner's appearance - He has an excellent character - I never saw him dressed in leather breeches and top-boots in my life, or with a ring on his finger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. I believe he returned about half-past six o'clock - He being robbed makes me remember it - I collected some money that evening to make up his loss.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DIBBEN. I am shopman to Mr. Fremont, a stationer. I was called upon to attend at Lambeth-street office to prove who uttered a forged note to me. The prisoner was accused of it, he is very much like the man-but, upon looking attentively at him, my opinion is that he is not the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. I am quite sure he is not the man - I should know the man directly if I saw him.</p>
               <p>EDWARD RANSOM. I am a tobacconist, and live in Church-street, Bethnal-green. I knew the prisoner two years. About the latter end of November my wife called me down to give change for a 1l. note-the man was dressed very much like the prisoner. I did not change the note - He is about his height and age, and had a ring on his finger, and a mixture coat on.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner four or five years. About five weeks ago I met a person in Shoreditch whom I took for him, and was going to speak to him, thinking it was the prisoner.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MILLER. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. - The prisoner went to the office with me on the 22d of November at the charge of Thorpe. I went and searched his house, but found no bank notes there, good or bad. - There was a pair of old boots, not top-boots. I found no umbrella there, or leather breeches.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. This was on the Monday-the charge had been made against him on the Saturday.</p>

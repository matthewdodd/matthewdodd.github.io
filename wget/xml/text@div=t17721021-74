               <p>Blake. No: I told them they had met with a bad bargain, for I had no money; one of them laid hold of my coat, and asked me what I had in my pocket; I told him it was a shirt; he said a shirt would be of service to him; he put his hand into my coat, and then into my breeches pocket; the other held me by my neck; then they bid me strip off my coat and waistcoat; I was sometime in getting them off, the sleeves being tight, upon which the lusty man swore to the other, and said he would blow out my brains if I did not make haste; they took my coat, waistcoat, hat, shoes, a silk handkerchief and buckles; then they went off into the field; some people afterwards helped me to some cloaths out of compassion, and the next day I went to Edmonton, and worked with Mr. Holland; on the Thursday following, two men (Flanagan and Dawson) came to me from Mr. Wilmot's; I went to Mr. Wilmot's, and I found the prisoners there in custody, and my coat and waistcoat were brought there.

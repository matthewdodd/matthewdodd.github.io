               <p>Q. Did you consent to their being continued in pawn?</p>
               <p>Manden. No, I offered to take a trifle a week, or if she would take out one thing at a time; but I never had any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after she had confess'd they were in pawn, was it before she was taken up.</p>
               <p>Manden. About two months or upwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How had she an opportunity to get them from you?</p>
               <p>Manden. She lay with me in the same room where the things were.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, the prisoner brought a silk petticoat, a Holland sheet, and six aprons, a table cloth, and a handkerchief to pawn to me.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose name did she pawn them?</p>
               <p>White. She laid them in her own name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask her if they were her own?</p>
               <p>White. I did, she said they were her own.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bring them all at one time?</p>
               <p>White. No, she brought them at several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>White. I did, and where she lived?</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say she lived.</p>
               <p>White. She said she lived in Old-street-square; she had pawn'd some other things, which she said were the prosecutrix's, but they were fetched out again.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. Did you give her liberty to pawn any of these things?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>White. The prosecutrix came to our house with a list of the things, and desired me not to let the prisoner have them, till she herself came with her.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175806280005"></xptr> After that she came with a warrant, and I delivered them all up.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you deliver them?</p>
               <p>White. I think it was the 14th of this instant.</p>
               <p>William Smith. I went along with the prosecutrix to the justice for a warrant, and took up the prisoner, who owned to me she had taken every thing mentioned in the indictment, and where they were pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say the prosecutrix gave her leave to pawn them?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, she did not, we went and fetched the goods from the pawnbroker's, and before the justice, though blind, swore to them all; she swore she cut out her own shifts, aprons, and gowns; that the shifts, petticoat and aprons were of her own making, (an apron is put into her hand.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is not of my making, nor my apron. She takes up her aprons, petticoat and table cloth, and mentioned particular marks on each, and shew'd them very exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>She gave me leave to pawn them to get money to buy coals and candle.</p>

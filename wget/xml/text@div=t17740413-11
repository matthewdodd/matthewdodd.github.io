            . I am a servant to Mr. Sherwood; the prisoner came up to me as I was dressing the horse and asked me who learned me to dress a horse, and found fault with me; I locked the horse up in the stable; after that when I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177404130005"></xptr> open the stable door at night, I found the lock broke open and the horse gone; I ran to my master and informed him of it; he sent out several persons in pursuit of him; I found the horse three or four days afterwards at 'squire Weston's in Surry.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the horse?</p>
               <p>Wenham. Yes, vastly well; Mr. Weston's butler knowing he wanted such a horse bought it for him; I fetched the horse from Mr. Weston's.</p>

               <p>Chunn. Yes; I was to give him ten pound for it, but in paying the money there was threepence over, which I gave him.</p>

            . I keep a public house at Epsom; the prisoner came to my house between ten and eleven o'clock at night, about the time horse was stole, and lay there all night; he had a brown bay horse with him; when he got up in the morning he said he was going to shew it to a gentleman that he believed would buy it, and whether he did or did not he should come back and pay his reckoning, but he never did come back or pay his reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the horse since?</p>
               <p>Bloss. Yes, since it has been restored to the prosecutor; I am sure it is the same I saw the prisoner with.</p>

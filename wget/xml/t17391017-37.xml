            . I and Mr. Pay were station'd on board the Voluntier; we came up to Ratcliffe Cross on the 1st of September, and the Ship lay facing that Place between Twelve and One in the Morning, September the 2d. At that time it was my Turn to watch; and hearing a Noise between Decks, I went down with my Candle and Lanthorn, and found the Prisoner and the Boastwain with two twelve-Gallon Casks of Rum; I told them I must take Care of them; but while I was arguing with the Boatswain, the Prisoner got one of them up upon Deck: I told him that he belong'd to a Man of War, and was only employ'd to work the Vessel up the River, and therefore that he had no Business with the Liquor; and I call'd to Mr. Pay, and to Mr. Blake, (an Excise-Officer) to help me; and we carry'd the Casks into the Steerage. Then I went down, and found two more Casks in the Bulk-head; but before I could remove them over the Cable-Teer, I heard Blake cry out, Murder! Upon this I ran up, and found the Candles and Lanthorns beat out, and the Prisoner immediately knock'd me down: The two first Casks which we had stopp'd, we had carry'd into the Steerage; and they were left under the Care of Pay and Blake: but while I was gone down to search farther, they fell upon the Officers, beat them, and got the two Casks over the Side of the Ship. When I found the Candles beat out, I attempted to strike a Light, and then they struck me a Blow in the Face, and beat away my Tinder-box, and got two more Casks from us, damning us, and telling us, - they would have them, or they would have our Bloods. When the prisoner was taken, he told us where the Liquor was, and we found it, according to his Direction, at the Lamb and Star at Newcranes.</p>
               <p>Counc. When you came up, on the Cry of Murder, did you see the Prisoner do any thing to Mr. Pay?</p>
               <p>Howard. No; I was knock'd down as soon as I got up. I am a Custom-house Officer; this is my Deputation, and I was on Duty on board this Ship.</p>

            . Between Twelve and One, that Night, I came out of my Cabin to make Water; and was going in again; but my Partner hearing a Rumbling, he took a Candle out of the Steerage, and call'd me to see after this Liquor. I roll'd out one of the Casks; and as I was going for the other, I saw a Man carry away one of them.</p>

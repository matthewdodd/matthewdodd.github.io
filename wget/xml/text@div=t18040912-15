               <p>Q. What day was it? - A. On the 17th of July, at dinner-time, Mr. Arnold called to me; I went to the back and he went to the front of the building; I saw the prisoner go up the ladder; after being up there some time, he brought down two saws - a tenon saw, and a hand saw; I was looking through a putlock hole in the wall; he unbuttoned his waistcoat, and put it under, and buttoned it and his great coat very tight; then he went out of the back door; I let him go about four yards, and then I stopped him; he asked me what I wanted of him; I told him I wanted those two saws which he had taken out of the house; at the same time Mr. Arnold stepped up to him, and took the two saws from him.</p>

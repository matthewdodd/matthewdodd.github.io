I am employed by the Mint, to look after persons en<lb></lb>gaged in coining—on 2d December, about half-past 4 in the afternoon I was in the Strand, opposite Somerset House, with Sergeant Ackrill, Inspector Brannan, and several other officers—I saw the prisoner pass by and called attention to him—we followed him about 40 paces, and I then instructed Ackrill to stop him—he did so, and I said, "Well, Mr. Davis," calling him by the name I knew him by, "you are suspected of having counterfeit coin in your possession, what have you got about you?"—he said, "Nothing, sir,"—at that time he attempted to put his left hand in his left-hand coat pocket—Ackrill seized the hand—I put my band in the pocket, and found these two packets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), wrapped up in one—one contained 9 counter<lb></lb>feit half-crowns, and the other 3 counterfeit florins—I opened them in the prisoner's presence and said, "They are bad,"—he said, "Oh"—when at the station I asked him his name—he said "Humphery," and refused his address—I knew his name was not Humphery.</p>

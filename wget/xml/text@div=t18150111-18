               <p>Q. Are your goods outside of the shop - A. Yes, they do some times. On the 8th of December, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I lost three pair of pantaloons, they were inside of the door of the shop, they were on a railing inside of the shop for sale; I was in the shop; I heard a scuffling in the shop; upon looking down, I saw some pantaloons fall down off the railing on the shop floor which gave me suspicion there was something going on wrong, and upon running out into the street at the corner of Play-house-yard, I saw three men standing together, one of the three had the pantaloons.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the prisoner - A. No; I said to the man that had the pantaloons, them pantaloons are mine, and when I came up to the man, the prisoner was taken in custody by two officers, Prince and Lewless. I heard the noise in the shop, and saw the pantaloons fall down, it gave me a suspicion; I ran after the prisoner from hearing the noise in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you did see the prisoner, the officers happening to be at Play-house-yard, Golden-lane and saw him running with the pantaloons - A. When I came up to him he was taken by the officers, Prince and Lewless are the officers that had got the pantaloons when I came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any body snatch any thing from off your rails - A. Yes, I did; that gave me suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately upon that, you ran out, and saw three men - A. Yes; the prisoner was stopped by Prince and Lewless.</p>

               <p>RICHARD LEWLESS. I am a constable. I was in company with Prince; I saw Prince take these three pair of pantaloons of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner doing - A. He was running; he ran right against me, Prince and Dewd was following him.</p>

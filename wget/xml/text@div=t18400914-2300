                  </hi>. On Monday night, the 31st of August, about twelve o'clock, I met the prisoner Jones on the City-road bridge—she said she had travelled some distance, and was fatigued and thirsty,—she asked me to treat her with a pint of beer, and said that in the first turning to the left over the bridge there was a public-house, and asked if I would go there—I said I had no objection, but I would not go out of my road—finding there was no public-house, I did not go down the turning a great distance, but told her I would give her a penny—I had my purse in my right-hand browsers pocket—there was a half-sovereign, six half-crowns four shillings, and a sixpence in it—I was looking for the penny, when she put her hand into my pocket and took out my purse with its contents—I am quite sure she</p>

               <p>is the person—she attempted to get away, but I turned and secured her—Bean came running up immediately, and struck me three times in my face and once behind my ear—Jones dropped the purse against the post, and told Bean to pick it up—he did so, and put it into his right-hand trowsers or coat pocket—he made a second attempt to strike me, but I had a carpet bag which prevented the blow—I saw five or six other men near the foot of the bridge—Bean went to them, and they surrounded me—I heard these men whistle, and one of them tore my coat from the skirt up to the collar, to set Jones at liberty, but they could not release her—I did not lose sight of her—I was knocked down several times, and dropped my paper parcel and my hat, but I recovered them again, and ran up to Jones to secure her, and not to lose sight of her—I gave her into the hands of the police, and described Bean, who was taken next morning.</p>

I came up from the wharf bridge to the City-road—I met two men and Jones—I asked where they were going in such a hurry—they said, down the road to fight—I said they should not—I then saw the prosecutor running after Jones, and several men after him—I cannot say whether Bean was one—I laid hold of one of the men—the prosecutor said Jones had robbed him—I let go of the man and took her—the prosecutor said he could identify two men in the crowd who knocked him down—another policeman came up to me, I told him to go to the men—I took Jones to the station-house—the prosecutor de<lb></lb>scribed Bean, and about half-past two o'clock I saw him with his back against the Windsor Castle public-house—I taxed him with it—he said he knew nothing about it—I took him—he had two sovereigns, a half-sovereign, a half-crown, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1 1/1 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to the prosecutor's house—he identified him as the man who had struck him.</p>

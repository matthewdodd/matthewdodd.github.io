            . I keep a public-house in East Smithfield. On the 27th of April, about five o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to my house and had some purl; he asked what time the Jews would be moving, I told him I did not know - He had a bundle and a blanket in it; he then went away and returned again in about an hour and a half, and said he had sold the things - He had a hat and a waistcoat with him then. A man charged him with picking his pocket, and he left the house. I found a key in my coal-box about half an hour after he was gone the first time, it was not there when he came in.</p>

               <p>JAMES FLETCHER. I am a constable. I went to Mr. Evans, with the prisoner, in consequence of what he said; the boy told me, in the prisoner's presence, that he sold a shawl there for 1s. 6d. - the prisoner did not deny it.</p>

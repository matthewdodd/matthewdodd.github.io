I watched the pri<lb></lb>soner from 5th to 19th Sept, and at 9 o'clock, on the morning of the 19th, I saw him in Hertford-street, with a man named Riley—he separated from Riley, and went towards Crown-street, Soho; he received a black bag in North-street from a little girl who ran down the street—I followed, and stopped him after he bad got some distance, and asked what he had got in the bag; he made no answer—I looked inside, and said, "It is all a mis<lb></lb>take"—I went back immediately, and secreted myself in No. 19, Upper Cleveland-street, a house filled with lodgers; and while watching there saw the prisoner and another man drive up with a horse and cart; they both got out, and went into the house; in about a minute they returned, looked up and down the street, and one of them, I could not tell which, said, "All's right"—each had a bag—I ran over, and seized the prisoner, the other man dropped his bag and escaped—I took the prisoner and the two bags to the station—Shaw's bag contained an opera glass, a snuff box, 26lbs. of cigars, and six packets of tobacco—the other bag contained a coat, waistcoat, and two cigar cases—when I took hold of the prisoner, he sprang back, and endeavoured violently to pull me down some cellars, but I threw him down.</p>

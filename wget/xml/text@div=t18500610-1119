                  </hi>. I am a watch and chronometer-maker, in Bishop's-row, Paddington. On 27th March I was in my shop—the prisoner Smith came in about half-past seven o'clock, he showed me a silver watch, and asked me what it wanted in the way of repairs—I looked at it, and gave it him back—he put it into his pocket—I said I thought he had made a mistake—he said no, he would send the boy with it—he then said his mamma wanted to buy a French clock—I handed him one, and he looked at it, and put it back—he then went to the flap of the counter, lifted it up, and pointed to one—he said, "Is that one gilt"—I said, "No"—I did not like his intruding into the inner part of the shop—at the same time I connived at it, and determined to watch him—there was a working board on which there was a gold watch—after a little time the prisoner went near to that board—I afterwards missed that gold watch—it belonged to Mr. Clark—while the prisoner was standing near that board he requested me to make out a list of the prices of the clocks to hand to his mamma, which I did—I was rather leaning over my counter to watch him, but I did not observe anything—I made out the list of prices, but he was not in a hurry to go, he stood some time talking about the clocks and watches—he then went away, and said he would bring the watch in the evening, or send it by the boy, or perhaps his mamma would call and look at the clocks—in the mean time I was making out a bill of this very watch on the board which was missed—I had seen this watch safe a very few minutes before he came—he was there altogether about ten minutes—I had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing his features perfectly—I have not the slightest doubt that he is the man—I saw the watch again at the police-court—this is it—I had re<lb></lb>paired it, and had some charge to make upon it.</p>

               <p>"Yes," and he was very anxious to know if he was locked up—I told him he was, for stealing a gold watch, and I should take him into custody for pawning the watch, knowing it to be stolen—on the way to the station, he said he had known Smith two or three years, and he was a very respectable man—I found on Redwood thirty-six duplicates of different articles—I have not been able to trace more than one pair of spectacles—he said at the station that he had the watch from Smith to pawn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, in partnership with Christopher William Barber, and occupy a house in Whitechapel-road, in the parish of St. Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel—we both reside there. I went out on Friday morn<lb></lb>ing, and came home about half-past twelve o'clock on the night of the 2nd of January, or the morning of Saturday, the 3rd—it was Saturday morning—Mr. Barber let me in at the street door, and I fastened the door when I went in—I bolted the top bolt, and Barber bolted the bottom—I fixed a bell on the door—we went to bed in a few minutes—I slept on the second floor, and Barber on the first—I was alarmed in about half an hour—I heard somebody say the shop had been robbed—I went down stairs, and saw two or three policemen—I could not tell how any body had got in—there is a small window which leads to the gateway of a livery-stable—it is a glass window—one square of that was broken—it is about eight or nine feet from the ground—a very small boy might get through that opening, I think—there was no appearance of any body having got through there—no other window or door appeared to be broken open—I missed two coats of my own, a pair of boy's trowsers, and a piece of valentia, which laid in the window—the trowsers and the valentia were the property of the firm——I had seen the things on the Friday morning, all of them—I went to the watch-house, and saw one of my own coats, a black one, and a pair of boy's trowsers, which I had missed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty between a quarter and half-past one on Saturday morning, and saw the prosecutor's door open, and two men come out—I was in company with Arnold, another officer, at the time—there was a gas-light in the shop, and a lamp outside also—I gave Arnold directions to keep his eye on one man, while I looked after the other—they both turned up towards Whitechapel church to<lb></lb>gether, fifteen or twenty yards, and then separated—I am sure the two persons who turned up towards Whitechapel church were the two who came out of the house—the prisoner Penny was one of them, I am certain—I cannot swear to the other—I went up and laid hold of Penny—I asked him what he did there—I put my hand behind him, to his pocket, and took this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> or crow-bar out of his pocket—I then hallooed to Arnold to secure the other one, for it was all right—I took Penny to the station-house—when I got there I took this coat off his back—he had it on over the one he has on now—this pair of trowsers he took out of his hat, and endeavoured to throw under the table in the station-house, but I pulled him back, and pulled them out of his hand—the other prisoner had been taken at that time, and was present when I took the trowsers out of his hand—he stood rather in front of Penny, and appeared as if he wanted to prevent my seeing him throw the trowsers under the table—I went to Mr. Walker's and examined the place—Arnold was with me—I</p>

I was in company with Walton—I received directions from him to watch one of the men—I had seen Walker's door open, and two people come out and leave the door ajar—they went towards Whitechapel church—Walton and I crossed into the road towards them—they parted—one went one way, towards Mile-end; the other towards the church—I followed one, and he the other—Walton called to me to stop the one I was following, for it was all right—and I stopped Kerr, who was the man—I told him he must go with me—he said he had nothing about him, and that he bad been to Lock's public-house—I said I saw him come out of Mr. Walker's house—he said he had only been to the corner to make water, he had not been in—then he said he had been to the stable—there are sublet down the yard, behind the house—I took him to the station-house, and found a truss in his hat—I asked him who that belonged to—he said to himself, for it was a thing he wore, and he was obliged to pull it off to ease himself—I went back to Walker's house, and found somebody had eased himself behind the counter—I never lost sight of the man from the time I saw him come out of the house, and am certain Kerr is the marr.</p>

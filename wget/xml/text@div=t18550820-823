                  </hi>. I live at No. 74, Cornwall-road, Lambeth—I am apprenticed to a cigar manufacturer, in Drury-lane, nearly opposite Long<lb></lb>acre—on 1st July, I was on the platform at the Lee-bridge railway station, waiting to come to London—I was there at 9, and waited till very nearly 10 o'clock—about 10 o'clock I was getting into the railway carriage, and just as I was getting in, I felt something done to my watch, and then there was a severe wrench—my watch was attached to a silver guard chain round my neck—directly I felt the wrench, I saw the prisoner's hand go from my pocket behind him—he was on my left side—I first saw his hand in front of my person—I looked round and saw him behind me—I called for assistance, and gave him into custody to the station master and a porter—there were crowds of persons round when the prisoner put his hand behind him; there were persons near enough to assist him—he put both his hands behind him—I seized him by the collar and said, "You have stolen my watch"—he said, "Do you accuse me of stealing your watch?" I said, "I do," and I called the station master—I kept hold of the prisoner, and he was taken to the station—there were other persons near enough to have received the watch from him, supposing he had had it.</p>

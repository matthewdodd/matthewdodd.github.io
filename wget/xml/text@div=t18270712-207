On the 3d of March I had two pieces of green and one of chocolate silk, from Messrs. Giles. I left them safe, up stairs, on my premises, about half-past eight o'clock. I returned at half-past nine and saw a light on the table on the ground floor - I had left a lodger at home - it was his light - I missed the property. On the Monday I went with the officer to the Three Cranes, public-house, where the officer found some silk in the bar.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 5th of March I went to the Three Cranes public-house, Mile-end-road, which is kept by the prisoner - he and his wife were at dinner in the bar; I called him aside, and told him I had a warrant to search his house for stolen silk; he said he had no silk in the house, and I might search in welcome, but might he finish his dinner first - I said Yes; he went into the bar, but instead of finishing his dinner, whispered to his wife, and then said, "I am now at leisure to go any where with you; what part of the house will you go to first;" I said "Up-stairs, into your bed-room;" we went up - I found a chest of drawers locked; he said the key was down-stairs; he called for it - the servant handed it up, but I found no silk; I came to another chest of drawers which were locked; I asked for the key, and at that time he put a paper into my hand, which proved to be a 5l. note. I said, "I must look;" he then said, "You had better give me that back again;" we came down together - he called for the key of those drawers; I took the prosecutor up with me, and left the prisoner in charge of two other men below, but found nothing in the drawers; I came down, and sent the prisoner and two men to search the back premises - they staid some time - I went, and the prosecutor said, the prisoner was gone out at the gate, and the boy had let him out; I returned to the bar, and found a handkerchief, containing these silks, in a little side, dark place, like a child's bed- it laid on the bed-clothes; the prosecutor claimed it; the prisoner was never found till Thursday week, when he sent me a note, and came to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Of course you returned the 5l. note? A. No - I have kept it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not, on your finding the tobacco, on which duty had not been paid, that he offered the note? A. I found a quantity of tobacco; his wife said the silk had been left an hour before, by a short young man; she did not hear what I had said to the prisoner; he has one female and two male servants.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Were not two officers left below while you went up stairs? A. Yes - in the passage, to see that nobody went out</p>

               <p>Q. When did she come to you? - She came to see me on Wednesday, the same week that she was stole away on Friday, she is my neice, I believe it was the 26th of March. She staid with me till Friday, when she was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what occasioned her leaving you? - No, I cannot say, she was at play in the market; I saw her about half after twelve o'clock, I missed her a little after, I recovered her about ten minutes after one; I found her at the bottom of Well-street, in Mile-end New-town, she was coming up Dean-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she alone when you found her? - No, she was along with the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p> Q. When you see her what passed between you? - I sat my self down on the stone steps, I was so glad I had found the child, I could not go any farther, and this woman came up with the child, holding the child in her hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child crying or distressed? - No, very quiet.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way was she going with the child? was she coming towards where you live or the other way? - It was not towards where I live. On her coming up to the steps of the door, I said to her, good woman, where did you find this child? - She said, she found it in High-street, and in my flurry I did not know that she had enticed the child out of the market, and I asked her if she chose any thing to drink? she thanked me and said no, I took the child and came away with it towards my home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the child dressed as when you see it last? - Nothing was taken from her, no clothes off at all. I came along the street towards Well-street, with the child in my hand, and I said, Mary, how came you to go away? says she, aunty the woman took me from behind the broken pump; I was very sorry, there were several people about, I said if I had known she had enticed the child away I would not have let her gone, and somebody went back and stopped the woman.</p>
               <p>- PIKE sworn.</p>


               <p>I stood facing my shop on the 28th of March, I saw this woman going down the street with the child, and another child, and I see her turn round several times and speak to the child, and I said to my wife, I dare say that woman is decoying the child away; my wife said, go along you fool, Mrs. Hannock has sent somebody with it. Presently there was an alarm made about it, and I went to seek after it, I went up into Brick-lane, and came down Brown's-lane, and there I meets this woman, and she runs past me without the child, and I stopped and watched her almost all the way up Brick-lane, and at the top of Brick-lane I ran up and catched her and told her she must go back along with me; so I brought her back and we took her to the magistrate, and he bound us over.</p>

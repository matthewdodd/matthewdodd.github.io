            . I live in Wheatsheaf-yard, Fleet-market. On the 3d of January I paid the prisoner 4 s., on account of Mr. Chillman, his master. I believe it was half-a-crown, a sixpence, and a shilling. I am sure there was a shilling.</p>

            . I live in Upper Thames-street; the prisoner was employed by me to carry out coals for four months, and, for sixteen months before; I entrusted him to receive money for me, which he should give me immediately on his return; he never accounted to me for this. I discovered it on the 10th of February, told him that I had suspected him some time, and gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did he take the order for these coals - A. I do not know whether he took it, or whether she sent to the wharf; it is usual to put down all that is owing, which he and I examine. I never asked him for this specific sum - when I charged him with it, he said he would account for what he received.</p>

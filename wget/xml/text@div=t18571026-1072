                  </hi>. I am no relation of the prosecutor. I am a dealer in china and glass, and do an immense business among publicans, both in stone and glass bottles, and have done business with Messrs. Powell nearly thirteen years—I have known Mr. Truelove Utley a long while, but Mr. Thomas Utley, I believe, has not been in London long—I introduced the orders of them both to the firm—some years ago, Mr. John Utley, another brother, who was keeping a house in Tower Street, gave me orders for a great quantity of bottles, just before Christmas—they did not arrive in time, and he told me that he would never deal with Messrs. Powell any more; and, owing to that, Thomas Utley never gave them any orders; but in the last two years and a half I have been endeavouring to get their custom for the firm, and ulti<lb></lb>mately took an order from him for thirty two gallon stone bottles—I cannot tell you the exact date, but they went on the Thursday previous to the bill being paid—on the Friday I was at Mr. Truelove Utley's, soliciting orders for goods, and I said, "Have you heard anything of your bottles?"—he said, "They came in yesterday"—I said, "How do you like them?"—he said, "Very well"—he had told me that he had got a farther order, but would not give it to me till these were delivered—on the Saturday morning, I said to Oliver, "If you go with me down to Mr. Utley's, I have got my cart and will drive you, and no doubt they will pay you, and you can take his order for the others"—it was not my place to receive the money—we went down, and Mr. Utley paid for the twenty-seven two gallons—I said, "Mr. Utley, what about the others?"—he said, "Well, I have got an order for you from my brother at the Causeway"—I took out one of my bill heads, similar to this, and wrote it on that—he gave me an order for another gross and a half of gallon bottles, marked, and of three various sizes; it came to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he then gave me an order for half a gross of one gallon stone bottles, and half a gross of half gallon stone bottles; that was for his brother—I then said, "What do you want for yourself?"—he said, "I want one gross of quarts, stone, and one gross of pints"—they were to be lettered, "D. Utley, Eltham Place, Dover Road," and those for his brother were to be printed, "T. Utley, Wine and Spirit Stores, Newington Causeway"—I explained that if the name was on a seal, instead of down the side, one seal would do for all the bottles—he said, "You had better call at the Cause<lb></lb>way, and tell my brother the difference, as 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would do for the whole three sizes"—we drove to Newington Causeway, at half past 12 o'clock—I saw Mr. Thomas Utley, and said, "I have got an order of your brother for some bottles for you"—he said, "Well, I think half a gross of stone bottles, gallons, would be too many for me"—I said, "As they are ordered, you had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260103"></xptr>
               <p>better have them now"—he said, "I do not know where I shall put them"—he did not seem to care much about it—I came with Oliver up to the stores, and had a similar bill made out, and laid the pen on the desk for him to copy it into his order book—the price was never mentioned—the order was given not to Powell and Ricketts, but to me—I laid this paper on the desk, and said, "I can cart these goods myself, and I will pay you cash when I fetch them away"—I said, "The price I am going to charge for the glass bottles will be 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross for pints, and 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the half pints, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the other sizes, and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for engraving the seal for the lot"—the price for the gallon stone bottles was to be 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the half gallons 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the quarts 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the pints 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I wrote it in pencil against each item, and he copied it to a certain extent—some one came in, and he could not finish it, and I left it with him—on the following week I had occasion to go there for some plain stone bottles, which I paid for and took away, and had an invoice made out in my own name.</p>

Powell; I am not in their service—I have charged other customers extra prices; it is impossible for me to tell how many—I considered that I was conducting this for myself—I asked Oliver to be particular in sending the orders down to Bristol, and he showed me in the book afterwards where he had copied it, to see that each letter was right on the bill—I have seen invoices arrive from Bristol—I did not see any of these invoices made out—I did not ask what became of the original invoices—I used to receive 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent discount—I used to</p>

               <p>let it run for three or four months—the extra money was paid at the time that my commission was paid—I explained that to Mr. Benjamin Powell—the commission and the other sums made up the exact amount I received to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my name is to this receipt in this book for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my discount is calculated on these different items—the commission amounts to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of that—Oliver would not receive 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of that.</p>

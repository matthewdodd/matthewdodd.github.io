               <p>Q. While she was in the shop did you see her do any thing - A. I saw her in the act of taking the shawl, the shawl was on the counter.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180807130013"></xptr>Q. Did you actually see her attempting to take it - A. I only saw her handling it.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me you saw her in the act of stealing it - A. I saw her drop it at the left hand counter just at the side.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she left the counter at the time these things dropped - A. No, a person detected her and told me; I went to her; directly she saw me she turned round and dropped the shawl; then the constable was sent for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Yours is a very crowded shop and what you call a cheap shop, where people crowd to buy what you call bargains - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were there in the shop at the time - A. There might be five or six at the counter where she stood; I do not know how many there were at the other part of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men had you serving in the shop - A. About sixteen or seventeen of us; the young man that was serving her is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the shawl drop accidentally from her - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You said Mr. Harvey and Lamming are the proprietors of this shop - A. They are; I never heard of any other partners.</p>

            . Q. What are you - A. I have been employed in the shop about four months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come in - A. Yes, she asked for some calico; the young man shewed her some and the person with her; the young man is not here; she did not like the calico, she asked to see some shawls; he shewed her some. I saw her take the shawl and put it under her gown; I went and told Mr. Ashford; he came to her and took hold of her arm; at that instant she dropped the shawl.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Did Mr. Harvey and and Lamming ever accuse you of taking things from them - A. They have once.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been in prison for robbing them since this woman was under accusation - A. Yes, about a week a ago.</p>
               <p>Q. So, then when this prosecution was going on, you were let out - how long were you in custody - A. Two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have not you said that you would not have charged the prisoner with stealing this shawl but so save yourself - A. I have.</p>
               <p>COURT. What did they charge you with having taken from them - A. A bit of muslin. I was twice before the alderman; the alderman discharged me the second time; my master did not come to maintain the charge against me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say to any body that you would not have charged the girl unless they had promised to forgive you - A. Yes, I said it to the young woman myself when I was in prison; she called me all manner of names and frightened me; I said so to her because she frightened me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Harvey or Mr. Lamming ever promise to forgive you if you appeared against the prisoner - - A. No.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not guilty at all; I asked to look at some black calimanco; they said stop a bit; I saw the shawl lie on the ground; they took another woman, but they let her go about her business.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Graving Dock Tavern, and am a black<lb></lb>smith—about half-past 9, on the 8th of June, I was keeping watch at the Graving Dock—whilst doing so, I saw Ashton and Hendry walking by the side of the fence—Hendry appeared as if he had something under his coat—Speck spoke to a lad who was minding a horse and cart—he came out of a public-house close by, and called the Jad to him—I could not hear what he said—the lad took the horse and cart up the road—I did not follow it—I was in the dock—I was with the constable at the bridge afterwards—I there saw Speck in the cart; before this the boy took the cart up the road—I went into the dock with the watchman, and went to the fitting-shop, and when we opened the fitting-shop door, we saw the door of the turnery open, and the fence broken—that was the fence next the road—anything could be taken out of that broken fence, and put into a cart on the road—I was searching the place with the watchman, and some one called for him, and said the cart was at the bridge—I ran up the road—when I got to the swing bridge, I saw Speck in the cart; no one else was with him—I asked him what he had in his cart—he said "Nothing"—I removed a sack that laid in the cart, and found this iron (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is used for smiths' forges—it was at the bottom of the cart—there was a sack in the cart—a sack was all that covered it.</p>

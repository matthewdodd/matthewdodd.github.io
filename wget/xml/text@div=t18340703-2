            . I am a policeman. On Saturday morning, the 17th of May, about one o'clock, I was on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183407030004"></xptr>duty in Brick-lane - I heard a cry of "Police," and "Stop thief" - looking towards Bacon-street, I saw the prisoner running, at the distance of five or six yards - when he saw me, he turned back and went to the corner of Great Bacon-street - I ran after him, and caught him at the end of the street - I saw Finett on the other side of the way, crying"Police," and "Stop thief" - they were both running very fast - when I caught the prisoner, the prosecutor came up, and said that he had been robbed, and that the prisoner was the man; that he had light trowsers on and a red handkerchief; which he had on - I asked what he had been robbed of - he said, a shilling, and did not at that time mention any half-pence - I took him down to the station-house - the inspector asked what charge he made against him - he then said it was 1s. 4d. - he did not say whether it was pence or half-pence - on going to search the prisoner, he said, "I have 4d. or 4Â½d. about me;" and I took from him two penny-pieces and four half-pence - I took them out of his pocket - there was no shilling in his pocket, nor any farthings - the prosecutor had been drinking, but he was neither sober nor drunk - he appeared very much excited - I searched the prisoner at the station-house, not in the street - I took care that he threw nothing away while he was with me.</p>

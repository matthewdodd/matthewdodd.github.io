             came to me, he offered me some knives and forks, handles that had been broken up; I saw a crest on them, I questioned him; he said they belonged to a servant; the silver was wrapped up in a letter addressed from Mr. Phillips in Bond-street, to Mr. Lawrence. I detained the silver. The man called again in about two hours, saying, that the silver had come from Mr. Phillips, that it was found by a charwoman in a place where they considered it was of no value, and they made a perquisite of it. I told him to call on me at seven or eight o'clock in the evening; he came, and the constable took him in custody, and took the silver from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the woman - A. Not till I saw her at the office, there the prisoner said the charwoman was his wife.</p>

            . Q. You took this man in custody at the silver smiths shop - A. Yes. I asked him how he came by it, he said his wife found it where she was at work at Mr. Phillips's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the wife present at that time - A. No; she was charing at Mr. Phillips's. I then thought it right to take the prisoner and the silver to Mr. Phillips's to see if they knew the property; they claimed the property. I laid the property on the table, I asked her how she came by it; she said she found them in a dust hole, wrapped up in paper, and begged to be forgiven. I searched their lodgings; the husband and wife both told me where they lodged; I went in company with the witness Phillips, and there found the glasses and china. The woman said they were given her by a servant of Mr. Phillips's; I never could see that servant, she only came occasionally.</p>
               <p>Miss Phillips I believe it to be my brother's property. I can speak to this socket of a candlestick that we used. The silver socket is worth half a crown.</p>

            . The Prisoner Cousens brought three pieces of Shagreen to me; I lent her Money upon two; the first piece was brought the 5th of May, the 2d, the 14th, and the 20th, she came again with another, I then ask'd whose they were; she said a Person near St. Clement's Church, and desired me, if I did not care to lend Money upon it, to let her have the Goods again. I insisted upon her going with me to the Person she had them of, and as we were going along, she said she had them of one Baxter, a Servant, and wanted to go to an Ale-house and send for him; but I would not suffer that, but made her go to the House. I called for the Master of the Shop, and asked him if he had not a Servant whose Name was Baxter, and I discovered the Affair to him. Baxter immediately begg'd for Mercy, and that we would not charge a Constable with him; he own'd he would make his Master Satisfaction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook in the service of John James Andrews, of No. 10, Blackheath-terrace, Blackheath—on Sunday, the 5th of July, I went up-stairs into the childrens' nursery—on coming down I went to my my master's dressing-room door, and looked behind it—I saw the prisoner coming out—the housemaid called out—I put out my hands, and tried to push him back, and said, "You wretch; you thief"—he made his escape down stairs—there were three rings in the dressing-room—Mr. Andrews was ill at the time, and Dr. Pink was attending him, and he went in pursuit, and shortly after brought back the prisoner—he is the man I saw on the pre<lb></lb>mises—I have seen his face before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>, 124), I received the prisoner in custody at the house of Mr. Andrews—I charged him with being there with intent to commit a felony—he admitted being in the house, and said he was not there for that purpose—I asked him for what purpose he was there; he said, for the purpose of seeing a servant who lived close by—I took him to the station—he was searched, and nothing was found in his possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Two or three days before my apprehension, I was at the Eagle, and met a young woman who was a servant, and whom I saw home to Blackheath. She promised to meet me on the Sunday, and I went. I waited until nearly 3 o'clock. I thought she was making a fool of me, and being rather the worse for drink, I supposed this was the house. I went into the garden, and seeing the servants going up and down stairs, I was rather confused, and I thought I would get inside this place, and get a chance of getting out again.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any sensation at your pocket at the time you missed your handkerchief? - A. None at all, it was the running alone that caused my suspicion; I had it in my hand not two minutes before in coming down Snow-hill.</p>

               <p>Q. What may the value of it be? - A. Above two shillings; it is a silk handkerchief, nearly new.(Produces it).</p>

               <p>LEMAN CASEBY sworn. - On Thursday morning last, I was coming through Shoe-lane, I saw a mob surround this gentleman, and the prisoner laying upon his back, in Plumbtree-court; I asked what was the matter; and they said, this gentleman had been robbed; I immediately took the prisoner by the collar, and pulled him up; in coming down Holborn-hill, he was very obstreperous; I searched him in the Compter, and found upon him a fellowship-porter's ticket, a pocket-book containing five duplicates, and a knife.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I picked it up at the bottom of Holborn-hill.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18001029-11-verdict62" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a furrier, at 92, Bartholomew-close—the prisoner has been in my employment since October 4th, as a traveler—on 10th December I gave him instructions to obtain 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Messrs. Hills and Barnard, of Chelsea, for goods previously supplied through our traveller—on his return he was asked whether they had paid it—he said, no, they were out; they would pay the next time he was round—I asked for it once or twice afterwards, and he said they would send it down—on 24th December, the prisoner absented himself from the warehouse—this receipt is the prisoner's writing; it purports to be his receipt for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Messrs. Hills and Barnard, on my account—he never accounted to me for that sum—I have a customer named Ball, of Whitechapel, who purchased goods of my traveler to the amount of a guinea—I did not authorize the prisoner to receive that—it would not be due until 1st February—the prisoner has never accounted to me for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Jaques Tristram Alfred Guy D' Hombres—we lodged in the house of Mr. Matthew Blakeley, 27, North Audley-street, Grosvenor-square—I left that house to go abroad, on the 19th of Sept.—I had a servant named Ward—I had discharged her—she was to go away that day—she requested me to let her stay till the evening—I said she might, as she said her husband was coming to fetch her things—she re<lb></lb>mained after I left—I left another servant, named Mortimer, in charge of the place—I had a number of linens, and other things in the front attic, all locked up in boxes—I returned on the 22nd of May—my linen was all gone, my writing-desk had been broken open, and a gold glass, and other articles taken out—another box had been broken open—I have not seen any of the linen—nothing stated in this indictment has been found—this small box was found on the prisoner—I will swear to it anywhere—it was a present to me—I had left it in my desk, which was broken open.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner.</hi>) I lived with Madame D'Hombres, up to the 19th of Sept.—she gave me permission to stay a little time—I asked her if I might stay till I got a lodging—I staid in the house—she left her ser<lb></lb>vant there—I know the prisoner—he was in the habit of visiting me there by Madame D'Hombers' permission, before she left London—I broke the win<lb></lb>dow of Madame D'Hombres' room, raised the sash, and I and the prisoner got into the room—I gave him some linen from that room—the box it was in was only fastened—it was not property locked—I opened it—no one was with me—I got into the room, the prisoner did not—he was in another room in the house—I took the linen—I gave it to the prisoner in another room—that was not the same day the window was broken—it was on another day—the prisoner and I went in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and took the linen to Ann Webb, at Westourn<lb></lb>green—it was rather heavy.</p>

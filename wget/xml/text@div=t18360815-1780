                  </hi>. I live at Mile-end, Old Town. On the 11th of July I had a chariot-lining to carry to a gentleman—the prisoner was to carry it—he had carried loads for me—I told him to go to my house to fetch it, and to meet me in Holborn—I stopped there two hours—he did not come—I was alarmed—I went home, and from what my daughter told me, I went to Holborn again, and told a policeman what sort of a man he was.</p>

I gave the prisoner these things between twelve and one o'clock, to take them to my father, and never saw him again till he was apprehended—he said he gave them to a man to carry to Holborn, and did not know what became of him—they have never been found.</p>

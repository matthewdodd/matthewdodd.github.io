On the 13th of August, about eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came and asked if I would take 36 s. for those decanters which were in the window. I went down stairs to consult my wife about it; she was then in the shop - I refused to take it. I gave her my card and desired her to go back to her mistress; she came back in about half an hour, and said they were for a respectable lady, who called about a week ago. I told her I could not take less than thirty-eight shillings and sixpence for them; she said I might pack them up in paper, and send them to Mrs. Taylor, No. 4, Staple's Inn. I sent them by

Mr. Heeley sent me with the decanters with the prisoner to No. 4, Staple's Inn, I went there with her, and at the door she took the bottles from me, and said she would take them up stairs and bring the money down; she came down and somebody called out to her,</p>

               <p>"Very well," and went on, leaving me at the door, saying, she she was going to the butcher's. I waited three quarters of an hour - she did not return - I went up the stairs and found the basket laying on the two pair of stairs, empty; the decanters and two shillings for change were gone from the basket, I found the bill still in it. I saw the name of Mr. Taylor on the door - I rang the bell - they knew nothing of them - I found no lady there. I enquired for Mrs. Taylor, but could find no such person.</p>

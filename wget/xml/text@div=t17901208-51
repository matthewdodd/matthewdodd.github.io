            , he is at sea: The prisoner came to take an empty<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179012080086"></xptr>room of me on the 18th of November, I was very loth to let it her, but she prevailed on me till I did let it, and I asked her what she had got to bring into this room; she told me she had nothing, she said she lay on the bare boards; I told her there was a bed in the room adjoining that, which she took, where a single man lay on, who was gone into the shop, and I gave her liberty to lay on it two or three nights; about seven o'clock in the evening I was gone to bed, I thought I heard a rumbling noise, and could not tell what it was; I got out of bed, and slipt on my under petticoat, and went up stairs, and she was gone down stairs, and the bed was gone; I went down and alarmed the rest of the people in the house; we went to the place where she was come away from that day, I came back again, and carried the watch with me, and I went up stairs and found her rolling these two pieces of carpet in the room; the watchman has got them here.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the bed was safe that night? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find the bed? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Had you let this bed to that woman? - I had given her leave to lay on it; she was to pay me nothing for it.</p>
               <p>Did you know this woman before? - No.</p>
               <p>What is she? - She cries things about the street, oysters; she has lived about Shadwell some years.</p>

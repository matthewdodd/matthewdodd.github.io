                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker of 2, New Road, Clapham Junction—on the morning of 4th September, about a quarter past two, I was walking in West Street, St Martin's Lane, close by Aldridge's Repository—I was suddenly attacked by three men; I did not see where they came from; I was tripped up on my back and robbed of my watch and chain and two half-crowns—the watch was in my waistcoat pocket and the money in my trousers; they were taken from me while I was on the ground—I saw the prisoner on the top of me, kneeling on me; he robbed me of my watch and chain and handed it to one of his confederatea—I could not do anything; I was perfectly powerless; I could not call out, I was stifled; the prisoner had one hand over my mouth—the policeman came up and took him in the act; he was kneeling down on me when he was taken; the other two got away—I feel the effects of the fall now in my side, and my elbow is black and blue—I was not able to work for three or four days.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 193). On the morning of 4th September I was on duty at the corner of Tower Street, near West Street; I saw the prisoner right on the top of the prosecutor, and two men standing by him—as soon as they saw me they ran away; I ran after the prisoner and caught him—I did not lose sight of him—the prosecutor charged him—I took him to the station and searched him, but found nothing on him—he said nothing to the charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prioner's Defence</hi>. I was coming up St. Martin's Lane and saw three men and the prosecutor rowing on the opposite side of the way. I went up to see what it was. I saw the prosecutor lying down. As I came up they halloed out "Police"! and I ran away, as I did not want to get into trouble, and when I had got about six yards the policeman took me.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, I was called to open the deceased; I found every thing quite perfect in the head; in the body I found a large quantity of extravasated blood in the abdomen, a blood-vessel had burst, which I look upon to be the occasion of his death; I took out between two and three quarts, and left a great deal behind; this might happen from a fall or twist; there were no marks of violence upon the body.</p>

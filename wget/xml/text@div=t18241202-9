            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 10th of November, while I was executing a search warrant at a marine store shop in Bethnal-green-road, the prisoner brought in some blinds and other things, for which he wanted half a crown; I was looking through a door between the shop and back parlour: the mistress of the house seemed rather confused, and tried to put him out of the shop. I then went after him, and said I would give him 1 s. 6 d. for the things: he said, "Oh! I know you, you are one of the officers of Worship-street, and I am done;" I said I should wish to know where he got the things - he said he got the blinds from a gentleman named Pitcher. I said I would go with him to his house, and as we were going he said, "It is of no use, what I told you is a lie - they are the property of Mr. Ramsey - if you will let me go I will give you the blinds;" I said I would not for 5 l.; he then said he would give me any sum to let him go.</p>

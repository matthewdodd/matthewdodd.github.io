                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, 237 R</hi>). I am doing duty at Woolwich. On 12th Feb. about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was going through the yard of the Star and Garter public-house in Powis-street—I heard a noise in the next yard, belonging to Mrs. Campion—I listened, and in about a minute I heard a footstep coming in a direction towards the fence, which separates the ground of the Star and Garter from Mrs. Campion's—I saw the prisoner come and place something like a box on the fence, parting the two grounds—he looked over the fence; he saw me, and he drew back—I went to the fence and saw him go down the yard—I got over the fence, and followed him—when I got over the fence I saw Mrs. Campion's back parlour window was open—it was quite up—I turned my light on, and saw the impressions of feet very fresh by the window, as if some person had just been in, and come out again—the marks were on the railing alongside the window—I went down the yard—there is a hayloft at the further end of the yard, you go up a ladder to get to it—I saw the prisoner going up this ladder, and followed him—when I was going up he took a truss of hay and knocked me down—I got up, and got in the hayloft—I found the prisoner concealed between some trusses of hay—he was afterwards taken by me and White—I saw White find a cash-box, about a yard and a half or two yards from where the prisoner was lying—I saw him take away the box that he had placed on the fence at the time he went away himself—it was the same size as this one, when I charged the prisoner with stealing the box, he said he had been there to sleep in the loft ever since 12, and he was not guilty—I said, "Don't say that, for I saw you in the yard not two-minutes ago"—he made no answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You dragged me to the farther end of the loft before you got to the cash-box. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was threeparts of the way in the loft when we took him, and the cash-box was about a yard and a half from him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, 330 R</hi>). I was with the last witness at a quarter past 2 o'clock that morning—I found this cash-box in the loft about two yards from where the prisoner was lying—I heard the prisoner hastening along the yard—I said to Randall, "You get over and I will run round to the door"—the prisoner said he knew nothing about the robbery, he had been there asleep—I found in the cash-box 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and a half sovereign.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How is the door in this loft? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are steps going from Mrs. Campion's yard to the loft—when the prisoner got in there he blocked the way against Randall, and ran to the door which opens to the Star and Garter yard—I called to him to surrender, and he would not—I got a ladder, and got in there.</p>

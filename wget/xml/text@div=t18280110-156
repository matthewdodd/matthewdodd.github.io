In consequence of suspicion, I directed persons to watch the prisoner. He never gave me to understand that any annatto had been moved to his lodgings - he had no authority to remove it. I and an officer went to his house in Globe-lane, and from there to Raycroft's, and under the stairs we found a cask of annatto - it is above 2 cwt.; some of my manufacture is marked "Joseph Botcherby, extra superfine;" some only "extra superfine;" the name of Goode was never inserted on any made at my house; some of that in the cask is marked"W. and a star H., superfine;" some not marked. I had the prisoner taken - he was at work at my house at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The prisoner had been a manufacturer? A. Yes; annatto is a vegetable substance; I believe he did business for himself before he came to me; he had travelled for another manufacturer, and from that I expected some connexion; my goods were never sold in his name.</p>

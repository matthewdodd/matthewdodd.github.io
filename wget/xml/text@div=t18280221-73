               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. Had you seen the horse and chaise in the street? A. No; I found it in Archer-street, after the alarm. Clifford's mother has since been to me, and said it was only a lark; but I never said I did not believe they meant to steal it, or anything to that effect, when she said it was only a lark - I said, "Well, he has done it only for a lark," as she said he was a respectable young man; but, when I went before the magistrate,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210077"></xptr>I found he was a different sort of a man - I never said I did not wish to prosecute.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. QUIN. Q. Are you on familiar terms with the prosecutor? A. He is my son-in-law - his Christian name is Charles Andrew: I found the gig at the corner of Archer-street and Windmill-street.</p>

            . I fetched the house and chaise to Mr. Nosotti's door; I went in to tell my father it was there, leaving nobody in care of it - I came out in about ten minutes, and it was gone; I ran to the top of Archer-street and Rupert-street, where a crowd was round it - Clifford was half in and half out of the chaise; Mr. Yates was dragging him out: I did not see Whatton there - they are both strangers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q. How far off did you find it? A. About two hundred yards - it was between eleven and twelve o'clock: I took the gig back; I turned it round myself - Clifford did not turn it round; Mr. Yates had got him out before that; somebody in the crowd held the horse's head till I came up - I heard nothing about a frolic: Yates asked for assistance, but none of the crowd would help him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Did you fasten the horse up. A. No; it staid there - it never runs away.</p>

            . I live in Windmill-street, near Nosotti - his house is at the corner of Archer-street: I was coming home about eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoners watching about Windmill and Archer streets; they came back, and, all in a minute, I saw Clifford get into the chaise - Whatton was on the same side of the way: Clifford drove the chaise away; I ran and stopped it in Rupert-street, about one hundred yards off - I called to him, and asked what he was going to do with it; I pulled him down: Whatton came up and said it was only done out of a lark - I told him to go away, or I should take him to the watch-house: I pulled Clifford out and gave him in charge; he said he meant to drive it a little way, and it was done out of lark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. J. ALLEY. Q. Was the horse going on when Clifford got in? A. I cannot say; it might - I am sure he got in; it might be his intention to stop it if it was going on - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. QUIN. Q. Were you not an officer once? A. Yes; two years ago: I was not discharged for misconduct - Whatton did not come up till I stopped Clifford: he surrendered himself voluntarily.</p>

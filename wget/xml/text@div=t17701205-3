             I lodge at one Mr. Allen's, a turner in Pains Alley, Aldersgate street. I met the prisoner in Moorfields about twelve o'clock at noon, the Friday before my Lord Mayor's day.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I had never seen him before There was another man with him. They asked me to shew them Bethlem, which I did. They asked me to go in with, them; I did. I went round the inside with them, then I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050006"></xptr> them I could not stay any longer, for I was going a journey. The prisoner asked how far; I told him I was going to Stretham, and I had the road to seek. The prisoner said that they were going that road, and they would instruct me. I wanted to go home to make an alteration in my dress, to put on a clean, apron, and the like. They followed me to Fore Street, and begged I would go in and drink a glass of wine with them for shewing them Bethlem. I went with them to the Angel in Fore-street, from thence they were to go to Stretham. They persuaded me not to go home; they said it was seven miles to Stretham. I was glad of the opportunity of going with them, and did not go home. They called at another public house before we got out of town; after that we called at another public house. They said they called there for some writings that the man that was along with the prisoner was going to have made over to him at Stretham. This public house was in Oxford Road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink with them at all these public houses?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes; at the first place we had half a pint of mulled wine between us three. At the other two houses we had a glass of brandy. We said in Hackney road an hour, or an hour and a half. This was between two and three o'clock. From thence we went along the road, then they turned down a lane, I don't know the road, nor the name of it; then they took me over some fields, and then they turned into another little town, and then took me into some more fields. It was then between four and five o'clock. I believe then they began to curse me, and d - d my blood, and said they had not brought me there for Stretham, but they had brought me there to lie with me. They had both of them their hands in my pocket. I lost half a crown. They blasted me for a b - h, and shook me about. They demanded my buckles out of my shoes; the prisoner took them; they were silver; I never had them again. The prisoner said to the other man, Why don't you make haste and pull her buckles out of her shoes? what signifies her crying and making a noise? They put a pair of black buckles into my shoes, and they wanted me to take some money. I begged for God's sake they would let me go home to my children. They said I had no children. I said I had. They took my handkerchief out of my pocket; they put some money into it, and crammed it down my bosom. Meekin d - d me, and bid me go home, and think myself well off that I did not lose my life. They bid me not makes any noise.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did they put down your bosom?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. It was yellow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your buckles taken by force, and was you put in bodily fear by these men?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. It is odd you should take a fancy to these two men you never saw before, should shew them Bethlem, tell them a story of being to go a journey to Stretham, and that theft men should be just so luckily going to the place you was going to.</p>
               <p>Mazemore. They appeared to be gentlemen, and they behaved vastly well. I asked them if it was a road-way; they said the chief of the way was a road. They behaved very well all the way till they got into this field.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray where did you dine that day?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. In Hackney road.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No, before. We had mutton chops for dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. All agreeable company there?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think you should make your visit to Stretham rather late?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. They hurried, they said, upon my account.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to dinner?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Between one and two.</p>
               <p>Q. And the robbery, you say, was afterwards?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married woman?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. A widow, I have two children.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell any body of this upon your road home?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I told nobody of it. The first place I came to was Hoxton. When I came home I examined my money.</p>
               <p>Q. And I believe you found it not to be it good as you could have wished?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. When I came to Hoxton, I did not know where I was. I asked a boy which place it was; he told me, Hoxton. He shewed me the way to Bishopsgate Church-yard. went to feel in my pocket to give the boy some thing, and I had no money, I had half<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050007"></xptr> crown in my pocket when I was with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you make the first complaint of being robbed of your shoe-buckles?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I sent for my sister, and told her I had been used ill and robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. My buckles.</p>
               <p>Q. What drink had you with your mutton chops?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I had a glass of brandy; they had beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink no beer?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes I drop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never been at Stretham before?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No never.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it take up to see Bethlem?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Not above a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. That was all lost time. Did you ever see them before?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No neither of them. As I was going from the shop I work at to dinner, I saw the prisoner cross the road; I ran up to him, and took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see nobody as you came home?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes, several single men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say nothing to them?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No; I was afraid the men would come after me and murder me.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the field you say you was robbed in from the little town you came through?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. About half a mile, or better. I went over the fields all the way till I came to the road to Hoxton.</p>
               <p>Q. What house did you dine at?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I think it was the sign of the Smiths Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you perfectly sober at this time?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Yes, very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose care were your children left?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. One was in the house, the other at nurse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you intend to return to town that evening?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. I was not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. After dinner you pursued your road - Had you on thoughts of being benighted? - They had told you it was seven miles to Stretham.</p>
               <p>Mazemore. They said so.</p>
               <p>Court. How long have you lived in London?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. Sixteen or seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. And not know Hackney and Hackney road?</p>
               <p>Mazemore. No; I work'd very hard; I had little time to go out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was your acquaintance at Stretham?</p>

               <p>Cross. Yes. I had not seen her a long time. She used to wash for me. She asked me to come and see her. She said she was at home only on Sundays. I went to see her the next Sunday about four o'clock. I had seen the prisoner, and another man with him, about the road. I asked her who the men were that I saw with her. She said she wished she knew who they were. She did not tell me any thing that had happened them. I saw the prosecutor again about a week after; then she told me what had happened. I told her, if I saw him again, I would secure him. One day, about three weeks ago, after having been looking for him, I was informed he was in custody. I asked him if he did not remember seeing me that day; he said No, at first; afterwards he said, Yes, he did. He said to her, That gentleman (meaning me) is your friend, and said to me, You are a young man as well as myself, if you will make this matter up, I will return the buckles. He said, what other injury he had done he would make her any recompence for she should require.</p>

I said, why? says she, he says he has had an aunt died that has left him 700 l. I said, so much the better; she said, if I had half of that, it would be the making of me: I said, so it might be. I asked if he was her husband; she said, no; she said he was an acquaintance he had met with by Bethlem; she said they went up to the gate, but it was not time to go in; she told me they were to go to the play in the afternoon, and that they were a going to take a walk till the afternoon; she bid me say I was her cousin; that we should all three go together, and she would make him pay for all.

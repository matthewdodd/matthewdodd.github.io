Bank notes, and 25 s. in silver - there were nine half-crowns amongst it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen your watch - A. On the Friday night. I went to the play about six o'clock, and saw every thing safe then, and the lock of the drawer also; I did not look at it again till morning, when I found it broken open. The prisoner was at home abed when I came home in the evening. On missing the property I advertised it, and immediately sent to his father. I have since seen the handkerchief the watch was in, but nothing else that I can swear to - (Clemence here produced a handkerchief) - this is it; I know it by the work, a young woman hemmed it for me; I know her work. Some notes were found - (looks at them) - they are folded up in the same manner as I fold them. I am certain the handkerchief is mine - my name is not on it; I know it by the neat work on it. The prisoner was apprehended on the Monday after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. The money belongs to me - A. He had not got a shilling, nor hardly a rag on his back.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sent for to take the prisoner in charge - his father brought him out of the crowd at the execution of the state prisoners - I took the handkerchief off his neck. I found 1 l. 12 s. 6 d. in his trowsers pocket, and in his fob I found two 1 l. Bank notes. He had new stockings and new half-boots on, and another new silk handkerchief. I asked him how he came by them? he gave me no answer; he appeared rather in liquor - it was about eleven o'clock. I heard him tell Mr. Birnie that he sold the property to a Jew in Houndsditch. I went to a Jew's house, but found nothing. He said he sold the watch for 2 l., or 2 l. odd, that the Jew told him it was metal, and that all the money he received of the Jew was 2 l. 16 s.</p>

            . I keep the Ship tavern, Charing-cross. Knowing the prosecutrix had lost this property, when the prisoner was in custody I questioned him how he disposed of it - I neither threatened nor promised him. He said he was afraid other persons would be led into trouble if he gave any account of it, and as for himself, he wished to go out of the country.</p>
               <p>MRS. TRIGG re-examined. I do not know who I took the notes of. The watch cost me fifty-five guineas thirty years ago. The outside case was very heavy fine gold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am very sorry that I have done it.</p>

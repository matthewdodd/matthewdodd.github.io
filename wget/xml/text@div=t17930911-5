I went that evening and saw the prisoner near twelve o'clock, between eleven and twelve o'clock, at his lodgings very much intoxicated, he was so much intoxicated I believe he hardly knew what he did; he had more than two hundred pounds about him, and he desired me to take the two hundred pounds and give him what belonged to him; he had changed one of them, and he had the twenty guineas in cash, and the rest in silver; the Bow-street officer took the notes. I attended before the magistrate the next morning.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My lord and gentleman of the jury, on the 29th of July last, after I had been at dinner I drank more than I do in common. It is very true I came about three o'clock to Mr. Lewis's chambers, and I saw these notes on Mr. Vizard's desk; I had occasion to go down stairs, I remember perfectly well it was a very warm day, and not knowing where to find the key of the chamber, in order to lock the door after me, I put these notes into my pocket for fear that any body should slip up in the interim; on which I went and had two or three glasses of brandy and water, and that threw up into my head, and this business was merely through intemperance, and not guilt. I went home finding myself intoxicated with liquor, thinking the next morning to have seen Mr. Lewis to have returned him this property. I had not any intention of going away, or otherwise other methods might have been pursued. I did not go to the office that afternoon as I was ashamed to face Mr. Lewis being so much in liquor. I believe this is the first offence that I have ever committed of the kind in my life time; I was never at the bar before. One favour I beg, is that as I have not the least doubt but Mr. Lewis has received letters from some people at Guildford, if they could be read it would be a particular indulgence; after that I submit myself to your lordship, and you gentlemen of the jury.</p>
               <p>Lewis. He was in my service a month, and I have heard an extreme good character of him, a gentleman, Mr. Sibhorpe, called on me who has known him twenty years.</p>

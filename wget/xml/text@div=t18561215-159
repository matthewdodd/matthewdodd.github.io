                  </hi>, Jun. I am porter to Mr. Sable, of No. 80, Coleman-street. About 5 o'clock, on the evening of 11th Dec., I was in a part of Mr. Sable's premises with the prisoner Hewitt—somebody whistled in the yard—upon hearing that, Hewitt went down directly, to speak to the man in the yard—it would be dark then, but there was a sufficient light thrown into the yard for me to discern any one—I did not hear him speak, but I saw him speak—he came back again to where I was—I was present when the doors were closed in the evening—I saw Hewitt, about 6 o'clock, move the truck near the plate glass warehouse door—that opens upon the yard as the large door fastened from within—the doors were closed when I left, and Hewitt left me about half past 6 o'clock—it was his duty to close them, provided he found that they were open—they are folding doors, but are divided into four—he was the last that went back into the premises, but we all left about the same time—in consequence of what I had seen, I spoke to my father—there is a lobby at the bottom part of the premises, in a direct line with the plate glass room door—that is on the ground floor—when you get outside the plate glass room you are in the yard—the door that is in the lobby you come out of last—the great gate that encloses the yard is in Coleman-street—the premises are at the bottom, and the door that I mean is in a line with the plate glass room door—when I heard this whistle, the prisoner was on the first floor—he went out through the lobby door into the yard—that is a side door—there is a door into the lobby, out of the plate glass room—I went out of the front door into the yard, and then went by the side door; that also opens from the yard into the lobby—from the interior of Mr. Sable's warehouse you can go into the plate glass room—the lobby leads into dif<lb></lb>ferent parts of the premises—I was not in the plate glass room—I came down the staircase that leads into the lobby—I and Hewitt came from the first floor down the staircase into the lobby—that lobby is beside the plate glass warehouse—Hewitt went into the yard out of the lobby door, removed the truck belonging to my employer, and moved it to the door of the plate glass warehouse—after that we returned again to the lobby, and went back again into the premises upstairs—he returned very shortly, and went into the general office, and took down the keys from the hook—I was then in the lobby as well—I, Hewitt, and the clerk then came away—I went home directly to my father—I did not see Hewitt do anything—I saw him lock the door when we were leaving the premises at half past 6 o'clock—I saw him lock the wicket door, and the door leading into the lobby—I did not see him do anything to the door of the plate glass room—I went to the station house that night, and there saw the truck, and the property that was in it—it was Mr. Sable's truck and glass.</p>

Q.</hi> Are you sure it was your employer's glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was very like it—when we go into the yard we first go through the wicket gate leading from Coleman street—then the plate glass room door would face you—the plate glass room has large doors opening into the yard—the lobby door is to the right—there is no other entrance to the premises, except that in Coleman-street, except we go through Mr. Astle's, which we never do—we might do it if we had permis<lb></lb>sion—we can get into our yard by going through his house—I believe it is a common yard—Mr. Astle does go through it—the general office can be got at by a door in the lobby on the right—there is a door that leads into the yard in the lobby, but it is kept bolted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, at No. 12, Cradle-street. I am father of the last witness—in consequence of what my son said I watched Mr. Sable's premises—about half past 7 o'clock, I was in Cradle-street, and heard a truck coming at the back of the gate in the yard—I was then a few yards from the gate—I heard as if the bar of the gate had fallen, and then the gates opened—I saw Rush—Clarke had the truck, and the other stopped to fasten the gate—I saw a third person—I could not swear to him as I did not see his face—he came out into the street, but went in again directly—they went towards Fore-street—the third man remained in the yard—he resembled Hewitt, but I cannot swear it was him.</p>

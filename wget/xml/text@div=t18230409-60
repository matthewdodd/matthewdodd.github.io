He said there were more than five missing, and they were dead, and he sold the skins to those people who would give him most money for them - he had no authority to do so. Next day he expressed his regret that he had told an untruth, and said only five were missing, and he had sold the skins to one Saxton. He was taken into custody on the 24th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had he been your shepherd - A. Since the 15th of April last. He came from Hampshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he took them, believing them to be his right, for when a ewe had two one was his - A. He said he had a right to all that died. He mentioned no name but Saxton.</p>

            . I am bailiff to the prosecutor, and live at his farm at Twickenham. On the 8th of February, there was a hundred and six lambs. I counted them that day. There was another after, making a hundred and seven. I saw them every day, and missed none of them. I had asked the prisoner how his flock was, once or twice; he said very well. They were counted on the 15th of March, and then there were only a hundred and two. I asked what had become of the others; he said they had died, and that he had sold the skins to those who would give the most for them. He afterwards said he had sold them to one Saxton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many did he say he had sold - A. Five. He said he was entitled to them in the country he came from; that when they foaled double, and the lamb died, it was his from lambing to shearing time; or he was to have a guinea and a month's board. He said so when he was first spoken to about them. He continued at his duty as usual, and was taken seven days after.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 24th of March, at a public-house, at Hounslow-heath. He said he knew what it was for, that he had expected it this three days; that it was for selling three lamb's skins for three halfpence each, to Saxton, on the Heath. I called on him when he was in prison, and particularly cautioned him what he said. He stated he had sold two lambs to Mrs. Clark's little boy, at the Cross Lancers, Hounslow-heath; that he considered them his property, and that he had 1 s. 6 d. for one, and 2 s. for the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who desired you to go to him in prison - A. I went about some sheep, which he was not implicated in.</p>

            . I keep the Cross Lancers, at Hounslow. I came into the house on the 20th of September, and the next day, or about that time, the prisoner came in to have some beer - he was a stranger. My little boy wanted lambs. The servant went and spoke to the prisoner about it. He said,</p>
               <p>"Very well, my little man, I'll see about one for you when there is one to spare." Next afternoon he brought one; I gave him a bottle. He got a quill and milk, to show the child how to make it suck. The lamb was weak, and I put it into a box with hay. He then went into the tap-room, and had a pot of beer. I gave him 1 s. and he went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He did not ask for the shilling - A. No; I gave it him for his trouble. I should think the lamb had been foaled a day or so.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ten years old, and live at 3, Little Eeppel Street, Chelsea—on 9th December I had been to Tooting, and had got a half<lb></lb>sovereign in gold from my father's master—the prisoner said to me, "Halloa, my little man, where are you going to?—I said, "To Victoria"—she said, "I am going there; let me hold your money till I get to. Victoria, and then I will give it to you"—I let her hold it—I did not intend to give it to her; she took it out of my hand—I asked her for it back again, and she said, "Wait a moment, till I get a little further, and then I will give it you"—I could not get it from her; she would not give it to me—I fol<lb></lb>lowed her, and saw a policeman by the Red House public-house—I halloaed out, "That woman has got my money," and the cabman called to the police<lb></lb>man—that was an hour and a half after she took my money, but I had not lost sight of her during that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was going from Balham to Tooting. You asked me to show you the way, and I did so. I went and did my business, and met you again with three or four boys of your own age, with something in your hand in a newspaper. I asked you whether you had anything to eat since you left home; you said, "No," and I bought you a bun. You asked me to pay for your train, and gave me your money to do so, and then you cried and said I had your money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You did buy me a bun; there were no other boys with me—I had a half ticket; I had been from Tooting to Victoria, and took a return ticket; I told you I was going to the station at Tooting, and you said you would go with me; we went by the train; it was at Tooting that you asked me for the money; the Red House is at Chelsea; after we got out of the train at Victoria, you asked me to call a cab for you, and asked me if I would ride in it with you; I did so because you had got my half-sovereign; you stopped the cab at the Red House, Chelsea, to get some rum and water, and I got out so that you should not run away with my money, and when you were going back into the cab the cabman called a policeman; I should not have gone into the cab if you had not had my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver, of 21, Croydon Street, Marylebone—the prisoner and a little boy hailed me by the Victoria Station, and said "How much to King's Road, Chelsea?"—I said "A shilling"—she said "You don't mind this little boy riding with me, he is going the same way"—I stopped and asked her where she wanted to go to, and she said "Pull up, I am going to have two pennyworth of rum warm"—she asked me to have some—I went to the door with her, and she said that she wanted to lose the' boy, but he was very artful—she said she would give me half-a-crown to go back again—she went down Sloane Street to the Red House, and I followed with the cab, as I thought she intended losing me—I pulled up and she said "When I get into the cab, you drive off as quick as you can"—the boy halloaed out "That woman has got my money, master"—a policeman came up and put her into the cab, and I drove her to the station.</p>

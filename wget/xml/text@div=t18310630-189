On the 7th of May, a little before five o'clock in the morning, the servant alarmed me - I went into the warehouse, and discovered several pieces of of silk laying on the floor in the counting-house, and on going into the back warehouse I found the desk broken open, several bundles of silk taken off the shelf, unpacked, and laid on the counter; several parcels of silk were gone, and about 12l. in money - I found the house had been entered by a centre-bit being bored through the outer shutter, and a piece extracted sufficiently large to enter a hand; the bolt had then been undone, the window-sash thrown up, and the shutters opened; after that they cut through the inside shutter, and threw the shutter back - the inside shutter, to which a large bell was attached, was taken down - the bar and bell were laid in the yard; I saw the property at the Mansion-house that morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. From the manner the house was entered, did it not appear to be the act of a man or men? A. I should conceive so - a workshop at the back of the warehouse was also broken open and entered.</p>

            . I live with my father, in King-square, Horse Shoe-alley, which is nearly opposite the back of Mr. Kent's house; I was up all night at work with my mother, and about four o'clock in the morning I went to the window, and saw two men at a dust-hole in our court, about four houses from the back of Kent's premises - each of them took a parcel out of the dust-hole, and put them into the prisoner's basket - she was there with another woman: the bundles appeared to contain something soft - I am quite sure the prisoner is the woman; it was day-light - I saw her in custody in about a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.What time was it? A. I first saw them at the dust-hole about four o'clock; the women were there all the time, from the time she came till she went away; the bundles appeared concealed in the dust-hole, as if they had come to fetch them; I did not see them placed there - they were deposited in the dust-hole; there was not time to break the premises open and bring the property there while I saw them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When you first looked out of window was any body at the dust-hole? A.They were going to the dust-hole then - they were passing our window; they came out of Horse Shoe-alley - I should know the men again.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH RYAN. I am a Policeman. I was in Bishopsgate-street, nearly a quarter of a mile from Mr. Kent's,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300097"></xptr>and saw two women and two men - the prisoner was earrying two bundles of silk in a basket; I took her - the men and the other woman ran away into Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen the prosecutor's premises? A. I went there about two hours after; it might have been done by women or men, for there are the most notorious thieves in that neighbourhood, in Golden-lane, where they live; I went to the prisoner's place on the Saturday - there is a whole family there in the name of Hooker; I cannot tell whether a man lives with her as her husband - we took a man named Hooker on suspicion, being found walking about that very morning at two o'clock - he had three hearings, and was discharged; I stopped the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street, and asked how she came by the bundles - she said a man she met at that time in the morning, had hired her; I do not recollect whether I stated this to the Magistrate - my deposition was read over to me by the clerk; the dust-hole is on my beat - it communicates with the back of a shed at the back of Mr. Kent's house - there is a wall crosses; a person could step on the dust-hole, and get on the top of the wall, and scale the wall about thirty feet into the premises - the wall may be about twelve feet high.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.How high is the top of the wall from the top of the dust-hole? A.It goes within two feet and a half of the top, I think.</p>

            . I am a City watchman. On the 17th of May Ryan came to me; I saw the prisoner, two men, and another woman; the prisoner was carrying two baskets on her head - I crossed Bishopsgate-street, touched her on the shoulder, and asked what she had got in the baskets; she said "Nothing," in a low voice, and then threw them down - I laid hold of her, and the men made their escape.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.When you first saw them were they walking or standing still? A. The two men were walking towards the dust-hole, and the woman were standing still, six or seven yards from the dust-hole; I cannot say how long the women had been there - the women were furthest from the dust-hole.</p>

            . This is the prosecutor's property: the premises were broken into, the back way - the wall by the dust-hole is not the wall of our premises; a person could step on the dust-bin, and walk along the wall about two yards, then along a building, and from the end of that step on our back wall, and drop down into the yard - the dust-bin is about ten yards from the premises.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What height must a person drop from the top of the wall? A. They could step on a gasmeter about four feet down, and then from the gas-meter three or four feet to the ground.</p>

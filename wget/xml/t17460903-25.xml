               <p>Court. So you went out of the House when she said she would have you nabb'd? Which of them will you swear has pick'd your Pocket? if you can't swear it, there is an End of the Prosecution. Here are two Persons indicted for privately stealing your Watch, &amp;c. which of them can you say is the guilty Person. If you have no other Evidence, you must reap the Fruit of your own Folly for going to such wicked Places.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Daley, of 14, Cannon-street-road. On 7th Aug. the prisoner came to my house with my daughter, who stated that she had been very kind to her when she was ill—in the afternoon I sent her with my two daughters into the up-stairs front-room, where I had two sovereigns and twenty-se ven shillings in a glass cupboard—I saw it safe that afternoon—my daughter is married, and does not live with me—I saw the money safe next morning, about twelve o'clock—a man came down into the kitchen that morning—I was washing—I did not see him come into the house, my child opened the door—he stayed two or three minutes, and then went away"—I saw him go out at the door—about twenty minutes after he was gone, the prisoner came—she came direct into the wash-house, and told roe I must go to my daughter directly, as she was dying—she offered to do the wash, and stay till I came back—I gave the key of the cupboard where the money was to my little daughter Julia, went to my daughter's, and found her quite well—I went back home, and found the prisoner and all my money gone, and the saltcellar in which it was—I found the key on the dresser, where my girl had laid it—I did not see the prisoner again till she was in custody—I have never seen the saltcellar or money again.</p>

The prisoner came and told my mother my sister was very bad, and she was to go immediately—my mother gave me the key of the cupboard where the money was, and went—after she was gone, I went down-stairs, and laid the key on the dresser—the prisoner said she felt very faint—I said, "Will you have a drop of beer?"—she said, "No; will you go and get me three pennyworth of brandy"—I went, and was away about five minutes—I left her behind, and when I came back she was gone—I found the key where. I left it.</p>

I was at my mother's house with the prisoner, and while there, 1 took the saltcellar out of the cupboard with the money in it—the prisoner was there at the time—I put it back, locked the cupboard, and took the key down to my mother—I was not ill the next day, and did not send the pri<lb></lb>soner to my mother to say so—the prisoner was at my house that day, said her father was very ill, and she was going to see him at Finsbury-square, and would be back in an hour and a half.</p>

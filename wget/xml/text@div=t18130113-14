            . I am a furniture-broker, Castle-street, Long Acre. The prisoner applied to me to purchase this piece of oil-cloth, on the 23st of December. I went and looked at it, and purchased it. He applied to me a day or two after, to know whether I could purchase another piece. I told him, I could not, unless I knew where it came from, to know whether it was stolen property. A person was sent with it. The prisoner told me he brought it from Whitechapel-road, and on the second piece of cloth coming to my house, I went down to Mr. Hayward, and asked him if he had lost any property. I am sure the prisoner is the man. He delivered the second piece, but not personally. This is the piece of floor-cloth I paid for; and I received it of the prisoner.</p>

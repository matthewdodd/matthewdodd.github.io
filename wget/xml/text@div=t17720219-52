I lost a piece of woollen Bath coating on the 18th of January from the shop window. I was in the back room; my opposite neighbour came in, and said a person had stole my roll of cloth and run up Chick-lane. I missed the cloth and ran after him; I catched him just by Black-boy-alley. He got away from me by main force, and went down King's-arms-yard in Chick-lane. He was taken that night in Black-boy-alley, in a disorderly house, for beating a woman. A constable was got, who took him, and found in his pocket some tools for house-breaking. I was sent for to appear against him; I took him before the Lord Mayor. (The cloth produced, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him after he took the cloth?</p>
               <p>Keys. He took the cloth on Saturday, and I did not see him again till Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him when you saw him on Monday?</p>
               <p>Keys. Yes; I had seen him many times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very sure the prisoner is the man you caught with your cloth in Chick-lane?</p>
               <p>Keys. Yes.</p>

               <p>I was coming down Saffron-hill and a cart hauled this cloth from the window; a man took it up and gave it me; and this man ran after me and took it away from me; I am a ship-carpenter.</p>

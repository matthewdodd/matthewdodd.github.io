                  </hi>. I am clerk to a ship's store dealer in the Minories—on Saturday night, 24th February, about 12.30, I was going over London Bridge, and the prisoner pushed up against me and made some re<lb></lb>mark—I could not pass him for some time—I saw his hand close to my scarf—I afterwards missed my pin, and went after him and collared him—he said he would walk quietly if I released him—I did so, and he ran away, but was caught by a policeman—one or two others were with him—I had not been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hairdresser, of 80, Mile End Road—on the even<lb></lb>ing of 24th February I was going towards Old Kent Road, and saw the pro<lb></lb>secutor coming from London Bridge station—the prisoner and two other young men went up to him—he got in front of him, and said "Halloa, old fellow, which way are you going?" and put his hand to his scarf and took something—the prosecutor went about twenty yards, missed his pin, and ran and caught him—they struggled, and the other two fellows went up, and he said "<hi rend="italic">Tip hold</hi>," and gave the pin to them, and then said "Search me; I have not got the pin"—I saw him given in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Which way was the gentleman coming? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Towards the City—a young girl who passed him spoke to him, but he did not answer her—she gave evidence at the Police Court that you took the pin—she had not hold of his arm.</p>

I was on duty in Fish Street Hill, and heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I ran out of a court into Fish Street Hill, and saw the prisoner turn the corner, running—I stopped him and asked him what was the matter—he said "Nothing"—I said "We had better stop a minute and see;" and in about half a minute Mr. King came up, and said that he was wanted for stealing a pin on the bridge.</p>

On the 16th of May, from information I received, I found eleven pair and a half of shoe ramps, and two pair of boot fronts concealed under the stairs, leading to the cellar. On the following day I ordered Whitehorn, the porter, to conceal himself and watch. I sent Brenan into the cellar to fetch some oil, and the last time he went Whitehorn returned before him, and from what he said I called Brenan several times from the cellar; I was obliged to send my son to fetch him before he came - I then told him his conduct was very plain, and he had better disclose all he knew of the robbery. I sent my son with him to the leather room, which is below stairs; they brought up the shoe vamps and fronts, which were the same I had marked the evening before. I had them taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How many people have you about your premises - A. About twenty generally. Brenan has been about a year and a half with me - they were both in my service. The coarse leather was kept down stairs, but not this. All the people have access to the cellar.</p>

            . I found these things under the cellar stairs, on Friday evening, the 16th of May, about eight o'clock. I watched next day by my master's order, and saw Brenan go down to them, and put his hand on them, and go away without taking them - he saw me concealed, and asked what brought me there, and I asked what brought him there - he made no answer. I informed my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were you concealed - A. Opposite the stairs. He took none of the leather away.</p>

            , JUN. I live with my father. I went to the cellar stairs, and called Brenan up twice; he came up at the second call. I accused him of robbing my father before my father spoke to him, and said if he expected mercy, he must confess the whole - he took me down stairs, and gave me the Wellington fronts from under the stairs, and the vamps from another cellar; it was altogether when I first saw it.</p>

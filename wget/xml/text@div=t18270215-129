On the 12th of January, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop with her daughter, who is a woman - I had seen her there before, to the best of my belief; I have since found that she resided at No. 6, Paradise-row, Bethnal-green; she asked to see some lace, and chose a piece, desiring me to cut three yards and a half at 9d., which I did; I rolled it up, and think I laid it on a box behind me, and put the rest into a box; she asked to see some half-stockings - I shewed her seven or eight pairs in a paper; she bought none, but said she had bought better for the money, and did not like them; while she was looking at them, I saw her take a pair with her left hand, and put them into her muff - she was sitting with the muff in her lap, below the counter; she did it while she was saying she would not take any - I then asked if I could show her any thing else - she said No, and took out her purse, and paid me 2s. 7d1/2. for the lace - I did it up in paper; I did not like to leave her, and called a young woman to give her change for a 6d.; I then said, "You will excuse me, Ma'am, but you have a pair of stockings in your muff;" she said she had not; I reached my hand across - she then took them out of her muff, and put them on the counter - I laid my hand on them, and she said, "I will give you 10d. for that pair of stockings if you like." I said "No, you shall not have them, Ma'am;" and expressed my surprise at a person of her appearance doing such a thing, and said I hoped she had got nothing else; she shook her muff with her left hand, her right hand was below it; I looked over, and saw a card of lace laying on the floor where she had been sitting; I then said I could not let her go - I sent for Mr. Hopkins down, who asked her to give her name and address, but she would not; an officer was sent for, who took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing fall when she shook her muff with her left hand? A. No; she shook the muff between herself and the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you not now know that her husband is in a good situation? A. I have learnt so since. She did afterwards give me her card; I am almost certain I had seen her before; she put the stockings into her muff, not upon it; when she took her hand from her muff, I saw part of the stockings out of the muff.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said she had got the stockings, was not her answer, "I think not?" A. She might say so; I had asked 1s. a pair for them - I did not offer them for 1s. after she produced them; she sat on a stool, the height of which is about a foot below the counter; her muff was not quite so high as the counter; I saw the lace in her hand at the time she chose the other piece - I think she put it on the counter again; I went to the office that evening; she was not admitted to bail till Monday.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was she a ready money customer? A. All our business is done for ready money. I did not know the lace was left out of the box; I put the box away from the counter, and did not see the lace afterwards; I put all into the box except one piece, which was laying under the daughter's muff - I took that piece, and then thought I had got all the lace (but I could not have put this piece in), and then shewed the stockings; I saw nothing in her right hand when she was shaking her muff.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How could she shake her muff between herself and the counter? A. She moved her knees to do it, but still kept sitting; our counter is about two feet and a half wide; there were people on the other side of the shop; we have fourteen or fifteen servants.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Hopkins' employ. I stood at Whitaker's side, and heard him ask the prisoner for a pair of stockings from her muff; she said "I have not got them." I saw them in her muff - the end of them was rather out - she then offered 10d. for them; I saw her shake her muff - I cannot say which hand she shook it with; I did not see what fell from it - I have no doubt but she shook it with her right hand - her left hand was on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you say at the office that nothing could have fallen from the muff? A. I said I saw nothing fall.</p>

               <p>ALICE YOUNG FORMAN. I went with mother to purchase the lace which was for me, and a pair of socks for my brother; we have been at the prosecutor's shop several times; she sat on a high stool at the counter - I was by her side; several cards of lace were scattered about the counter - her arm was sometimes on the counter, and on her muff - if she had taken up the stockings, and put them into her muff, I must have seen it; I know nothing of the lace.</p>

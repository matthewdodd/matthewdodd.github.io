I sent him out at a quarter or ten minutes to 10 o'clock in the morning—he was going to the East India Docks, and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he returned from that journey about 1 o'clock—on the Monday morning he handed me his book, with these two toll tickets in it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the entry is 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. paid at the Bull and Mouth, and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at the cloak room of the Shoreditch station—the toll tickets are one for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that made altogether 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took the sum</p>

               <p>found two parcels done up in other papers—I opened it, and found it contained blank tickets for turnpike trusts—after examining them, I communicated with Mr. Slater, and he desired me to bring the parcel to him, and I did so.</p>

                  </hi>.

                  </hi>. I am a toll collector, at the Mackworth Arms' gate. On Saturday, 26th Nov., I relieved the witness Tripp—I came on duty at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and staid till 4 o'clock on Sunday—the prisoner did not come through the gate on Saturday afternoon, to my knowledge—I did not give him either of these tickets, they are not genuine tickets.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. Morrison—I go out with the cart, along with the man.

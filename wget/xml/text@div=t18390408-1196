                  </hi>. I am shopman to Henry Flower Fenner, of Brill-row, Somers-town. On the 15th of March the prisoner came to the shop, and after she was gone, I missed a waistcoat—I inquired where she lived, went to her house, and said we had missed a waistcoat—she came back with me and said she would fetch it, if I would let her go—I gave her in charge—I had known her before—I do not know that she is weak in her mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a haddock smoker, and live at 7, Walker Street, Long Lane—about half-past twelve in the night or morning of 14th February I was drinking with John Kendall—when we left the public-house we stood talking at the top of Sweeps' Alley; we were sober—as we were returning home we saw the prisoner sharpening a knife on a door-step, and as we passed by he made use of some bad language, and said he would cut the first man's throat that he came <hi rend="italic">anigk</hi>—I said nothing to him, but as I took two steps past him he ran at me and plunged the knife into my throat; he then turned round and ran away—I saw that he had a knife in his hand—I had never seen him before.</p>

            . I am a ship insurance agent. On Sunday, the 12th of August, about a quarter after four o'clock in the afternoon, both the prisoners passed me in Beaumont-square, about thirty or forty yards from the prosecutor's house - Ferry was carrying a bundle, which he threw away - I had not spoken to them; they were both in company, but Ferry came along first, and Hall a few yards after him; they came in a direction from the prosecutor's house - I did not see them come out of the house - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and then the bundle was thrown away; they both ran away - I pursued down a very narrow lane - Ferry was first, and was stopped by another man, in my sight; Hall was running after him; I was close in pursuit: and as Hall ran, he threw away three different parcels over a wall - I did not stop to get them up, but, having a rule in my pocket, I immediately scratched a mark on the wall, to know the place, and still pursued; another person came by me, and stopped him - I immediately collared him, and the other man let Ferry go immediately - I took Hall back to the garden, where he threw the things over, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130041"></xptr>were handed over to me - I am certain of both the prisoners - I searched Hall myself, as nobody was in the watch-house, and found on him a chissel, a brad-awl, a waistcoat, a glass, and phosphorus-box, a shirt in his hat, and a baby's cap, or something - I am sure Ferry is the man who threw away the large bundle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know Ferry before? A. No - I did not see him come out of the house; he did not run very fast at first - I have not seen the man here who took Ferry; he was retaken a long time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you made inquiry about Hall since this occurred? A. I have no doubt he has been led into it - I have reason to believe his parents are highly repectable, and he has been the dupe of some other person.</p>

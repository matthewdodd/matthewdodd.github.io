                  </hi>. I am a publishing bookseller, and live in Paternoster<lb></lb>row. The prisoner was in my service, as a porter and collector for about eleven months—in consequence of something that occurred, I gave him into custody, on the 9th of Feb.—he was taken to the station—I saw a duplicate found on him—I proceeded with it to the shop of Mr. Lamb, a pawnbroker, in Stan<lb></lb>hope-street, Clare-market, and there I found this copy of the <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi>, and twenty-three numbers of <hi rend="italic">Knight's London</hi>—I afterwards went to Mr. Winton, a publican, in Wych-street, Strand—I found there these six numbers of <hi rend="italic">Froissart's Chronicle</hi>—these are not works which I have published, but which I have sold and dealt in—the prisoner was my porter, but he had nothing to do with selling property across the counter, or dealing with it in any way—he would have access to the books—he came to me at eight o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, and remained till nine at night—I had a right to all his time during those hours—I paid him his wages every Saturday—I missed this volume of the <hi rend="italic">Mirror.</hi>

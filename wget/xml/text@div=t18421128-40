               <p>with considerable force—she had a contused wound on the left arm—that might have been inflicted with the poker—on the third day after she came in, she had a general inflammation on the head—her death was caused by secondary abscesses of the left thigh and right breast, caused by the absorption of matter from the head, and sloughs came away—she was getting better, but on the 14th of Nov. she was attacked with shivering and sickness, never rallied after<lb></lb>wards, and died on the 19th—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body, and found the membranes of the brain perfectly healthy—there was matter on the veins of the left thigh, and they were inflamed—it was there I had observed the secondary abscesses had begun to form—there was also an abscess under the right breast—she died of the inflamed veins and the secondary abscesses, caused, in my judgment, by the wound in her head—I have not the slightest doubt of it.</p>

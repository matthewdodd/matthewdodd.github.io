I shew'd her some: after we had agreed for one, she made a frivolous excuse to go out, and asked for a bit of foul paper. I missing a parcel of handkerchiefs, went out after her, and took her with the handkerchiefs mentioned in the indictment upon her, (produced in court, and deposed to as his master's property) here are our private mark upon them. She left a half guinea on the counter to be changed, and the other woman was to have taken the change, but upon my going out after the prisoner, that other woman made off.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she cheapened a handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Risby. She had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she also leave a bundle on the counter?</p>
               <p>Risby. There was a bundle left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look into that bundle?</p>
               <p>Risby. No, I did not, the constable did, but he has business else-where, and is not here. There was some dirty shirts in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not a child with her?</p>
               <p>Risby. She had one in her arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not that piece of handkerchiefs be taken up by mistake with the child?</p>
               <p>Risby. No, because she begged I would not hang her, and said it was the first time that ever she was guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the shirts she left?</p>
               <p>Risby. I know not the value of them, they were old and of little value.</p>

             brought the prisoner into my master's shop; his name is Johnson, who lives just by him. He desired I would take notice of what was in her apron; I saw him take out of it a dozen of silk handkerchiefs. He desired me to fetch a constable; I did, she fell on her knees, and desir'd he would not prosecute her for the sake of her children; after that she was taken before my Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I went into that shop to buy a silk handkerchief; I bargained for one for 3 s. 6 d. I had my child in my arms; I laid it on the counter to give it the breast; laid down half a guinea; I found my child had fouled itself; I swept its things up together, and went out to clean it; he came and taped me on my shoulder, and said I had got something of his; I said if I had, it was more than I knew, if I had had a Mind to have defrauded him, I should not have left the half guinea; I intended as soon as I had cleaned my child to return again for my change; my shirts that I had left there, were worth about 30 s. at 3 s. 6 d. each. I am downright innocent before God and the world; I had no woman with me in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to Risby. How many shirts where there in her bundle?</p>
               <p>Risby. I do not know, the woman that came in with the prisoner, was to have taken the change of the half guinea, and was to take care of the shirts, but upon my going out after the prisoner, she went off immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought in the bundle?</p>

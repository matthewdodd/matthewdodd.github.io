               <p>JOSEPH FRYER. I am a constable of Lincoln's-inn-fields, appointed by the trustees. I live in Princes-street, Gate-street. In consequence of information which I received on the 6th of December,I met a man of the name of Baker, who is a constable of Lincoln's-inn, and Spruhan; I did not know them before-we did nothing then. I met them again on the 10th; we went to Seven Dials, about six o'clock in the evening, having received instructions from Mr. Powel, an assistant to the Solicitors of the Mint; Mr. Baker gave me two shillings, an eighteen-penny piece, and a half-crown on the 6th of December - They were all marked.</p>
               <p>Q. You went on the 10th to Seven Dials, did you see any body - A.Spruhan left me and Baker together; we all three separated, and Baker stood close by, so that I could see him-Spruhan went down White Lion-court, and returned with the prisoner. Spruhan called me, I went to him, the prisoner was with him; we went to a public-house in Little Earl-street, kept by Owen; Spruhan called for three half-quarterns of gin; we stood at the bar, each drank a glass. Spruhan then said I ought to stand a pot of beer, I said I would; I called for a pot. While we were drinking it, a woman came in, and offered a shilling for a glass of gin; she put it on the bar, the landlord refused it; the prisoner took it up, looked at it, and said it was a very good one of the sort, but what he had was better.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom did he say so - A. To Spruhan and me - We stood at the bar, he whispered to us; the shilling was put down, and the woman took it away. The prisoner then took us into the corner of a room, close by the bar, and pulled a counterfeit shilling out of his pocket, as a sample of what he had to dispose of; he said they were all like it. We drank the beer, and came out; we all stood by the side of a court next to the public-house; the prisoner asked me how many I wanted? (meaning how many counterfeit shillings) I told him two dozen; he said he had not got two dozen, he had only eleven, and would let me have them. I told him that I would only take six; he put his hand into his pocket which contained the counterfeit shillings, and gave me six; I then gave him two shillings and an eighteen-penny piece in payment; they were all marked. The rate of dealing was two bad shillings for one good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you give him two shillings and an eighteen-penny piece - A. I had no change that was marked. I told him I had given him 3s.6d.; he said he did not know it-Spruhan was there the whole time. The prisoner took the money out of his pocket that I had given him, and said, "You are right, you have given me sixpence too much." He asked Spruhan if he did not want any? Spruhan said, he had no money; he said he would let him have two till the next night, and persuaded him very much to take them; Spruhan declined it. The prisoner went into the same public-house which we had come out of, and got change, and brought sixpence, and gave it to me. We then walked down to Seven Dials. The prisoner asked me if I knew how to make the money ring? I said, no; he told me to lay a knife on the counterfeit money, and put a hot iron on the knife, and then put the money into vinegar when hot, and that would make them ring.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened then - A. Baker and I had agreed, that when I had made the purchase, I was to take my hat off, as a signal for him to come up, and take the prisoner - Baker came up, and took him into custody, and asked him what he had been doing? he said, nothing. Baker tried to push him into a shop, which he did; and in going in, the prisoner threw a parcel of counterfeit money about the ground-Baker picked it up. He searched him, and I believe he found four-pence or five-pence in halfpence on him. He threw good and bad money down. I was by his side - I saw the marked money in Baker's hand; Baker searched me, and took from me the six counterfeit shillings I had taken of the prisoner, and the good half-crown, which was marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What are you besides a constable of Lincoln's-inn-fields - A. No business. I have been a constable for ten months, before that I went to sea.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever before this circumstance been engaged in buying counterfeit coin, or detecting people who uttered it - A. Not before the 17th of November. I have since that been engaged in it by Mr. Powell - I never knew the prisoner before. The public-house is the sign of the Rose and Three Tuns. Spruhan paid for the gin. The marked money had been in my possession ever since the 6th of December. Spruhan was with us, and could hear all that was said. He was not examined before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the magistrate of the woman's offering the bad shilling - A. I do not think I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140057"></xptr>Q. On your oath did you not tell the magistrate that you neither knew the sign of the house, nor the landlord's name - A. I did - I have since found them out. We did not go into any room; he took me into a corner-there was nobody else in the room when I told him I gave him sixpence too much; he did not say, take another shilling, but got change, and gave me a good sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the marked money found - A. No; one of the shillings I had given him was missing.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Where do your friends live - A. At Battle-bridge. My father is gardener of Lincoln's-inn, and has been so for fifteen years. I went to sea at fifteen years of age. I do not remember where I lived last - I have never, in particular, been out of a situation.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you learn what the rate of dealing was for bad money - A. From Spruhan-nothing passed between the prisoner and me about it. When I was before the magistrate I answered the questions that were put to me. Spruhan has got two thumbs on one hand.</p>

            . I am a special constable, sworn in to attend on the Lord Chancellor. On the 10th of December I went to the Seven Dials, with Fryer and Spruhan. After stopping about five minutes, I saw Spruhan, Fryer, and the prisoner together; I was at the corner of White Lion-street - they came up White Lion-street; Fryer joined Spruhan and the prisoner; they went into the Rose and Three Tuns, public-house, in Earl-street - I was nearly opposite the house; they staid there about twenty minutes-all three came out together, and stood at the corner of Monmouth-court, conversing some time, the prisoner and Fryer in particular. In a few minutes I saw something exchanged between the prisoner and Fryer. In two or three minutes after that Spruhan left them; I saw the prisoner go back again to the public-house - He came out in a moment, and Fryer gave me a signal; they went into Earl-street, and staid at the door of a chandler's shop, talking together. I went up to the prisoner, and asked him what he was about? I told him I was a constable, and that I thought he was doing something wrong; I told him he must go into the shop, and after a great deal of resistance on his part, I saw him trying to get his hand into his right hand breeches pocket, I got him into the shop; as he went down the step he pulled something out of his right hand breeches pocket, and dropped it just as he went into the shop. I picked up five counterfeit shillings - I searched him, and found, in his waistcoat pocket, one eighteen-penny piece, and one shilling, which were marked, I had marked them; I knew them to be the same that I gave Fryer, and told him how he was to use them; I found four-pence in halfpence on him. I asked Fryer what he had been about? he said, nothing; I searched him, and in his waistcoat pocket I found a piece of paper, containing six counterfeit shillings, and the marked half-crown, which I had previously given him. I had also given him two shillings and an eighteen-penny piece. I asked Fryer whom he got the bad money of? he said, of the prisoner - They were close together-the prisoner heard it and did not deny it; he said he had reigned long enough, or something of that kind. I took him to Marlborough-street. I produce the money that the prisoner dropped, and what I found on Fryer. The shilling and the eighteen-penny piece are the same I gave to Fryer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORDEN. I never saw him before. I had received directions about a fortnight before to detect utterers of counterfeit coin, from Mr. Powell. I have assisted in convicting utterers two or three times. I first saw Spruhan about a fortnight before. I understood Spruhan knew the prisoner before. Mr. Powell and Spruhan told me that the prisoner was an utterer a few days before the 10th. I did not see Spruhan after I had taken the prisoner - I saw them all three together in the public-house. Fox went back alone to the house-Spruhan left before I went up to Fox; I saw something pass between Fox and Fryer. I saw Spruhan before the examination - I do not think he was examined. The prisoner dropped the six shillings inside the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that you did not like to give evidence about this, and that you would give your evidence very short, because you did not like to be cross-examined - A. I never said any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. REVNOLDS. Q.Was your first acquaintance with Spruhan through Mr. Powell - A. Yes; every transaction with him was under Mr. Powell's direction.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SPRUHAN. I have known the prisoner since last December. A man of the name of Leonard introduced me to him. I gave information to Mr. Powell about the prisoner, and Mr. Powell introduced me to Baker and Fryer. We went together to the Seven Dials. Baker stepped on one side, and I and Fryer went on to White Lion-street - Fox lodges in a cellar there. Fryer stopped two or three doors off; he lived about twenty yards down the street. I went to Fox's lodging-he came out with me, and asked me what kept me till then? I had promised to meet him on the Sunday before, to purchase counterfeit money. I told him I had been to Teddington to see my child. We came up as far as the Seven Dials. I told him there was a particular friend of mine, who wanted a few things, if he could give him them - He said if he did I should come with the person myself. Fryer was quite handy at the time - I told him so, called Fryer to him, and told him that was the man I wished to recommend to him; he said,</p>
               <p>"very well." All three went together into a public-house in Earl-street - I asked for a quartern and a half of gin; we all drank of it. After that I told Fryer that he should stand a pot of beer, by way of footing for the recommendation - He did so. While we were drinking it, a woman came in, called for a glass of liquor, and tendered a connterfeit shilling for it, which was refused. I took it up and looked at it; Fryer did the same, and so did the prisoner, and laid it down again-the woman said she would get it changed. We pushed up close to the door. The prisoner took a counterfeit shilling from his pocket, and said the other was a good one of the sort, but the one he produced was better, and all he had were so too, The pot of beer being nearly drank, I said I could stop no longer, as I had left only my child at home-the prisoner said it was time enough. We paid for the beer, went outside the door, and stood at the end of Monmouth-court; the prisoner then asked Fryer how many he wanted? he said, two dozen; he said he could not let him have two dozen then, as he had only ten or eleven about him. Fryer said as he was not flush in them, half a dozen would do for him that night, as it was late. He took a paper from his pocket, out of which he counted six counterfeit shillings,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140058"></xptr>and gave them to Fryer, who gave him 2s. and a 1s.6d. piece, which the prisoner put into his pocket, and asked me if I was going to have any myself? I told him I had no money, nor time to pass them that night, but would meet him next evening at the Seven Dials. I wished him good night and went home, leaving him and Fryer together. Baker was on the other side of the street, and could see us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I never knew Fox till the 5th of December, and had known Fryer and Baker about a fortnight before. I have known Mr. Powell four years, and during that time have transacted business of this sort. I have known Leonard ever since August, 1816.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tempt Leonard to deal in the same way - A. I do not know a man of the name of Cubit, nor ever had any conversation with him about selling him bad money.</p>
               <p>Q. When Leonard introduced you to the prisoner, what was your conversation - A.He told Fox he introduced me as a friend.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you, or did you not, undertake to supply the prisoner with counterfeit money, if he would put it off - A. Never. I never had the counterfeit shillings in my hand. I live in Bedfordbury. I have been to the prisoner's house since his confinement.</p>

            . I am principal assistant to the Solicitors of the Mint, and have been so for many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you acquainted with the three witnesses who have been examined - A. I was. I gave them directions to detect persons who utter counterfeit coin. I introduced Baker and Fryer to Spruhan for the purpose, and gave them directions how to proceed. They reported to me that the prisoner was taken up - I conducted the prosecution, and brought forward such evidence as I thought proper before the magistrate. I had a particular reason for not bringing Spruhan forward. I look at the five shillings found on the prisoner, and those picked off the ground - They are all counterfeit, and of the same die - They are an imitation of the current coin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I have known Spruhan many years - He introduced himself to me. I first saw him at a police office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About the latter end of November Leonard and I were in a public-house, and the man with two thumbs on one hand came in, and talked with us - He went out, and Leonard told me his name was Spruhan. I never saw him again till he called on me on the 10th of December, he then gave me a parcel, and asked me to go and drink with him - He pointed out Fryer as we were going along; he said he was a friend of his, and that he would be thankful to me to give him (Fryer) what he asked me for out of this paper - I did not know what was in it. Fryer joined us - We went to the public-house, and came out. Fryer said he wanted two or three dozen out of what I had got for him. I opened the paper, and found it contained shillings. While I was counting them he said six would do - I gave him six; he gave me 3s.6d., and then said he had given me 6d. too much - I returned him 6d.; soon after, the constable came up and took me. A mob came round, and in the scufile they knocked the other five shillings out of my hand.</p>
               <p>TIMOTHY CORBETT. I am a labourer, and work for Mr. Day, a builder, in Compton-street. I know Spruhan.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 10th of December, did you see the prisoner, Fox, anywhere - A. Yes, I saw him going towards the Seven Dials, with Spruhan and a man in a blue coat - I did not know the prisoner before. Knowing Spruhan, made me follow them. I saw Spruhan give Fox a paper parcel out of his pocket. They went about a hundred yards up the street; Spruhan put his hand up, and the man in the blue coat went to them; they went into the public-house at the corner of Monmouth-court, I went in after them, and stood behind them all the while; they called for gin. I followed them out, and then went to market; when I returned I saw a mob at the chandler's shop, and saw the man in a blue coat. I told the people what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you going when you first went out - A. To market. I had no other reason for following them than knowing Spruhan. I never saw Fox before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Q. What market did you go to - A. It is what I call market-it is below Marlborough-street, I do not know the name of it. I have been in the habit of going to it for twenty years - I forget the name.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from the public-house - A. It is about half way to Smithfield; I can go there in ten minutes-it was between five and six o'clock on a Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you remember its being on a Thursday - A. Because I go to market every day. They could see me in the public-house. I heard of Fox being taken up a week ago. I did not ask what was the matter at the chandler's shop. Three gentlemen told me to come here in the prisoner's behalf.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you now remember the name of the market - A. I think it is Clare-market. Lumber-court is in the way from it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Now you say it is Clare-market; you said it was not further than from here to Smithfield - A. No.</p>

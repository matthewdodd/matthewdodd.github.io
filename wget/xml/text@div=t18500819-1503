                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at 71, High-street, White<lb></lb>chapel. On 24th July, Mr. Elphinstone handed to me a small portion of a jam-tart, which I have here—I examined it—it contained a considerable quantity of cantharides—they were bruised, not powdered—I found portions of several flies; they are of a golden green colour—the effect upon a person from taking a quantity of cantharides, would be to produce very violent pain in the stomach, in fact the whole of the alimentary canal would suffer; it is an irritant poison—if the proportion in the rest of the tart was the same as it is in this, it would produce most alarming symptoms, and would probably lead to fatal effects—there is a great difference of opinion as to the amount requisite to destroy life—a very small quantity will have a fatal effect with some—with others it might pass off without any injurious, or perhaps slight, symptoms—that would depend upon the predisposition to irritability in the patient—I think a quantity put into a tart in the same proportion as this, would be destructive to life—I have attended Mrs. King—the symptoms under which she laboured, correspond with those which would be produced by taking cantharides—she is still in a very delicate state, and is labouring now from the effects—the piece of tart that was left, was something less than a half-crown in size.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What is the smallest quantity of cantharides likely to occasion death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can only speak from what I have heard and read on the subject—I attended Mr. Taylor's lectures on the subject, and he gives it as his opinion that even a drachm, or somewhat less, may be taken, and in other instances twenty grains has been sufficient to produce death—I have not weighed the quantity I have here, but I should say there is five or six grains—I have not, previous to this, seen persons labouring under the effects of cantharides.</p>

               <p>JOHN SMALLPIECE sworn.</p>
               <p>On Friday, the 29th of January, I lost eleven Seville oranges, eleven China oranges, and twenty-seven lemons, out of my cellar; they are worth 2s. On Thursday the 28th, about eleven o'clock in the evening, I went down in the cellar; I had missed a bag of oranges; I searched the cellar, in expectation of finding them; and found a smock frock laid in a corner; I took it up, and found there was a bag with fruit in it; the bag was tied, and the smock frock tied over it; I untied them both, and told the fruit out of the bag; there were forty-nine in the whole; I tied them up again and put them where I found them; the prisoner was a <rs id="t17960217-41-deflabel235" type="occupation">weekly man</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Vaughan. Q. As to the fruit, of course, a man of your credit will not pretend to swear to oranges and lemons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark upon the bag? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not in the indictment? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never missed any fruit you suspected to be taken by the prisoner? - A. You had better not ask me that question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the Thursday or Friday, to which you are now speaking, take any oranges away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.How long has this man been with you? - A. I believe about five months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who he lived with before? - A. A grocer, in Bishopsgate-street, the corner of the Four Swans Inn; I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever happen to lose your gold watch at any time? - A. The prisoner, I believe, did bring it up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it? - A. I left it in the privy; he gave it to my apprentice, which was certainly a very good act.</p>
               <p>Q. This watch was of something more value than the oranges? - A. Yes; I should have been very much vexed if I had lost it; it was not a gold watch; but it was certainly of considerable value.</p>

               <p>One night the prisoner was nailing down a chest of fruit; he went down for a hoop, and came up again; he put out the candle, and then he went to the stair-head and lapped the fruit up in his apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bag there too? - A. Yes; I saw one end of it hang out of his apron, and then he went out; and I called the other man twice, his name is Charles; and then I called my master; he went after the prisoner, and caught him directly by the Cooper's Arms, in Botolph-lane; I saw my master take him, and I saw the fruit in his hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Vaughan. Q. The Cooper's Arms is a very little way from your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner usually go to that house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

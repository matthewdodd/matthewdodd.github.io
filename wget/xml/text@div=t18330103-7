               <p>JOSEPH PERRY. I keep the Crown and Horse-shoe, Enfield-chase-side; there is a bridge over the New-river within three yards of my door. On the 19th of December last I saw both the prisoners at my house, and I saw the deceased there - I first saw them about eight o'clock at night - I went into the tap-room, and saw the deceased, the prisoner Johnson. Fare, Cooper, Wagstaff, Taylor, and Jackson; nobody else was present, I believe, at that time - I went into the tap-room, and saw Fare laying along a bench, apparently asleep; Johnson laid on two chairs, with his lead on a bench opposite him, and another man named Wager was laying on a bench also - I went to Fare or Wager, I cannot say which exactly, and told them I would not have any sleeping there, and I disturbed the whole of them; I aroused them all, and Fare was angry at it - Fare said, "D-n your eyes, you would not serve me so, but you think I cannot pay for a pot, but I have money that will pay for a gallon;" he put his hand into his pocket, and showed me what appeared to me to be two shillings and a sixpence; I understand he was at that time receiving assistance from the parish - I knew he was not in employment; the deceased, Wagstaff, Taylor, and another, were playing at dominoes at the time - they were playing, as I understood, for a pot of beer; only two pots of beer were taken into the tap-room until ten o'clock; I went into the tap-room at ten o'clock, and the dominoes were taken away - the party still continued in my tap-room, and just afterwards I saw the deceased and Fare tossing for some beer - I went up stairs about a quarter to eleven o'clock, having told them before I went up that it was time to go; the shutters had been shut up at ten o'clock, and I had told my wife not to serve them with any thing more - just as I got to the top of the stairs I heard Fare call for another pot; they said they would go if they had half a pint of gin, and I then heard them go away together - the deceased pulled out a purse several times during the evening; it was a silk net purse, with steel slides and tassels - I had seen it on other occasions in his possession; he took a shilling out of it to pay me for half a gallon of beer, and I afterwards saw him take it out, and take a shilling out to toss with; by the appearance of it there were from twelve to fifteen round coins in it, whether shillings or sovereigns I cannot say, but none of them were larger than a shilling - I saw nothing more of them: about eight o'clock in the morning I was informed of the murder - during the evening the deceased was showing the number of pockets he had in his dress; he appeared to me to have two suits of clothes on, and pockets inside and out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you seen the person several times before at your house? A. At my own house, and at other houses; he has been at my house before - I never saw Johnson in his company before that evening - when he showed his pockets I heard an observation made about it, but do not know whether it was by Cooper - I do not think he was present; Cooper did not come in till past ten - I believe Cooper was the only person who came in; he worked at the brewery opposite - now I come to recollect, it must have been after Cooper came that the pockets were exhibited, as they played at dominoes till ten o'clock, and it was after that; one of the party said, "D-n it, what a number of pockets he has got - he has got sixteen:" but I am certain it was not Cooper's voice, as it is so familiar to me - if he had mentioned it I should have recollected it; the others were in the habit of coming there, but I was not so familiar with their voices as Cooper's - I might see them once in a week or a fortnight, but was in the habit of seeing or hearing Cooper all day long; he used to make my house almost his home.</p>

No; I have been in trouble before, and that is the very reason I gave Cooper the advice - I told him I thought the man was going to be robbed, and advised him to go home; I did not mention my suspicion to any body, nor call a patrol - there was none, and when he said he would go with them, I thought there would be a third person, who would be a protection; I was tried here two years ago.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you acquitted or found guilty? A. Acquitted.</p>

            , and Fare there - Matthews, the pot-boy, came in once or twice; when I went in they were sitting at the table, drinking - I staid there till ten minutes or a quarter after eleven o'clock; the mistress ordered us out - she told us to go out, it was time to shut the house up; I did not notice how the deceased walked when he came into the air -I saw him go over the bridge; Johnson and Fare helped him over the bridge - Matthews came out, and asked somebody to lead him home; Wagstaff's house is about one hundred yards from the public-house, on the right-hand side of the road - there is a path goes up to his house - the road is about ten yards from the house; Johnson, the deceased, and Fare went first, and I and Wagstaff behind them - I had no lantern with me; it was a kind of candlestick, with the bottom like a lamp - it would do for a candlestick or lamp; I had no light - I did not assist Johnson and Fare in taking him over the bridge; I was with Wagstaff, about four or five yards behind - when we came as far as Wagstaff's house he went in; before he went in he said to me at the corner of Horse-shoe-lane,"Jack, you had better go home" - I would not go home; I said, "I shan't go home;" I said so to Wagstaff - Wagstaff said, "You had better go home;" that was all he said - he only said, "It would be much better for you;" he did not say why I had better go home - the deceased was not sober; I know Sheffield's house - it is about seventeen or twenty yards from Wagstaff's house; it is a very little distance - they went on a little way from Wagstaff's house - that would lead them by Sheffield's; when they got to Sheffield's they were shoving one another about, and Fare fell down - Johnson, Fare, and the deceased were shoving one another about; I observed some scuffling; I was about four yards off at this time - I could not distinguish whether any thing was taken from the deceased - Fare fell on the ground; after that I did not observe what became of Fare - he got up, and went away somewhere; he did not stop any longer - the deceased was then with Johnson; after Fare went the deceased caught hold of my arm, and asked me to lead him home; Johnson had hold of the other side of him - we went on together, Johnson on one side, and I on the other; Mr. Addington's house is not two hundred yards from Sheffield's - it is on the other side of the way - I did not know that the deceased lived at Addington's; I never saw him before - when we got opposite Addington's, Johnson asked the deceased whether he would go and get a pint of beer; the deceased said"Yes, with all my heart;" Mr. Addington's house is on the chase-side road - Holt White's-lane comes into chaseside road; we passed Addington's house, and went along the chase-side road, leading to Holt White's-lane; when we got to the bottom of Holt White's-hill, two persons passed - I bade the gentleman good night, and they bade me good night; I turned along the chase road, towards the Holly-bush, which is about ten minutes' walk from Holt White's-lane; you would turn to the left when you get to the end of the lane, and to go to Addington's you would turn to the right - there are four roads at the corner of Holt White's-lane; I know Parsonage-lane - we did not meet the two persons; they passed us at the bottom of the lane, where the four roads go, and went along the chaseside road, towards the Holly-bush, and we turned up Holt White's-lane, to the left; Parsonage-lane is opposite Holt White's-lane - Pinnock's beer-shop is at the top of Holt White's-lane; we three went up Holt White's-lane, within nine or ten poles of Pinnock's beer-shop, but not farther; Johnson then turned himself round - the deceased was on the right-hand side of Johnson at this time; I was not aware that Johnson was going to turn round - I was on the side next the ditch when we had turned; when Johnson turned round the deceased said, "Where are you going?" and I said, "We are going home;" we had no beer - when we were going towards the beer-shop, we were going away from the deceased's home, and when we turned we were going towards it - I did not then know where he lived; I meant I was going home myself - after we turned round we came about nine or ten poles together down the road; I was on the footpath - there is no footpath on either side; I was near the ditch, Johnson on one side, and I on the other; when we got nine or ten poles on, Johnson said to me, "I will be d-d if Sam has not robbed him;" he said"I will be d-d if he has not robbed him."</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say both Sam and he just now? A. Yes; about half a minute after, as we were going down the road Johnson put his foot out behind the man, and threw him on to me, and I fell into the ditch; the man's head and shoulders fell on my head - Johnson fell too; I did not remain under the man above half a minute - I had a cap on when I fell, and when I drew my head from under the man - my cap came off; it was left behind; when I got my head out I felt for my cap, and got it - it was underneath the side of the deceased's face; it was wet when I got it out - blood was on it; when I observed the blood on my cap I said to Johnson, "What have you been doing? don't hurt him - don't do any thing to him; don't kill him!" Johnson was uppermost when we fell - I could not see any thing done by Johnson before I got my head from under the deceased; when I said to Johnson, "Don't hurt him, don't kill him," he said, "I have done him;" I then got out of the ditch, and went and stood in the middle of the road - when I got out of the ditch, Johnson had his knees on the top of the deceased's breast, and his hands on his head; Johnson got off the deceased, and came to me; the deceased did not struggle - I heard him make a noise once; he did not make a noise in his throat then - it was a groaning; Johnson came from him up to me, and said, "You take this knife, and go and finish him; I have began him;" I said, "No, I won't;" he had a knife in his hand - that was the first time I observed him with a knife; it was open - after I said, "I won't," Johnson went up to the deceased, and said to him, "What will you give?"</p>

               <p>Q. Had the deceased then done any thing? A. Yes, he held up his head, and said, "Oh, don't hurt me; Oh, don't," and Johnson said, "What will you give?" the deceased said, "Any thing;" I could then see that he was all over blood - I could see it on his face; when the deceased said, "Any thing," Johnson went and cut his throat; I heard him gurgle in his throat as I stood in the road - Johnson stood by the deceased about half a minute - he took a handkerchief out of the deceased's jacket.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030013"></xptr>Q. When Johnson said, "You go and finish him - I have began him," did he say any thing to you besides? A. Yes, he shook his fist, and said, "Don't you say a word - don't tell any body;" that was before he cut his throat - his fist was doubled when he said this, and he held it at me; only the deceased's head and shoulders were in the ditch - his feet laid towards the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you interfere to prevent this? A. I was afraid - I was afraid of my life; after Johnson got up from the deceased, we went down the road together, down Holt White's-lane - as we were going down the lane, Johnson kept saying, "Don't say any thing to nobody - don't know any thing about it, don't say a word;" when we got into chase-side road, there is a way across the fields which will lead to the back of the house opposite Addington's; when I came to the turning, I wanted to go down the road, and he said, "Come this way across the field, don't go along there," and I went across the field with him; it is called Corney's-fields - the way across the fields leads back again to Perry's house the back way; we must cross the New-river bridge before we get to Perry's house - it is a small bridge close to the one we went over before; they are both on the chase-side road of the house - we went over that bridge together; when we got over Johnson stooped down, and washed his hands in the river, and the knife - we then came over the same bridge as we crossed coming from Perry's - it is called the Horse-shoe bridge; we then went away to the left, that leads us in the direction to Giles' house (there is a lane from the Horse-shoe bridge); we turned to the left, and went along the river side - when we had got about forty yards along the river side, Johnson took a handkerchief from his pocket and threw it into the river; the stream runs towards Giles' house - this was about forty yards from Perry's; we did not go twenty yards on together after he threw the handkerchief into the river; there is an alley leading into the chase-side road below Perry's house, down the river side- when we got to that turning, I went up the alley home, and Johnson went over the iron bridge, towards his home; I turned to the right, and he to the left - his home is not far from Giles' house; it is in that direction - the iron bridge is opposite the alley; I was not taken in custody till ten o'clock next morning, Friday - it was Friday, I believe; it was the morning after this happened - I went home about twelve at night, and was taken at ten o'clock the next morning; I was taken on the road towards Potter's-bar - I was going with my master's dray; Mead and Watkins took me; my cap was examined - I was asked some questions about the cap, and gave some answers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you said true? A. Why I had been carrying some dog's meat the morning before - I do not know whether that made the blood, but I told them so; about an hour after I was taken I made a statement to Dr. Cresswell, at the George, at Enfield - I made the statement I have made here; I have been in custody since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. At what time did you go to the public house that night? A. Ten o'clock, and staid till after eleven; I had never seen the deceased before - he took out his purse once while I was there; it was a brownish colour - it had some slides on it, and appeared as if it had money in it by the look of it; I saw that - I am quite certain he did not take it out more than once while I was there; he did not unbutton his coat or show that he had a good many pockets while I was there; I never saw him do it - they had just done playing at dominoes when I went in; I staid in the room from that time till we all left together - he did not show me his pockets, nor did I say what a many pockets he had, nor did I hear any body else say it; when we left I was the first person that went out - I went on the bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the rest came out of the house? A. No, they were close behind me; my way home would be over the bridge - the others came out close to me, the deceased came out last; the deceased first took hold of my arm just before I got to Sheffield's, just after I had passed Wagstaff's - that was the first time I had any thing to do with the deceased, I am sure, either leading him or taking his arm; Matthews did not put him in my charge, he said,"Sam take care of him," and Sam went to lay hold of him - I never heard him say Jack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say, "Jack and Sam take care of him, for he has nearly fallen into the river?" A. I never heard him say that - he left him with Fare and Johnson; I had not hold of him at all, I am positive - I took the candlestick home with me, and took it to the brewhouse next morning; I always take it home at night, to bring a light in the morning to light the fires - it was not lighted; I cannot take it home lighted, as it has got no cover - I cover my apron over it in the morning; I have not five yards to go - I do not want the light at night; all Wagstaff said to me was, that I had better go home, it would be better for me - he did not tell me that the man was going to be robbed, or any thing of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. You say after you left Wagstaff's they pushed each other about, what do you mean by that? A. They pushed against one another as they walked along.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did? A. Fare, Johnson, and the deceased; it was in that pushing that Fare fell down - their pushing him about did not raise my suspicions that he would be robbed; I did not think any thing of the kind; when we got to Addington's, Johnson asked the deceased to go on and have a pint of beer - I dare say that was near upon half-past eleven o'clock; I went on with them, under the notion that they were going to have more beer - I knew the place would be shut up, but I thought they would call them up, or something - the beer-shop is kept by Pinnock; we turned back before we got there - the deceased said, "Are you going home?" I said Yes; I did not ask why they did not go on to the beer-shop - when they turned I turned; when we got back eight or nine poles, Johnson said, "Be d-d if Sam has not robbed him;" this was down Holt White's-lane - it was after we had turned round.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, as far as you could learn, Johnson appeared to be impressed with the idea that he had nothing to be robbed of? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you observed whether he had put his hands to his pocket or not? A. No; I cannot tell whether he had or not.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did I understand you to say Johnson kicked the deceased? A. He tripped him up - he made a blow at him with his foot; his foot struck him on his feet next the ground - Johnson had hold of him at the time; the tripping threw him against me, and I fell into the ditch, which is not above a foot deep - his head im<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030014"></xptr>mediately came on mine, and prevented my seeing any thing till I got it off; when I drew my head from under him Johnson was on the top of the deceased - it was a star-light night, and it froze quite sharp; there are no lamps in the lane - when I took hold of my cap my fingers were bloody; I could see that by the light of the night; it was quite light.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you afraid of your life when, after getting into the road, you went with Johnson across the field by a path? A. No, I did not think any thing about it then, not when he was talking to me, my fright had gone off; we went about twenty yards along the road before we struck into the path; it is a public road; I never saw a patrol there; I did not pass any house on the road, nor meet any body - I got home about twelve o'clock, or it might be later; I went to work at five next morning, as usual - my master came and called me up; I was taken into custody at ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You was dreadfully shocked, of course, at what you had seen? A. Yes I was; I had no rest - I did not mention a word about it to my master, nor to any body, till I was taken; I had the cap on my head when I was taken, with the blood marks on it - I was asked how they came there; I said I had been burying some dog's meat for master, and the blood dropped off that on the cap - the deceased appeared to be very much in liquor, quite incapable of offering resistance - one person might easily overcome him.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, when you got to the corner, after you passed the two strangers, did not Johnson separate from you and go home? A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where did Johnson live? A. His father lived in Stafford's-row, and I believe he lodged with him - that is near Giles'.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How was you dressed that night? A. The same as now, except this ffannel jacket - I had this fustian jacket on; Johnson had on a black coat and trousers.</p>

            . I am a shopkeeper at Enfield-chaseside. On the 19th of December I was passing along the road, from eleven to half-past eleven o'clock at night, and when I got to the bottom of Holt White's-hill, I saw two men standing across the road - I only saw two; I passed them, and said nothing - they said nothing to me at all; I was going towards the Holly-bush - there was a young man with me; they were standing at the corner of the lane - the one I passed had on a kind of jean coloured dress, but I did not take particular notice, for I was rather alarmed, seeing them standing in the road, and not talking together; I was glad to push on home as fast as I could - they were standing close together, side by side, right across the road; they never moved all the time they were in sight - neither of them said a word; it was a young lad, about fifteen or sixteen years old, named Frencham, that was with me - I was walking home, and asked his father to allow him to walk with me, not liking to go alone; the men stood across the road at the bottom of the Holt White's-hill, at the four road ways.</p>

On Thursday morning, the 20th of December, at half-past five o'clock, I went up Holt White's-lane, towards Parsonage-lane, to my work; I passed by Pinnock's beer-shop, along Holt White's-lane, and I got about half way down the lane, about three hundred yards from Pinnock's; there is a ditch on the left hand side of the road, and in that ditch I saw the body of a man laying on his face - his face was in the ditch, and his feet in the road; I kicked it, thinking it might be a man in liquor - I called to him several times, and got no answer: I pulled him, but could find no life in him, and judged that he was dead - I went back towards home, and met

             with a load of straw; I turned back with him to the spot - he stopped his cart, and we tried to move the man, but found he was dead; I went to Parsonage-lane, to Radley's house, got a light, went to the spot, and found by him two halfpence, a small knife, and a pair of gloves - the gloves were in the ditch; I found some shot about - these things were all close to the body; Radley and Whitehead fetched a board, while I and a man named Chapman stood by the body - it was put on the board; there were several wounds on his face - I assisted in taking him to the Serjeant public-house, Parsonage-lane; I saw some wounds on the throat: his left-hand side trousers pocket was turned inside out - the same gloves were put into his cap, and they were brought down to the Serjeant; (Mead here produced a pair of gloves) these are them; there was an appearance on the ground, as if there had been a scuffling, and there was a great deal of blood - I found the body about one hundred yards from Holt White's-gate; the gate is nearer to Pinnock's than where the body was - there are two gates between Pinnock's and the chase-side road, both on the left hand as you go up, and on the opposite side to where I saw the body.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were coming down Holt White's-lane, from Pinnock's, towards the four lane ends, should you come to the gates or the body first? A. The body; it was nearer to Pinnock's than the gates - I found the body about one hundred yards from the first gate, as near as I can judge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you come out? A. Half-past five o'clock; it was dark - I was about the middle of the road; I could not see the deceased's face where I was walking, nor any blood before I got a light - his face was towards the ground; I could not have seen his face by the light in the road.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Serjeant, Parsonage-lane. On Thursday morning, the 20th of December, at twenty minutes after six o'clock, I was called up by Radley and Whitehead - I gave them a shutter, and followed them to Holt White's-lane; the gate is on the left-hand side, going up the lane - there are two gates; I passed both those gates, and went to the spot where there was a dead body - the nearest gate is sixty or seventy yards from the body, on the other side of the way - when I got to the spot I saw the body: several persons were there; I picked up two halfpence, a cap, and two gloves; those produced are them - (Mead here produced the cap) this is the cap I picked up; I assisted in placing the body on the shutter - it was carried to the Serjeant; I observed a great deal of blood on the ground; the body was about one hundred yards from Pinnock's beer-shop - Holt White's-gate is about seventy yards further off from Pinnock's; I only guess the distance - the cap, with the halfpence in it, was placed on the board, and taken to my house, and taken from there by Mead - there was blood on both the gloves; I sent for Mr. Astbury, the surgeon, and Mead, the beadle - I went with Watkins and Mead, to show them where the body was found, and then they went on further, and about seventy yards before I came to where the body was found, I found a silk handkerchief, which I gave to Addington.</p>

            . I am one of the horse-patrol of Bow-street, stationed at Enfield. On Thursday, the 20th of December, at twenty minutes to seven o'clock, in consequence of an alarm, I went to the Serjeant public-house, Parsonage-lane, and saw a dead body; I went to Holt White's-lane, and observed some blood on the side of the road, and in the ditch on the right-hand side of the lane - the ground appeared to be disturbed about that spot: in consequence of further information I went with Mead to Johnson's father's house, and took him into custody; I asked where he was last night, and at what time he came home - he said, "I don't recollect what time it was;" I told him there was a murder committed last night, and I apprehended him on suspicion of being one implicated in it; he said, "That I know nothing of;" I took him to the watch-house, searched his person, and found on him a small iron box, containing fifteen duplicates and a shilling, nothing else - I locked him up; I afterwards accompanied Mead towards Potter's-bar, and apprehended Cooper - I took off his cap, and observed blood both inside and outside it, and the blood inside was wet; a conversation took place about it, and he gave an account about some dog's-meat; after he was taken a message came from him, from the George - I took him before Dr. Cresswell, where he made a statement; I observed Cooper's clothes - there was dirt on the back part of his trousers, and on several parts of his waistcoat; it was a sleeve waistcoat, and there was some on the elbows - he has the waistcoat on now; on the following Saturday I took Johnson to the New-prison - he then wore the same clothes as he wore when he was taken into custody; as I took him along, I saw several spots of blood on his trousers - I borrowed a pair of trousers at a public-house, and when I arrived at the New-prison, I took Johnson's trousers off, and gave him another pair for them; I have had his trousers in my custody ever since(producing them); he had a drab great coat and a black one under it when he was taken; here are some of the marks<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030016"></xptr>on the trousers now, but the blood is very faded - here is one spot; the marks are the same as when I took them off - the blood is in front, below the knee; it was three days after the murder that I noticed it - I see very little difference in it now; I examined the bottom of the trousers, and found there was a square piece torn out of them - I showed the trousers to Dr. Astbury, at the Coroner's Inquest, on the following Wednesday; here is a piece torn off the bottom - I observed that as soon as I took them from the prisoner; I searched his coat pocket on the same Saturday, at the same time - I found a glove in his coat pocket; I did not take particular notice of it till I got home - I then looked at it, and found marks on it, which I believe to be blood; there was very little blood on it - it is between the thumb and the fore finger; I showed that to Dr. Astbury at the Inquest - I received a piece of cloth from Mr. Perry, the same Wednesday, at the Inquest; I compared that with the bottom of the trousers, where a piece is wanting, and it fitted - I observed a dull spot of blood or two on that cloth; it was dirty, and had been trod on, and torn off as it appeared; I returned the cloth to Perry again.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found an iron box, with duplicates on Johnson? A. Yes, and returned them to him - they were all his own, I believe; I cannot tell what amount they were pawned for - I first went to the spot a few minutes after seven o'clock; the body had then been removed to the Serjeant - it appeared to me that there had been considerable struggling on the part of the person; there was trampling of feet there - the ground was a great deal disturbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it present an appearance of a person having fallen into the ditch, or of a person struggling? A. I cannot tell - there had been many persons there before me.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live at Enfield. I have seen these trousers and this piece of cloth before, and have matched the cloth with the rent at the bottom - I believe this piece of cloth formerly formed a part of the trousers: I have no doubt of it whatever.</p>
               <p>MR. ADDINGTON. I know this cap well - it is the cap the deceased wore on the night of the 19th of December, when he left my house - he had rough sailor's trousers on outside, what are called pea trousers, and he had black trousers on under them; I myself picked up that piece of cloth on the spot on the morning, before the witness found it, and threw it down again, not thinking it of any consequence - neither of the pairs of trousers which the deceased wore were at all like that cloth, and his trousers were not torn at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time did you find the cloth? A. About twenty minutes past seven o'clock - it was on the spot where the deceased was found; it laid in the path, not a quarter of a yard from the ditch - I handed it to Cuffley, who said it was of no use, and threw it down; he and I both had it in our hands at once, looking at it, and threw it down together; and as we came away we met Budd very near the bottom, going towards the place.</p>

            . I have come here casually, not as a witness - I have examined the cloth; I am a Blackwellhall-factor, and have had an opportunity of examining cloth for twenty years; I should say the trousers and cloth were of the same fabric, decidedly - I have not examined to see if the piece fits the place - I should say the colour is the same, and the quality is the same; that is, that it is black milled kerseymere, and they appear to have sustained the same degree of wear.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Are you a manufacturer of cloth? A. No; I receive cloths from the manufacturer, and sell them - I heard his Lordship express some doubt as to the identity of the pieces; I did not volunteer my evidence, but was asked by Mr. Alderman Venables to give an opinion as to the texture of the cloth; there are a great many black kerseymeres manufactured - in my opinion the piece is the same as the trousers.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Is there any thing about the stitching or sewing of these trousers which enables you to speak to the cloth being the same? A. Yes, they are turned up at the bottom, and sewn to secure it; the sewing at the bottom of the piece corresponds with the sewing at the bottom of the trousers - I should say decidedly they have both been done by the same hand.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. On the piece of cloth has not every stitch been separated - is there one stitch which holds both ends together? A. No; here is the sewing on the piece, it is where the hem has been sewn, but has now become separate - it is the turn up at the bottom; I should think this sewing and that on the trousers have been done by the same person, but the trousers are worn in that state I cannot tell - the legs of the trousers should be of an equal length.</p>
               <p>Q. One of these legs are considerably longer than the other? A. There is a piece gone off all round the bottom - (here the witness pinned the piece of cloth to the trousers.)</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that at least half an inch longer than the other side? A. I should think it is not one-eight part of an inch different - you cannot account for half an inch, because in these sort of trousers sometimes one leg gets stretched down longer than the other, being trod upon, and different things - they are sewn with silk, and so is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030017"></xptr>the piece; trousers of this kind are usually sewn with silk.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the silk of the same texture and fabric? A. Yes, and both are worn the same.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Enfield. On the 20th of December I was called in to see the body of the deceased; there was a wound on the right side of the cheek - there was a wound sufficient to cause his death on the right side of his neck; it was produced by a stab from a sharp instrument, which, in passing into the neck, transfixed the common carotid artery, which would produce death instantly; the beadle showed a pair of trousers at the Inquest - there appeared to me to be two distinct spots of blood on them; I have not a doubt that it was blood - they also produced a glove to me, with a mark of blood on the fore finger; I saw the piece of cloth - it is marked with blood and dirt.</p>

Gentlemen, - I most solemnly declare myself innocent of the crime laid to me, or of any participation in it, I am perfectly aware that asseverations of innocence, unaccompanied by proofs, are disregarded in a Court of Justice-like this, but while I bow to the voice of the laws of my country, I cannot but deeply feel that I have, by the most unmerited and cruel aspersions, been deprived of the first and noblest right of an Englishman, which entitles him to be presumed innocent until he be proved otherwise: that in saying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183301030018"></xptr>this I do not submit more than is true, is proved by my having been, from the first moment that suspicion attached to me, held up to the country as a declared murderer, and one whose atrocities should long since have brought him to this bar; what is the consequence to me at this dreadful moment? this - that fear has possessed my friends, and that I am in danger of falling a sacrifice to the prejudice which ascribes their standing aloof, as a sign that I am an abandoned and worthless man. I shall not, Gentlemen, trouble you with comments upon the calumnies cast upon me, but just observe that they have been the cause, and the only cause, that I have not, in this, my hour of trial, the attendance of some most worthy gentlemen to speak to my character, and assure me, to your satisfaction, to be a person wholly incapable of committing the horrible crime for which I am indicted. Bred up to be a gardener by my respected, and I fear now heart-broken father, I have ever been able to earn sufficient funds for my support, without having resort to indirect means to obtain them; is it fair then to suppose that I should follow the trade of the midnight assassin. That I had funds at my command is proved by the very duplicates, taken for a time, by Watkins, the patrol, when he searched me, and I had then other and valuable articles upon which I could have raised a considerable sum had I wanted it: why then am I charged with having murdered Mr. Danby, to obtain what was already at my command? and as he had never offended me, what other motive can be assigned that would have caused me to attempt his life? - none could exist - none did exist. Gentlemen, I leave my case in your hands, and I implore you (not more for my own sake than for the sake of my afflicted wife) dispassionately to weigh the whole of the circumstances adduced in evidence, and I pray that the Almighty, dismissing all prejudice from your minds, will enable you to discover that though I may have been unfortunate, that I am not guilty.</p>

             re-examined. When the hunt was over, the huntsmen gave us some money, and we went to a public-house and had some beer on the chase - we continued together about half an hour; Johnson had black trousers and a black coat on - he was on foot.</p>
               <p>Johnson. Watkins asked where I was that night, and I said at the Horse-shoe.</p>

            . I asked him at what time he came home the night before; he said he did not know what time it was - I asked where he had been that night, and he gave me no answer; I am sure he did not say he had been at the Horse-shoe.</p>

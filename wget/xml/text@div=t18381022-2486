On the 27th of September my attention was attracted by a noise in my parlour—I went down, but there was no one there—I went into the yard and saw the prisoner, who was our servant, standing there—I asked him if any one had passed through—he said, "No"—I asked him if any one could pass without his seeing or hearing them—he said no, they could not—he had been up-stairs about ten minutes before, and left me to go and give the dog some clean straw—I went to the cash-box in the parlour and found it open—it had been locked before—I went into the shop to get the keys out of the desk, and found the bunch of keys taken out of the desk—the key of the cash-box was on that bunch—I took the box up-stairs, and</p>

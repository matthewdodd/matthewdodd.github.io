                  </hi>. I live in Mulgrave-place, Woolwich. I have known the prisoner for about the last four or five months—I live in the room over her—she has two sons, and had a little boy named Lonergan in her care—on Wednesday, the 16th of Oct., I remember that little boy coming down to me—he then appeared well in health—he asked me for a light and a drink of water—I opened the door to let him out of my washhouse—he appeared in good health.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did the child die? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot exactly say—I never saw it dead—the last time I saw him was on Thursday, the 17th, about five o'clock—Mrs. Mead brought him up in her arms, and I was frightened at its appearance—I did not observe that it had any eruption—I turned my head away and did not see its face—the prisoner had always been very kind to the child, and kept it very com<lb></lb>fortable—she was very attentive to her own children, and to that too for the last four weeks—she treated it with equal kindness as her own children.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant R</hi> 8.) I took the prisoner into cus<lb></lb>tody on the 19th of Oct.—I first spoke to her son, who is eight or nine years old, in her presence, and said, "Show me where your mother hit little Jemmy's head"—the child went to the door with me to show me where the child was struck—the prisoner, in two or three minutes, said, "Here is where it was"—she took me into the room and said, "The child fell off this box," which was a box about eighteen inches high.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it possible to have fallen from that box and struck its head against the corner of the box? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the child pointed out the door as the place against which its head was struck—the door is not a foot from the box—the prisoner said it had fallen off the box, and struck its head against the corner—that might have been so if there was only one injury on the head, but there were three—after taking her to the station-house some friends came to see her, and as she returned to the cell she sighed and said, "Oh, poor little fellow! he hit his head against the iron pot."</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CURWOOD</hi> here stated that he had no evidence to contradict the prisoner's statement, and declined calling further witnesses.)</p>

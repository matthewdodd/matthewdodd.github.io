               <p>On the 2d of August, I was at <placeName id="t17810912-71-crimeloc357">the Angel, a public-house, at the foot of Old Gravel-lane</placeName>

The prisoner was there. I asked him to drink with me. He came and sat down with me, and I called for a pint of beer. I had often seen him in that house. We sat together about three quarters of an hour. I called the mistress of the house, and gave her a shilling to change; and took my watch out, and laid it down on the table. I looked over my right shoulder at the dial, and felt the watch go from under my left hand. I saw the prisoner take it up, and go out of the door with it. It being dark, we could not apprehend him: there were only women in the house, except another man, as infirm as myself. Three weeks after, he was taken, and I saw him before Justice Sherwood. I never recovered my watch. He said, before the justice, that he had it in his hand, and laid it down again. I saw the watch as he was going out at the door: the key was sticking out between his finger and thumb.</p>

               <p>I went out for snuff for him. The watch lay on the table. When I came back again, there was a sailor and he together: he was in liquor, half asleep and half awake. I shook hands with him, and wished him good night. I never heard it was lost till the next morning. I went to the prosecutor's house, to see about it. He was out: he had been out with his Moll all night.</p>
               <p>Was you in liquor? - No. I paid two guineas and a half for the watch about a fortnight before.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH O'BRIEN. I am daughter of John O'Brien. On the 20th of October, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was sitting in our parlour with another man - we <rs id="t18240407-152-viclabel849" type="occupation">keep a public-house</rs>

The prisoner came to the bar, and took part of it off the counter - my brother followed him with the rest; he said if my brother came into the parlour he would give him the silver; he asked him several times for it - he said he would give it to him directly, he was not going to run away; but he went out without giving us the 3 s. They had three pots of half-and-half.</p>
               <p>JOHN O'BRIEN. I am fifteen years old. The prisoner and another man came into the parlour, and told me to bring 3 s. worth of copper for silver; he took half of it into the parlour, put some into his pocket, and some in his apron; he said there was but 2 s. 6 d. - I said he had put 6 d. into his pocket. He said,</p>
               <p>"Oh! Yes," and then said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070061"></xptr>to the other man,</p>
               <p>"Is not he a cunning little fellow." He sent me for 1 d. loaf, and told the other man to wait till he returned - he went out, and in five minutes the other man went out; my sister tried to stop him, but he knocked her down.</p>

               <p>Q.When was it you found this horse at Oxford? - A. About a week after, and that I brought home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner at the bar before that time? - A.Not till he came to hire the horses, the night before they took the horses out of the yard.</p>

             Sworn. - I live at Oxford; I keep the Roebuck: The prisoner at the bar, and Glover, came to my house in the evening of the 15th of September. I have known the prisoner five or six years, he was a gentleman's servant, and lived along with one Miss Finch, in Oxford, just opposite me. I did not see them the night they came in; the next day was market day, and they dined at my house, at the ordinary. After dinner, they shewed the horses out to sale; shewed one to Mr. Crook, a fellmonger; they did not agree for price; and Mr. Bulley, at the Angel, had wanted to buy a horse, and I bought the horse for him; I gave eight guineas for it; I paid the money upon the table, and Glover took it up; but the prisoner told me that that was his brother, that his name was Cooper, or else I should not have bought the horse. He told me, that his brother had taken the Turf Tavern, at Shrewsbury, and he was going down to help him; and he said, that his brother must go off that night by the mail-coach, or else he would not have sold the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the prisoner stay at your house? - A. He did not lie at my house. Glover went away that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the horse since Crouch had it back again? - A. No. The prisoner bore a very good character at Oxford for five or six years.</p>

The next day, a young woman was in company with us for some time, who lived a fellow-servant with me. we were going to see the Colleges, and he said, he would wish to pass as my brother, to save expences in seeing the Colleges.

Before I returned, I was asked if the horse was mine; I said, no, in the presence of Mr. Probert, that I had nothing to do with it; and Mr. Probert said, he would have it at eight guineas. The following day, Glover offered this horse to Thomas, and changed with him. Glover went away that night without paying the bill. I was going down to Shrewsbury, and was so reduced, that I went to Shropshire upon five shillings.</p>

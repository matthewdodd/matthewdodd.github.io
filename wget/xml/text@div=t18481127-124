                  </hi>, Knt. I reside in the Royal Crescent, Bath. I was formerly a merchant at Bristol—I know the prisoner—I first became ac<lb></lb>quainted with her in the early part of 1846—she was then Miss Todhunter—she resided with her mother, who is married to Count Gabrouski, a Pole—I saw them at the house of mutual friends once or twice—I was in Paris in Jan., 1847, saw them there, and renewed my acquaintance with them—I left Paris on 6th Jan (<hi rend="italic">reffering to his diary</hi>)—the prisoner and her mother came to the same hotel I was staying at—I gave my rooms up to them, and they staid there a short time—I went back to Paris on 30th March—I found them packing up, just on the point of leaving—the) left the day afterwards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184811270077"></xptr>
               <p>—I left Paris soon after—I merely went to Paris to pay my accounts—I made a stay of some days at Boulogne, and then came to London—I received a note from them in London, requesting me to call on them; and I did so, at their lodgings in St. John's Wood—I found them there, and the prisoner's present husband, the Baron St. Mart, also—I learnt from them that she was about to be married to him—they stated that they were to be mar<lb></lb>ried in two or three days, and they invited me to dine with them; which I did—they stated that they expected papers from France, and the marriage was to be deferred till they arrived, which would be in about ten days—they invited me to dine with them three or four times, and to go to a party with them, and as they said they had nothing to do—I invited them in return to spend a few days with me at my house at Bath—they accepted the invita<lb></lb>tion, and arrived there on Saturday, 24th April, the Countess Gabrouski, Miss Todhunter, and the Baron St. Mart—they remained till the following Thursday, 30th April—on Monday, 26th, I dined at home with these three persons—there was no one else there that day—after dinner I had occasion to write one or two short letters, which I did at my portable desk, with the intention of posting them on the way to an evening party to which we were invited—they were all sitting close to me in the dining-room—I took this casket, containing a diamond ring, out of the desk—it was one of these two caskets (<hi rend="italic">producing two</hi>)—they were both lying on the top of the desk, in the open part—I opened the one containing the diamond ring, and placed it on my finger—is was a large diamond, with small diamonds round it, what is called a cluster-ring, I wore it when I went to any respectable party—Miss Todhunter (that was the young lady's name at the time) requested me to let her look at it, and I took it off, handed it to her, and she placed it on her finger—she then said, "What have you in the other casket?"—I took it up—it contained an emerald ring—it was an emerald in the centre, surrounded by small diamonds—it was so remarkably small, that I could not get it over the small joint of my little finger—I handed it to her—she held it in her hand, and remarked what a very small finger Lady Hare must have had—I had mentioned that these were my wife's rings—I am a widower—one ring was on her finger, and one in her hand, and she said, "I will keep these things"—I then requested her to return them, saying that I set a very high value on them—she said, "No, I will keep them"—I said, "You must not keep them, for they were my wife's rings, and you must give them up," and I used every effort I possibly could to obtain them from her—I requested her to give them to me repeatedly, and she repeatedly refused, and said she would keep them—she did not assign any reason whatever—I was anxious to save the post, and took the letters to the Post-office, and after that went to the party—the Baron went with me—I returned from the party between eleven and twelve, I should think—I do not think I saw the prisoner that night—I think they were gone to bed; I am not certain about that—I did not during their stay, till the Thursday, renew my application about the rings: it never occurred to me—I was exceedingly busy on the Tuesday in going to market, and providing things that were required—I had a large dinner-party that day—on the Wednesday Mr. and Mrs. Pennington came down, and of course I did all I could to make them welcome, and got another dinner for them, and we went to the assembly in the evening—on the Thursday the whole party left—I was too much engaged from the Monday to the Thursday to speak about the rings—I was going to market, and providing different things to make them comfortable, and never thought of the rings till they had left the house—I was invited to the wedding, which was to take place on the Saturday—I</p>

               <p>left Bath on the Friday (30th April) for that purpose—I called on them at their house, in Thayer-street, on my arrival in London, about four—they were at dnner—I was invited to partake of it, and sat down—during the dinner some one came in, and the prisoner was called away to go up stairs, and as she was going from the room, I got up from the table and said, "Bring me down my rings"—I said that in a low tone of voice—she made no answer, but went up stairs, for about five minutes—when she came down, she came up to me and said, "What did you say when I left the room?"—I said, "Bring down my rings," repeating the same words,—she then said, "I have not got your ring's"—I then appealed to the Countess, and I said her daughter had my rings, and I had requested her to bring them down—a scuffle, at least high words, ensued, and I left the house—I went next morn<lb></lb>ing to a relation of mine, Mr. Charles Fleay. and he accompanied me back to the house—J went in with him, introduced him, and then I went outside—I went to him the same night, but did not see him—I am not certain whether I went back to the house that night—he accompanied me on the Saturday morning—that was the morning of the prisoner's marriage—I remained in the street after introducing him—he came out and joined me after some time, and made a communication to me—I called at the house myself, between eight and nine in the evening, accompanied by Sir Alexander Downey and Mr. Mackinnon, of the Lie of Skye—I think I saw the Countess, the Baroness, and the Baron—I demanded the rings again, and said I had brought friends with me to demand them—they said they had not got my rings—I believe the Countess spoke, but I am not certain—they all denied having them, in fact—I saw the prisoner while I was there, but whether she was in the room when I first went in, I am not quite certain—the Baron came towards me to force me out of the room, when my friends interfered—I did not get the rings—I then went to the police-office, in Marylebone-lane, but there was no Magistrate there—I called at the house on the Monday, and learnt that they had left England on the Sunday—they were partially married on the Saturday, and the marriage was completed in the Catholic Chapel on the Sunday—I am not quite certain how long I remained in England, but I was in Boulogne on 26th July following, and saw the prisoner there with her husband—whilst there a communication was made to me by the Prefect of the Department on this subject—I had frequently before that been speaking of the loss of my rings—I remained some time at Boulogne, going backwards and forwards to Paris occasionally—I did not hear a word of my rings till I received this letter from Police-Sergeant Hockaday, on 6th Nov. in the present year—I was then in Bath—I had never heard of such a person as Hockaday before I received the letter—I sent a description in answer to that communication, and followed it up by immediately coming to London—I arrived there the same day I received the letter, the 6th—I went to the station-houe, from where the letter was directed, saw Hockaday, and put into his hands a description of the rings—in consequence of what Hockaday told me, I took steps to have the prisoner taken into custody—I was with the officer when she was arrested—on being told what she wns taken for, the Countess (her mother) said, "That man (meaning me) is mad, and that is his keeper"—the officer was in plain clothes—the prisoner implored me very much to let her go—she en<lb></lb>treated, and said, "Oh, Sir John, pray let me off! pray let me off! pray for<lb></lb>give rre '" and supplications—a gentleman came up and was interfering, when I said, "If you interfere with justice, I shall give you in charge"—the prisoner was Ukjn to the station, and alter three examinations was com<lb></lb>mited for trial—I should say—40/. is the very smallest value of the rings—I</p>

               <p>had never had any conversation with the prisoner about those rings, or any others, till the afternoon when I produced them from the casket.</p>

Fitch that intro<lb></lb>duced me to the Countess—I do not think that I saw them again after the <hi rend="italic">pic nic</hi> until I met them abroad—most likely I called on her after I was introduced—I do not recollect that I did, but I should as a matter of course—in 1846, I met them in Bolongue, where I was staying at the time—I went there in Dec., 1845—there were a good many other persons there at the time—I was there for the same reason as many others: little railway mishaps—I was there, and at Paris for nearly two years, frequently coming to England, I came openly—I never had the least hesitation in coming to England—I saw the Countess and her daughter at Boulonge, and renewed the intimacy there—I saw very little of them there—I went to Paris, and met them there at the boarding-house—that was in Dec. 1846—they gave me their address; I did not ask for it, they volunteered it, and I called on them next day—I dined at the same boarding-house frequently—five times at least—I think not more—I swear I did not dine there twenty times, or a dozen—I think five or six times was the most—it was a public table, where ladies and gentlemen dined—it was not the boarding-house I was stopping at—I was at the Hotel Maurice—there is a <hi rend="italic">table d'hote</hi> there, but it is the fashion in Paris not to dine at your own hotel—gentlemen frequently go about to boarding-houses to dine—when I rode out in my carriage they asked me to allow them to make a call or two, and 1 took them out once or twice while I was at the boarding-house—I lent them my carriage once or twice—I did not imagine that a par<lb></lb>ticular sort of wine would be good for the young lady's complaint—I was recommended to take a particular wine—it was so good that most likely I recommended it to all my friends—I think it is most likely I sent the prisoner some of it—I could not sit at a table, and not ask a lady to take wine—I did not get some wine from my wine-mercbant, and send it to her—she requested to know where I got the wine, and the lady who got it for me procured some for the prisoner likewise, and she paid for it—it did not occur to me that the apartments were too close, and not good for the young lady's health—the Countess said she was almost dead from suffocation—she was sleeping in a back room, and begged I would ask Mr. Saunders whether there was room in the hotel I was stopping at—I applied to Mr. Saunders—he could not accommodate them exactly as they wished, and as my month was up in two or three days, I gave my apartments up to them, and I went and lived in the upper part of the house, not in the attic—it was a very large house—I left Paris on 6th Jan., and returned about two months afterwards—I called on them—they were then packing up to leave, and having a dispute witb the landlord—they were going the next day provided the landlord would allow, them—they did leave the next day—I did not express any regret whatever at their being about to leave Paris so immediately; I swear that—not even as a matter of common-place civility—I do not think I was even so polite as that—I was told at the same time that the lady was going to be married—they left next day for Bolongue I suppose—I saw one of them on</p>

               <p>board the ship next day at Bolongue—I am not certain whether I saw both or not—I cannot say: it was a matter of so little importance—they left Paris the day after I arrived—I see by my diary that was 30th March, and they left on the morning of 31st—I left aain the next day, or the same night, I am not quite certain which—it is vury likely I travelled through the night, I cannot recollect, I was so frequently going backwards and forwards between Paris and Bolongue—it was my custom to see every steamer off—it is the fashion at Bolongue—I am in the habit of following the fashion—I went on that occasion, and saw one of the ladies on board—they did not express surprise at seeing me, after leaving me at Paris the night before—they could not—I was on shore, and they on board—I do not know that they said they were surprised, and I said I came to say-good by to them—I know a gentleman named Owen; I do not remember calling on him that morning—I do not recollect that I told him I had just been to see two ladies off by the steamer—Owen never said, "What! is that the young lady you have been so sweet upon?"—he never said anything of the sort; I swear that—I left Bolongue on Saturday, 10th April, for Folkestone—my visit to Paris was very short—I went because my coachman had requested I would come to pay for the keep of the horses—I had sent him money previously, and he made use of it for his own purposes, considering it as wages, and I thought next time I would go to pay my bills myself—there was the coachmaker to pay, and the coach<lb></lb>man's lodging, the keep of the horses, and various little things—I think the coachmaker's bill was about 1, 600 francs—I did not think it safe to intrust the payment of that to an agent—when I was at Paris the Countess gave a ball at our house—I sent in part of the refreshments—I asked my friends, and she asked hers—it was on 3rd Jan.—I did not pay half the expenses—I dare say I paid as little as I could: I paid some of it—I sent in a dozen of wine now and then—the very same sort of wine that I was in the habit of drinking, and I sent in a few things from the confectioner's besides; tarts, or something of that sort—I came to London on 10th April—I went to Bath on 13th, and came back to London on 15th to go to Court, to the Drawing-room—I called on the ladies on 18th, at St. John's Wood—they afterwards removed to Thayer-street—I dined with them on 21st, and met Mr. and Mrs. Penning<lb></lb>ton there, who invited me to their ball on the following day—I went—it is very likely I may have danced a quadrille—I am frequently in the habit of dancing—I am about sixty years of age—it is not sixty-five—I believe between sixty-one and sixty-two—it is not sixty-four—I swear I am not. sixty-four—I will say I am sixty-four for the sake of saying something—the Countess said that Mr. Pennington had business to do at Bath, to sign some. papers which were to be sent off, and I then invited them down to my house—the Countess, her daughter, and the Baron St. Mart came down on Saturday, 24th—I cannot tell what time they arrived—they slept there that night—the next morning the party, most likely, assembled at breakfast—the young lady was generally late—it is always my custom at my house to wait till all the party are assembled—I did not distinguish the place which the young lady was to occupy at the table in any particular mode—I cannot say that I never make a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of poetry, or sometimes give a young ladyaboquet—I do not recollect placing a copy of verses in the prisoner's plate—I may have placed a boquet there; I do not remember it—I am not particularly in the habit of paying attention to young ladio—I hope to be always civil to all ladies—if a young lady stopped at my house* I may have put vi-rses into her plate two or three times—I do not recollect anything about it—I think it is most likely I put (lowers into her</p>

               <p>pay for it if it came after he left—it is very likely that I told the Baron that the jeweller had charged 6. for doing something to his ring, and that I took the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of him—I do not recollect it, but I may have done so—I think it is very likely the servant might have come in and said, "Here is a ring," or "some trinket," and charged 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I might have taken the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that did not bring my rings to my mind—I came up to their house on the Friday, and got there at their-dinner hour—I sat down at the table—there was something set before me, but I do not think I ate it—I was waiting for an opportunity to speak to the prisoner—some one came in, and she was called to go up stairs—there was not a word said about the rings before that—it is very possible there was a conversation at the dinner-table about the marriage license, I do not recollect it—I do not recollect the Countess saying, "I hope your license is all right with regard to the spelling of the names; there was a mistake of about mine, and we had to wait at the Church while it was sent to Doctors' Commons to be altered"—I do not recollect one syllable about it—I was thinking of my rings at the time, waiting for an opportunity to ask her in the most delicate way for them—I did not follow her out of the room into the passage—I got up from the table, went to the door, and said, "Bring down my rings"—she might have been just in the passage at the time, but the door was open—I swear I did not follow her into the passage, and shut the door behind her—she went up stairs, and when she came down she said, "What did you say to me?"—I said, "Bring down my rings"—she did not ask whether I wanted to see her wedding-ring—after I made this remark, she called to her mother, and told her I was saying something she did not comprehend the meaning of—I appealed to the mother, and, as I said before, there were high words, and I left the room—I do not know that she called to her mother, and said, "Mamma, Sir John Hare is saying something to me about his rings which I do not understand"—the mother did not come out into the passage—we were at the table—I did not say, "You had better not speak so loud, or the Baron will hear"—I did not hear the mother say, "I do not care whether the Baron hears, or all the world; you shall not make such a charge against my daughter"—I believe she said I was mad—at that I left—I think I then called on some friends, to relate it to them—I cannot recollect what friends they were—I was back<lb></lb>wards and forwards at the house all the evening—I expected that they were going off, and I took care to watch that they did not go—I was there, back<lb></lb>wards and forwards, several times in the evening—I did not keep the house in sight the whole evening—I might have stopped there two or three hours—I went out of the house about five o'clock—it is very likely I staid till seven: I think I did—Mr. Pennington came out to see me—I sent a message, requesting he should come to meet me at my solicitor's—I think I delivered the message myself at the door—I walked about with Mr. Pennington—he accompanied me to look for a friend—I was somewhere about the street, in the neighbourhood, till he came, going frequently to see who went in and came out of the house—I siw the Countess and the Baron come out and go into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I followed the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> a considerable distance, to see where they were going—I saw them go towards the Circus and Oxford-street, and then lost sight of them—they drove faster than I could walk—I had not an opportunity of taking the number of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, I was not near enough—I do not recollect that I saw them come back—it is possible I may have gone back again to the house—I was exceedingly anxious—I believe I did go back, I will not swear it—Mr. Pennington came to me about ten the same evening—I did not stop</p>

In Feb. 1846, I heard of a situation through a person named Warren, in consequence of which I called at the house of the Countess Gabrowski, 11, Bentinck-terrace, Regent's-park, and was there engaged as housemaid—I stayed in the service till 30th Nov.—at that time the Countess disposed of her house to a lady and gentleman named Swan, and I continued in the same house in the service of Mr. Swan—while I resided with the Countess I became acquainted with Miss Todhunter—she remained Miss Todhunter till the Countess left that house—I stayed with Mr. Swan six months, and left on 30th Nov., 1847—during the time I was there, Miss Todhunter called once while she was single, with the Baron, to show him the family pictures, and she called again on the Friday before she was married—I saw her—there was another servant in the house at the time named Potts—Miss Todhunter came in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on the Friday—she told me she wanted me to go somewhere with her, as she wanted to make some money—I went and asked Mrs. Swan, but she told me she could not let me go—I told Miss Todhunter that, and she</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker—I have a shop at Paddington, and another in Theobald's-road—I remember some inquiry about these rings—I was present at Debenham's and Storr's when they were sold, and bought them for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I broke the cluster ring up, and I was very doubtful whether the other was an emerald; and having inferior brilliants round it I sold it as a common ring, either in a lot or separately, I do not recollect which—I think I took them in my pocket from the sale, and broke one up after a few days, or it might be a week—I broke it up with my hands—I have sold part of the stones, and some I have by me now; I have the centre one still, I have not got it here—I told the Magistrate I had the stones now—I sold the emerald ring in the same state in which I bought it—I sold it from my house in Theobald's-road—it is not at all usual to sell them in the same place they are pawned at—I cannot give you the slightest—notion to—whom I sold it, nor the price—it might have been sold in a lot.</p>

                  </hi>. I presided at the Marylebone police-court on the occasion of the examination of the prisoner on this charge—after the evidence was concluded, the prisoner was called upon, in the terms of the Statute, to know if she had anything to say or wished to say—she made a statement, which was taken down in writing by the clerk—when the deposi<lb></lb>tions</p>

               <p>initial them after they had gone through them—a report was then drawn up and submitted to the District Board at their next meeting—that report ought to contain a true account of the bills audited—it was then the prisoner's duty to draw cheques for the amount claimed in the report—a cheque was then drawn for the whole amount due to each particular person—there was the usual counterfoil to the cheques used in the office—after the cheques were drawn and signed by members of the Board, it was my duty to countersign them—it was my usual practice to see that the cheques agreed with the report—I seldom countersigned any cheque until I saw that it agreed with the report of the Board—the cheques were generally sent to me for signature, probably by the messenger, from Mr. Chapman—sometimes I signed them at the office—these four accounts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) dated May, 1861, are Mr. Hobbs' accounts—the account for the quarter ending Lady-day, 1861, for St. Nicholas, Deptford, is 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—it is endorsed by Mr. Chapman, "St. N., D.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Any of the clerks would have access to these papers, and if they wished to destroy them after the accounts were once passed and audited they would remain for years without any one looking at them, no suspicion attaching to them—there was an audit in the regular way, Mr. Chapman being the person to prepare the accounts for the audit, and to attend the auditors—this is the balance-sheet prepared by him; that would carry on the same defalcation, so that the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not be accounted for—I had a certain salary, and had to provide a clerk to do the business of the Board—the prisoner was recognised by the Board by a special minute made in 1866—in 1861 it was practically his duty to act as accountant, prepare documents for them, submit them for signature, and attend the meetings—he did not attend to my private business at all, I have my own office at a different place altogether; he attended entirely to the business of the Board.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Shorter's Court, City—In May, 1861, I was chairman of the Board of Works of the Greenwich district—in the ordinary course, the report of the Finance Committee would be laid before the Board—the cheques were frequently drawn during the time business was going on; Mr. Chapman would draw them—I should not before signing a cheque see that it agreed with the finance report—if the finance report had been adopted, I should assume that the cheque had been drawn in accordance with it; I signed the cheque on the faith of the report—it would be signed by two other members, and the clerk would countersign it—I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of the particular transaction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now clerk in charge of the London and County Bank at High Wycombe; in 1861 I was clerk in the Greenwich branch of the London and County Bank—the treasurer of the bank kept an account there on behalf of the Board—it was my duty to pay cheques drawn by members of the Board, countersigned" by the clerk—I paid this cheque produced on 30th May, 1831; it is an open cheque, payable to bearer—I paid it over the counter in four 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, two of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coin—the entry in this book is my writing—at this distance of time I can't say to whom I paid it—it was the first cheque paid on that day, and it would be consequently early in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at New Cross Road, and am a contractor—in 1861 I did work for the Board of Works of the Greenwich district—I did the work mentioned in these four accounts—I made out this account for the Greenwich parish myself—the work was done by my people at Lady Day in that year, this was the account for that quarter—I added it up myself—when I sent it in to the Board, it was an account for 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that, with the other accounts, made a total of 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due to me—on the morning of 30th May I called at the clerk's office for payment of those accounts; I had a memorandum book with me, I have it here now—I saw the prisoner; it was a little after 12 o'clock when I went into the office—I said, <hi rend="italic">"</hi> Mr. Chapman, I have called for my accounts for the quarter ending Lady Day"—he said, "I must trouble you to call again"—I said, "For why?"—he said, "I am sorry to say that I have made an error in drawing the cheque for your amount, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in excess, call again in half-an-hour and I will get the cheque cashed and pay you in cash, and pay the excess over to the credit of the Board"—he begged me not to say anything to any member of the Board, it would make no difference, every one was liable to mistake—I did not see the accounts then—I went away and called again in half-an-hour, he then paid me 340<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank-notes, three 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put stamps on the bills and receipted them, all four—these are my signatures—before receipting them I looked at my memorandum-book to see whether the accounts agreed—this is my memorandum: "St. Paul, Deptford, account 247<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., cartage account 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Greenwich account 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., St. Nicholas, Deptford, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I am certain that the Greenwich account was 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I receipted it—as soon as I received the notes and signed the receipts I went and paid them in to my credit at the London and County Bank at Greenwich, together with a little cheque of 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

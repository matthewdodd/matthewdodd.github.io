He then put down an hammer and an iron crow on the table. Welsh's wife came to the window, and called him out. He went out in about ten minutes, and took the hammer and crow. He came back afterwards; he did not bring back the hammer or the iron crow. I said I could not stop any longer; he said I was welcome to drink the share of two or three pots of beer if I would stop. I stopped with him about half an hour, and then I went away to my work. I told him when I saw him again I would reward him for it I told him that my wife was not at home; that she would not be at home before six o'clock. My wife happened to come home before I did.</p>

            . The last witness is my sister. I live at No. 1, Horn's-alley. I saw Welsh go down the court with a bricklayer's hammer in his hand about half after eleven, when I was eating my dinner. He went into Mr. Swiney's yard; he stopped there about two minutes. His wife was with him. After that I did not see Welsh until between three and four o'clock; I then saw him go into Swiney's yard again. Griffiths was with him, but I never saw Griffiths go in. Griffiths stood at the bottom of the court, leaning over a post at that time; I never saw him go in. I did not see any body with him. A little while afterwards, I saw Welsh come out with a bundle under his arm. That might be in about twenty times. He came out with a sailor's sack, a little narrow bag. He had nothing when he went in; he had this bag coming out. The bag appeared to be full; I cannot say what was in it. Welsh came down the court; Griffiths took the hammer, and Welsh's wife came up the court.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him between three and four o'clock did you see the hammer then - A. I did not. When he came down I saw the hammer in his hand. Welsh passed down the court with the bundle; his wife went up the court. That is all I have to say.</p>

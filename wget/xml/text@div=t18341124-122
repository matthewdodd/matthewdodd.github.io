                  </hi>. I live in South-street, Spitalfields. On the 17th of October, about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in Whitechapel—some one tapped me on the shoulder, and then I missed my handkerchief from my pocket—I had it safe ten minutes before—it has not been found—I followed the prisoner, who was said to have taken it, to Petticoat-lane—I could not find any officer, and left him there—he saw me following him, and said, if I came any further he would rob me of something else—</p>

               <p>I had accused him of taking my handkerchief, and he denied it—he had a companion with him, and I concluded he had passed it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, No. 2, Duke-street. He is a boot and shoemaker. I was in Whitechapel that evening—I saw the prosecutor walking with another gentleman, and the prisoner took a handkerchief out of his coat pocket—I told the prosecutor of it—the prisoner gave the handkerchief to another young man, and he went off—I am quite sure the prisoner took it.</p>

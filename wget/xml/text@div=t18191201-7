            . On the 16th of November, a little before eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner with the coat in Church-street, Hackney, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutors', he had it rolled up under his arm. I suspected him, followed him, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got?" he said it was a coat, which he had brought from a clergyman's, who was a lodger at a gentleman's house, at Clapton, and was going to take it to his master, who was a tailor, and lived in Whitechapel, to get it cut shorter in the back. I told him to go back with me, and shew where he took it from; he refused, and said he would take me to where he was going - I took him to the watch-house. When he got half-way he said he would go no further. I pulled him on, he then said,</p>
               <p>"I did not bring it from where I told you, I found it in the church-yard." I asked him why he told me that? he said he thought I should not detain him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. Did the prosecutor tell you his name - A. Yes, I have heard him answer to it since the prisoner was taken. The prisoner said he took it from a clergyman, and mentioned some name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming across Hackney church-yard, and saw the coat lying between two tombstones, I picked it up, and put it under my arm, and the officer stopped me. I told him where I found it, and offered to shew him the place - the lamplighter saw me pick it up. I did not say I brought it from any house.</p>

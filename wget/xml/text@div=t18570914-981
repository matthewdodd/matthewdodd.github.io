                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Barrett, of No. 6, Mornington Road, New Cross. He is station master at the railway—the prisoner was with me nearly three months—I paid her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week just to come in the morning, and clean some steps—I only required her in the morning—on 18th Aug., 1856, I gave her a sovereign and a plate to go for a pound of butter, and told her to make haste; she had not to go more than three minutes' walk—I did not see her again till 18th or 19th Aug. this year, when she was in custody—I did not know where she lived, or whether she had a mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was making all the haste I could, and dropped the sovereign; some man picked it up, and ran away with it; I was all in a tremble, and frightened to come back.</p>

On 19th Aug., from informa<lb></lb>tion I received, I went to No. 56, River Street, Deptford, and found the prisoner in the top garret, working with a young man who she was living with—I told her the charge, and she turned to the young man, and said, You told me this was paid, or I should never have come back again"—he made no answer—going to the station, she said that she bad been in the north of England, and should never have come back, but she thought the sovereign was paid—she said nothing about losing it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a widow, I take in washing: On the 20th of September, I think it was Friday, I lost seven pair of cotton stockings and a pair of pockets out of the yard, where I had hung them to dry; I was coming down stairs to take them in, and saw the woman at the bar going out with them in her apron; I live in St. Andrew's-street, Seven-dials; upon seeing her, I went up to her, and said, ma'am, I beg your pardon, I think you have got something there belonging to me; I then saw the stockings hang out; then she said, if I would let her go, I might have them again, if they were mine; I then called for assistance, and knocked at the door; a young woman came to my assistance, and I sent for a constable; I had lost other things that same evening. (The constable produced the property, which was deposed to by Mrs. Field).</p>

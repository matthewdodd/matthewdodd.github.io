I am clicker, of 51, Banner Street, St. Luke's—it is my dwelling-house—on 4th May I closed the house, left it all secure, and. retired about twenty minutes to 1 o'clock—I was aroused about 4.15 by the policeman, went into the kitchen and found part of the window entirely taken out and set down by the washhandstand—persons must have been in the kitchen to place it there—the grating was lying outside on the stones, it was a fixture.</p>

On Saturday, 4th May, at 10.30, I was in Banner Street, St. Luke's, and saw the prisoners—I ordered them away, and they left—between then and 2 o'clock on Sunday morning I saw them several times together—about 2 o'clock I saw Biggs in Coleman Street, close to a hoarding enclosing some ruins at the back of Mr. Poole's permises—</p>

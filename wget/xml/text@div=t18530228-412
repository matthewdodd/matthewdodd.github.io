                  </hi>. I am a locksmith. I reside and carry on business at No. 10, Winchester-street, Old Broad-street—the prisoner is my son—he lost his mother on 20th Sept—previous to her death I had been in the habit of employing him, but I never could get him to work regularly; he would work nowhere—he did not commit any assault on me at the time she was lying ill—after the death of Mrs. Corton he worked for me at times, and I wished to keep him on, if I could—I was at my house in the morning of 4th Feb.—I recollect the prisoner coming; it was about 10 o'clock, as nigh as I can guess, or it might be later (he did not lodge in my house)—I asked him if he thought it was a proper hour to come to work, and if he could not come before that he had better go back again, I had nothing for him—I do not know what words he used—he sat himself down on a chair in the shop, and not being dressed in shop dress, it was not altogether proper—after some time he went down into the cellar, or workshop, and soon after I went into the back yard, and hearing a cry from my errand boy I went down in the workshop to them, and the boy told me that the prisoner had knocked him about, and had thrown his cap on the fire, or on a piece of hot iron—the prisoner was close to the fire, near to the lad—on the boy making this complaint, I told the prisoner to go out of the place, I would not have him there—he said, "What for?" and said he would not go for me at first, and I then put my hand on his shoulder to push him up—I got him up stairs, and he went into the other shop, in the front shop—I there told him to go; I had some trouble to get him to go—when I got him to the door he made a rush at me, and struck me on the right jaw with his fist; it was a pretty sharp blow, and it is swelled a little—after he struck me this blow he ran away, and turned the corner of the street, and finding me following him he ran back again and into the shop, as I understood, but I did not follow him down—when I got back he was gone down in the cellar—I sent for a policeman; he came to the house, and the prisoner was concealed in the cellar; I could not find him for some time—we found him in the front cellar, and I gave him in charge of the policeman fur striking me—I went to the station house in Moor-lane with him and the officer, and my eldest son—when we got to the station the prisoner denied the charge, and the constable discharged him, there being no corroborative evidence—I went back to my house, and the prisoner was there; he had got down stairs again—I had no conversation with him, he having gone down to work—I went out directly, leaving him in the house; I went to the Mansion House to take out a summons—I did not get a summons, they said there was a long case on—I went to the Mansion House three times, and after that I returned to my own house—I went into the shop; the prisoner was there, and my daughter, and my other son—the prisoner came in from the cellar, and he asked me if I was going to take out a warrant against him; I said, "Yes"—he began to abuse me, and I went to him to put him out; Salter, the boy, was at that time in the shop—the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

               <p>struck me on the nose—I could not say what he struck me with, the blood was all streaming down; it was done with some sharp instrument—this blow on the nose was struck in the shop; I was trying to put him out, and I received various blows with this knife—I did not see the knife in his hand—I received the first blow on the nose; it has been strapped up—I received one blow on this right thumb—the leader is all dead now—I received one on the third finger of my left hand, one in the throat, and one just on the heart; they were all wounds, and all bled—I cannot say in what way they were given; I fenced them off, but how I received them I cannot tell—here is a scar on my breast, and one on my throat—I had a coat on, a waistcoat, a shirt, and a flannel waistcoat underneath—the instrument which made the wound on my breast, cut through all those clothes—here is the coat; it is cut through on the arm, on the breast, and on the neck too—after I had received these wounds, my eldest son called to me, and said, "Father, take the knife;" and I saw the knife held up by my eldest son, who had struggled with the prisoner and had taken the knife from him—I was bleeding very much; I became faint from loss of blood; I fainted in the doctor's shop—this is the knife; it seems a new one—I had never seen my son with it before—I had seen him with a knife, which I have got in my pocket, but not this knife—this is the knife which my son William had in his hand after I had been stabbed—at the time this took place, the prisoner was under recognizances to keep the peace towards me—I was taken to the hospital in a <hi rend="italic">cab—</hi> I was there a fortnight at first, and then I had to go back again—I was attended by Dr. Coleman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am eleven years old. I am errand-boy to Mr. Gorton—on the morning of Friday, 4th Feb., William Corton and I were down in the workshop; the prisoner came there about 10 o'clock—he slapped my head, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> my cap on a bit of hot iron—I cried out, and my master came down out of the back yard—I complained to him of what the prisoner had done to me, and he ordered him out—I then went up stairs—I saw the prisoner again about half past 11 o'clock—I had been sent on an errand to Clerkenwell, and when I came back I saw the prisoner in the shop on the ground-floor—William Corton was in the shop at that time—I did not much notice whether any words took place between him and his brother William—I was giving a message—I did not notice the prisoner go down stairs till after 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I afterwards saw him and my master, and William together, and I heard my master tell him about taking a warrant out against him—he asked my master whether he intended to take out a warrant against him—he and his father had been out together before that, and I had been sent for a policeman, and got one—after that I heard the prisoner ask his father whether he meant to take</p>

               <p>out a warrant against him, and his father told him yes—the prisoner said some angry words, but I do not know what, and his father ordered him out—he put his hand on his shoulder and ordered him to go out—not with any violence—he did not go out, and his father went to push him out, and when he got as far as the step of the door he struck his father with the knife—I saw the knife in his hand—this is it—when the father was struck on the nose I ran up stairs—I was frightened, I did not see anybody take the knife from him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am brother to the prisoner. On Friday, 4th Feb., I recollect being down in the workshop with the prisoner and the lad Salter—the lad was rather saucy to him, and he gave him a clout on the head—it knocked his cap off, and it fell on a piece of iron that a man was working, and the boy said he would smash his nose for it—the boy cried, and my father came down in the cellar—the boy did not make any complaint to my father that I heard—there was no complaint made, but my father ordered my brother out because the lad was crying.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When your father came down stairs, did he not ask the boy what he was crying for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in my hearing—I have not stated that before that I am aware of—I am not aware that the boy said the prisoner had been knocking him about—I did not hear it—my father ordered the prisoner out—he did not go out directly—he was carried up by the policeman and my father—I went with them to the station—I did not see the prisoner strike my father any blow—the blow was struck before the policeman came down.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">LOCK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, your father made a charge against him at the station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he did—I did not go in—I returned with my brother from the station-house—I believe my father went to the Mansion House—on our way from the station-house the prisoner said to me that if his father did not leave off, or something to that effect, it would be the worse for him—we got home before my father—I told my brother that my father was gone to the Mansion House, and I recommended him to go away and be quiet—with a good deal of my persuasion he did go away, and he was absent, I suppose, about an hour or two—he returned, and came down in the cellar—I advised him a second time to go away, and he did—I do not recollect how long he was gone that time—it might be half an hour or three-quarters—my father was absent the whole of this time—when the prisoner returned the last time he came in the shop and went down in the cellar—after my father returned, I recollect my father, my sister Elizabeth, and myself, being in the front shop—while we were there the prisoner came from the cellar into the shop—my father did not say anything to him, but he asked my father if it was his intention to get a warrant out for him—my father said, "Yes, it was"—on his saying that the prisoner said something, but I am sure I cannot recollect what—what he said</p>

               <p>induced me to say that if he went on in that way I would twist his neck and turn him out of the shop—he had said something to my father, and to me as well—he went on in that way, using abusive language, till my father ordered him out—he had been to my father's late employer, and I believe he said my father had been exposing him, it was something to that effect—my father ordered him out, and he put his hand on his shoulder to put him out—I was looking at some blanks, and I did not see what took place at the step of the door—I saw him and my father out in the road, scuffling about—I ran between them, and took hold of my brother—I did not see a knife anywhere till I came back from the station-house—I then saw it on the counter, my sister was looking at it—I believe this is the one, as far as my recollection can go—I am not aware that I saw this knife before that time—I cannot say positively.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police officer. The prisoner was brought to the station house on 4th Feb., about 3 o'clock—after the charge had been booked against him, I went to Mr. Corton's house in Great Winchester-street—I took this knife from Elizabeth Corton—I perceived there were marks of blood on it—the prisoner was given into custody for striking his father with a knife, and cutting him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to James Farquharson, of No. 94, Houndsditch, about five minutes' walk from Great Winchester-street. On Friday, 4th Feb, I was in the shop, the prisoner came in about 2 o'clock or a little after 2 o'clock—I had not known him before—he asked for a clasp or a pocket knife—I showed him one with a buffalo handle and a broad point—this is it (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—he looked at it, and said he wanted one with a spring back (all the knives with spring backs have steel points)—I showed him one with a spring back and a pointed blade on the outside of a parcel—he looked at it, and examined the knife—he found the spring had lost its effect, and he asked for one that had the spring sound—I opened the parcel, and gave him one that had the spring—he opened it, and tried the spring, and said that would do—he asked the price, I asked him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he urged that he wanted it for the trade, and very likely he would have more of them—I ultimately came down to 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he asked what was the wholesale price—I</p>

               <p>said 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—he did not like to give more than the wholesale price—he was going to the door, but he came back and paid the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and had the knife—this knife produced is like the one I sold him—I have one out of the parcel here—there is the same maker's name on them both—I believe this is the one of out that parcel that I sold to the prisoner—he went away with it—I had not seen the prisoner before—I was taken to Newgate prison on that day week—I was shown seven persons together; I picked the prisoner out, and he is the person.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 152). On Friday afternoon, 4th Feb. I was on duty in Great Winchester-street, about a quarter before 3 o'clock, I saw the prisoner near Mr. Corton's house; I saw blood on his face; he was in company with his brother—I inquired what the matter was, and hit brother answered he had been stabbing his father—his father afterwards came out of the house, accompanied with his porter—I saw blood on the father's face, and a wound on his nose; he appeared in a very weak state, and quite agitated—I asked him if I was to take the prisoner into custody? he said, "Yes;" adding at the same time that he had stabbed him in the heart, or to the heart—I took the prisoner to the station—he alleged that he was suffering from kicks he had received from his father in the abdomen, and he could not proceed quick to the station; he could not walk quick—I searched him at the station, and found on him two duplicates, two keys, an old penknife, an old pocket-book, and a bottle of what Dr. Simpson pronounced to be chloroform—I took the prisoner to Bartholomew's Hospital—he remained all night in custody, and was discharged about four o'clock the following evening, and I took him to the station—I took him before the Magistrate—he was remanded, and was finally committed for trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at Guy's Hospital—I remember Mr. Corton being brought there on 4th Feb.—I did not notice the time, I know it was before 5 o'clock—I examined his person; I found a wound over his nose, one over the left collar-bone, one over the cartilage of the sixth rib, near the breast-bone, one on the right thumb, one on the ring finger of the left-hand, one on the right fore-arm, near the elbow, and one on the back part of the left thigh; they were all punctured wounds, with the exception of the one on the arm, which was an incised wound—they were all wounds which might have been inflicted by a knife of this description—the one over the cartilage of the sixth rib is very near the region of the heart—the point of the instrument seemed to have impinged on the cartilage of the rib which attaches the rib to the breast-bone; it seemed to have slipped up a little—the wound was a quarter of an inch deep and three-quarters of an inch wide; it went a little beyond the edge of the rib—the rib seemed to have stopped it going to the heart—if it had gone between the ribs it would have reached the heart, and death would have occurred shortly—from the wound in the chest he had symptoms of inflammation of the lungs, for which he was removed to another ward—from the blow on the breast having gone through a coat, a waistcoat, a shirt, and an under waist<lb></lb>coat,</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 90). On 4th Feb., I was acting-sergeant at Moor-lane-station—the prisoner was brought there on the 4th Feb., at 20 minutes before 1 o'clock, on a charge of assaulting his father—the father was present, and made the charge against him—there was no other witness, and I told him I could not take the charge; he might summon him, which I recommended him to do—we require in all cases a corroborative witness, unless there are marks of violence—the prisoner was charged again at 3 o'clock with this charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I hope, gentlemen, you will see I must have had great provocation to do such a thing as I have done; I admit the charge now; since my mother died my father says, "You shan't go on in this manner," and he has undermined me in everything; in every way; my brother here that gave witness against me, is really obliged to do so; if he did not, my father would say" You are as bad as he is," and actually turn him out of doors, as he has me, in several instances, because I would not go out to thieve and pick pockets, and all those sort of things, in order to get him money to buy fixtures to get him up in business; that is how it was; I have this charge to make against him, which I would not have done, but he has employed two counsel against me to show that I am a bad character; I say this in order to state what he really is; I have been greatly provoked to do such a thing as this; when I was about fourteen there was a scuffle or something of that sort, a row between us, and he struck me several times, and with the assistance of a porter that he brought up, he got me down and got hold of my handkerchief, and very nearly strangled me; for three months afterwards I had a blood-shot over my sight; if my mother had been alive, I should not have come here; I should not have been to a police-court, much less a criminal court; if my mother had been alive, she would have shown you how I have been put upon, and undermined in every respect.</p>

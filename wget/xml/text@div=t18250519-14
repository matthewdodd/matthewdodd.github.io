            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoners in Worship-street, about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock at night, on the 25th of April, both carrying a piece of wood; I asked what they were going to do with it - they both said to take it to Mr. Bonner's premises - I let them go, but soon afterwards I heard it was stolen; I went to Mr. Bonner's, and found the wood inside the door: he is a willow weaver: I am certain it is the same wood as I saw the prisoners with. About half-past one o'clock I saw them in company again, in Long-alley; I knew them before, and have no doubt of their persons: I took them into custody with assistance, and charged them with taking the wood; they said, "What wood?" I said they would hear more about it; one of them had a smock-frock on - the other had a black coat.</p>

            . I live behind Mr. Lacey's premises. I saw Eyre, who had a black coat on, getting the wood on his shoulder, close to Mr. Lacey's rails; he went down Holywell-row, and I followed him till he got to Worship-street; Brown had a smock-frock on - he was close by the King's Head public-house, about twenty yards off, with a small piece on his shoulder. I went and told the watchman.</p>

            . I was coming out of the King's Head, and saw a person go by with a piece of wood on his shoulder; he had a white jacket on, or a smock-frock. I was examined before the Magistrate immediately afterwards; I said it was a person in a white dress: I never saw his face. The Magistrate asked me whether I believed Brown to be the man; I said I could not swear to him, but by his dress I believed he was the same person.</p>

               <p>Re-examined by the COURT. The clerk whose duty it was to have paid the duties, always asserted that they were paid; but the London Dock Company denied that they were paid. There was no appearance of their having been paid; that clerk's name was Samuel Ki zey; I don't know where he is now. There is a clerk in Court, who will explain whether or not, or receipt papers for these duties; not attending to the Custom House business myself, I am not aware.</p>

They were delivered under the authority of this order. I read it, "Deliver the leather to Widow Robert Taylor and Sons, they paying all charges." By virtue of this they were delivered. The clerk brought it, and I recollect receiving it from him. I then put my initials upon it, as an authority for the warehouseman to deliver them to the carter. I recollect they were delivered to Tomlin. I don't recollect that he was at the door, but I recollect he was there during the time. I kept that order until there was an application made by Sir

He expressed surprise at being apprehended on a Sunday, and said that he thought it very strange and very hard. There was nothing in his conduct more than happened every day in the mercantile world, and he had not intended any fraud or injury to any one. That he had not concealed any thing, nor withheld any information that he could give to be useful.

             LUBBOCK, Esq. now called again, and cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. I have no other partner than my father, Sir John Lubbock, in our mercantile concern.</p>
               <p>Q. I observe that this contract comprehends a much larger quantity of hides than the commerce. It is 773. The price of the first parcel of hides was a little more than 2200l. - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. And Mr. Taylor paid you that 2200l. for them - A. They were paid for at the time they came due. Mr. Taylor had been long employed by our house as broker.</p>
               <p>Q. I need not ask you, if you had great confidence in his integrity - A. He did all the business in our line.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, at the very time of this transaction, he had many thousand pounds worth of your goods in his possession - A. He made a sale of goods to the amount of 9000l. and they were in his warehouse. The other goods of the Commerce were delivered in October. They were kept back for the small sum of duty; but the same delivery which was had upon the order in question in February, might have been obtained six months sooner, upon payment of the duty.</p>
               <p>Q. If these had been delivered in the month of October, have you the least doubt that they would have been paid for also - A. I think that there is every reason to suppose that they would.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I would ask you from all this, do you think he intended to commit any fraud - A. I do not think that at the time he gave me the contract, he ever intended to defraud me of the amount, but to fulfil it by paying the amount.</p>
               <p>Q. And but for his subsequent failure, do you mean to say he would not have done it - A. I attributed it to his failure, and I founded that opinion from the hides being in his warehouse at the time of the failure.</p>
               <p>Q. And before the failure, he sent word to you that he wished the contract to be cancelled, and that you might have the hides again - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100039"></xptr>Q. And the hides were still in his warehouse - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that he had any intention to defraud - A. It is impossible to say that. I do not think he got them under any premeditated scheme to get the money for them; but if it had not been for his bankruptcy, I believe he would have paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. We know a broker can't buy in his own name. If he had said that these hides were for himself, you would have objected to it - A. Unquestionably.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by Mr. Pooley. It is not usual for a broker to use the name of a fictitious person.</p>
               <p>Mr. SERJEANT BOSANQUET. My Lord, that is the case on the part of the prosecution.</p>

            , on being called upon for his defence, read it to the Court as he had committed it to paper. He lamented the degrading situation in which he was placed. He commented with warmth upon the various circumstances which appeared in evidence to prove that he might, by paying the trifting sum of 30l. duty, have obtained the hides in question, long before the time that he got them into his warehouses. He declared that his intention was to pay for these as he had paid for the former; and he hoped that unless the transaction appeared to be meditated, and carried into execution for the purpose of fraud, a Jury of his countrymen would not find him guilty. He hoped that the door of mercy would not be shut against him, and that his intention would be seen throughout the whole transaction. He declared that if any criminality could be attached to the transaction, his brother was most ignorant of it; and he concluded by throwing himself on the humane consideration of the Jury, and by hoping deliverance at their hands.</p>
               <p>THE COURT did not think it necessary to call on

               <p>THE COURT then proceeded to sum up the evidence for the consideration of the Jury, and told them, that the first question for their consideration would be,whether the prisoners, both or either, and of but one then which forged the endorsement in question, with intent to defraud.</p>
               <p>The next question would be, did both or either of them dispose, fit, and put it away, upon the other Counts of the Indictment, with a similar intent.

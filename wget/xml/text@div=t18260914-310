               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You say, when the boy went away the prisoner had returned? A. Yes; and in about half an hour I found the silk in the cotton-room. I had been some few moments in my house, once or twice; a person might have gone into the warehouse without my seeing them, but not without my hearing the door go; my house is about six feet off; I went up stairs into the bed-room which looks into the warehouse; I was there five or ten minutes, I might be a quarter of an hour altogether in the house - I employ forty or fifty other workmen; I believe they were not on the premises; I did not see any one go from the warehouse to the cotton-room; they might have done so, but it is very improbable.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could any person have gone out of the warehouse without your hearing them? A. I think not, because the door makes a noise; it was not the business of any person to have been employed there but the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you came back the prisoner was in the room where the silk was? A. Yes, and I suppose he took it from the warehouse to the cotton-room during the half hour; he must have opened the door that I speak of; it was his usual custom, after he has done his work in the warehouse, to lock the door and bring in the key; I went out with the key, and he was coming out of the cotton-room; at that moment my dog got loose in the cellar, and I desired him to go down and fasten him; I then went into the warehouse, and the silk was gone - I found it in the cotton-room, behind a box of rubbish - I sent for the officer, and told him what I conceived the prisoner to have done, and it was when he was going out of the door that he used this expression - I had desired him to look for it, but he would not; he stood<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140132"></xptr>before the hole where the silk was, within a yard of it, and I desired him to move; I put my hand in and took hold of it.</p>

            . I am a foreman to Mr. Machu. I know the prisoner - on the 10th of September some silk of this description came from the dyer's; I weighed it, and there was 58lbs.; it was then put into the silk-room, which is detached from the warehouse; I have seen this parcel of silk weighed; it weighs 5lbs., and I have weighed the silk that came from the dyer's since; we had parted with about 9lbs. 11 oz. of it, but allowing for that there is 5lbs. deficient - I have seen the prisoner with a handkerchief of this pattern, about five or six days before; it was dirty on a shelf, and he said "This is mine, I will take it home, and have it washed;" it struck me immediately that it was the same handkerchief; I have often seen a handkerchief of this kind in the warehouse.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went out with a paper, and the boy was left in the warehouse; when I returned I was occupied full an hour in putting things in order; the prosecutor was in his house, and I did not see him till I went out to my breakfast; he then came and asked, if I had seen the silk; I said I had not; he then told me to search, which I did, and it was found in the cotton-room; but I told him I knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>COURT to PROSECUTOR. Q. Did he say he knew nothing of it? A. He said it was not his - I said it was not, it was mine.</p>


               <p>Six witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Wandsworth. On 1st Sept., between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, Ann Moore came to my shop to purchase a collar—the price was 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she laid down a shilling on the counter—I had not a sixpence to give her change—she ultimately had two collars, and I gave her 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change—I took the shilling off the counter, and it was in my hand till the officer took it out.</p>

About 8 o'clock in the evening I saw the three prisoners together—they walked up Putney High-street; they came back again, and separated—I saw Ann Moore go into a baker's shop—she was in some little time—she came out again and joined James Moore, who was a few yards off—they went up the town—I followed, and saw them turn up Wands worth-lane—I then saw the last witness, and was speaking to him, and John Moore came up and turned down Wandsworth-lane—we followed him, and they stopped at the end of Frogmore—it appeared as if James Moore passed something to John Moore, and John Moore went round Frogmore—Ann Moore and James Moore went through Love-lane to High-street, Wandsworth, and there it appeared James Moore passed something to Ann Moore—she went into Mrs. Knight's shop and stayed there some time—James Moore passed by, and he came back and looked in at the window—Ann Moore came out and joined him—I took James Moore, and on the way to the station I found four half crowns in separate pieces of paper in his jacket pocket, and at the station I found one half crown and one shilling in his left trowsers pocket—he said his father gave him them to take out—I found some good money on him as well—we then went to the town and took John Moore coming along—one shilling was found in his jacket pocket, wrapped in a piece of paper—he said at the station that he knew nothing of the other two prisoners, and James Moore said, "You told me that you married my mother two years ago."</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of coin to the Royal Mint. This shilling that was uttered is counterfeit, and this found in the possession of John Moore is also counterfeit—amongst the coins found on James Moore one shilling is counterfeit, and from the same mould as that uttered by Ann Moore—two of these half crowns are of George the Fourth, from the same mould, two are Victorias from the same mould, and one of George the Third—all are counterfeit.</p>

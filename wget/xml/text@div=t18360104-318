                  </hi>. I am a tailor and clothes salesman, and live in Moor-street, Compton-street, Soho. The prisoner came to my house on the 23rd of December, between six and seven o'clock in the evening—I never knew him before—he offered me two pieces of cloths, measuring nearly eight yards and a half—this is it—he brought it in two separate parcels, in brown paper—he asked me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the two pieces—I consider it worth from 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a yard, and suspected him from the price—I asked him if it was his own cloth—he said, "Yes"—I asked him how he came in possession of it—he said he had it from a brother of his, a master tailor—I asked where—he said, "In long-lane, Smithfield"—I told him I would send my shopman to ascertain the truth of his having it from his brother, and if he was right I would purchase it—he then said he had to go down to Wales, and had no time to spare, and would rather take 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. than have any trouble about it—he said that he had been out of employ there weeks—I sent for a policeman, and had him taken.</p>

Mr. Solomon gave the pri<lb></lb>soner into my charge—I asked him how he came by the cloth—he said he hot got a mother in Wales very ill, and had received a letter from her that morning to come down, but he had no money—that he had a brother, tailor, in Long-lane, who owned him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but could not pay him, and he had given him this cloth to pledge—he said, in the course of the evening, that he had been out of employ for the last three weeks, but his last situation was in Watling-street—I took him to the station-house, searched him, and found 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him, which was returned to him by the inspector—I found the key of the prosecutors' beer cellar on him, among other keys.</p>

               <p>I was servant to Mr. Robinson, on the 8th of May last, we left every thing safe, that night and went to bed; a little before eleven I went round, and saw every thing was safe; I was alarmed in the morning between five and six o'clock by the ringing of the kitchen bell; I got up, and before I could well dress myself, I was alarmed by a knocking at the door; in consequence of that, I came down; when I came down to the bottom of the stairs, I saw a vast many things laying in the passage, the street door half way open with two watchmen standing on the stairs; part of the decanter of wine standing on the mat by these two doors; after that I let the watchmen in and shut the door, and went up and alarmed the house; afterwards I went down into the kitchen and I observed that the passage door, that goes into the kitchen, at the bottom of the stairs, was forced open; there was only one bar that was forced; the area door below stairs, which was fast over night with two bars, was open; one of the inside shutters was open of the kitchen window, and the sash half way up; there is a little hole in the shutter, which had been chipped round, so as to make room for an arm to be admitted through, so as to open the window, they could then take the bar up; the shutters had been forced in several places besides; I saw a candle stuck behind the door, which goes into the area, which they had taken off a box in my master's room; afterwards I went to my pantry where I used to keep my plate; I had an inventory of it; I am upper footman; the pantry is on the same floor, as the kitchen: the cupboard in the pantry was left locked, that was broke open and nothing left but two tea spoons, which they did not find; in the cupboard was a draw which I locked up the plate in, and out of which they took every thing there was; they left nothing, not the least in the world; I locked it up the night before I went to bed, and put the key in my pocket; all the articles mentioned in the indictment, were in this draw, and all were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what was the amount of those things that were in your care? - I cannot tell, there was a considerable quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any observations on the other part of the house? - Yes, I did on the parlour; the parlour is on the ground flour; the cupboard was broke open, and every thing was laying about; next I went to my master's room, which is called the back parlour, and there I saw all his cloaths laying about, his bureau was broke open where my master's cloaths lay.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man that called Monk up that morning? - I cannot say on my oath, if he is, he is very much altered; I knew him a little.</p>
               <p>Court. Let him be committed.</p>

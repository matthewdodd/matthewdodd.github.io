               <p>Q. Who keeps it? - A. I don't know; there were some people drinking punch; they knew my nephew by pretence, that they had seen him before, and they asked us to drink with them, and then cards were introduced, and my nephew played.</p>

            Who were the parties that sat down to play? - A. There is one there, (Parker.)</p>

                  <persName id="t18020113-24-person307">Q. </persName>
            What did they play at? - 
               <persName id="t18020113-24-person308">A. </persName>
            They played at whist; there was my nephew and three of them made the party; I sat by them, and then they proposed to lay money; my nephew said, uncle, I have an extraordinary good hand of cards, I can beat them myself, I am sure of the odd trick.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that openly, so that the others could hear? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>

            They would not take your best after that, I suppose? - A. Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lay? - A. I laid forty pounds to twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you win? - A. No; as soon as they put it down, I thought there was something wrong; I thought they were going to rob me, and I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130024"></xptr>to my nephew, John, you have brought me here to be robbed.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020113-24-person310">Q. </persName>
            Before all the company? - A. Yes; he said, no, uncle, I know the men very well, they will not rob you; Mr. Parker, the man at the bar, got the money in his hand, and I snatched it out of his hand by force, and, in getting it from him by force, I tore the thirty-pound note in three pieces; I had put into his hand a thirty-pound bank-note and two five-guinea country-bills; then that caused a disturbance in the house, and they were angry with me, and he said I had robbed my nephew, for he could have won the game if I had let him.</p>

                  <persName id="t18020113-24-person311">Q. </persName>
            Was he to go halves with you? - A. There was nothing said about halves, and my nephew himself was angry with me; upon that we all went away from that house, and I thought of going home, and all the way I went, my nephew and these two men were chiding me that I had ruined him, by not letting him win the money; they said, they were my nephew's friends, and they would not let him be robbed; so in going home, some of the party proposed to get some more drink; then we went to a public-house in the Haymarket; they call it the tap at the Opera house; we went all straight away in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Jury. 
               <persName id="t18020113-24-person312">Q. </persName>
            What time of night was this? - A. I do not know, for I had been drinking punch with them, and had more liquor than I should have had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do not you know what time it was - was it dark? - A. Yes; I dare say it was nine o'clock before we went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps the tap? - A. The prisoner Lonsdale.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober? - A. I do not know whether he was drunk or sober; I did not see any thing by him; when we went into the parlour, they called for some more punch, and some of them began to produce a pack of cards again; my nephew was as keen of playing as any of them, and he said only put it down, and we will soon have the money; and they proposed a wager again, and one of them said, oh, he is drunk, we will soon do him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that? - 
               <persName id="t18020113-24-person313">A. </persName>
            One of the party that was playing.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought him drunk too, I suppose? - A. I thought he was in liquor; he appeared very much like a gentleman; they would not let him speak, and I thought they used him ill; and then I laid the same wager as I had done before; I laid forty pounds to twenty again; I was thinking I could get some money.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18020113-24-person314">Q. </persName>
            And did you think that perfectly honest? - A. I cannot say; then my nephew laid twice over ten to one, that was threescore pounds, and I put it down for him; he said, he had got such a hand of cards; he had got all the trumps in his own hand; he had got seven trumps; he had only one trick to get; he had only one card left when the wager was laid, and that was a trump.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew all this, and saw it? - A. Yes; and one of the men wanted to look at the cards that had been played, and he played a trump; my nephew said, you are a rascal, I played that card, it was the seven of hearts; then the gentleman, that pretended to be drunk, snatched up the money, and ran away with it.</p>

            Did you see Lonsdale in the room at all? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, you see this is a scene of iniquity from beginning to end.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q. Who held the stakes? - 
               <persName id="t18020113-24-person316">A. </persName>
            Another man that they brought in; I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect all these circumstances perfectly well, and yet you say you were so drunk you could not tell what time it was? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Will you just tell the Gentlemen of the Jury how many jails you have been in? - A. I never was in any jail for any harm.</p>
               <p>Q. How many jails have you been in? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Clerkenwell, one; Newgate, two; Hereford, three; and so on? - A. I never was in any country jail.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that place behind you? - A. I suppose you know that as well as me.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you in Newgate for? - A. For no felony.</p>
               <p>Q. For gambling? - A. No.</p>

            What were you in Clerkenwell for? - A. I was there once for something; I changed a horse at Smithfield, and the horse that I changed for was stole, and they took me upon suspicion, but I was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect a man of your name being indicted for horse-stealing, and run away from his bail? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard of such a man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your's is a singular name - I do not ask you if you are the man -</p>
               <p>Court. I don't know whether we should go any farther in a case like this; they are playing at cards in a public-house, and his nephew, being sure of winning, lays two to one; what credit can you give to so drunken, so abandoned, a witness.</p>
               <p>Jury. We should like to hear the nephew, my Lord.</p>
               <p>JOHN BOLDERSON sworn. - I am a cheesemonger, No. 7. Whitcomb-street, Haymarket; Parker called upon me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him? - A. I did not know any thing of him further than coming to my shop for cheese and butter: On Tuesday, the 6th of January, he called upon me, about eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180201130025"></xptr>o'clock at night, and asked me if I was busy; I told him I was; he said, he had betted a wager of a bowl of punch about a foot-race at York; and I told him I knew the man won his wager that he run for, but I could not tell what time it was to be done in; I told him I had an uncle from the country, if he would take him with me, I would go; we went first to the tap under the Opera, and there they said he was gone to the Talbot; then we went to the Talbot, and then a man came in with a note from the Robin-Hood, saying, that his bowl of punch would be forfeited, unless I came directly; I left my uncle, and went there; there was only one person in the back parlour, and he asked me what I knew about the wager, and I told him; he said, he was satisfied that he had lost, and called for a bowl of punch; I had a glass of punch, and a man came in, and said, Mr. Bolderon, how do you do? I was astonished at his knowing me, and he asked me to have some brandy and water; he said, he should like to smoke a pipe with me, and persuaded me to fetch my uncle; Parker went with me, and my uncle came; after we had sat down some time, a pack of cards was produced, and my uncle was asked to play; he said, he never did; we played for a bowl of liquor; I had a capital good hand, and they proposed to bet wagers as far as forty pounds; my uncle put down a thirty-pound note and two five-guinea notes; Parker took them up; and then my uncle, dreading something, said, John, you have brought me here to be robbed; I said, G - d bless you, no, we are all countrymen together; then there was a proposal to go to the tap under the Opera.</p>

            Only since May; we went to the tap, and then the cards were introduced again, and we stopped to play; hearts were trumps, and I had the ace, king, queen, knave, nine, seven, and six, of hearts, Parker was my partner; the other two were Furby and Harrison; Harrison was the man who was represented as the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. He was drunk, was not he? - A. He pretended to be drunk; when I looked at my cards, I said to my uncle, I am sure I can get the odd trick; I trumped one of their cards with the seven; then Furby said, let me look at your cards that you have played, and he did look at them, and stole the seven from my cards; after a little while, he played my trump seven, and then I perceived he had stole it; then the gentleman swore he had won, and snatched up the money; my uncle had betted thirty pounds, and put down five five-guinea notes and four guineas in gold; Mr. Harrison put down his pocket-book and his gold watch against it; it was all put into the hands of a man of the name of Solliker, and as soon as there was a row about it, he snatched the money from Solliker, and ran out; my uncle ran out immediately, but he was gone.</p>

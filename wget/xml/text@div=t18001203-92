               <p>Mr. Alley. Q.Have you got your appointment? - A. No, I was appointed by an order of Common-council.(Mr. Alley contended that it was necessary he should prodace his appointment, which was over-ruled by the Court.)(The warrant read.)</p>
               <p>Teague. On the 2st of November, in consequence of information, I gave directions, that every body who came to enquire after Dunn, should be searched, I was called down into the office to see the prisoner searched; Baldwin, Lee, and Alderman were present; there was a man who came along with her, he was searched, he had nothing about him. but upon her was sound a small coil of rope, and a spring saw, (produces them;) she was asked about them, but would not say who they were for; she said, she was ordered to bring them there, but denied who they were for; a Bank-note of thirty pounds, and a sixpence, were also found upon her; she said her name was Winisred Bryan, and she was servant to Mr. Dunn.</p>
               <p>Q. Would such a rope as that facilitate the escape of a person out of prison? - A Certainly it would.</p>
               <p>Gross-examined by Mr. Alley. As to this prison, I do not know the situation of it, these things did not find their way into the prison, but into the lobby? - A. No, they never went inside the prison at all; she was stopped in the lobby.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the got into the house at all? - A. Yes, in the passage, just within the first door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Vaillant. Q. When you go out from the Poultry, you go through some gates to a passage? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you get to the absolute gate of extreme consinement, there is another gate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>A little further is the lobby, within the second, and then there is a third? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At night the lobby is inclosed within the general sence of the prison? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the under keepers of the Poultry-Compter; on the 21st of November; I saw the prisoner walk up the court to come to the prison, she came to see her husband, the man who was tried last; she said, she wanted to go to her husband, Dunn; just as she was coming into the lobby, I stopped her there, and told her, my master wanted to speak to her, and I sent for my master.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of her bringing any instruments, or give her leave to do so? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley, Q. This lobby is before you come to the jail? - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You stopped her before she got to the prison? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>REUBEN BALDWIN sworn, - Examined by Mr. Vaillant. I am head under keeper of the Poultry Compter; on Friday the 21st of November, I received some information, which I communicated to the keeper, in consequence of which, he gave directions that if any person came to the gate to enquire for Dunn, to stop them, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180012030063"></xptr>call them in; I was called out at the gate, and saw the prisoner and a man standing by the side of her; I asked her if she wanted Dunn, she said, she did; I desired her to walk into the lobby with me, which she did, and the man followed her; I asked her if she had any thing about her, she said, no, she had not; I desired her to take off her cloak, that I might search her; she then turned from me, and went to the other gate, but it was shut; I desired her to come into the lobby again, which she did, and pulled off her cloak; I searched her, and in her left-hand pocket, I found this coil of rope, it is more than eighteen yards, and in her right-hand pocket, I found this spring saw; I asked her how she, came by them, and, to the best of my recollection, she said, Dunn ordered her to bring them to him; she did not say for what purpose; I asked her, if she was the wife of Dunn she said, no, she was only his maid; while I was speaking to her, I saw her put her hand into her bosom, I supposed she had some other instrument about her, but there was not; she was then sent to Giltspur-street Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that saw, and tell me what use that may be put to? - A. I think this saw sufficient to cut any bar that we had asunder, in a very short time; this rope would be sufficient to let any one down from any part of our prison to the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things brought to the jail with your consent and permission? - A. No; the next day she came before the Lord Mayor, and said her name was

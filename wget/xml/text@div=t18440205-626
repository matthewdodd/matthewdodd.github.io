                  </hi>. I live in Christ's Hospital. On the 4th of Nov. I paid to a female a sum of money—to the best of my belief it was the prisoner—I cannot positively swear to her—this is the paper she signed—I gave her a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; country note, asking her to give me the change—she said she had not got it, and went out of the house, and obtained it, brought it back, and gave it to my servant—I was gone out then—I delivered the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; note to the prisoner—this is a bill sent to me by Mr. Jolland—here is a receipt to it—it was written in my presence by the prisoner—she has not put her name to it, only, "Settled, for J. J. Jolland, Nov. 4, 1843"—I saw her writing, but did not look at the bill, to see what she had written—I was in another room—a ser<lb></lb>vant</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Newington. The pri<lb></lb>soner was formerly in my service, and left me on one day in Oct.—she wasnot in my service on the 4th of Nov., nor employed or allowed by me to collect any money on my account—Mr. Stone, of Christ's Hospital, was in<lb></lb>debted to me 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I know the prisoner's handwriting—to the best of my belief the writing on this bill, "Settled for J. J. Jolland, Nov. 4, 1843," is hers—I can speak positively to it.</p>

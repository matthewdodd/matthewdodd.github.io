             sworn. - I am a labourer: On Wednesday, the 9th day of the month, I was at the Seven-stars at Hammersmith; about eleven o'clock the prisoner came in, and called for a pint of beer, and while he was drinking it, he said, d-n the boys they will not let the sheep alone; I got up and looked out at the window, I saw he had got four; then, instead of taking the high road, he went down the lane, where the water was up to the horse's belly, where I knew it was impossible to drive sheep, and I followed him full a mile towards town, by Shepherd's-bush; he came to a slough, and he got over into a field, and listed the sheep over till he got past the slough, I followed him to the Bull at Hammersmith, it was a private road all the way; I asked him where he was going; he told me he was going to town with them; I told him; I did not think he had come honestly by them; I then took him by the collar, and led him into the Black-bull; a constable was sent for, and he took charge of him, the constable locked the sheep up in a stable at the Black-bull; Finch came in the evening, and the landlord of the house shewed him the sheep, they were the same sheep that the prisoner had brought there; they were marked T D upon the near side, just behind the shoulder, a single W upon the hip, and they were fresh ruddled; he told the constable he was going to Kew-bridge; and then he told me he was going to the Black-lion at Kensington Gravel-pits, and he sent me with a note to the Black-lion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Was it not in consequence of what the prisoner said that you went to Kensington Gravel-pits? - A. Yes, he sent us there.</p>
               <p>Q. The water was very much out upon the roads at this time? - A. Yes, it was there, and has been for twenty-five years; it was so all through the summer.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was the Black-bull in the direct road to Kensington Gravel-pits or not? - A. No, it was not.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable at Hammersmith: I was sent for to take the prisoner into custody on Wednesday the 9th of October, about twelve o'clock in the day; he told me he met with the sheep the other side of Hayes, and told me they belonged to a gentleman, and he was going to Kew-bridge with them; afterwards he told me he was going to a Mr. Pike's, at Kensington; I asked him if he knew Mr. Pike; he told me he did; I immediately wrote a line to Mr. Pike, and kept him in custody till I took him to Bow-street the next morning; I put the sheep into the stable at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300018"></xptr>the Black-bull; the drover came in the evening and abused the landlord for detaining them from him, they were delivered to him the next day; Finch said he knew who had got them, for he had been drinking with him that day; he abused the landlord, and said, he knew the man was driving them to Kensington Gravel-pits, and he told him he was as bad as the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Finch.) Q. What did you mean by saying you knew the man was driving them to Kensington Gravel-pits? - A. I did not say so.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you heard such a thing, since this man has been taken up, as a reward of twenty pounds for sheep-stealing? - A. I never knew any thing about it, because I never was in a hobble before in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to Hammersmith, and I met with these sheep; I meant to give them up to the first Majesty I came to.</p>

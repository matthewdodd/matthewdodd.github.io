                  </hi>. I was 14 years old last August—my mother is married to a gentleman named Miller, and I have lived with them at 10, Church-street, Camberwell—I lived entirely at home, and my employment was fancy needle-work—I had no employment out of doors—about five weeks ago I became acquainted with the prisoner—I first saw him from my father's window—he was at work at a house which was being repaired opposite—I smiled from the window to him, and he smiled back again—afterwards, in the same week, I went over and told him that I had come over to look at the house—he showed me over it—it lasted about half an hour; I did not hurry myself much—I had no notion of taking the house—that was on Saturday—I met him next day, Sunday, on Camberwell-green, at 6 o'clock in the evening—that was not accidental; I had arranged with him to meet him—I remained in his company till half-past 8—we were walking about all that time—I got away from him because my parents thought I was going to church—the prisoner did not know what I had told them—I did not tell him that I had made any excuse—I met him next on Monday evening, and was with him about an hour—I got out because 1 had to go across the green to the grocer's—between then and the evening when I went away from home, I met him, I suppose, twenty times—on one of those occasions I told him that I got out to go to Mrs. Sibley's, the lady that employed me; that I had to tell my mother and father so—I met him on Monday evening, 2d December, by Camberwell—green; that was accidentally—I had told my mother and father that I was going to Mrs. Sibley's again, but I did not intend going; I intended meeting the prisoner,' and I did</p>

               <p>meet him—I went with him to the Elephant and Castle, and then he per<lb></lb>suaded me to come back home—I did not yield to that persuasion; I said that I would not go back home—nothing had taken place between me and him—I told him that mother and father had been very angry with me at home, because a bill had not been paid—that was true—when I said that I would not go home, the prisoner took me to his father's house in Drury-lane—we only stayed there a few minutes; we went for a walk, and then we went to Bloomsbury—we first went to a coffee-house in Long-acre, and had some tea—we left there at a little after 8, and went for a walk, and then we went to High-street, Bloomsbury, and did not leave there till next morning—I had never been there before—he took a bed there, and I was with him—I slept with him—we went next morning and had coffee at the coffee-shop—I walked about a short time with him, and then I went home with him to his father's, where I met his sister Edith, who went with me to seek for a lodging—I saw the prisoner again next evening—I slept with his sister Edith that Tuesday evening, in Bedford-place—I saw the prisoner on Wednes<lb></lb>day afternoon, and slept with him that night, but not at the same place as we slept on Monday—on Thursday, the night he was taken in custody, I slept at the lodging, and next morning I went with his father to the police-court, where he was to be examined before the Magistrate—I saw the prisoner yesterday, and spoke to him—he said that he would meet me by the Elephant and Castle, on Sunday evening, if he got off all right.</p>

I live at 20, Church-street, Camberwell, and am dis<lb></lb>penser to a medical gentlemen—in August, 1852, I married the last witness' mother, and from that time down to 2d December the child always resided with us—I have behaved towards her with kind<lb></lb>ness ever since I have known her—on Monday, 2d December, she went to Mrs. Sibley's, in Grosvenor-park, who she works for; she was to return in three-quarters of an hour, but did not do so; we did not take notice of it, as she sometimes stopped to finish work there—I then went to Mrs. Sibley's, but did not find her—her absence that night was not with my consent—on Wednesday, 4th December, about twelve o'clock, I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner with Inspector Frost, of the P division; I asked him where my daughter was, and what he had done with her—he said, "I do not know where she is; I have not seen her since Monday night—about half an hour afterwards he came over to my house—I was called in to him, and met him in the passage—he said, "I have told you an untruth, and now I tell you the truth; I did take your daughter away"—he went down stairs; Mrs. Miller was there, and Mrs. Osborne; and he said that he took her to his father's house, and she slept there and dined there the following day, Tuesday; and his sister went and took lodgings for her in Bedford-street, but he did not know the number—Mrs. Miller asked him whether he would produce her, and he said that he would about 5 o'clock that afternoon, solemnly declaring that he had not reduced her, and that he would bring her home a virtuous girl—he did not bring her back at 5 o'clock, nor did she come at all, and I went that night to Bow-street—on the next day, Thursday, about 9 o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner in custody—he said, "If you will give me time I will produce your daughter"—I said, "Where is she?" he said, "I do not know"—I gave him in charge—he is not still working opposite to me; but I have seen him in the neighbourhood of my house since he ceased to work there, as recently as Monday, in this week—she was then at my house; but was not aware that he was near the place—I passed him in Church-street—Saturday was the last day he worked there—I always treated the girl with the greatest kindness—there was nothing on my part, or my wife's, that I am aware of, to cause her to leave her home.</p>

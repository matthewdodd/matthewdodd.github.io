               <p>SUSANNAH HILL. I live at No. 9, Morgan-street, St. George's in the East; in the house of my mother; my mother keeps the house. The prisoner lodged in that house, he occupied the one pair of stairs room; he paid four shillings a week for it. On Tuesday night, the 5th of this month, he came home about eight o'clock, he was very much in liquor indeed; his neice came home with him. I and his niece undressed him; we got him to bed between eight and nine. After I had put him to bed. I went down stairs to get him some water to put by his bed-side, and when I went down, he got up; he broke the things on the mantle-piece; this was between eleven and twelve. When I heard he was breaking the things, I went up stairs; I said, for God's sake, do not break the things. He took a bundle of matches, and put into the fire, and then he put an apron into the fire; I begged him for God's sake, not to set the house on fire. He then took me by my side, and was going to throw me down stairs, but I ran down, and shut the street door after me when I ran out.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you so run out, did you consider yourself in personal danger - A. Yes. I sat on the steps; I heard him within breaking the things, both in my room, and in my mother's room. I went for the watchman; I could not find the watchman on the beat. I then went to the watchman, Hale; I desired him to come and take him out of the place until he was sober. Hale came with me to the house; when he came to the door, I spoke to the prisoner; I desired him to open the door; he would not. I saw my mother coming down the street, within two doors of me; I asked her to give me the key. She went to open the door herself; the watchman asked her to give him the key. The watchman took the key and opened the door, and as he was opening the door, Mr. Elliot unbolted the door. I did not see what took place. As soon as I entered the house I found the watchman was hurt directly; I helped him off with his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a hatchet in the house - A. Yes, when the watchman came back from the watchhouse; that hatchett belonged to Elliott.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. What is Elliott - A. He is a painter and glazier.</p>
               <p>Q. He came home at eight o'clock quite drunk - A. Yes. My neice and me went to bed in half an hour after him.</p>
               <p>Q. You put him no water at his bed-side - A. No, I had no time to get it.</p>
               <p>Q You could have got it before twelve o'clock - A. Yes, I could.</p>
               <p>Q. He was unfortunately gone down for the water when you unfortunately awoke - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman was at the door, your mother asked to come in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He opened the door to let your mother come in - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the door was opened, the first person that presented himself, was the watchman; he expected to see your mother; he saw a man he had no motion of before. The axe was his own; whether he had struck with it or no, you cannot tell - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Before the watchman opened the door, did you hear Elliott say any thing - A. When I tried to open the door, the door was bolted; I said, Elliott, let me in; he said, no; b - y b - r should come in that night. I asked the watchman to open the door; I told the watchman I would give him the key, provided he would upon his word, return me the key. The watchman opened the door; I did not see what took place at the moment.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. George's. On the night of the 5th of this month, I was called by the prosecutrix. The patrol opened the door; on the door being unlocked by the patrol, I had heard Elliott say, the first person that entered the house, he would do him a mischief. I was the first person that entered; as I was entering the house with my lanthorn in my hand, Elliott struck me on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060038"></xptr>the arm at the elbow with the axe, just against the socket the bone is cut asunder. He cut the bone three inches over. He struck at me after that, missed me, and hit the patrol. I was taken to the surgeon directly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. He had not known it was you, who you was, and what you came for - A. When I came to the door the prisoner was looking out of the window; at that time the patrol was along with me. I told him what came for. The young woman that fetched me was there then, and the mother came up at the time we were talking. The young woman wished me to break the door open; I told her we had no authority to break the door open. He was not breaking the things when I came up; he was looking out of the window; he had been breaking the things before.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was called a quarter before twelve by the watchman; I went with him, and saw Elliott at the window. We demanded admittance. I had my patrol's coat on; he had his watchman's coat on and his lanthorn. I told Elliott not to kick up a disturbance in the street at that time of the night, because it was what we did not suffer. I asked him to give the girl admittance; he would not; the girl desired me to break the door open. I told her I had no more right than the watchman without the cry of murder in the house. The mother came up just at that period of time; she gave the daughter the key to unlock the door; she could not get it open then. She gave it to the mother, and she could not get it open. I said, are you the landlady of the house; she said she rented the house; then I said, give me the key, I will endeavour to open the door, which she did, under promise of letting her have the key back again. I opened the door, and while I was unlocking the door the prisoner unbolted it. There was nobody but the prisoner in the house; then I saw the prisoner when he opened the door; he stood behind the door with something in his hand, which I then thought to be a stick; I afterwards found it to be a hatchet. I then said twice, come out, here is a second Williams, he has got a hatchet in his hand. The watchman went in, his lanthorn was first knocked out. I saw his arm, and his lanthorn was struck; his arm fell. He had a lanthorn in his hand. I was standing at the door. At first, I thought it was only a stick. I received a blow on my wrist, which took all the use of my hand away. I received that blow from Elliott: then I put my hand upon the shoulder of the watchman to get him out; he cut me twice upon the arm. When I saw the hatchet, I drew my cutlass; I said, if you rise that again I will run this through you. He then shut the door, and shut me out. I got assistance. The woman of the house opened the door again; then we went in, and took him up in the one pair of stairs room. After we had taken him down to the watch-house, I returned back with my partner for the hatchet; we found it in the house. This is the hatchet. Seagrove, the other patrol brought the hatchet out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did anybody strike him - A. Not before he struck the watchman and me, and then in our defence we hit him with our sticks.</p>

I went up stairs and sat close by the window.</p>

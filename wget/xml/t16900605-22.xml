               High-Treason Committed against our Most Gracious Sovereign Lord and Lady King William and Queen Mary, in having and holding Correspondence with the late King James, and Queen Mary, both in France and Ireland, endeavouring thereby to Depose our King and Queen of their Royal Crown and Dignity, and to Raise War and Rebellion in this our Kingdom of England, and a Miserable Slaughter, amongst their Majesties Subjects, to bring to pass and procure, against the Duty of his Allegiance, and against the form of the Statute in that Case made and provided, &amp;c.

               <p>The Tryal was long in hearing on both sides, and great Indulgence was extended towards him by the Court, as ever was shewed to any Man in the like Circumstance at that Bar; the Evidence was clear and positive against him, as to every point of the Charge of the Indictment, and he had all the Advantage of a fair Tryal, but yet notwithstanding he used several Evasions, (and Inforced,) by way of Extenuations, several frivolous Excuses, to perswade the Court that he was Innocent, which did not take on his side. So the Gentlemen of the Jury were Ordered to withdraw, which they did, for several Hours, and then their Keeper came down and acquainted the Court, that they could not agree upon a Verdict. Yet the Court was pleased to wait patiently upon them till it was late at Night, and then they were of the same Mind, so the Court Ordered them to be Lock'd up, without any manner of Sustenance, or Candle-Light, allowing them Gowns and Caps, and somewhat to Lie upon.</p>
               <p>On Saturday Morning the Court met again, but the Jury could not then Agree, One or Two of them making some particular Scruples, which were Resolved by the Court, although it was Twelve or One a Clock before they were United to Return a Verdict, and then they brought him in Guilty of High-Treason.</p>
               <p>After which Mr. Crone, the Prisoner, Prayed for an Arrest of Judgment, for that he had several Exceptions to make, desiring that Councel might be Assigned him to Argue to his Exceptions in Point of Law, in Case any Point arose.</p>
               <p>So he Prayed that Five Councel might be Assigned, to which the Court gave their Consent, and Ordered that a Court should be held for the same purpose, (and to put an end to the Prisoner's Scruples,) on Thursday the Twelth of this Instant June, by Seven of the Clock in the Morning, after which the full Tryal will be Printed at</p>

             thus depos'd. The Prisoner and 2 Women, one of whom he call'd his Wife and the other his Sister, came at Night to take a Lodging at my House in Shoreditch. I shoew'd the Room and they staid there together upon an hour and then he came down and would needs treat me with a Pot of Ale, and when we had empty'd it, he went up Stairs. When he had been gone a little while, I consider'd that my Drawers in his Room were unlock'd and so I went up to take care of my Cloths; I found him lying upon the Bed, but the 2 Women were gone and my Cloths too</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made his Defence. I came from Bramton Park and the Women pick'd me up we went into an Ale House where we saw the Prosecutor with whom the 2 Women fell into discourse so that I thought they had all 3 been acquainted. The Prosecutor told me she had a Lodging to let and not being willing to go out of Town that Night; I took it of her. She carried us up to see it, and pull'd out the Drawers and shew'd the Women her Cloths; Then I went down and with the Prosecutor, and the mean while it seem the Women rob'd her. I might indeed call one of them Wife, and the other Sister, but it was only in Jest, for they were Strangers to me <rs id="t17260711-68-verdict295" type="verdictDescription">

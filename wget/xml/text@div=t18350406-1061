On Saturday, the 28th of March, I was in master's shop—the prisoner was there—I saw her concealing something white under her apron—she went to the further end of the shop—I followed, and took a shirt out of her apron—it had hung in the shop, pinned with three pins—I detained her—the handkerchief had hung at the door—it was produced at the office—it belongs to my master, and is worth 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

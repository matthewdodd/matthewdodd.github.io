On the 7th of June a neighbour came and asked if we had lost anything - we inquired, and missed the prints; and soon after the officer came in with them, tied up in a handkerchief; I have every reason to believe they are mine, but there are no marks on them - there are four different patterns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it not a great thoroughfare? A. Yes, and particularly at that time; we have a passage about four feet from the window, and in that doorway they stood; the outer door was open - I missed them between eleven and twelve o'clock; we were shutting-up when the officer came.</p>

            . I live opposite the prosecutor. On the night in question, at near twelve o'clock, while the boys were putting up the shutters, I saw the two prisoners together; I took Williams for a person who was arraigned here last Session, but he is not; I saw them together from five to ten minutes - I watched them, and saw Williams go and look at something in the doorway, and while his hand was extended Downes took these prints, ran down Castle-street, and Williams after him - I pursued; I met Groom, and said, "I want your assistance - take that man (meaning Williams) into custody;" I went and took Downes with these prints; he had got them down, and was tying them up in this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see Williams do anything? A. No - he extended his arm, and Downes came and took them out; there was no third man, to my knowledge - there were plenty of people in the street; I swear that I was not reprimanded at Bow-street office for letting a third man go, nor was Groom, in my presence; we went before Sir Richard Birnie - I was on the opposite side of the street: I saw them together ten or twelve minutes - they were not in the passage two minutes: the street was not very much crowded - I did not give an alarm, or go into the shop. I believe there were three or four cases in which I was examined last Session which were acquitted- I do not know in how many cases the Jury desired I might not have my expenses; I had my expenses in two cases.</p>

            . I am an officer. Whittingham asked me to assist him; he ran down Castle-street, and took Downes, who was stooping down - he told me to lay hold of Williams, which I did; while Whittingham and Downes were struggling I saw some prints on the ground, which I took up - I did not see who they fell from; before Whittingham came to me I saw a man like Downes, about his size, carrying a bundle: but I lost sight of him: there were several persons crossing the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not this street very much crowded? A. Yes - I had only come up to Bear-street; the Magistrate said that the other man ought to have been taken as well, but I do not know that Whittingham heard it - he went to the gate part of the time; there was another man with Williams, and I took them both, but Whittingham said, "This is the man," and the other got off; he walked fast - he did not run.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might not the other man have been the party carrying the bundle? A. I should think he might be one of the party; Williams struggled a great deal, and Whittingham said, "Let the other man go - this is the man;" I told Sir Richard Birnie of the third man.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then Whittingham saw the third man? A. Yes.</p>

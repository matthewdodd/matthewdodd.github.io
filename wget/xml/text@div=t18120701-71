               <p>Q. On the 13th of June did you lose these articles - A. It might be before that. On the 13th, I found them on him. On the 11th of June, I missed a quantity of horse-hair. I sent him out: I found there was horse-hair concealed in one corner of the shop, under some packing mats and wrappers. I then sent him out, and called my nephew,

            , in to watch him. After the prisoner was gone out, I sent my nephew to go to this hair and see if any of it was gone. He told me, there was a quarter of the horse-hair gone; about three pound was gone. He came back again. I sent him out again, and gave my nephew instructions to watch if any thing was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time, did you miss any thing but horse-hair - A. Yes, there were other things missed. When the prisoner was out, my nephew looked; he found there was more horse-hair gone. The prisoner came back. I sent him out a third time. My nephew then found more hair was missing. I then applied to Bow-street office for a constable. The constable came, and some horse-hair was found on his person, about two pound, or from that to three pound. When the horse-hair was taken from his person, he went and searched the prisoner's premises. In the front attic we found his bed there, and his daughter in bed; there was some horse-hair in one of the sides of the fire-place. I found a hearth-brush, I believe to be mine. In a large deal box there was a quantity of printed furniture, different patterns, and various pieces. I knew them to be mine, from the patterns. I had missed articles of them patterns from my shop. The curtain pins, which I have here, there had been on them a private mark when they were taken from me. In the box with the furniture, I found the curtain pins. He had rubbed the marks off. They were such curtain pins as I had lost. I value the whole of the articles that I lost, at four pounds, fourteen shillings. The prisoner was present; he said, he hoped I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. They were not all taken at one time;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010056"></xptr> one at one time, and another at another time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to his character.</p>

            . On the 11th of this month I had been at Kentish-town about some business, and in returning towards London, about one o'clock, in the first field from <placeName id="t17700425-40-crimeloc250">Kentish-town</placeName>

They met me; one or more seized me; they tore my hat; I held it fast; then they went behind me and took my cloak. I said, You had better give me my cloak. Then Catharine Goodwin turned again, and with her double fist knocked me down, and cursed me, and said something very vile, but I can't remember the words. I saw one of the other three with my cloak at that time. (She produced her gown very dirty by the fall.) When I got up, I saw a poor-looking man; I told him what they had done, and told him which way they were gone; and desired he would pursue them: they were in the very next field. Soon after came another man: I told him of it. Another man was coming; he heard me tell him. They both pursued. When the prisoners saw themselves pursued, they left the cloak upon the ground. The young man took it up, and brought it to me. The two men were quite strangers to me. They took all the four prisoners at Kentish-town. When they saw me, she that knocked me down, said, Well, I am ready to answer it, if she (meaning me), would swear it. I am very clear the four girls are the four persons that took my cloak: they were carried before the justice that afternoon.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Pancras parish. About one o'clock that day, two young men came to me, and said, a young woman had been knocked down and robbed of her cardinal; and they are gone towards the fields. I was in my own house in Kentish-town. I pursued them the way that goes towards the Foundling-hospital, and overtook them in a field in the common path that goes to London. The prosecutrix had followed them back from Kentish-town towards London.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see them first?</p>
               <p>Balanger. I first saw them about half a quarter of a mile from the first field that goes from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250033"></xptr> Kentish-town towards London. Two of them were running, and two of them walking. When I spoke to them, they made use of two or three oaths. When I stopped them, they seemed rusty, and would not go with me. I said, if they would not go quietly, I should use such means they would not like. I carried them back to Kentish-town to the boarding-school, and asked, who was the gentlewoman that was robbed? The prosecutrix turned round. I said, Do you know these girls? She said, They are the girls that robbed me; then she had the cardinal with her. I asked the man that took up the cloak, Did you see these girls do the robbery? He said, Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoners say any thing to that?</p>
               <p>Balanger. They did not acknowledge it. One said, She knew nothing of it. Another said the same. Goodwin said to one of the other, You b - h, don't you turn pastry-cook *.</p>
               <p>* The cant word, Not to puff.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I returned again from the two men that went after the prisoners, to Kentish-town. The two men had seized them, and brought them back to me. The two men thought it would cause trouble, and they left me; then the prisoners walked towards London.</p>
               <p>Balanger. They were going towards London when I took them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Most of the people were for my letting them go: and some said, if I did not prosecute them, they would me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after they took your cloak was it that they were taken?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It was not a quarter of an hour.</p>

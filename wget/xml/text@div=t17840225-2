               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, you are first to judge whether this house was broke open in the night time, which is necessary to constitute a burglary, the woman went to bed at a quarter after eight, that is the night certainly; and the property is found at Kensington Gravel-pits, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, therefore these things must have been taken away in the intermediate time, now you are to judge at this season of the year, whether it was in the night; the distance is near ten miles.</p>

On 26th Sept., about half-past 8 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in New Bridge-street with this bundle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under his arm—I asked him what he had got in it—he said, "Nothing but some dirty towels, which I am going to take home to be washed"—I said, "Are you sure you have nothing else?"—he said, "No, nothing else"—I told him to let me look—I untied the bundle, and in it found these two books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him whose they were, and how he accounted for the possession of them—he said, "They belong to our firm"—I said, "Where do you work?"—he said, "Messrs. Whit<lb></lb>taker's "—I took him to the station in Fleet-street—the clerk read the charge over to him and said, "What have you to say to that?"—he said, "I took them home to read."</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William Hood and Sons, trading under the name Whittaker and Co., in Ave Maria-lane—the prisoner was their porter—on the day before this we received twenty-five copies of "Harvey's Sporting Adventures"—they were copies similar to these.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Whittaker and Co.—on the morning on which the prisoner was apprehended, I examined the stock of "Har<lb></lb>vey's Sporting Adventures," and found twenty-three copies—one copy was missing and one had been sold—these are similar to what we had—the prisoner was in the employment—he had no right to take these books oat without giving a signature for them, or speaking to the clerk, who would have entered them, a book being kept for that purpose—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—here is no entry of them—there are four clerks—he never mentioned it to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might he have taken them if they were put down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might have been an objection, not suspecting that a porter would require them for his own reading—if he mentioned it to the master, he would be told to go and sign for them—there is a notice posted up that no servant is entitled to take books without signing for them, and on breaking those rules he is subject to instant dismissal—he has been nearly seven years in the employment.</p>

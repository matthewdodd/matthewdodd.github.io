                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Edward Lees, of Pitfield-street, Hoxton, he is a cheesemonger. On the 1lth of Janu<lb></lb>ary we had twenty firkins of butter standing off the curb—the corner one was taken from the others—a pork butcher's lad ran over and gave us in<lb></lb>formation—we ran out, and were directed down the opposite street—I and ray master ran into Charles-street, and saw a man at the other end of it with a tub of butter on his shoulder—I hallooed, "Stop thief!" and almost directly heard him throw it down—while he was in the act of throwing it down' my master came up to the butter, and stood by it while I pursued the thief—I cried "Stop thief!" all the way, and had him taken in Bruns<lb></lb>wick-place, where he was stopped and taken into custody—he was out of my sight for half a minute, while he turned the corner—I thoroughly be<lb></lb>lieve him to be the man who had the butter—I saw no other person—I merely lost sight of him while he turned the corner, for half a minute.</p>

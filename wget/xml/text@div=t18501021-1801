                  </hi>. I carry on chemical works at Mill-wall. I have one partner—the prisoner was our foreman since the beginning of the year—he had no authority to sell anything—he was desirous to sell, but was forbidden to do so, on his own account or ours—he was to superintend the works—I do not know Mr. Trott, nor Mr. Tarras—he has never accounted to me for any money received from them, or for any sulphate of ammonia sold to them—we had sulphate of ammonia on our premises in April.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring chemist, in the employ of Mr. Trott; I live at Lee-place, Old Ford. I saw the prisoner in April at the prosecutor's premises—I asked him if he would sell sulphate of ammonia in small quantities—I said I was a poor man, and would pay for it by instal<lb></lb>ments—he said he could not say anything about it till he had seen his master—I called again about a week afterwards, and he said his master would not have anything to do with it, and if he sold it he must be responsible for the money—he agreed for me to have half a ton, and he sent me half a ton in—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman. I was employed about April or May to take half a ton of sulphate of ammonia from the prosecutor's premises to Lee-place—I delivered it to Farrant by the prisoner's direction—he pointed out to me what I was to take.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother—we are leather-factors, in Seething-lane—we formerly carried on business as tanners in Bermondsey—a quantity of tails and hair were removed from Ber<lb></lb>mondsey to Leadenhall-street and from thence to Seething-lane—I let a warehouse where some of this hair and tails were on the 6th of Jan., and my foreman gave orders to have it cleared out—the prisoners have been in my service for fourteen years—none of these things were allowed to them as per<lb></lb>quisites—I did not allow them, on the 8th of Jan., to take any of these tails—the hair produced corresponds with the rest that I have—these are the tails of hides, cut off in a dry state.</p>

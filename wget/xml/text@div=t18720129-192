                  </hi>. I am a jeweller, in Bishopsgate Street—on a Satur<lb></lb>day evening, about 7.15, the prisoner came into my shop, and asked to look at some brooches and earrings—he selected about six sets, to the value of 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave the name of Sir Charles Cavendish, and desired the</p>

               <p>things to be sent to the Cannon Street Hotel—he mentioned a Mrs. Gains<lb></lb>boro, as a customer of mine; I did not know the name—he gave a glow<lb></lb>ing description of the lady, and said he wanted to make her a present of a brooch and pair of earrings, and he wished them sent to the Cannon Street Hotel for her inspection—he wished to look at another set rather more expensive—I went to the end of the counter, and directed my assistant to get it out—I turned round sharply, and saw the prisoner appear to put something in his pocket—I looked on the counter, and instantly missed a set, value 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I kept him in conversation for some time, hoping every minute to see a policeman pass; then he got up, saying they must be sent on in half an hour, by that time he would have dined—I went round to the door, and shut the door, and said "You can't go," and I accused him of robbing me—he said he had done nothing of the kind—I saw a police-man pass, and I called him in, and he searched him—whilst he was doing so, the prisoner shuffled about a great deal in the shop, and I saw the brooch and earrings at his feet—he was standing in the same position then as he was before, in front of the counter.</p>

I was called in to take the pri<lb></lb>soner into custody—I searched his coat pockets—he was very restless, I could not keep him still—I told him to keep still, I was not going to hurt him, and all of a sudden I saw this morocco case lying down against his feet—I said to Mr. Gabriel, "There is the case, pick it up"—he did so, and gave it to me—I searched the prisoner at the station, and found on him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers, the tops of two old metal spoons, a smelling-bottle, and snuff-box—I asked his name and address—he said he could not give it me, it would disgrace his family—on the Sunday morning he gave an address for me to go to his sister, which was false.</p>

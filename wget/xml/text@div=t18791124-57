                  </hi>. I am a saleswoman to Mr. Blackrock at 252, Totten<lb></lb>ham Court Road, and I sleep in the bouse, and other persons sleep there—I take my meals there—on 23rd October, between 2 and 3 a.m., I was aroused by a constable ringing the bell, and from what he said I went outside and found one of the shop windows broken, and I missed two sewing machines—a man could get through it, but could not get inside the shop without breaking some glass doors which were bolted inside—the machines which were taken were in the window between the glass door and the window—I last saw them safe at 8 p.m. on the 22nd, when I closed the shop—this machine (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my employer's property—it is worth four guineas retail—I remember securing the window, and saw it safe.</p>

At 2.40 am. on 23rd October I was called to Mr. Black rock's premises, and found a large pane of glass broken; a man could get through—I saw the prisoner at the station, and when I charged him with the burglary he said "I did not do it"—Soho Square is two or three minutes' walk from Blackrook's—there are no shutters to the shop windows, and the gas is left burning at night, and people could see through.</p>

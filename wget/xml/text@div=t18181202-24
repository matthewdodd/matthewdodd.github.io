               <p>Q. What passed between you and the prisoner - A. The first that I said to him, was, that I had agreed with Dye to take one at 7 s. 6 d. He said very well. I gave him 7 s. 6 d. He then told me to meet him at Blackfriars-bridge, at three o'clock - we separated. I met him at three o'clock on the middle of Blackfriars-bridge - on the right hand side going from the City.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed - A. He said I could not have it till five o'clock, and to meet him under the dead wall of Waterloo-bridge. I went there at five o'clock - he came about half-past five - he put a note towards me, and said, catch hold - I took it. He then asked if I should want any more that night. I said No, but I would take five 1 l. notes, on Monday, and I would be at the Coach and Horses about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020014"></xptr>ten or eleven o'clock on Monday. We parted. I went home, and opened the parcel which he gave me, it contained a 1 l. bank note. I marked it that night, and took it to Sellers next morning. He and I went to the Bank to Mr. Rooker on Monday, and I believe Sellers gave it to him (looks at one), this is it.</p>
               <p>Q. You was to meet him on Monday; before you met him was any more money given you - A. Yes. Sellers gave me 1 l. 15 s., about an hour before I met him, to purchase five 1 l. forged notes of Williams - I had been informed that if I took five, I could have them at 7 s. each. I went to the Coach and Horses - in about half an hour Dye came in - I gave him the money which I had received of Sellers - about ten minutes after I saw the prisoner there. He and Dye went out of the taproom together, and I followed them - Dye said to the prisoner, he wants five 1 l. notes, (meaning me) - that it was all right, and he had got the money. The prisoner then told me to go on Waterloo-bridge, and he would follow me. I went out and saw the prisoner almost directly as I got into Drury-lane. We walked a little way together, and then he stopped talking to somebody. I went on into the Strand - he then overtook me, and we went over Waterloo-bridge together - we went to a public-house, called the Hero of Waterloo. He said I had better wait there while he fetched them, and he should be gone about half an hour - he did not go into the house with me. I went in and waited about half an hour, and he returned - I was sitting in the taproom, having a pint of beer. He sat down a few minutes, and then asked if I would walk - I said Yes - we walked into the Waterloo-road. He then asked when I should want any more. I said I would take ten 1 l. notes on Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any reason for it - A. I told him I was going to Kingston on Friday, where I thought I could pass them; he them told me to meet him at the Green Man, Kent-street, Borough, at nine o'clock on Thursday morning, and he would have them there. He then put five 1 l. notes into my hand - we were then in the Waterloo road; we parted. I took the notes to the Woolpack, in Gravel-lane, to Mr. Freeman, the bank inspector. I had appointed to meet him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mark the five 1 l. notes - A. Yes, in about twenty minutes after I had them (looks at five), these are them; this was on the 9th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. You was to meet him at nine o'clock in the morning on Thursday the 12th, did you receive any money from anybody - A. Yes; on Thursday morning Sellers gave me 2 l. 10 s. in silver, and a 1 l. note, to buy ten forged 1 l. notes of the prisoner. I had told him that I had agreed to meet the prisoner. At nine o'clock on Thursday morning, I went to the Green Man, into the tap-room.</p>

            , the son of the constable; in a few minutes the prisoner came in and sat down by me - Coates was almost facing us; the prisoner asked me if I had got the money, he spoke in a very low voice. I said, Yes. He said he wanted it. I gave him the 1 l. note first, and the 50 s. afterwards - he put it into his pocket without counting it; he then said I could not have them until six o'clock at night, in Monument-yard. I said very well. He went away directly. I went and told the three constables.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Monument-yard that evening - A. Yes, about five minutes before six, the prisoner came to me as the clock struck; he spoke first, and said come on, and asked if I had any one with me? I said, No, not a soul. He then asked when I should want any more? I said I should want five on the Monday. We walked out of Monument-yard, up Pudding-lane, through George-lane, into Botolph-lane, he there put ten 1 l. notes into my hand, and wished me a good night - we parted; he ran up towards Little Eastcheap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you then see anybody - A. Yes, I met Sellers and Furzeman, just at the corner of George-lane - I had not then received the notes a minute - the constables pursued the prisoner. I went immediately to the Bank, and marked the notes at the solicitor's office there, in the presence of Mr. Jeffries, who is one of the clerks (looks at ten), these are the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Nobody was present that knew anything of it but you - A. Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been a witness before in a case of this kind - A. Never in my life, not in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been a witness before in any case of this kind - A. I have twice, and not more; it was against Edwards and a woman who lived with him; they are not tried.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you a witness before the justice against Cashman - A. No, I had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you left off calico printing - A. About seven months; I have been a porter in Thames-street, and worked in different calico grounds. I was in the coal trade about three months ago; I worked for my cousin, who was master, and had a shop in Northampton-street, Clerkenwell; he also carried on business in Gravel-lane - nowhere else that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he never carried on business elsewhere, and you with him - A. I think I can; not in the coal trade; he was once a lawyer's clerk, in the Temple.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any warrants out against you for poaching - A. Not that I know. I live at No. 17, Pitt's-place, Maid-lane, Bankside, and have lived there nearly three months.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you taken up this trade that you are in to day - A. The 28th of October was the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. During that time, you have only met the prisoner, and Edwards and his wife - A. There was another man, named Strandley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anybody present, the first time you met the prisoner - A. Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time were any present - A. Only two I believe - I did not know them, but I heard them call the prisoner by name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Coates hear what passed at the Green Man - A. He was in one corner of the room, and we in another. When the prisoner came in, I said,</p>
               <p>"How are you, my bonny." I do not think he could hear anything else.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Did the two persons at the public-house appear to know the prisoner - A. Yes - they spoke to him, and called him by his name.</p>

            . I am a constable. I know Underwood; in consequence of directions, he was employed on the 12th of November to go to the prisoner. I went with Sellers and Coates to Monument-yard, at six o'clock in the evening. As the clock struck I saw the prisoner and Underwood come out of Monument-yard into Pudding-lane, followed them into George-lane, but lost sight of them as they turned into Botolph-lane; in about a minute I saw Underwood again, and pursued after the prisoner, but lost him. I found him at the Coach and Horse, about seven o'clock.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were all three of you there - A. Yes; Underwood was employed by the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Who introduced him to the Bank - A. Sellers and I.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to select him - A. Sellers selected him, I knew nothing of him before.</p>

            . I am constable of Marylebone. I was in Monument-yard on the 12th of November, with the two last witnesses, and saw Underwood go into Monument-yard - it was a dark night - I did not see the prisoner. I was in a grocer's shop, to watch the prisoner into the yard, but did not see him. I afterwards took him at the Coach and Horses.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at 167, High Holborn. About the latter end of September the prisoner bought a pair of shoes at my shop, which came to about 8 s. 6 d.; he paid me a 1 l. note; I asked his name and address, he gave me</p>

            . I am an inspector of bank notes, and have been so upwards of twenty-five years. I am enabled to judge of the character of notes (looks at the note set forth in the indictment, uttered with others on the 12th), it is forged in every respect, paper, plate, and signature; it is not C. Tabor's signature, nor is it signed by any person authorized to sign bank notes; the other nine uttered at the same time, are all forged, and of the same description, struck from the same plate, and filled up alike - they are the same manufacture throughout (looks at five sold to Underwood on the 9th of November), they are all forged, and the same in every respect. (Looks at the one sold on the 7th) It is forged, and of the same description and plate as the others. The one uttered to Mr. Chalmers is also forged, and of the same description as the other sixteen in every respect; I mean they are the same plate and paper, and signed by the same person, but not the same signature.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. Used you to be longer at first in examining notes than now - A. It certainly wants experience. I was never mistaken in a note.</p>
               <p>(The note was then put in and read. See Indictment.)</p>
               <p>MR. GLOVER re-examined. The water-mark in bank notes is made at the time the paper is made, but this note has a representation of a water-mark, which is made afterwards by pressure. In a genuine note the line containing the date, and the word London, is printed in stereotype,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020016"></xptr>and in a different ink, in these notes it is engraved in the plate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my case to my counsel.</p>

I am positive to the prisoner's identity; he came to my shop on Thursday, the 9th of August, between one and three o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for a polishing iron and a beating hammer, for a person resident in Bell-yard, a bookbinder; he mentioned the same, but I do not recollect it. I asked him what weight he wished the hammer to be, as they varied from eight to sixteen pounds - he said he did not know. I told him to return to his master and enquire. In about twenty minutes he returned, and said it might be about ten pounds. I said, the hammer was ready all but facing, and if he would call in half an hour, it should be ready; he said he would take the polishing iron, and call in half an hour for the hammer, he said he would pay for both the articles, and tendered me apparently, a 5 l. Bank note - the things came to 11 s. Not having change, I marked the note with my initials, in his presence, and sent the boy with it to Mr. Barratt, my neighbour - he brought back four sovereigns, and 20 s. in silver. I gave the prisoner the change, 4 l. 9 s., he went away, and never returned for the hammer - nobody ever came for it (looks at a note) this is the note. I put my initials on it immediately - I had no other note in my hand. I saw no more of him till the Saturday following, when he was in custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You recollect that it was Thursday - A. Yes; I generally dine about two o'clock. I think he came before two o'clock, but cannot be certain of the time. I am positive he is the boy. I do not remember seeing him before. When I saw him on the Saturday, he was at Guildhall, at the bar, that place distinguished him from other persons. I am almost positive that I did not speak to any body before the Magistrate asked me if he was the person. Close was not examined in my presence, he was a stranger to me. I had not spoken to him about having taken a forged note.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that - A. I cannot say positively; I never told any body that I was uncertain about who gave me the note. I told the Magistrate immediately that he was the person. I invariably put my initials on all my notes, and in the same place. I had no other 5 l. note in the house that day, nor had I passed any between that and Saturday.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. How long was he with you the first time - A. Very few minutes. I had the conversation with him myself; he came twice, and promised to come again for the hammer. On my oath, I have not the slightest doubt of his being the person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You mark all notes with your initials, how can you distinguish this from any other that passed through your hands - A. I sent it to my neighbour, who returned it, saying, he presumed it to be forged. I kept it in my possession separate from any other, being informed he was in custody. I sent my neighbour no other note that day. I kept it till I delivered it to Mr. Lees.</p>

            . I am a tea-dealer, and live in Fetter-lane. On the 9th of August, Timbury's boy brought me a 5 l. note; I marked it in his presence. (looks at one) this is it. I put my initials on it, and Timbury's name; I gave change, and put it in my cash-box. I took it out next morning, and knew it to be the same from the marks - I took it back to Timbury next morning. I was induced to examine this note, from Mr. Stevens, my next door neighbour having shewn me one - Close shewed me none on that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you many when this was brought to you - A. Not many. I am almost positive that I had no other 5 l. note. I will not positively swear it. I often change notes for Timbury and other neighbours, and endorse them generally - I always endorse 5 l. notes.</p>
               <p>MR. REYNOLDS. Q. Did you change any other 5 l. note for Timbury that day - A. No, nor the day before. I think I had no other 5 l. note in the box. I had no other with Timbury's name I am positive. I wrote his name in the boy's presence.</p>

            . I live in Castle-street, Long-acre. I am in the service of Mr. Hough, a gold-beater, in Fetter-lane. On the 9th of August, the prisoner came to the shop for 200 leaves of gold, which came to 12 s. - I tied it up; he produced a 5 l. note. I asked him who it was for, he said, for Mr. Rowley, a book-binder, St. Andrew's-hill, Doctor's Commons. I told him I had no change, and my master was from home, but I would see if I could get it of a neighbour. I called our lad into the shop, to remain with the prisoner while I went to Mr. Stevens's, a cheesemonger, within three doors of my master's, and shewed him the note; he said he was doubtful whether it was not a bad one; he carried it to Mr. Barratt, to look at it - this was between two and three o'clock; he returned in a minute or two and gave me back the note. I returned and told the prisoner, I thought it was not a good note. I gave it to him, and said I would put on my coat and go to his master's with him, to explain it. I went with him to St. Andrew's-hill; he stopped at a door, with the name Wakeling and Penny on it; he then hesitated, and stopped opposite, as if he was going in. I was proceeding to ring the bell, when he said, he was not sent from there, he was to bring it there; that a person met him at the corner, and told him to fetch it and bring it there. I put him against the wall, told him I was convinced he was a bad boy, and I insisted on his stopping with me - I rang the bell, and asked for Mr. Wakeling. Mr. Penny came down stairs; I asked if he knew the prisoner, (I made him go in) he said, No; nor had he sent him. I asked the prisoner for the note, he felt in his pockets, could not find it, and said he had lost it. I related the circumstance to Mr. Penny, and asked if he knew Rowley - he said there was a person of that name who lived in Wardrobe-place, Blackfriars-churchyard. I took the prisoner there - he is a bookbinder; Mr. Rowley said he had no knowledge of the prisoner, and had not sent him for the gold, and that a 5 l. note had been passed in his name at Mr. Warwick's, a gold-beater, in Fetter-lane, who had called on him about it. Rowley accompanied me with the prisoner to Mr. Warwick, they knew nothing of him there. I then gave him in charge to Kinsley, who searched him, and found no note on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. What time was this - A. Nearer three than two o'clock.</p>

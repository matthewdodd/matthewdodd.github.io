R. on it, as the name of the person who served us with beech; I ran to the shop and asked whether any had been sold; I found there had not, I ran back, and before I got to the place where it stood I saw the prisoner take it on his shoulder; I asked him where he was going with it; he said he was going to take it home, and he found it in the street; I asked him where; he said in a street by Mount Pleasant; I am positive it was our plank, because we had several out of the same tree, and it is an inch and quarter plank, which we gave a particular order for, and I rather suppose there is no such thing in London beside.</p>

            , on the 4th of July. I saw the body between six and seven o'clock in the evening; the wound was about an inch broad; it was on the left side below the arm, about four inches. I passed my finger into the external wound, and passing it a little downwards about an inch, I found a wound penetrating into the cavity of the breast. I proceeded immediately to open the breast; when I had raised the breast-bone, I put my finger in the inside, and conveying it under the left side of the lungs, I felt a passage into the pericardium and the purse which contains the heart; then passing my finger upon the surface of the heart, I found a slit in the heart. I then carefully introduced my finger, so that my own knife should not touch the heart at all; I opened the wound in the pericardium; then I passed my left hand under the heart, raised it into view, and put my fore finger into the wound, which I found penetrated into the left ventricle of the heart.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that wound was the occasion of her death?</p>
               <p>Barton. Undoubtedly it was.</p>
               <p>Q. With what instrument do you apprehend this wound was given?</p>
               <p>Barton. I was shewn a knife, which they said he did it with (a common case knife produced.) This is the knife that was shewn me.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you judge by the orifice of the wound, whether it was made with a blunt instrument, which you see this is, or by a pointed instrument?</p>
               <p>Barton. I imagine from the wound that it was not given by a very sharp instrument; the wound answers to the size of that knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing this knife had been thrown with great violence, could it have made so deep an impression as that was?</p>
               <p>Bar ton. That is matter of opinion: I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing the woman had been naked, and he had thrown a knife of this sort, it would have made such a wound; would it not?</p>
               <p>Barton. I think not; it is a matter of opinion, not evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again, upon due deliberation and consideration, whether, if a man had thrown this knife with violence, directed as an arrow or a dart, whether it would not make such a wound, if thrown with extreme violence?</p>
               <p>Barton. It is impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110054"></xptr>Q. Don't you think a man might throw a knife with such a degree of force and violence, that might stab her as well as if he had took it in his hand?</p>
               <p>Barton. I can't doubt of the possibility of a knife penetrating by a throw.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you can't take upon you to say, whether this wound was occasioned by a stab, or by throwing at the deceased?</p>
               <p>Barton. The idea struck me then, and does still, that it was occasioned by a stab.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me your reasons why you think this wound was occasioned by a stab, and not a throw.</p>
               <p>Barton. The external wound was rather oblique than transverse. I rather think the wound was given by a stab, and not by throwing the knife. The wound went down near an inch, and then through between the fifth and sixth ribs, rather turned upwards; taking that into the whole complex idea: I am of that opinion.</p>

            . I live opposite to the apartments of the deceased. On Tuesday the third of July, about six in the morning, I heard a knocking by the prisoner at a neighbour's door opposite to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is your house to the prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Maidly. About the distance of one end of the court from the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise before this?</p>
               <p>Maidly. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If there had been any noise, should you not have heard it?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Yes, if there had been any noise in the prisoner's room, I must have heard it; I was up before five.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you hear the prisoner say at your neighbour's door?</p>
               <p>Maidly. The words, to the best of my knowledge, were. For God's sake! for Christ's sake! get up, come directly, for I have (he said) killed, murdered, or stabbed, I don't know which word he made use of, my wife. When I heard these expressions I looked out at the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect particularly which word he made use of?</p>
               <p>Maidly. It was one of the words, but I can't say which. Upon that I looked out of the window, and his back was towards me; when he turned back to go to his apartment, I saw his hands were all besmeared with blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your apartment?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Mine was up one pair of stairs, directly opposite the prisoner's; his was the ground floor. I spoke to him out of my window, and said, For God's sake, what have you done? he made answer, that he went to throw a knife at the dog, and it stabbed his wife. As he opened his door to go in, I saw her lay upon her back, inclining to the right side.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you went down to see her?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Almost immediately; her eyes were closed, and she smote upon her breast with her right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appear capable of speech?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I thought there were the pangs of death upon her; I told him so. I asked him what the wound had been given with; he went directly to the window, and took a white table-knife which was all over blood; he said, it was with that, as he was throwing at the dog: this was a little after six o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know any thing of this woman?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I knew her by sight, but I never spoke to either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What business does the prisoner follow?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I can't tell. The prisoner has lived there two or three months, I believe; I have lived there two or three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard any quarrels in the house between them?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of what sort?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Swearing and cursing, and such like language.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what this dog is that he spoke of?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I know he had a dog; I did not see it that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What does the prisoner's apartments consist of? this was a lower floor, you say?</p>
               <p>Maidly. They had only one floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman dressed or undressed?</p>
               <p>Maidly. She lay by the fire almost, with a gown and petticoat on, without a cap.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any stays on?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I don't believe she ever wore any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her gown loose or pinned?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Her bosom was exposed, quite indecent.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did these people generally get up?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I don't know that I had seen the prisoner ten times before this morning; I am told he is a watchman. I am out all the morning, and am not at home till the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110055"></xptr>Maidly. I clean shoes in St. Paul's church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. You was up two hours before you went to the prisoner's apartments, I think, and had heard no quarrel nor noise?</p>
               <p>Maidly. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose if the prisoner had had a mind to have made his escape, he could have done it?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not hear any shrieks or outcry in his room?</p>
               <p>Maidly. No; she had no shoes, stockings, cap, or handkerchief on; she was naked as low as her navel: it looked to me that he had dragged her from the bedstead by her hair to where she lay.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did she lay from the bedstead?</p>
               <p>Maidly. She lay by the door; the bedstead stands on one side; her head lay from the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason had you to think she was dragged from the bed?</p>
               <p>Maidly. Because the blood lay all in streaks from the bedstead to the place where she lay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did there appear that smear of blood; when you first went in?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I did not take particular notice of it at first, I was surprised; I only stood upon the threshold of the door. When I went into the room the neighbours had put her upon the bedstead: they asked me if I had any drops; I said, It don't signify giving her drops, the pangs of death are upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know in what manner she was moved to the bedstead by the neighbours?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I don't know; the neighbours here can tell. The blood was on the different side the bedstead from what she lay.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you suppose he dragged her by?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I suppose he dragged her by the hair, because her hair was all loose, in a distracted form; it seemed so to me, though I would not pretend to swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a drunken or a sober woman?</p>
               <p>Maidly. I believe she was not burthened with sobriety; I have seen her often in liquor; I have seldom seen her otherwise.</p>
               <p>

            . I lodge in the same house with Maidly, I live on the ground floor. About six o'clock on the fourth of July, I heard the prisoner crying out to the next door neighbours, that he had killed his wife, instead of the dog; and begged them, for God's sake, to get up. He keeps a little black dog that used to go out with him when he went out to watch. I put my under-petticoat and shoes on, and went to see what was the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there first?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. No; Maidly was there before me. She seemed as if she had been dragged out of bed, and pulled round to the other side of the bed, and she laid across the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think so?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. There was a great quantity of blood all round the bed to the door. I asked the prisoner how it happened; he said, he took the white-handled knife off the table to kill the dog; that he threw it at him, and it stuck into his wife. I saw a great quantity of blood upon the floor, and at the bed's-post at the foot of the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention the reason why he threw the knife at the dog?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. No. Seeing the poor woman lying in that condition, I said, For God's sake, go for a surgeon. He ran out of doors for a surgeon; in a very few minutes after he was gone, she expired. The people said, we should secure him. We sent a man after him, who brought him back again: before he could get up the place, they took him away.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been gone to fetch a surgeon, before the man followed him?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I believe, about five minutes; because, as soon as we lifted her up upon the bed, we found she was gone. I gave the knife to the constable. The surgeon did not come till ten or eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased and the prisoner go to their lodging over night?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Yes; and they were both very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any quarrel between them?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they quarrel often?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I have seen her have very bad bruises in her face; and now she was very much bruised, setting aside this affair. She had a great bruise upon the side of her temple, and another great bruise on the side of her breast.</p>
               <p>Q. How old might she be?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I believe upwards of forty.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any children by her?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I don't know; this was not his wife: he has a wife and children.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether she ever knew us quarrel with our neighbours?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110056"></xptr>Prisoner. She might hear a few words between ourselves; we used both of us to drink for a day or two, when we had money.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard them quarrel?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. I have seen her have very bruised faces; her fingers were hurt, as if they had been chopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bruise fresh you discovered?</p>

               <p>Wheeler. Yes, I think the bruise on her temple was; and she had a notch on the back of her fingers, that looked as if it was just done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, the last witness said, he thought my wife had been dragged by her hair. I cut her hair off a few days before. I don't believe she had any hair an inch long.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this? how was her hair?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. She had hair as far as I saw.</p>

            . I lodge in the same house with the prisoner; I lodge in the two pair of stairs. The first I heard was, the prisoner came out, and said, that in throwing a knife at his dog, he had stabbed his wife. I was up; I went down stairs; she lay close to the door: It seemed to me by the blood, as if she had been dragged from the bed to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she dressed?</p>
               <p>Holden. She had two petticoats, a gown, and a shift on. I was the first person that went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the wound?</p>
               <p>Wheeler. Just under the left arm, near the breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any hole through the gown and shift?</p>
               <p>Holden. Yes, I observed there was, when I stript her to lay her out.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the gown and shift here?</p>
               <p>Holden. Yes: I washed the blood off, and then we laid her on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry her to that side of the bed where the blood was, or the other?</p>
               <p>Holden. The opposite side. ( The gown and shift produced, very bloody, with a hole in both, under the left arm.)</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you in what posture she was when the wound was given?</p>
               <p>Holden. He was not in the room then: before that he asked me to wash her, to see where the wound was. I did not think it was so dangerous then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe whether her hair was short or no?</p>
               <p>Holden. It was a middling length, about two or three inches long.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her hair long enough for her to be dragged by it?</p>
               <p>Holden. I don't think she was dragged by her hair.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she lay?</p>
               <p>Holden. Upon her back, with her arms and legs stretched out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her heels bloody?</p>
               <p>Holden. Yes.</p>

            . I lodged two doors from the prisoner. I heard the prisoner knock at a neighbour's door, and said, For God's sake, neighbour, get up, for I have thrown a knife at my dog, and I am afraid I have killed my wife. I got up directly, and went to his room;

            . I heard a great noise of somebody calling to a neighbour to arise. It being an usual thing to have a great many words in that place, I did not look out immediately. When I looked out, I saw the prisoner stand by the window, with his hands all over blood. I went to his room; the woman lay upon the floor. I saw a great quantity of blood lie on the other side of the bed. I asked the prisoner how he came by the knife; he told me it lay upon the table. He said, he called her up to get him some breakfast; that the dog growled, and he could get no rest; so he threw the knife at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the table stand, that he said he took the knife from?</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. By the bed-side.</p>

               <p>I have lived with this woman about a year and a half, always vastly united; we never spent 2 d. out of each others company, and I believe we have been about three months in this neighbourhood; two days before we had been to dinner at one Mr. Stanley's a barber, who lived within about 40 or 50 yards of us, a man I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110057"></xptr> knew when I was at the Isle of Minorca; I was 30 years in the Royal Regiment of Artillery; this unlucky accident happened on Tuesday morning; my wife had been on Sunday for a pail of water; Stanley bid her tell me if I would come he would treat me with a pint of beer; I told him I should go the next day to the office to receive a month's pension-money; I ask'd him to lend me a shilling and I would pay him when I came back; he lent me a shilling; I had a breast of lamb, and his wife a cabbage, and we boiled them together for dinner; we spent all that afternoon with him; we went home and went to bed without a word of any malice: the next day which was Monday I went to the office to take my pension; I told Mr. Stanley that I would bring a piece of pork home with me, and something to boil with it, and boil it with a piece of salt beef that he had; I came back about one or two; I bought a piece of pork and three colliflowers, and carried some of it to Mr. Stanley's, and we boiled it with his piece of beef; we continued there all the afternoon; we drank a good deal of porter, and I believe some gin: I can't tell what time we came away; Mr. Stanley told me it was dark before we came away; we went home directly and went to bed without any words; being pretty much in liquor we both of us laid in our cloaths all night. This woman had this dog six or seven years before we came together; I did not care to destroy it, because she had a regard for it; it is very apt to be on the bed, and very often upon my legs, and it snores three times lowder than a christian; I beat the dog off the bed once or twice in the night; in the morning when I awak'd (I don't believe she or I had waked three minutes before this accident happened) I said to her, Hannah get up and light the fire, and make me some tea; upon that she got immediately up; I bid her turn the dog out; her shoes and stocking lay some where about the bed-side; she did not turn the dog out, so I got out of bed; I opened my door and the street door, and then fell a punching the dog in order to get him out; I stood by the door; the dog not seeming ready to come out, this unfortunate knife happening to lie upon my dresser, I took hold of it; I throw'd it with all the force I had in the world at the dog; my wife at this time was stooping, with her head down close to the ground, I believe for her shoes and stockings; she fell down immediately as the knife was thrown out of my hand; her left side was towards me as I throw'd the knife; she was a short woman; I went to her and lifted her up in my arms; she said, Oh John! John! That was all the words I heard her speak. Where I put her down again, God above knows, for the blood came pouring out upon me like a torrent. As soon as I put her down, I cried out, and ran to the next door; some of the neighbours came; I told them I had thrown a knife at my dog, and I believe I had killed my wife; I said to several of them, for God's sake go and fetch a doctor; there was a man so good as to go with me; we went down Grub-street, into Fore-street; I said I knew two doctors there; when we came there it was so early none of them were up; somebody directed me to the Old Jewry to Dr. Sharpe; I saw a young man there, who I suppose was the surgeon's servant; he desired me to sit down; the gentleman would be down soon; I believe the man and I sat down pretty near a quarter of an hour before the gentleman came down; a gentleman came down and ask'd what was the matter; I told him I throw'd a knife at a dog, and was afraid I had killed my wife; he said, I must take her to Bartholomew's hospital; I desired him to come with me, for the consequence was great; when we came to the house there was a great crowd of people; the crowd cried out, ' you have murdered your wife, take him away;' a constable and three or four more laid hold of me; I said you have no occasion to pull and hawl me, I don't want to run away; I made no resistance, then they took me away very quietly to Wood-street compter. I hope your lordship will enquire into my character; I have been watchman in Cheap Ward pretty near seven years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Barton again.</p>
               <p>Court. You hear he says his wife got up undress'd, and as she was stooping down with her left side towards him, he flung his knife at his dog, and stabbed her, and that she was a short woman; Was she?</p>
               <p>Barton. I think she was short.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for the kn ife to miss the dog and strike her in that manner?</p>
               <p>Barton. I am afraid not. - I apprehend that as she was stooping the arm would cover the wound entirely.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her then, you apprehended the wound could not be given that way?</p>
               <p>Barton. I gave that as my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. Might she not have received such a wound?</p>
               <p>Barton. I should think not; I can't conceive<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110058"></xptr> the part that was wounded could be open in such a posture; the wound was a few inches below the arm pit, in a straight line downwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not this part be exposed?</p>
               <p>Barton. I keep in view the whole direction of the wound; I conceive I have that knife in my hand; I contain in my mind that it is that knife, of the same degree of sharpness with that knife and no sharper; then the course of the wound; the skin was forced downwards as far perhaps as it would yield; then by the force of the blow or the plunge, or whatever it was, finding admission through the skin, it came down with the same kind of oblique wound through the intercastory muscles between the fifth and sixth ribs, and then altered its course, turning rather upwards, and slit the heart inward.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot such a knife as this by a throw make such a wound as you have described?</p>
               <p>Barton. I am absolutely of the contrary opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any bruise upon her temples, or cut or notch upon her fingers?</p>
               <p>Barton. I took no notice of any thing but that wound.</p>
               <p>

            . I was upon the coroner's jury; I examined the body very carefully; I observed a wound upon the left arm about an inch broad, and I observed the left side of her face was very much bruised, likewise her left arm near the elbow seemed to be very much gripped, seemingly by struggling, and the knuckles of her right hand seemed to be grazed with a knife, which appeared as though just done, and the pit of her stomach was black and blue; there was upon the breast what I thought an old bruise, it was rather green, but the other parts seemed fresh; as to her hair, I believe it was as long as mine * at the bottom of her head, some hair was cut off, her hair was long enough for any body to take hold of.</p>
               <p>* The gentleman wore his own hair.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did you view the body?</p>
               <p>Croker I believe it was almost seven o'clock; there were twenty-one on the jury; I made particular observations; I made remarks upon paper on the whole evidence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am sensible that there were no blows; if there were any marks they must be old marks, because I used sometimes to give her a blow or two when she was in liquor, but not to hurt her.</p>
               <p>Q. You said her left arm seemed to be grip'd, was that fresh or old?</p>
               <p>Croker. It looked fresh, of a red colour.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Could not there marks be done in her struggling after she received the wound?</p>
               <p>Croker. I believe they were done in struggling; I lifted up her arm to see how such a wound could come; I lifted up her arm three or four times; I made particular observations, and it seemed impossible for me to believe that a wound could be given in that place without design, for, if a person's arm was hanging down it seems impossible to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. You hear the account he has given, don't you think, allowing her to be in a proper posture, such a wound might be given by throwing that knife?</p>
               <p>Croker. I do think it impossible for such a wound to be given by it without very great force.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The two witnesses I expected to be here, I find are not; the man that went with me for a surgeon, and the man I first called up. I beg your lordship to examine two or three witnesses to my character.</p>
               <p>- Stanley. The prisoner and his wife dined at my house on Sunday, and again on Monday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they drink a good deal of liquor?</p>
               <p>Stanley. Not so as to be much disguised; they went away very peaceable and happy together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they live quietly and peaceably together?</p>

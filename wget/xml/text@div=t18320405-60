            . I was house-surgeon of Middlesex-hospital. On the 28th of February Harrington was brought there, about two o'clock in the morning - I found a would on the left side of the abdomen, about an inch long, and in about ten minutes after he was admitted a portion of the intestines came through the wound - they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050034"></xptr>were replaced, and the wound dressed; he died in consequence of that wound twenty-three hours after his admission; his body was opened, and the intestines were found wounded in four places.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BABRY. Q. Did he appear to have been drinking? A. He appeared a little in liquor, but not drunk - I judge he had been drinking by the smell- he was almost insensible, which was the effect of the injury; I did not open his head - I am sure he did not die of apoplexy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I suppose the four parts of the intestines had been wounded at the same time? A. I should judge so; the wound had been inflicted by stabbing with some cutting instrument - the Policeman brought me a knife, which I fitted to the wound; it was the exact size of it.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutor. On Friday, the 28th of January, I saw the waggon with five hogsheads of sugar, which were to go to Crowcher and Bishops, on account of Mr. Scott; I went with it, and got on to Limehouse turnpike; finding the waggon did not come, I went back to meet it; I found it stopping near a turning in the road, and saw a tarpauling put over the sugar; there was no appearance of rain; I went on and stopped at the turnpike till the waggon came up, and the two prisoners were walking by it; I was in the toll-house, and do not know that they saw me, they went on and I saw Barney for a little distance; I then lost sight of him - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070055"></xptr>went up and asked Hartis where he had been so long; he said to get a little beer, I said he had no business to stop; I then asked about the tarpauling, and if he thought it was going to rain; he repeated my question, and said</p>
               <p>"Going to rain" - I then called to the horses to stop and told him to get up and take the tarpauling off, as people would have a suspicion there was something wrong; I then saw a man's hand which appeared to prevent it from coming off - and saw Barney between two hogsheads of sugar, scraping some loose sugar into a bag - I told Hartis to tell that fellow to get out; he said,</p>
               <p>"What fellow?" I said Barney - Barney then jumped out and got away; I came with the waggon to Church-lane and sent for Mr. Scott; I did not examine the sugar, but gave it to Mr. Scott; I looked at the tin cover of the drawing hole of one of the hogsheads, it appeared to have been raised and put down without being driven down - an instrument could have been introduced into the hogshead from that piece of tin being moved; it was weighed soon afterwards, and was six pounds deficient.</p>

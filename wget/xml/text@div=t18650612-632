I am a labourer, and live at 8, Baxendale-street, Bethnal<lb></lb>green—on the morning of Sunday, 28th May, about 1 o'clock, I was in Commercial-street; I had been out with my friends—I don't think I had more than three pints of beer from the time I left off work at 1 o'clock—I had about three pints and a half, my own share—I was coming along Commercial-street alone, smoking my pipe, with my left hand in my pocket, where my money was, and these three men came up to me—the two biggest came in front of me and held ray arms up, and the little fellow came behind me and put both his hands into my pocket, and then the middle one (<hi rend="italic">Oxley</hi>) pulled my hat off my head and gave me a slap in the face—my hat was a new <hi rend="italic">hilly-cock</hi>—I halloaed out, and away they walked—I followed them a little way up the street, and met two other men, and we went after them—I followed them up close, and had a full view of them—they were taken a few minutes afterwards—I never saw them before that—I could swear to them amongst a thousand.</p>

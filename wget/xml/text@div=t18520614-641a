                  </hi>. I live in Great James-street, Islington. I have known the prisoners some time—on 18th May, I had been drinking with them at two places—I left them about a quarter before 1 o'clock in the morning—there had been no quarrel between us—when I left them I went</p>

               <p>to my sister's in Hemmings-building's, about one hundred yards from where we had been drinking—when I got there, my sister went out to Wood's pie shop to get some pies—when she came back and got to the door I heard both the prisoners were threatening that they would stick her, unless she let them into the house—I went out to protect her—I caught hold of both the prisoners—I did not strike them—we fell, Stockbridge was the undermost—I was on the top of him, and Darvill on the top of me—Stockbridge stabbed me in the back of my neck—I caught hold of him, and would not let him cut me any more—here is the wound at the back of my ear—it bled very much—I was much injured—it was only last week I went to work—I was attended by a medical man—Darvill cut me in the hand in several places—I got up and went into the house—I was taken to the station, and from there to a medical man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sister of the last witness, and live in Hemmings-buildings—I recollect my brother coming home, and I went out for some pies—I saw the prisoners; I heard them say they would go after my brother—I followed them—when I got in I took off my bonnet and shawl—the prisoners came and knocked at the door, they asked for my brother—I told them he was not at home—they said I was a liar, and if I did not let them in they would stick me with a knife—Stockbridge opened a knife at the door—my brother came to the door, and they said they would murder him if they got hold of him—Stockbridge said that, not Darvill—my brother came to the door and Stockbridge came up, and they had a bit of a scuffle—they fell, and my brother said, "They are sticking a knife in me"—Stockbridge was under my brother, and Darvill on the top of him—while my brother was on the ground they stuck him in the head, and also in the hand—after Darvill had stuck my brother he ran after me—I ran into a neighbour's house—there had been no quarrel between us—they asked for my brother, and as I would not let them in they tried to pick a quarrel with me.</p>

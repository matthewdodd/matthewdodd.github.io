                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Woolwich. On Monday, the 3rd of Feb., I had this shawl, belonging to English, in a chest in my possession—I saw the shawl safe about six o'clock that evening, and about eight o'clock on Tuesday morning I looked into the chest, and the shawl was gone—I had been at the Three Daws public-house on the Monday evening, and the prisoner came in and had a pint of beer, about half-put six or seven o'clock, and Bridges came in and drank with the prisoner-Bridges then went out, and I remained in the tap-room with the prisoner<lb></lb>before I left my lodging that evening I had locked the door, and put the key into my pocket—I can swear I locked the door with a small padlock—I went home about eleven at night—I was at the public-house from six till eleven—the prisoner drank his beer, and went out of the public-house—I did not see him again till about eleven—he then came and said he had broken out of barracks, and did not want to go in, as he would be tried by a Court-martial—he asked me if I would allow him to sleep with me, and he would bring some money and pay me—he went home with me—when I got home I found the door as I had left it—I had to unlock the door before I could get in—the prisoner left me from six to half-past six the next morning—after he left, Bridges came and spoke to me—I found had lost the shawl, and Bridges said he had pledged it—I have a room of my own in that house, and I have the key of this room—the landlord does not live in the house.</p>

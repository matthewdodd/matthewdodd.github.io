On the 10th of January, about a quarter after eight o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and showed me two or three duplicates, which he wanted me to buy - I refused; he asked me to trust him for some coffee; I gave him a bason of soup; I then turned round to go towards the stairs, leaving him at the counter-the shoes hung on a nail about two yards from him; I turned round again, and saw him buttoning them up in his waistcoat; I was afraid to speak to him - He went out - I knew him before. When my husband came in he sent for a constable, who took him.</p>
               <p>JOHN BARNLEY. I am a beadle. I found the prisoner, about ten o'clock on the 10th of January, at the Thatched House. I found 8d. on him. He said he never saw the shoes.</p>

I was in the Thatched House, in Field-lane-the prisoner came in, with a pair of shoes buttoned in his coat; he offered them for sale, but nobody would buy them; he went out, and came in again with some bread and cheese, and called for a pint of beer.</p>

On the 7th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop and asked to see some ribbons; I shewed him a box, and gave him a piece out - He asked for a wider piece. While I was looking for some, I saw him put the one I first gave him into his bosom. I went into the back-shop and told Ann Martin, who told Mr. James. I went for an officer.</p>

            . James gave me information - I told the prisoner there was a piece of ribbon missing, and we must find it. He denied having it, and inquired what woman it was that stood by him while he was looking at them, as if to throw suspicion on her. I told him she could not have it, as she was not looking at them. Mr. James desired the prisoner to give him the property-he still denied it. Mr. James told me to watch him; he dropped it in the back shop while I was engaged. It could not have got there if he had not dropped it.</p>

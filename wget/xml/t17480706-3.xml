               <p>Q. What was it in?</p>
               <p>Marshall. In a canvas purse, in my breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I cannot say what time it was: I went into the stable at eight o'clock in the morning, and went and laid down.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you asleep?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes; I lay asleep in the manger.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had the money in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel in your pocket for the money a little before you went to sleep?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before?</p>
               <p>Marshall. About two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in any company in that time?</p>
               <p>Marshall. No; I went in with a pair of horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a coachman?</p>
               <p>Marshall. No; I went in with a young man, who lives at the Green Man in Barnet.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge the Prisoner with it; can you say he took it?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I cannot punctually say, whether he took it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the Prisoner taken up?</p>
               <p>Marshall. The same day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him up upon suspicion?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with any thing?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I could not swear to any particular pieces of money he had in his pocket, but he owned the taking the 14 s. and 6 d.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when he owned it?</p>
               <p>Marshall. He said he took it out of my pocket. I did not say much to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got your money again?</p>
               <p>Marshall. No, all the money is gone; he has made away with it all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by when he owned it?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes, and he owned it before my Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner work in the yard?</p>
               <p>Marshall. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a helper to the hostlers?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Is this true?</p>
               <p>Marshall. I said, if he would kneel down upon his knees, and give me a note of his hand, I would forgive him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you a note of his hand?</p>
               <p>Marshall. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any promise made to the Prisoner, to induce him to make this confession?</p>

            . I am the constable that had the charge of this man, for taking the 14 s. and 6 d. I took him out of the room, and asked him about it, and he said, he hoped he had made things easy?</p>

               <p>Q. Who said so?</p>
               <p>Fulbrook. The Prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prosecutor say so?</p>
               <p>Fulbrook. If he would have signed a note for the money, it might, I believe, have been so, but the Prisoner would not do it. The Prisoner had in his pocket half a crown, a shilling, and some halfpence, but the Prosecutor could not own any of the pieces of money that the Prisoner had in his pocket, and he returned them to the Prisoner again.</p>

               <p>watch chain, and said, "Let us have this"—I grasped my pocket, but the watch was not there—at the same moment a man behind me put his arm round my neck and held me back—I thought it was useless to attempt resistance, and occupied myself with intently looking at the prisoner, with a view to his identification—the prisoner broke the chain with his hands, and they all ran off together—it was a silver hunting watch worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—only part of the chain was taken—I ran after them, crying, "Stop thief!" and saw them run up Bedfordbury—I followed them, and at the bottom of Bedfordbtiry found a policeman—I told him of my loss, and he went up a court, up which the prisoner had been seen to run—I went to Bow Street station the same evening, and on the next Monday I was sent for to see some prisoners, but the prisoner was not among them—on the following Friday, 5th July, the prisoner was placed in a row of fourteen men and I picked him out of the lot—I have not the slightest doubt of him; I swear positively to him.</p>

Chelsea where I was going to sleep; I can't tell what time the prisoner came. He would not come to bed, and I went to bed before him; he gave no tea on for not going to bed and fell asleep, leaving the prisoner standing with his back against the wall by the bed side. He tried three or four times if the door was fast, I wakened about half past one, and the prisoner was standing still in the same place; I told him to come to bed, for he must be tired after his march. I was laying with my right arm across my breast, and he stabbed me in the arm. The men in the room got up, and said there was murder in the room, and a general confusion ensued, when the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am a poor old soldier, and came to get some sleep that night at this house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210028"></xptr>The men who were in the house, and who slept in the room, were teazing me the whole of the afternoon, because I was an Irishman; I requested they would not teaze me, and if they would not, I would give them anything they chose to drink; they very readily drank all the money I had, amounting to ten shillings, all that was left of my marching money. When the money was gone, they again commenced teazing, and I was very much afraid of them. When I went up into the room, I had never seen this man; the rest of the men went to bed. I assure your lordship I was afraid of my life, and did not lie down but stood against the wall all night. I thought if they should attract me I had no means to defend myself, I searched about the room and found on the table a piece of an old rusty razor, which I wrapped up in a stocking to defend myself, I had no malice against any of them; presently some of them got up to teaze me again when they found I would not get into bed; and a man was coming round behind me, and I made a blow at him; immediately there was a watchman sent for; I was taken to the watchhouse, and remained there all night; if I hurt any one, it was not with any malice, but merely in my own defence, I was afraid of my life.</p>

                  </hi> I am a job-master, and live in Quebec-mews., Portman<lb></lb>square. I know a man named Rose, and had a transaction, with him re<lb></lb>specting a horse, about a week before the present transaction—on the 6th of Oct. he called on me, and said he knew of a horse for a sale in the hands of a publican in Oxford-street; that the gentleman was in em<lb></lb>barrassed circumstances, in a lock-up house; that it was to be sold, as Mr. Brown had advanced 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it, and was to receive 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for the interest of the money—he said the horse was worth 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I accompanied him in a chaise of his, to Brown's, the Three Tons. public-house, Oxford-street—he called at the door, and went round—Mr. Brown met. us at his back door, and ordered his man to bring out a horse, which was pro<lb></lb>duced, and trotted up and down the mews—Rose said it was as fine an animal as he had seen for many a day; and, provided he had the moneym he would pur<lb></lb>chase it himelf—I think Brown heard that—we were all together—I did not agree to buy it then—Rose took me home—he called repeatedly afterwards, and said, "Delays, are dangerous"—that was the second time we met—I said I could not think of buying a horse of a gentleman in difficulties, as I should not be safe; I should like to see the gentleman—Brown sad his servant was there very frequently; he would see if he was there now, but he was not—I told Brown I could not think of buying it until he made it his own—on the 19th of Oct. Rose called again, and said Mr. Brown had a letter from the gentleman; he had made the horse his own, and they had come to an under<lb></lb>standing to that effect—in consequence of that, I accompanied Rose to Brown's, and saw him, had some conversation with him, and he handed me over this letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Portugal-street. Oct. 9, 1846. Sir,—In answer to yours last evening, the proposition you make respecting the business be<lb></lb>tween</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184612140006"></xptr>
               <p>us, the money you advanced on my horse, which is 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with expenses going on. I gave 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for him in May last; but under circumstances I now stand in, if you will make it up now 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I am sure he will fetch 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. When sold, as he is one of the best horses that can be drove, as I have drove him twelve miles within the hour often, which you can recommend him to any<lb></lb>body. If you like to comply with this proposition, you shall take the horse for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with an understanding by allowing me half what he fetches above 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., with the expenses deducted. Your obedient servant, G. A. <hi rend="smallCaps">SMITH</hi>. To Mr. John Brown, 429, Oxford-street."—On reading that I agreed to purchase the horse—I had agreed to buy two pairs of wheels—Brown put in the wheels and horse at forty-five guineas—the horse was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left a deposit of two sovereigns—Brown wrote this receipt for that on the back of the letter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I paid the remainder on the 21st—the horse was taken to my yard by Mr. Brown's pot-boy—they would not allow anybody else to take it there—I came home about an hour after, and it stood in the stall with other horses—next day I took him out to have a little exereise, and found him a rank roarer, and very much broken-winded—I went to Brown's in the afternoon, and found him and Rose there—I told Brown the fault of the horse, being such a bad roarer—he said, "I will come down and at you to-morrow"—we stopped there some time—Brown came down next day and when the horse was rode up and down, he said, "I never heard such a roarer in my life"—he said he would call next day, and arrange matters with me, and not to do anything until he called; but he never called at all.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; on Saturday the 26th of September, I was informed the clerk of the market's office was broke open; I went in and found the lock broke off the door, and two desks were broke open; the office is by the water side, not joining to any house, it is at Billingsgate-market; I found a man in sleep, he was not the man; but on Saturday I saw the prisoner going in and out of the publick-houses, in liquor, and spending his money very free; I took the prisoner into custody, and searched him, it was on Sunday morning about two o'clock; I found upon him half a guinea, four shillings, and some half-pence; I have kept the money ever since; Mr. Peatt came on Monday morning, and I told him, and shewed him the money; there was only one shilling remarkable, which he said he could swear to, and which he returned me again; this is the shilling; it is a crooked shilling with two sixes, or two nines each side; he could swear to it by that before my lord mayor; the lord mayor's clerk asked the prisoner whether any body was with him? he said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178910280078"></xptr>no; he acknowledged the robbery to several people; I heard him say that he was by himself when he committed the robbery, that there was nobody with him; I had not said a word to him, nor did I hear any body say any thing to him to induce him, or threaten him, there or any where else.</p>
               <p>(The shilling deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>I know it by making a particular remark of the person I took it of, on the Monday morning, and putting it into the wooden bowl when the money was all out; the moment the constable shewed me the money, I took it out, and told him who I took it of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>

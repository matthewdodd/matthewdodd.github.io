            . I am servant to Mr. Webb. After the stolen horse came back to my master's it was in my care - I saw it safe the night before Henley fair, which was on the 22d of September; I put it into the stable at eight o'clock, but did not lock the door: the stable is in the yard. I missed it about four o'clock in the morning, and informed my master.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WEBB. The prisoner left my service on the 20th of August. When I heard this same gelding was again stolen I sent two of my sons to town; I went to Henley fair on Thursday, and had some conversation with Harris, a horse-dealer, and went to his place in Drummond-street, on the Tuesday following, and there found the gelding, and took it home with me.</p>

            . I am a horse-dealer. On the 22d of September, about eleven o'clock at night, I found a gelding in my stables, in Drummond-street, St. Pancras, and next morning, about eleven o'clock, the prisoner came down my yard - he said, "Mr. Harris, you have got a brown gelding, which I left last night, in your stables, and it is to be sold - I have sold three more of my master's horses, and this I will endeavour to sell you;" I agreed to give him 14 l. for it, but would not pay him, suspecting it was stolen, having seen Webb at the fair the day before - I had him secured directly, and sent to Webb.</p>

            . I am an officer. Harris sent for me; I took the prisoner in charge: I wished him to say nothing, but he told me he had stolen this horse from his master, Mr. Webb, twice. I asked if he did not think his master would be very severe with him; he said, No, he did not think he would. I said, "Then you are a very bad man to take it twice;" he said he wanted a little money, having been in bad company.</p>
               <p>RICHARD WEBB. I have no doubt of this being my horse. I never employed the prisoner to sell it.</p>

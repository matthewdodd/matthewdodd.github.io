On Saturday night, the 18th of February, I received information, and went in search of some pro<lb></lb>perty that had been stolen—I found the handle and sucker of a pump at a little distance from the place—I then went in search of the other part, in the direction of Bow-common—I got opposite the Cholera Hospital—that is a quarter of a mile from the place where it was lost, if you go round, but there is a nearer way by going over a ditch—it makes about two hundred yards difference—I looked over a field, opposite the hospital, and saw the two prisoners together—there is one ditch in the field and</p>

               <p>one on the side—they were standing on the side of the ditch next to where I was—I went over to the middle of the field—I saw them separate a few yards—I called to them, and they separated—they then came together again, and I spoke to them twice—I received no answer—I then went through some water that was between me and them, and looked them full in the face—I said to Connolly, "What are you doing?"—he said, "Nothing particular"—I said Mr. Abbott had made some complaints about the fences being stolen; they had better go to the station; and in going along Connolly made use of some bad language, and said he knew very well it was not for a fence that I was taking them, and they were fools to go, and if I wanted him I knew where to find him—I then went and found five pieces of copper, the remaining parts of the pump, in the field, about thirty yards from where I found the prisoners—Trapp's house it about twenty-six or twenty-seven yards from where the pump was found—I went to Trapp's house with sergeant Cooper—it was on the opposite side of the ditch from his house that I found the copper—I found at Trapp's a saw, a chisel, and a small hammer, and some dust of metal, which would be produced from solder or lead; and a piece of lead, which fits the upper part of the pump—the saw was marked as if it had been sawing copper—I saw the dust on the floor, and some portion under the copper—I hole, that appeared to be the solder from the joints of the pump.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in the East India-road, poplar. On the 27th of May I was coming from Limehouse-causeway—there is a public-house opposite the causeway—I saw the prisoner standing, about two feet from the public-house door, very much in liquor—I saw a child, a boy coming along with some biscuits in its hand, it was on the pavement in Three Colt-street, opposite the causeway—I saw a cart there—the prisoner reeled against the child, the child went under a cart, and I saw the wheel go over its head—it was picked up by the police, put on a shutter, and carried home dead—I was half-way across the road—the street is very narrow there—the prisoner said nothing that I heard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barman at the King's Head, opposite Limehouse-causeway. Between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning of the 27th of May, the prisoner came into the bar—I refused to serve her, she was very drunk—she drank out of a pot of half-and-half belonging to two men—she went outside, and stood by the door from three to five minutes—I did not go out till after the accident—I then saw the child lying on the pavement, quite dead—its name was parker.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, Park-street, below where the deceased lived—I knew the child—I saw the prisoner outside the public-house, rather staggering—I saw something fall, I ran away directly, and saw the child brought home dead on a shutter—the cart stood still—it was moving at the time of the accident—I saw the child fall, but did not know at the time whether it was a child or a man, for I ran away, as the people screamed and alarmed me—they said the child was killed—it fell just by the cart wheel—I was sure some accident must happen, which alarmed me.</p>

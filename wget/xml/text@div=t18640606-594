                  </hi>. I am a general dealer, of 22, Preston-street, Bethnal<lb></lb>green—I know Bingley—on Friday afternoon, 27th May, I was at the Halfway public-house at Hoxton, between 2 and 3—I saw Harris there giving a horse some water—Bingley came up to me and said, "<hi rend="italic">Ted.</hi> there is a cheap horse you can buy"—I said, "I have not got money to buy it"—Harris said, "I will make a <hi rend="italic">chop</hi> with you"—he meant an exchange—I had a horse there, and Harris said he would take 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and my horse for his—I said, "I have only got twenty-four shillings;" and he said, "I will take thirty-shillings"—I said, "No; I will give you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and give you five shillings the next time I see you"—he took the pound, and I told him I would give him five shillings the next time I saw him—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186406060019"></xptr>
               <p>he wrote out the receipt for a pound, and I gave Bingham, a shilling—I then took my horse out of the cart and harness, put the other one in, and drove away—the horse went away too fast, and I had suspicion of it—I left word at the station-house about it, and got some one to follow the prisoners—I went to Smithfield to buy a collar for the new horse, and came back into Bethnal-green-road, and saw Harris there in custody at the station-house—I then gave up the mare I had bought to the police—(<hi rend="italic">receipt read</hi>) "John Harris, No. 2, Montague-street, or Horner-street, Whitechapel; exchanged ponies with Edwin Young for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

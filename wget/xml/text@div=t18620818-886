               <p>I was in Aldersgate-street, about 9 o'clock, and saw the prisoner resting this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the pavement—I asked him what he had got in that bag—he said things belonging to himself—I asked what things they were—he said, "Petticoats"—I said, "Where are you going to take them to?"—he slid, "Home to where I live"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, Come along with me and I will show you"—I did not go, but took him in custody, and took him to the station—I again asked him for his address, but he did not give it me—the bag contained twenty-eight petticoats—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are a portion of the things—the others were given up—there were fifty-two pieces of linsey, patterns.</p>

I carry on business at 18, Lawrence-lane—these goods are my property—I missed them on the morning of 4th July, at a few minutes to 9 o'clock—I saw them safe at twenty minutes past 5 the night previous—my premises were then fast—when I left t bolted the door, turned the key, and tried them—when I got there next morning at seven minutes to 9, I found one of Pickford's porters at the door waiting with a parcel for me—the door was closed, but unfastened—I went in, and missed these goods—they were on the premises the night before—I am quite sure they are my goods—they are patterns of ours that no other people make—the door showed no signs of any breaking.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> When I made that statement which was read just now, that I received the goods, I did not understand that I was indicted for receiving them, knowing them to have been stolen, and I never meant that I had received them, knowing them to have been stolen. I was going to the post-office that morning when I left my house, and I met a young man, who told me he had got a situation at a woollen warehouse in the City. He then had two bags with him, one in front and one behind. He said he had to leave one at Blackfriars-road, and one at Islington. He asked me if I was going home, and I said I should be, shortly, to my breakfast. When I got to the station-house the officer took my money away from me. I told him I had had no breakfast, and he got me some. After asking the man what the goods were, I took them. Knowing the man, I did not know I</p>

               <p>was doing anything wrong, or that the things had been come wrongly by; I thought I was doing the man a favour. Had the officer gone home with me I should have had an opportunity of clearing myself, but by his not going home with me he robbed me of the only chance I had. The man called for the goods, and my wife told him the officer had there and searched the place, and then he made off. Had the officer have gone with me he would have seen the man, but he is prejudiced against me for a certain thing, although he has never had me in trouble before. There was no trying to shift out of any question he put to me. I answered him sharply, and did not try to evade an answer. I think the case is very doubtful, and I beg you will give me the benefit of that doubt.</p>

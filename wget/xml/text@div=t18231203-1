On Sunday night, the 26th of October, I went out about ten o'clock, returned in forty minutes, and about twelve missed these two great coats out of the surgery; I had seen them safe at nine o'clock. The persons had got over the wall, unbolted the gate, and forced open the door of the surgery, which is part of the house; they had forced the spring of the lock back - it is a common spring lock, and goes very hard; I am sure it was fastened, but it had not been locked inside - it was not double locked, but I am sure the bolt had caught; it could not be pushed open. I saw my coats again on the Tuesday, cut up - (looks at them;) I know them well, they are both mine; I have had them about a year and a half; one cost four guineas, and the other five. Compton had been in my service, and was discharged on the Saturday night previous, for being drunk - he drove me. Denton lives at Southgate.</p>

Denton told the Magistrate something, and the Magistrate sent me with him to his house to fetch the coats. When we got there, he told his wife to fetch the coats to me; she brought me the coats' skirts in his presence, and said she had cut them to pieces, and burnt them all but the skirts.</p>

            . I live at Southgate. I stopped at the Thatched House with Burgess, on Monday morning, about eleven o'clock - the prisoners came up in a cart together, and stopped to give the horse some hay - I believe it was Denton's cart; he called for a pint of beer. An old clothes man came by; Compton said to Denton, "Go and sell him those two coats;" Denton called the man to him, and pulled the coats out of the cart; they were like those produced. He asked 2 l. for them - the man did not buy them; they were put into the cart again. Compton was a very little way from the Jew. Denton came to me and said, "If you hear any alarm about those coats, don't take any notice about it, the coats belong to Dr. Hammond." Compton could hear what he said. I was getting my horse ready, another clothes man came by - Denton offered them to him in Compton's presence, and after that he offered them to the pot-boy of the Thatched House; he tried one on, but did not buy it. I went away, and they drove off before me, towards Southgate. Denton knew me before very well.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol of Bow-street. On the 31st of October, Clarkson called on me to assist in taking the prisoners before the Magistrate. While he went with Denton for the coats, Compton was in my custody - I neither threatened or promised him; he said, "Where is Denton gone?" I said to fetch the coats - he said, "If Denton is admitted to see the Magistrate, I hope I shall, I have something to state, and will state it to you" - he said that on the morning of the 26th of October, he was in company with Denton, and again in the latter part of the day, and they agreed to go together to Dr. Hammond's to take his fowls - they waited at Denton's house till between ten and eleven o'clock, when a stranger to him came in and agreed with Denton to go with them, and between eleven and twelve o'clock all three proceeded to Dr. Hammond's house. Compton knowing the premises, he got over the wall, unfastened the gate, and let in the stranger. Denton remained at the gate to look out; they proceeded to the fowl-house. Compton broke open the out-house where the fowls are kept, and gave them to the stranger, who wrung their necks, and put them into a sack; they then came to the surgery, got in there, and took two coats - that he got the door open; he did not say whether by force or not, and as they came out of the gate, Denton said, "Here comes the patrol," and they waited on the premises till he had passed, and then proceeded. Denton left the gate, and they got to his house with the fowls and coats, and found him at home; they then agreed to go to the Cherry-tree, which they did, and stole some fowls, carried them to Denton's, killed them there, and took them to market next morning, but Compton said he never received any benefit from them. Denton was called in, and asked who the stranger was, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030004"></xptr>said

            . I am a patrol, and was present when Compton made this statement - it was quite voluntarily.</p>
               <p>MR. HAMMOND. My fowl-house was broken open that night, and ten fowls and a cock stolen - the neck of one was left behind, and there were marks of blood about, as if they had been killed. Compton had lived six weeks with me, and often took these coats into the surgery. The lock was broken off the fowl-house door, and the stable lock thrown into the path; the fowl-house is at the back of the stable. The coats cost nine guineas together, and had not been much worn; they are worth two guineas each - it is a spring lock, and will not keep open, it opens by a handle outside. We found it shut after the robbery.</p>
               <p>COMPTON'S Defence. The fowls are kept in an open shed; it is not locked up.</p>
               <p>DENTON'S Defence. On Sunday morning Compton came to me, and asked me to give him a ride to town - I said as he was out of place I would; he asked what time I should start in the morning; I said about half-past four or five o'clock - he asked if he might sit up in my house all night, till I started, which I agreed to. I had lent my cart, and as it was not brought home, at twelve o'clock, I went as far as my brother's stable to see if I could see the man coming with it. I was not nearer to the prosecutor stable than that, and at that time the young man came into my place, and in the morning I went to fetch my cart, and during that time the bundle Compton had was put into one of my flats, and afterwards put into my cart by Compton. I knew nothing of it till we got to the Four Swans, Bishopsgate, where Compton took his bundle and bag out, and went away with a friend of his, (who we met there,) and agreed to meet me at the Angel, public-house, Islington, at half-past ten o'clock - he came about eleven with one of the bundles, which he had taken out of the cart, and offered the two coats for sale there. I did not know who they belonged to till we got to the Thatched House. A Jew went by; he told me to offer them for sale to him, which I did before these two men, who I knew well. He saw me talking to Hale, and asked if I knew him; I said Yes, and then he told me whose the coats were, and I told Hale, fearing I should get into a mess about it; we drove on. He took his coats out, and left me.</p>

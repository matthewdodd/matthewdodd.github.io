               <p>Are you sure the skin that was found at Lyon's house, was the skin of the sheep that you found on your father's ground? - I verily believe it was, I will swear to the mark of the ruddle, there is not any body round that part that marks them so, all butchers have private marks, and we always mark them different, I found there was a sheep gone that was marked in that manner.</p>
               <p>Was that mark sufficient to enable you to speak with certainty to the skin? - I verily believe that was the skin.</p>
               <p>Court. When you say, you can swear to the certainty of the mark, do you verily believe it was one of the sheep? - Yes, the prisoner was committed the day before I searched his house.</p>

               <p>On Thursday the 8th of May between seven and eight, I was going up with a flock of sheep, and saw the prisoner standing among a parcel of butchers upon Felton Common, in a place where there was no road for near a quarter of a mile, where I got before him to shop, I says to this man, what does that man do there, he said, he did not know; he had got a sheep in a string.</p>
               <p>Did you see he had a sheep in a string? - Yes, but we did not see it at first, for he was among the bushes, he drove the sheep into his own house, I was close by him.</p>
               <p>What mark had it? - It was a stroke of ruddle, I could not observe any pitch mark, to know the letters, I saw there was a pitch mark.</p>

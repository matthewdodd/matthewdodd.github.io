On the 3d of October, about ten o'clock in the morning, Mr. Jeave, and I were sitting in his parlour, and about twelve o'clock, the prisoner brought a pot of beer, I took it of him - he went away as I thought. Jeave and I were in conversation for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - I was then going into the yard, and passed the bed-room door, saw a shadow, went into the room, and saw the prisoner there, I asked what he was doing - he said he was playing with the parrot - there was one in the room; he went out about his business. I told Jeave, he said he thought him honest, and had no suspicion.</p>

One day she took my handkerchief off my neck, and said she would lend me 6 d. on it, to buy gin, and in the afternoon she said she would lend me another 6 d. on it, if I spent it, and next day, she offered 1 s., 6 d., more if I would spend 6 d.; she gave me 6 d. for the duplicate of a pair of stockings, and said if I could get her duplicates of anything, she would buy them, let them be what they would, and said I could not be without money in such a house as I lived in. As to these things,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240042"></xptr>I went for my pots at nine o'clock in the morning, she asked if I had any money to toss for gin, I said No. She sent me for a pot of beer, and asked me to drink, and after waiting about five minutes looking at the parrot, she told me to give it some bread, and as I came into passage, I kicked against something and found it was a thimble - the ring and padlocks laid by the side of the drawers; this gentleman came in the passage, and said Hallo!

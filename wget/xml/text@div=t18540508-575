                  </hi>. I am a stock and share agent In March last I took the first floor of the house, No. 30, Percy-street, at a rent of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—the defendant was the occupier of the house—I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, as he wanted money; he asked me to let him have it; he is a portrait painter—there is no ground whatever for saying that I was ever tried for breaking into a wine cellar in Coram-street—I have never been tried for any offence whatever; not a word of this libel, as regards myself, is true—since the defendant has been out on bail he has been to my banker's, and to persons with whom I deal, stating things against my credit—my wife's maiden name was Emma Berry—I have been married eight years—I received some money under some trust property belonging to my wife; I paid that money into the Royal British Bank, in trust for her, and the prisoner went to my banker's, and by that means ascertained my wife's maiden name—on Monday, 20th or 21st March, when I returned home from the City, my wife made a complaint to me about the defendant—she was agitated, and crying—I went down to the defendant, and asked him what he meant by making use of such abominable language to my wife and servant—he said she was a wh—, and so was my servant, and on that I knocked him down—there was a disturbance in the house, and we went before a Magistrate, who suggested that I should leave the house—I promised the Magistrate that I would leave before 12 o'clock that night, and I did so, and so did Mr. Benjamin—Mr. Benjamin is not a friend of mine, only a lodger in the house—I knew nothing of him till I went there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185405080006"></xptr>
               <p>—the rent would have been due on 24th March; there would have been 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due, minus 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the keys of the door, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the agree<lb></lb>ment—I did not pay the prisoner that rent, because the landlord said that he had received no money whatever from the defendant—I was about two months in the house—this libel was first brought to my attention a week after I had left the house; it was sent to me by Mr. Benjamin—I went round the neighbourhood of Tottenham Court-road, and saw these placards in the shop windows; I should think there were about 100 in the neighbourhood—there were none upon the walls—I went to the Royal British Bank, and found that the prisoner had taken one there—(<hi rend="italic">the libel being ready charged the prosecutor, among other things, with having committed a burglary in a wine cellar in Coram-street, and alleged that he was living with a woman named Berry, as his wife.</hi>)</p>

J. Onion, portrait painter"—I did not know that he painted portraits; I knew he was a painter when I took the lodging—he once showed me his pictures, one that he said was worth 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., by Annibal Caracci, and I saw him with something on an easel, painting—I was not subpoenaed as a witness in an action about a portrait—I was present when such a case was tried in the County Court—the prisoner brought the action for payment of a portrait he had painted—I do not consider that I owe the defendant anything, until I hear from the landlord that I may pay it—it is a question whether I am justified in paying it—I think I have paid enough now for the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I do not owe it him—I agreed to take the place at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I promised before the Magistrate that I would pay the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not broken my word—I have not paid it; I had a notice from the landlord not to pay—I am going to pay it as soon as it is convenient—he has taken good care at present that I should not be able to pay anything at all, as far as to getting credit—I got my things away, but I have not paid the money, because the landlord gave me notice not to do so—I did not ask the land-lord to put a distress in—I sent round to the landlord to ask if our goods were safe against his rent for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and that was his answer; that was a month before we removed the goods—I am a stock and share agent—I am not on the Stock Exchange—I deal on my own account, I buy and sell in the Alley—I have a house at present, but if I give my address I shall be served the same as I have been all along, having my door placarded, and have to turn out again—I have no objection to state where I am living, provided I am certain of having peace when I get home—it is No. 62, South Moulton-street—there had been quarrels with one and the other ever since we went to the prisoner's house—I know nothing about my servant shaking the carpets immediately under the window of his painting room—I go into the City at half-past 9 o'clock and return at 4 o'clock—I heard of it one day, and I went and explained to him that it should not occur again—it did not</p>

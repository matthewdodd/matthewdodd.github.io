On 11th of this month, I went with Mary Cliff and Clara Banks, to the prisoner—I told him I was a police officer, and that he would be. charged with marrying Clara Banks, his wife being still alive—he said "All right, I am ready, to go with you, my first wife has driven me to this"—after the 11th I went to Liverpool, and got from there a certificate of marriage, dated September, 1869, which I' compared with the entry of marriages at St. John's Church, Liverpool, and found it to be a true copy—I got. a second certificate from Mary Cliff, which I also compared with the entry of marriage of William Charles Cliff, and Clara Banks. (<hi rend="italic">The certificates of both marriages were put in and read.</hi>)</p>

               <p>COURT. You took it in your cart - A. Yes; I took it out to take to the house; the porter brought it back and said they were removed; I drove to Wood street; I am sure the same parcel was put in again in Wood street; it was in the middle part of the waggon; I took and put it between two trusses, where it could not fall out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. What sort of a waggon is it - A. It is boarded at the bottom and railed round the side; the parcel could not fall out by accident.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was it so low that any body could put their arm in - A. They might put their hand down between the rail and move the parcel, and so take it out between the rail; it could not get out without being taken out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. When you had put the parcel in the situation you have described, what did you do then - A. The porter took out another parcel to deliver, and while he delivered that I turned the waggon round; he was gone a quarter of an hour delivering the other parcel; he came back and demanded this same parcel again; I went to look for it, and it was gone. I have seen the parcel since.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Grove, 93, Wood street, he is a watchmaker. On the 8th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the yard shutting up the shutters, a parcel was thrown over the wall of the yard; I took it up and carried it into the shop to my master; when I got in to the shop I saw the prisoner standing at the street door window; he walked past the shop window; he stood at the corner of the court one minute, and then he came in; he said if you please, sir, will you give me the parcel, a drunken man has thrown it in your yard; my master bid him come in; he asked him where he lived; he said in Bethnal Green; Mr. Grove put several questions to him, and he run away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was at the window - A. Yes; and I am sure that is the man that came in the shop and had the conversation with my master in the passage; I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . Q. We understand you are a watch maker living in Wood street - A. Yes. The little girl who spoke last brought the parcel to me, and while she was with me waiting while I wrote a note, she perceived a man; I saw Simpson and Pitfold on the parcel; I was going to write to these people to inform them that I wished to see them, not wishing to keep a thing that I suspected I might be stolen; the girl says, there is some man looking in at the window; I said open the door and ask him in; upon which he vanished; another, or the same man, came; he came in whining and crying; he stood in a singular position, appeared much shorter than what he was, with his leg behind him keeping the door back that it might not be shut; he said if he did not get the parcel he should lose his place; he solicited for the parcel, saying that a drunken man had thrown it over my pales; I said if he came in he should have the parcel; he came a little matter forward; I asked him what sort of a parcel it was, the colour of it, and what it was wrapped up in, and a variety of such questions as that, to which he could give me no satisfactory answers; upon further requesting him to come in, he pushed the door back and the child against the wainscot and ran away, and I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about being a porter - A. He said he had to carry the parcel; if he did not recover the parcel he should lose his place; he did not say he was a porter. I had a large candle in my hand, of which we had two or three in the shop. I ran down Love lane, up Great Love lane into Wood street again, where he was taken; I never lost sight of him, and once had hold of him; but he being a heavier man than myself he got away; I had like to have fell, my hand was upon the ground; I got up again; he never was further from me than I am from you; I never lost sight of him. This is the parcel; he could not give any account what the contents were nor what it was covered with.</p>

               <p>Q. About what time did you set out with the waggon - A. At five o'clock, or rather before; it was after six when we missed the parcel in Wood street.</p>
               <p>COURT. How far was your waggon from Mr. Grove's - A. The waggon was very near the Castle inn.</p>
               <p>Grove. About an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Your back yard has a paling - A. Yes; rather higher than I could reach; at the back of the yard is a court, which is a thoroughfare; I rather think it was intended to be lodged there; not to be thrown over.</p>
               <p>Q. Open the parcel and see what it contains - A. It contains twenty four yards of cambric.</p>

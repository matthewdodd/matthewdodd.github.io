               <p>Hutchins. Yes; I was sitting in the parlour; on the eleventh of June, about ten o'clock at night I heard the dog bark; my men were gone to bed.</p>


               <p>Q. How many maid servants had you up?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Two maid servants. I called them to see what was the matter with the dog. In a short space of time I heard a noise; I ran to see what was the matter; I found my maid

               <p>Q. Do you swear to his being one?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I do, to the best of my remembrance; the other's name is Highham Lazarus;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040035"></xptr> my fright was exceedingly great. I did my endeavour to assist her; but one pushed me into a chair, and pulled my upper petticoat over my head; I believe it was the Doctor that laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any of the others?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No; I put my coat down again, then they put it up again, and said if I valued my life I must keep it there; then I heard the cook cry very much; one of them said cut her throat; another said, you Bish, if you don't hold your tongue I will cut your throat; if you hold your tongue I will cot murder you; they were all in the same room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who it was made use of that expression?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No, my coat was over my head; I could not see them: as they were pleased to speak so favourable, I begged them to make her hear, for she was deaf; then they came to me and offered to tie my legs; I begged they would not, and said I would not stir; then they all went to another room; the door of that room was locked; they said, if it was not immediately opened they would break it; they returned again in about five minutes. I heard them go up stairs; a little time after they were gone up, I heard somebody cry, Fire! and swore very much, I then heard a pistol go off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after you heard the word fire?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. In about the space of a minute. I then ran to the back door, endeavouring to get off.</p>
               <p>Q. On the pistol going off, did you hear any cry or shriek?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I heard the man cry out, and beg they would not; I could hear no more. I took hold of the latch of the back door, endeavouring to get out, but I found some men at the outside of the back door who prevented me: They said, if they were not my friends, they would blow my brains out. It was when the pistol went off that attempted to make my escape out of the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know then whether the five persons you spoke of were in the house?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No, I cannot tell; I returned to the chair. Then I heard a very great russling, and screaming, and noise above stairs, as if they were throwing the servant down stairs; and a little while after I heard another pistol go off.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance of time might it be between hearing the two pistols go off?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. A very short space of time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the tussel on the stairs was it before you heard the other pistol go off?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. A very little time. Then I saw the wounded man endeavouring to get down: He came to me, and said, How are you, Ma'am, for I am a dead man! Those were his words: He turned short, and fell down upon the ground; his shirt was on fire close to the wound, and I put it out; the blood ran down his legs: When he fell down I saw the wound; it was just under the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see blood issue from that wound?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes, and the blood that was running down his legs proceeded from that wound. He groaned very much, and complained of being cold.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing on but his shirt?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No, nothing. Then I heard the people in the house run from room to room; then they came down to me, and one of them took the buckles out of my shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell who?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. To the best of my knowledge

               <p>Hutchins. I cannot say; I believe it was the little man. Hyam Lazarus; there were three with me then.

            , and him, and another which I can't describe. They took the plate out of the cupboard, and gave it to their companions at the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your plate again?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No: Then they went into the parlour, where there was a bureau, and broke it to pieces. The doctor and a little man went into the parlour. I followed them. I told them there was nothing there worth their having, for there was nothing but paper. Then one of them struck me in the face with a pistol, and was going to shoot me, for he put his finger in the trigger, but the doctor guarded the pistol off with his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that man?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. He was a thick short man: he is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040036"></xptr> not here; he cut my lip with the pistol, and loosened one of my teeth. They said they must have money and notes; that they came for money and notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the doctor say any thing when he pushed the other man's pistol by?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Nothing at all. I told them I had a little money. They asked me to shew them where it was. I went up stairs, unlocked the drawers, and gave them a purse with sixty-one guineas; and the same old man turned round, and would have shot me, and said I had notes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not here?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. He was a short lusty man; he is not here, or my fright don't permit me to know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any silk?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes, a piece of lemon-coloured silk.</p>
               <p>Q. Who prevented him shooting you the second time?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. The same man, the doctor, pushed him by the shoulder, and prevented him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the silk?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. In a chair on the left hand side of the parlour, wrapped up in a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had it?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I cannot justly say; I had it of one

            , a dyer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing remarkable in the silk that you can know it again?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. There were some spots of grease upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity was there of the silk?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I never measured it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them take it away?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No; the silk was there; I missed it as soon as they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they all pistols?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I saw several; I think they had all pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. In a darkish red sort of a great coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all dressed alike?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. All dressed in great coats alike. excepting the lusty man, he had not; to the best of my knowledge he had a kind of a light brown coat.</p>
               <p>Q. A great coat?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I cannot very well say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in their great coats?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No; only they were so long, they reached down almost to their heels; there were three of them so equal in height, that you might have rolled a ball on their heads.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they bring any lights with them?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. They dou'ed our candle, and in a little time lighted brown wax-candles of their own; there were several lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a wax candle that rolls up?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Really I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they any thing of a box to put it in?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I saw nothing; they held it in their hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen any of the things you lost?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I have seen the piece of silk, as I think; I cannot speak positive to it, one piece is so much like another. There were two grease-spots upon it; I objected to it on that account.</p>
               <p>Q. When did they go away?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Immediately after the man attempted to shoot me because I had not the notes. I found my maid,

             and Hyam Lazarus were in custody in the Borough; do you remember that?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them in the prison at St.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040037"></xptr> Margaret's-hill, when they were publicly examined before the Magistrates?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you attended, it was broad daylight; had you a full view of him then, and Hyam Lazarus?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you expressed yourself at that time that you had no recollection of his face or Hyam Lazarus?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I said I believed they were the men then.</p>
               <p>Q. But they were discharged?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. That was because I could speak no otherwise than that I believed they were the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it put to you, whether they were the men that committed the murder and robbery at your house?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. It was; and I said I believed they were the men.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was desired by somebody present that they might speak, that you might recollect their voices again?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. It was for my cook, not me.</p>
               <p>Q. They all spoke at that time, I believe?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. A question was put to one, that he might give an answer, that you might hear his voice?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. There was a coat the doctor had on, which I thought he had given to the little man; I desired to know if that was the coat he had on; it was not for his voice at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen him several times?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have not you always, from that time to this, expressed a doubt of his being the person; and Hyam Lazarus and he has been discharged?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes, I had the same opinion of them in the Borough as I have now; I expressed myself so there.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he was disguised by his coat, and hat flapp'd?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean it was button'd up to his face?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Considering him so disguised, and you seeing him before, and expressing great doubts about his being the person, how can you be more positive now?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Because there are corroborating circumstances have arose since, that strengthen my opinion.</p>
               <p>Q. It is mere matter of opinion then as to the person of the man; your doubts would be the same if it was not for these circumstances of the reality of the man?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. They would.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in equal doubt with the little one (Hyam Lazarus) in the Borough too, I believe?</p>

               <p>Hutchins. I did not care to swear to him; I had the same opinion of him as of the doctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Whoever that person was, you say the person you apprehend be the doctor darted off the pistol from your face when the man would have shot you?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you reason to think that person would have killed you, if it had not been for that man?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those three people up stairs all of a height?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think the men you took to be the doctor saved your life?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I do believe so.</p>
               <p>Court. You swore you thought the same then as you do now?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you explain what your doubts were?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. Because one face may be so nearly like another.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other reason to doubt about it but that?</p>

               <p>Hutchins. No other.</p>
               <p>Council for the Crown. When you saw the little man in the Borough, was there any circumstances respecting his hat you observed?</p>
               <p>Hutchins. There was brown wax on his hat, the same as they had in the house; he had a brown wax candle in his hand in the house.</p>

            .) I jump'd upon my right side, and asked what that was for? one of them answered, D - n your eyes, you son of a bitch, if you speak another word I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know which that was?</p>
               <p>Stone. I cannot tell; as soon as they spoke that word, my fellow-servant jumped up, and I heard one of them cry, Shoot him, and directly there was a pistol discharged, and he cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell which discharged the pistol?</p>
               <p>Stone. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the pistol to him when it was discharged?</p>
               <p>Stone. Close to him, I suppose; the blood was all in the bed; he cried out, Lord have mercy on me, I am murdered, I am murdered! There were two on each side of the bed, and one stood at the foot of the bed; they went all round, and dragg'd him to the stair-case, all five of them. I lay on that side of the bed next the window. When they had him at the stair-case, I supposed they were going to throw him down the stairs; I jumped up, and got through the window; as soon as I had just got on the outside, and fell into the gutter, they discharged another pistol. I climbed up and got on the ridge of the house; they fired out, I supposed they fired at me; from the ridge of the house I got into a gutter on the lower part of the house; I was there the space of about ten minutes; I heard a man at the door ask who was there? Then the door was opened, and they came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How many men did you see on the outside?</p>
               <p>Stone. There were two at each door; as soon as the door was opened, they came out; I heard them say one to another, It is time for us to be gone: one of them made a whistle like; and then I heard a man or two come from the fore part of the house to the back part; then they went out of the yard through the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the poor man die that was shot?</p>
               <p>Stone. About three o'clock next day.</p>
               <p>Q. When they all went away together, how many might you see?</p>
               <p>Stone. I thought there were nine of them; there might probably be more.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the Borough when these people were in custody?</p>
               <p>Stone. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw some of them in gaol?</p>
               <p>Stone. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect the doctor was in custody before the Justices at St. Margaret's-hill; at that time you did not charge him with being one?</p>
               <p>Stone. Yes, him and the short one.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say of them?</p>
               <p>Stone. To the best of my knowledge I said I really thought them to be the men in the house.</p>

               <p>Stone. To the best of my knowledge?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you could not be positively certain.</p>
               <p>Stone. I said I was not positive of him, but I was of the other two.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been a-bed when this affair happened?</p>

               <p>Q. What were they to go to Chelsea for?</p>
               <p>Isaacs. To break into a house with a design of thieving. I had been in their company on an illicit trade, and they consided in me, and asked me to be of this party.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or not accept of their proposal?</p>
               <p>Isaacs. I said I was sick and could not go.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this proposal made to you before the robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Isaacs. On the 17th of March we were together.</p>

               <p>Isaacs. It was before the feast of our passover, which corresponds with Easter, the months Lessen, which correspond with part of March and April. Sunday night 17th of March we met together at an alehouse in Woolwich-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them together between the 13th of March and the time the robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Isaacs. After the feast of the passover; much about the 7th of April; we met together at a widow woman's one Mrs. Moses.</p>

I took it home; we opened it and measured it on my counter, there was about fifteen yards and a quarter on it; we took it into the parlour; my wife complained it was full of wrinkles. She said this end did not turn out so well as the other. I said an iron would take it out, and make it as stiff as the other part. She said if it did she would have it. An iron was put to the fire, the iron immediately upon our applying it, drew three spots of grease from the iron-cloth, and there were two pinches in it which seemed as if screwed up about three quarters of a yard distance from one another.</p>

               <p>Wood. Do you remember any enquiry being made of you about Mrs. Hutchins?</p>
               <p>Wood. Two men came to me to make some enquiry; they asked who kept the farm just beyond me. I told them a widow gentlewoman; they asked me if there was a lodger there, they mentioned somebody, I forgot the name. I believe it was fictitious. I said she let out no lodgings, she was a gentlewoman and lived upon her own farm; they asked me how many men she had. I said two that lay in the house. They asked me how many carters she had, and whether they were married or single men. I told them I could not tell. They asked me whether any of them laid in the barn or the stables. I said I did not know, they were out all hours to go to market. They asked me if any women laid in the barn or stables. I told them there was more or less, I could not tell how many worked for her. I told them I could not tell, nor do I know now when I said she had no lodgers. They said she was a handsome likely woman, and they had been with her and asked for the same name, and thought the man did lodge with them. I keep a public house; my girl carried beer there. I keep the chequers.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before the robbery?</p>
               <p>Wood. As near as I can guess, two month; there was but one of them asked me any questions; the other stood still; at last he said, shall we go? he paid for his pint of beer; then he turned round in my face, and said, d - n me, you are as knowing as we are ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was that that asked the questions?</p>
               <p>Wood. A short thick well-set man; he that sat down was taller; it was he that asked me so many questions that said that. In half an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177112040044"></xptr> hour's time I sent Mrs. Hutchins word by her caiter.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you distinguish by their pronunciation, whether they were Englishmen or not?</p>

I shall not trouble your lordship with any long preamble, it will suffice when I with the greatest regret reflect on my situation, my being charged with a crime so cruel and notorious. The evidence

I ever used much humanity and honour to the gentlewomen, I had the honour to attend, and I treated my other patients in the tenderest manner which I can prove. I can only say, and truly affirm, that what he has said is as false as God is true. I shall say no more, but leave the rest to my counsel, and the witness I have to prove my innocence.</p>

            . The very day that the charge is, was my brother's birth-day; it was about three or four in the afternoon we went together to the Mermaid at Hackney, because it was his birthday; there we drank tea; then I walked with him till nine o'clock; then he said he would go home; we came to Bethnall-green to Lord Camden's-head; he said, Go in there, I will go to a certain house in the neighbourhood and receive some money. I went into the Lord Camden's-head, and drank a gill of wine; and then my brother came to me. I was there a strong hour, that is, a full hour. My brother then told me he went home with a lady; and then we went together to town; we went to Abel's buildings. Sir John's men took away my pocket-book, where my receipts are, that will shew my business, and with whom I dealt; I can't name them, but my receipts will shew. I subpoena'd several people; but my character was so blackened, they would not appear.</p>

            . I live in Mill-yard; he has been a lodger of mine thirteen months; he was in my house the 11th of June last; he was not out the whole night; he is an old-cloaths-man; he came home at six in the afternoon, and did not go out afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you follow any business?</p>
               <p>Kelley. Yes, I deal in fruit; he had a first floor backwards, at 10 s. a month.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a passage?</p>
               <p>Kelley. No; there is a door comes into the house; the street door comes into the entry; there is a door in the entry into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remark this 11th of June?</p>
               <p>Kelley. I have a man-servant that sells fruit for me; he came three or four days after, and said a barbarous murder had been committed by some Jews. I asked him if he remembered whether Solomon was at home that night (I took notice of it because he was a Jew); he said, yes, he lay with him that night.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he taken up?</p>
               <p>Kelley. I cannot say when it was; some people came the next day to enquire for him.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What month was it?</p>
               <p>Kelley. It was four months after.</p>

               <p>Q. How long is it since he was taken up?</p>
               <p>Kelley. About five weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the justice?</p>
               <p>Kelley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You took no manner of notice of it till this time?</p>
               <p>Kelley. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in Mill-yard?</p>
               <p>Kelley. Four months; I lived in Halfmoon-alley, Whitechapel, before.</p>

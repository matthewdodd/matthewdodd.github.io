                  </hi>. I am the mother of Sidney George Laming; he had not been baptized, only registered in that name—it was born on 26th Oct. last—I did not nurse it or suckle it—it went away from me about two hours after its birth—Mrs. Power, a wet-nurse, took it away—she is not here—about six weeks before the child died, I made an agreement with the prisoner for nursing it—I was to pay her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—she was to provide food and lodging, and I was to provide clothes—I took it to her myself—it then had a very bad cold, but it was very well besides that—it was not fat—it had not been weaned when it was taken to the prisoner—it had had the cold about two months—I used to see it about twice a week—I thought it got ill the last three weeks—it had never recovered from the cold—it was ruptured, but not very bad—I always saw food for it when I went—the prisoner lodged in George-street—she is a widow—she was recommended to me by a medial gentleman, named Stunt—I saw the child the day before it died—the nurse took it to Dr. Murphy, and to Dr. Dyer, of Marylebone-street—he is not here—Mr. Stunt saw it once or twice—the prisoner applied to me for a calf's teat, and for something which the child was to suck out of a bottle—I paid for it—as far as I know, when I went there, there was food for the child, and it was fed; but it continued with that cold till it died, on 14th June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am physician to the University College Hos<lb></lb>pital. I saw the child about fifty-four hours after his death—it was not at all decomposed—it was very emaciated, the eyes sunken, and it appeared to have died of a lingering death—I made an internal examination, and found inflammation of the left lung, of about a week or ten days' standing, and the commencement of inflammation in the right lung—it was probably caused by cold—want of food could not cause it—I should say it was the cause of death—if not subdued, it would emaciate the child—there was no fat, the other organs appeared healthy—there was a very small quantity of food in the lower part of the canal—want of food would not create disease there—there was also considerable bronchitis, which might be of many weeks' standing—inflammation of the lungs might be caused without exposure to the air—want of food would render it more susceptible of cold.</p>

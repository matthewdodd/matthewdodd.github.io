               <p>What is the value of these things found? - I suppose 30 l. I have valued the paste buckles at the pawnbroker's at two guineas.</p>
               <p>Dixon. I understood by the pawnbroker that Mr. King had been robbed of a great many things; the prisoner had been advertised; I went to the tailor's in the Strand, where the prisoner directed me, and in his great coat pocket, I found this 10 l. note.</p>
               <p>Mr. King. There is some of my writing on the back of it.</p>

               <p>Court. Then if you deliver them to Mr. King, they must be marked now, if they should be wanted to be produced in evidence against the receiver.</p>

               <p>Dixon. I searched him, and found five guineas in a purse, and the prisoner said that was the produce of his master's property.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. How did you come by this young man? - I advertised for a servant, and this young man came; he mentioned his friends; his father keeps a house of industry at St. Ive's, and his brother who belongs to the excise, gave him a good character; I enquired of the brother's character there, and I heard he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240047"></xptr>in the excise, and had a little estate of his own in the country.</p>

               <p>Court. I can never disapprove of any thing that arises from a motive of humanity, but compassion must not interfere with public justice, and the public safety; this offence is of so dangerous a kind to society, that no tradesman, no merchant, no gentleman can be secure, if confidence cannot be placed in their servants, and especially in those servants that are entrusted, particularly this unfortunate young man was entrusted by you to sleep in that shop for protection of your property, and he has availed himself of that opportunity to plunder you of that property which he was entrusted to protect; under those circumstances, it would be impossible for me, as a Judge to interpose at all, or to recommend him to his Majesty's mercy; the King will dispose of him as he thinks fit.</p>
               <p>Court to Tyler. The Jury having convicted the prisoner of burglary, as your conduct has been very meritorious, if you will apply to me in proper time, you shall have a considerable share of the reward.</p>

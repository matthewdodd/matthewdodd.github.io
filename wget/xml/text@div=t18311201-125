               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q.Fordham called the prisoner a two-faced fellow at twelve o'clock? A. Yes, but whether the prisoner was present then I cannot tell; the prisoner seemed anxious to render every assistance.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called to see the deceased on Saturday evening, the 29th of October; he was then dying - I saw him after he was dead; he died at his own house - I examined his head, and found an extravasation of blood over the left hemisphere of the brain; I consider the concussion was the cause of his death, and not the blow - the blow caused the concussion, which was the fall; he died within two hours after I saw him - which was about eight o'clock; I was with him nearly all the time, and did what I could for him: the prisoner fetched me, and seemed very sorry for what had occurred.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He died from pressure of blood on the brain? A. Yes; he had a severe blow on the mouth, and the concussion was on the opposite side - he had fallen down: if he was intoxicated less violence would have caused his death - I do not think the blow would have caused his death if he had been sober.</p>

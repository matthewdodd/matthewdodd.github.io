                  </hi>. I keep a beer shop at Chingford, in Essex. On Sunday, 19th Feb., I had a gun in front of my bar—I saw it safe from 1 o'clock to half past 1—it was one I had borrowed the week pre<lb></lb>vious, of James Birch—I missed it about half past 9 o'clock the same evening—I know the prisoner; he had been in my house more than once that day—I believe he passed through that part where the gun was—about half past 10 o'clock the same evening the gun was produced by the policeman.</p>

Yesterday week I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner in the evening, at Chingford Hatch—he had this gun with him—he was about 100 yards from Mr. Chapman—I stopped him, and asked him where he got the gun; he said it was given to him—I asked where he was going to take it; he said, "Home"—I asked him again, and he said, "Home"—I said I should take him to the station; he then said he was going to take it to Chapman's—I made inquiry, and found it had been taken that afternoon from Mr. Chapman—the prisoner then said he found it outside Mr. Chapman's gate.</p>

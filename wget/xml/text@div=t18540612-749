                  </hi>. I am an engraver, and live at No, 23, St. Paul's-place, Camden New Town; it is in the parish of St. Pan crag. On 22nd April I went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock—my property was then safe—the house was fastened, but the water closet window was left a little way up—it is a sash window—it was by that window that the entry was effected—I lost from the passage a coat, a cloak, and three umbrellas—I have not seen them since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman, in the employment of Mr. Knight, a builder, in Camden-town. On Sunday morning, 23rd April, I was in St. Paul's road, about 100 yards from Mr. Bacon's house—I saw the three pri<lb></lb>soners about a quarter to 6 o'clock; they passed me, and I repassed them again—I cannot say the exact time, but I heard the half hour go some time before; it was broad daylight—I went on duty to watch the premises at half past 5 o'clock in the evening, and I am there all day on Sunday—there are buildings there—I had never seen either of the prisoners before, to my knowledge—I saw Jones come to the corner of the turning—they passed No. 28, and the other two then turned back, leaving Jones standing at the corner—Jones then got over the front wall of No. 28—at that time the others were standing, one on the footway opposite Mr. Bacon's house, and the other at the corner—Jones first went up the steps of No. 29, and tried the little window there, but could not open it—he then came down again and went up the steps of No. 28—they are semi-detached cottages—he opened the water closet window, and got in—I cannot say whether the window was any way open or not, but I saw him lift it and get in—the other two came up to me and said something to me, but I did not understand what they said—I walked down towards the house to try and see what assistance I could get—I could not get any, they came before me and would not allow me, and Welsh called out, "Billy! Billy!"—they pushed me, to</p>

               <p>drive me away from the house—I went towards the corner, where I could see, a little of the front of the house, and I was scuffling with them when I saw Jones come over the back garden wall, bringing with him three um<lb></lb>brellas, a coat, and a cloak—I was then knocked down by Welsh—Jones left the things on the ground, and the other two took them away with them—I afterwards saw Phillips and Jones in custody at Clerkenwell, and knew them again directly—I am sure they are two of the men I saw—after they were committed, I went with a policeman to a house in Little Saffron-hill, and saw Welsh in bed—I am sure he is one of the three men I saw, it was him that knocked me down—I had an opportunity of seeing them all three, it was broad daylight.</p>

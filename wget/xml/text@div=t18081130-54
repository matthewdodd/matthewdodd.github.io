             came in; I asked her to drink up the remaining part of the pint of beer; I called for a second pint; after that we went out. I agreed to go along with her and I was to give her sixpence. I went with her to <placeName id="t18081130-54-crimeloc320">Lisle street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. Yes, I had but part of two pints of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stop with her - A. About twenty minutes in Lisle street; I accused her with it; she said she had got no money of mine. I called the watchman, she would not let that watchman take her, she said he did not belong to the parish. I called out for another; the second watchman took her; that was the watchman that she treated with a glass of liquor when we were coming from the same public house. She was taken to the watchhouse and searched; no money was found upon her. I mentioned what sort of shillings; two of them had heads on them, and the other had a G on it, a crooked shilling; the watchman was called in and told to pull out his money; he pulled out three shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the watchman here - A. Yes; Wale is the watchman. The constable asked me if they were my shillings; I said they were.</p>
               <p>Q. These three shillings were found upon him were they - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they are yours, do you not - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had lost the money before he came up - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he was rather privy to it, though not present at the taking of it, all he could do was to receive it - was there no other person you was in company with - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you lost the money you could not tell - A. I lost it in that house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was sober, I think; I went strait from home into that public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman before - A. No, I never saw her before.</p>

             was brought in by the man prisoner on charge of robbing the prosecutor of three shillings. I searched her and found nothing on her but a battered sixpence and some halfpence. While I was searching the woman I heard the beadle say, watchman, is not that your wife; he said no. I told the woman to go out of the room. I said to the watchman, for the satisfaction of the man that has lost the money, and your own character, let us see what money you have got in your pocket. Out of his right hand breeches pocket he took three shillings and sixpence and laid it down on the desk; I told Smallway to look at the money; he did; and said they were the three shillings that were taken from his pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Let me look at the shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What were the marks on the shillings - A. Two of them had heads on them, and the crooked shilling had G on it; I am sure they are the shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. You come here to say that there was nothing but a G upon the other - A. Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. If you can swear they are yours, you must know - A. I am not sure now; it is a remarkable crooked shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear by the bend of the shilling - A. I know I had a plain one in my pocket. I wished to keep these till the last because they were the best. - (The shillings handed to the jury.)</p>
               <p>COURT. It seems to me to be a C instead of a G.</p>
               <p>JURY. It is C that is on it.</p>
               <p>Kimberley's Defence. When I went into this public house he asked me to have some beer; I did; he called for another pint of porter; after that we had a quartern of gin to drink; I gave him a part, and part I took myself. We came out of the public house and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300047"></xptr>turned up the first street which led from the public house, where he gave me a sixpence; I asked him for more money, he said he would give me more if he had it; then upon my refusing him the favour, he caught hold of me and called the watch.</p>

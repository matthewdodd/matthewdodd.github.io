                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I said I thought they were doing wrong by having a still, the prisoner said "I have been here twenty-five years and know better than you"—that was after I had signed the agreement, and I did not supply anything after that—I began to supply the syrup at the end of December, or the beginning of January—I supplied three loads altogether—I was not there when the Excise officers seized the still; I heard of it afterwards—I attended at Lambeth police-court, on 29th May, when the prisoner was fined 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and Monet 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for selling some of the brandy—I was not a witness—I had nothing to do with the seizure—I never sold or had any of the brandy—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of molasses was supplied before 24th March—I mean by "customer" some person to whom I owed money, and when I was not in a position to give" them a cheque I sent an accept<lb></lb>ance—there is not truth in the suggestion, that I gave this, or the other bill, to the prisoner—I did not know who took the bill out of my desk.</p>

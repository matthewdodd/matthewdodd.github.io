               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes, he is <rs id="t17980418-99-deflabel531" type="occupation">in the lamplighting way</rs>

               <p>Q.How came you not to stop him? - A. I did not know how to go about it, I told my master of it as soon as I saw him, and my master had him taken up</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the same man that took away your trimming pot and your oil? - A. I am. This is it, (producing it); the oil has been used, I am sure it is the same that I had put upon the watch-box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was coming along and saw this trimming pot standing at the door, I looked at it knowing it, and wondered to see it there; and I went away, and he came after me and challenged me with stealing it; I did not meddle with it.</p>

             sworn. - I am a brushmaker, opposite Mrs. Heywood's: On Tuesday morning, the 17th of March, I saw the prisoner, Mary Selby, go into Mrs. Haywood's passage, and then one of the lodgers in the house came out, and the prisoner ran out into the court; she came up again, and went into the passage, and her husband followed her in.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was her husband? - A. He said so at Bow-street; then she came and watched at the door; her husband came out, and put his hand to his waistcoat pocket; he stood looking two yards within the door, but did not proceed into the shop; I then saw the woman come out with the scale-beam under her apron; the man came out at the same time behind her; upon which I ran to her and laid hold of her, and said, that won't do, you shan't have it; I held her fast, and called out for assistance, but could get none; I then took her back into Mrs. Haywood's passage, with the beam; when I laid hold of her, the man ran away; there was but one man that I could see in the street to get any assistance, and he would not, by that means the man got off; and the next morning, as I was going to work, I met the man in the next passage; I told him I knew him, that I saw him in a place he should not have been in, and then he set off and run; I went to get some of my shopmates to assist me, and a man immediately came to tell me he was taken; I am sure he is the same man. (Produces the scale-beam).</p>
               <p>Mrs. Haywood. It was hung upon a hook in the passage, with a wire round it, to prevent its being taken away.</p>
               <p>Wells. There is a small bit of wire round it, which appears to have been broke.(Alice wills confirmed the evidence of her husband).</p>

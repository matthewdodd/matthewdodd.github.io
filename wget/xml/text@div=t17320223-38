            , Waterman. I was about 6 or 7 Yards from the Prisoner when the Sash was broke, I saw him smash the window with his hand thus - and snatch out the Handkerchief; he ran away towards Tower-hill, I pursued him, he dropt the Handkerchief in the Mud, and presently after fell down himself, and so I took him. There was another Fellow with him when he broke the window, but he got off. A little Boy took up the Handkerchief and gave it me, and I gave it to Mr. Lambard. This is the Handkerchief, you may see where 'tis cut with pulling through the Glass.</p>

                  </hi>. On 26th July, I followed Parsonage from Fenchurch Street at 4.10—he took no ticket—he passed Bodger there, got out of the train at Stepney, and went down the steps slowly, looking behind him—Daniels was at the barrier—Parsonage did not produce or give up any ticket, he passed and nudged him with his elbow, and Daniels said "How are you, old boy?"—next day, the 27th, Parsonage entered Stepney Station about 9.30, Daniels was on duty—Parsonage passed by him a little way, then returned and spoke to him—I did not hear what was said—I was six or seven yards away—I saw Daniels take from his right-hand trowsers pocket a number of tickets, and after examining them, he gave Parsonage one—it was a third-class clipped ticket—I could not see the station—Parsonage held it up between his two fingers, and I could just see the clip between his fingers—he then went on by the train—I should think Daniels took as many as thirty tickets from his pocket, a good handful, a</p>

I have seen Daniels at the barrier at Stepney, and have seen Parsonage pass through when Daniels has been there, eight or nine times or more—I have never seen him produce a ticket to Daniels, or give one up—I have seen him go through repeatedly without doing so; he used generally to keep both hands in his waistcoat pocket—I have heard them speak together, and they used to go and drink together—and one night I heard Daniels say to Parsonage, "Your friend (meaning me) can come by at any time"—Parsonage lived at Stepney, just opposite the station, thirty or forty yards off.</p>

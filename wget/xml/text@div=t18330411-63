            . I am a Policeman. In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's house, in Bear-street, Leicester-square, on the 22nd of February, and apprehended him; I asked him if he knew Langley - he said he did; I asked if he had received any rings from Langley - he said he had, and had sold them to Mr. Davis, of Belton-street, Short's-gardens; I asked if he was not to have 10s. for his trouble - he said he was, and that he had received the money; I got a warrant, and searched Davis's premises, but did not find the rings.</p>

            . I know nothing about Ridge, except that he acknowledged to the Magistrate that he had been in company with Langley, and sold five rings for 35s. - he said he had been with Langley, and had received 10s. for selling them at No. 11, Belton-street, Short's-gardens - that there were three females in the place, and they sold them to one of them; the rings were mentioned as having been stolen from my house by Langley - none of the property has been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went with him to sell them, but knew nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>DANIEL MOBBS. He told me he had sold the rings to Mrs. Davis, in Short's-gardens - I went there, and found a woman answering to that name; it appeared a broker's shop outside, but we found things there which should not be at a broker's.</p>

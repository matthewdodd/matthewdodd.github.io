               <p>Q. What sort of watch was it?</p>
               <p>Patrick. A silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put it when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Patrick. I had it in my hand, and put it again in my breeches, and put them under my pillow. I told the woman of the house what had happened, and she took and brought the prisoner to justice Fielding's, between nine and ten o'clock. There my watch was produced, and I swore to it (produced in court, and deposed to) there is my name upon the dial plate.</p>

            . The prisoner was brought to Mr. Fielding's about ten o'clock in the morning, I don't know the day of the month. Justice Fielding desir'd me to search her. I did, and could not find it. She call'd me into the passage, and delivered it into my hand. She said she had pawn'd it for half a guinea, but she had it I believe in her hand when I searched her.</p>

               <p>Last Sunday was a month I met the prosecutor. He was very drunk, and made me so. He desired me to put the watch in pawn, he having no money. I took it, and got up and went away about my business with it, but not with an intent to steal it. I delivered myself up to justice Fielding without any warrant, and gave him his watch.</p>

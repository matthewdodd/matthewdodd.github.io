                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Richard Alfred March, a hatter in Eastcheap. On the 30th of April I saw the prisoner at the door—he reached in at the door, took a cap and walked out—I ran after him, and caught him in Leadenhall-market—he got under a butcher's stall—I brought him out—be threw himself into the gutter—I dragged him up—he asked a man to give me a good <hi rend="italic">hiding</hi>—he said it was his cap, his father had just bought it for him—he had the cap on his head—this is it—it is my master's—he had no cap of his own—I was standing at the door at the time he stole it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the shop—I saw the prisoner on the other side of the way, and Elder in pursuit of him—I saw the prisoner holding the cap down by the wall—Elder ran after him, and brought him back in about five or ten minutes—I pulled him in, and asked where he got the cap from—he said his father bought it a fortnight ago at my brother's shop—I gave him into custody—the cap was quite new.</p>

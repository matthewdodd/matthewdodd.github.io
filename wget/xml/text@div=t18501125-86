                  </hi>. I am a carman, in the service of Mr. James Patteshall Jones. On Friday night last, at a quarter-past seven o'clock, I was un<lb></lb>loading some sacks of fat, at Mr. Jones's, in Fenchurch-street—l went inside with one sack—when I returned to the cart again I missed a sack out of my cart, containing 1 cwt. of fat, belonging to Mr. Jones—a gen<lb></lb>tleman passing by spoke to me, and I followed a cart going in the direction of London-bridge—the prisoner was driving it, and them was another man in it—I came up with it near Mark-lane—previous to my getting to it I saw the prisoner, assisted by the other man, roll the sack of fat out of the cart—I made my way to the horse's head as soon as possible; the prisoner and the other man got out at the back of the cart and ran away—I called stop thief!—there was an officer close by—the sack was left in the street, and I and the officer put it back in the cart.</p>

                  </hi>. ( <hi rend="italic">City-policeman.,</hi> 516) About a quarter-past seven o'clock last Friday evening I saw Marman running—I ran after the pri<lb></lb>soner—I ran past the horse and cart, and saw Marman lay hold of the reins—the moment he did that, the prisoner, who was in the cart, jumped out and ran away—I ran and came up with him at the corner of Billiter-street—he was then in custody of another officer—I saw the bag of fat in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How near were you to the cart when you first saw the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four or five yards from the horse's head—I did not lose sight of the prisoner—there was not a crowd—it was a very wet night and few persons about—he was taken about twenty yards from the cart——there were several persons there—I had called "stop thief!"—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man—I took charge of the cart, and took it to the greenyard—it had a name on it, bottom upwards.</p>

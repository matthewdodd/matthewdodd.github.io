               <p>Q. Was it by the lamp-light that you discovered it to be a man's head? - A. There was a lamp about a yard from him; I got up and awaked Mr. Clarkson; I was not gone two minutes; Mr. Clarkson returned with me; the man was then gone; we waited a short time, and the man came again to the fan-light; that might be in about five minutes; he went away again, and returned in a few minutes, when he put his arm through the glass of the fanlight, and Mr. Clarkson seized it, while I went out at another door, and secured him outside.</p>

               <p>Q. How high is this fan-light from the ground? - A. Ten feet; he must have been assisted by somebody; I did not see any other person when I came out; the prisoner is the man that I secured; I missed a shirt which I had seen at eight o'clock the night before; it was hanging upon the line, near the fanlight; there were three hanging upon the line, but this was the only one within his reach.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any shirt upon him? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of light was it? - A. It was then twilight.</p>

               <p>Q. So that you could easily distinguish the features of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

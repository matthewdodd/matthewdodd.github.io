               <p>I live at Kilburn Wells, I was coming to town on the 19th of December, about twenty minutes after seven in the morning, I overtook the prisoner with a bag on his shoulder, which is here now, I asked him what he was loaded with, he said his own wearing apparel, I asked him where he was come from, and he said from Watford, this was on the Edgware road, he said he had lived at Watford and left his place, I told him I insisted on seeing what he had in his bag, he readily laid it down without hesitation, I opened the bag and took out various articles of wearing apparel, and among the rest some women's, I asked him who that belonged to, he said to his wife, he afterwards said he came from Stanmore, that he had carried them down to Stanmore and was then taking them to her to London, I took him and the property to Bow-street; the things have been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>(The things deposed to by Mr. and Mrs. Gurney.)</p>

               <p>Mr. Gurney. Here are various apparel that the prisoner had pawned, they were his property, and I took them out of pawn for him, and took them to my house under my care, I did not mean he should have them till satisfaction was made for the money; there was a black cloak, value 6 d. two linen womens gowns, a white waistcoat, two pair of black plush breeches, two shirts, a white linen waistcoat, three muslin handkerchiefs, an old coat, and a waistcoat.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>

               <p>I lived with my brother, Mrs. Gurney is my own sister, and my brother-in-law took these things out of pawn, but he did not tell me that I should not have the things; my witnesses did not know that I was to be tried to day; the prosecutor wanted me to leave my wife.</p>

               <p>Jury to Mrs. Gurney. Did you ever say any thing to the prisoner at the bar about his wife, or about leaving his wife? - He complained of her as a person that had brought him to poverty.</p>

               <p>Court. Did you promise to give him any of these things in case he should leave his wife? - No, I took them out of pawn for fear she should sell them out and out.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH - sworn. I am servant to Mr. Kemshead. On the 28th of April as I sat at my dinner, about two o'clock, in the kitchen, I saw the prisoner shut the door three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner work in your house. - A. No, she came for the washing, she was in a room below in the house; seeing her shut the door three times, I went up the last time to see what she shut herself in for, the door had wooden panes and one pane was out, I looked through, I saw her take one silver spoon out of a glass that had wine and water in, it had just come out of the coffee room, she put it in her bosom, I ran and told the head waiter, the waiter told master, and master sent for her back.</p>
               <p>Q. When she put the spoon in her bosom she went away out of the house did she. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) You remember when the waiter told you that the spoon was lost. - A. I do, in consequence of that my waiter brought her back from the Swan, at Charing Cross, I immediately ordered a constable to be fetched, he came, and took up the prisoner.</p>
               <p>- CLEMENTS sworn. I am a constable. On the 28th of April, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I was ordered at Mr. Kempshead's, to take the prisoner into custody; I searched her, and found these two spoons I now produce, they were twisted up in the corner of her apron which she held in her hand.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. One of the spoons is marked with a cross and a K, I am certain that is my spoon, with regard to the other, I will not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My mistress told me to make haste with the basket of clothes, and as I came back to bring one of the children with me, I brought two with me, I asked the cook for a little bit of bread and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180605210026"></xptr>meat, I just shut the door after me while I eat some of it, then there was a parcel of dirty coarse kitchen cloths, which I put in my apron, as we never put them with the clean linen; the waiter came after me, he says you are wanted back, I went back with him, Mr. Kempshead told me to sit down, he locked the door, I says what is the matter, he says I do not know, but if it is true you may be transported; these cloths I laid down on the table, and when the constable came I took the cloths up in this hand, the constable searched me, and when he had done that, he takes these greasy cloths, and the two spoons fell out.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Clements) When you took the spoons from the prisoner at the bar, had she any thing in her hand but her apron rolled up. - A. There was no towel about her, there were only the two spoons in the corner of her apron; she was very loth to let me open her hand.</p>

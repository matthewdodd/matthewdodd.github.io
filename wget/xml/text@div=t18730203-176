                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of (adder's Green—on Monday, 13th January, I found a duck tied up in a handkerchief, in a ditch in one of my fields—it was afterwards produced before the Magistrate—there was a remand for a week, and after that I found the name "J. Draper "on the handkerchief—I gave it to the officer, and it was produced on the second occasion—the field is 500 or 600 yards from the road—there is no public way through it—I pointed out to young Mr. Trevelyan where I found the duck, and he pointed out to me where the assault took place—it was in the same field—the two places were 150 yards apart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am aware that, after this, there was an altercation between the prisoners and the two young Trevelyans, and that there is a charge of assault hanging over them—I don't believe I said anything about finding the duck tied up in a handkerchief on the first occasion, but I did on the second, which was two or three days after I think—I said a girl in my employ had washed it—she is not here—she is still in my employ—I was not asked by any one before as to who washed it—she took it and washed it.</p>

I live with my father at the Oaks, at Hendon—on Sunday, 12th January, I was in the garden, and saw one of the prisoners, I cannot say which, leaning over the fence—there was a dog inside—my father came up—I did not see anything done to my younger brother, but we followed the prisoners for about a mile; they turned off, and went across three fields—when they got to Mr. Sharman's field, I turned through a gap, and my brother joined me—the elder prisoner said "What are you coming after us for?" and knocked my brother down, and sat on the back of his head—I went to assist him, and the younger prisoner, I believe, knocked me down, for I found him on the top of me—he caught me round the neck, and nearly <hi rend="italic">throttled</hi> me—they then went away—I said to my brother "I know one of them;" that was the younger one—one of them went on one side and the other on the other side of the hedge where the duck was found.</p>

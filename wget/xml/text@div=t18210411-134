            . I keep a cart of my own. I was drinking with Cavenaugh at a public-house, at Wapping, in the evening. He asked if I would have a bit of flour to take home. He had worked with me about four years ago, at a meal warehouse. I said I did not care. I gave him my handkerchief, and he went and fetched me some. I knew he was in Walter's employ. He brought me back 7 lbs. His wife came in and asked if he was coming home. (The public-house is in front of the prosecutor's) - he asked her to drink some porter; she went on, and he and I came after. There was something under her shawl. I did not see who gave it her. I was taken before the Magistrate, and have been in custody seven weeks.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JUDGE. On the 6th of March, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw Russell loitering about the dock bridge, with something under his arm. I went away, and coming back, I saw Russell and Wise together. I asked Wise what he had got there - he said, a little flour. In the mean time Russell went into the road. I went after her, and asked what she had got - she made no answer. I found it was 10 lbs. of flour. Wise had 7 lbs. Russell said she brought her's from St. Catherine's, and Wise said he gave a man two pots of porter for his.</p>

I asked who he worked for - he said Mr. Walters. I went and searched Mr. Walter's sacks, and found them open, and some taken out. Cavenaugh said there was some taken from almost every sack in the warehouse, and that he took it out. He said it fell out of the sacks and he picked it up.</p>
               <p>MR. WALTERS. These sacks were opened, which was improper. It is not sweepings.</p>

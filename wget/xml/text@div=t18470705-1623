                  </hi> I am in partnership with two others, as clothiers, at No, 87, Tower-hill. The prisoner was in our employ for about three years, to assist in taking in and giving out work—he was foreman of the cutters—my brother sent a pair of trowsers to be repaired—they would find their way into the prisoner's department—they were lost—I asked the prisoner several times about them, he said they were lost, that they were gone from the warehouse, and had got mixed amongst the goods—he said he had looked for them, and could not find them—these now produced are the trowsers—I was with the officer when he went to the prisoner's lodging—he found in a drawer in the pri <lb></lb>soner's bed-room, a duplicate corresponding with this duplicate of the trowsers.</p>

                  </hi> I am assistant to Mr. Maurice Moses. I know these trowsers—we made them for Mr. Hyam Moses—I do not know the name of the tailor who made them—the stuff was ours—we saw them before Mr. Hyam Moses had them—I recollect their being sent to be repaired about three months ago—I have seen Mr. Hyam Moses wearing them—they have passed though my hands, when they came back to be repaired—they were lost—I asked the prisoner about them—he told me on one occasion that he gave them to a man, who brought them home, and handed them to him, and that he handed them to me—that was not true.</p>

Q.</hi> What do you know them by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the pattern, by the cut, and by this scorch—I am not in the habit of having my trowsers made in this manner, but the last I had were made after this pattern—we generally trim the trowsers, or fit them up in a certain manner; and these are fitted up in the same manner as mine—the buttons are the same as we have had in the house these six years—I have one of them here—it is a very peculiar button—the owners of these trowsers, I should think, are Messrs, Moses—they were in their hands to get repaired—the gentleman to whom they did belong, is gone to Van Dieman's Land—I saw him in the vessel on the 1st of July—I do not know when these trowsers were found at the pawn-broker's—perhaps it may be ten days or a fortnight ago—I know the trow<lb></lb>sers well—we buy the stuff, and make them up—it is not a common pattern—it is the only one I have seen of this kind—I do not know where they bought it—that is not my business.</p>

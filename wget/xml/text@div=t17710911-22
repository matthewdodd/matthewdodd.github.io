               <p>Q. How far was he from Mr. Milsworth's house when you overtook him?</p>
               <p>Davis. Not a quarter of a mile; my fellow-servant asked him where he was going to carry this copper to, and where he brought it from; he said, Mr. Clark's, at Shepherd's Bush, and I said, what do you make this in your way, which is a mile about; he said, he was bringing it to Mr. Shenn's, at Holborn Hill. Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177109110015"></xptr> Milsworth's house is on the top of Craven Hill, by Baise Water; he could make no excuse till he put the copper down, then he took to his legs and strove to make his escape. I overtook him, and then he said, he did not come out with any seen design as to take the copper away; him and his partner that was with him went with Mr. Stain into Mr. Milsworth's round house where they saw the copper; and, he said, he thought it was his property as well as anothers.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day did you first see him?</p>
               <p>Davis. About eight in the evening.</p>

            . I saw the copper on the prisoner's head; I was the first that spoke to him I believe; soon after he set the copper down, they ran away, I went after him, the other ran the other way; when I came back he was taken.</p>

            . I am a constable; I was sent for upon this occ asion; I saw the copper; I shewed them the place where it was took out of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner carried to the house where the copper came from?</p>
               <p>Mayner. No; I asked him how he came to do so, he said, he was going by there and saw the copper, and that it was his property as well as any bodies, as the house and goods were in Chancery. I took him to Sir John Fielding's.</p>

               <p>The person that was with me had the copper on his head, and asked me to carry it; I said if he would pay me, I would; he said, he would give me a shilling to carry it, it was to go to Mr. Sheen's, he said, Holborn Hill. I have been clerk to Mr. Sayer who belongs to the Charter house.</p>

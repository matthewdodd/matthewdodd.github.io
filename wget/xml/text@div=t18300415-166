               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did he leave you? A. On the 20th of 21st of February, and this charge was preferred on the week following, when the bills were returned that were outstanding; he was taken on the following Monday I think - he had been sent for to our house; we took him; he had set up a fishmonger's-shop himself - it was about the 1st of March, we sent for him: I did not ask him how he was going on in business - I have not made any bet about his conviction; nor offered any; there was a bet offered me, whether the crime was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150084"></xptr>transportable one or not - I really forget who the person was I made it with; I think it was a person of the name of Butler, but I had forgotten it altogether.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the wager? A. A bottle of wine, that if he were convicted he would be transported; several other persons have offered to lay wagers with me, which I declined, because I thought it was wrong.</p>

             were at that meeting - Mr. Riley and I have had misunderstandings on the subject of these accounts, but not on my mode of keeping them; I did not keep them, the prisoner did - he has asked me from time to time if there has been overplusses in the account, which there sometimes has, but more frequently not; I was not accustomed to go through the items of bills received by the prisoner every night, or I should have detected many other robberies - I did not state to the Magistrate, that I went through the accounts with him every night; I saw the nominal amount and took it of him - if he had given me but 49l. and put down 50l. I should have known it; he has paid more money than he has accounted for, but more frequently less - it has appeared that there has been a larger sum in the till, than has been put in the books; it may have been so twenty times; there has been trifles over; I have consulted the prisoner about them, but I put them into my pocket; he said to me, "It is not worth while to put them down, I consider you are a loser by the surplusses whatever they are;" I never had any misunderstanding with Riley on this subject.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mean by stating you had no difference about the accounts, when you stated you had had misunderstanding about them? A. He suggested that if there were any surplusses or minutes they should be put down, but there was more frequently a minus than surplusses - I did not suspect the prisoner at all.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now turn to your ledger, and see if you can find the entries of these payments? A. They are entered as goods sold, but not made paid, he ought to enter all monies that are received in the cash-book - there is one book wanting; I did not hear the prisoner complain of the want of that book before the Magistrate - I do not recollect his solicitor asking for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner call for that book by his solicitor before the Magistrate, and was not your answer that it was lost? A. Really I have no recollection of it, and I do not see how it could favour his case at all; I have no doubt he took it away - if I did state it was lost, I stated the fact, but I have no recollection of it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it an earlier book? A. Yes - it had nothing to do with these accounts.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you any thing to do with the keeping of the ledger? A. No, the prisoner has entered these accounts in the ledger, but we never take any cash accounts from there - it is put down in the ledger in red ink, "Paid, E. Townsend," which makes the robbery the greater and the more flagrant; his entering it there is no proof of his honesty - all money received ought to be accounted for in the cash-book; this does not afford a means of conviction - he did not state to me on the evening in question, that I should find them in going through this book, and explain to me the mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not explain to you that when you were in the shop, if a customer came in you would receive the money, and give him the bill to receipt? A. No, not at that time - I always handed to him every farthing I had received in the day, before we closed our accounts at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this one of the circumstances of the misunderstanding between Mr. Riley and you? A. No, it was never mentioned - I have not paid money out of my pocket without considering where it came from; I have told the prisoner to put it down, and have accounted to him for every farthing - there has been as much as 1l. surplus of a night, but we have accounted for it next day satisfactorily; it has been some bill omitted by the prisoner - that has not often happened; there have been frequent dificiencies, but I never considered he would be so base as to rob me, they were treated as mistakes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever given him a moment to enter into explanation on the subject of these three bills? A. Yes, about three weeks or a month previous to his leaving my employ, my partners were dissatisfied and particularly Mr. Riley; I spoke to the prisoner, and there were a great many bills came in; I believed him honest, and I paid 6l. 10s. out of my own pocket.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he questioned about there particular bills? A. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. CLARKSON. Q. Will you swear he was questioned about any one of them, except on the night he came to your house? A. Yes, Mr. Riley and my brother were present. I am clear I spoke to him about these three accounts before the night he came to my house; there can be no mistake about that - these accounts were included with many others; that was not because Mr. Riley laid the whole blame of keeping the accounts to me - he never blamed me; Mr. Riley and I had no misunderstanding before the Magistrate about them; Mr. Rawlinson did not remenstrate with me on the subject of my misunderstanding with Mr. Riley - he blamed me for my neglect, in trusting too much to the prisoner; he was held to bail, but did not get bail.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Does that other book relate to this case? A. No; when the prisoner received money it was his duty to enter it in the cash book.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In making my defence it will be necessary for me to state the way and manner of our keeping our accounts; he commenced by giving me a certain sum of money to which at night was added all accounts of money and bills received - it has frequently<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150085"></xptr>happened there was a surplus over, and he would say he did not recollect, but he supposed he must have gone to the place where he kept his money and mixed it; in the course of a week or a fortnight the bill has come back receipted, and he would say that must be the bill that made the surplus on such or such a night; as it respects the dates of the bills in question that was the time the fish was had, not when the money was paid; these bills were among those surplusses - he has received money, and I have receipted the bills; he has frequently told me not to mind putting down a bill or two, as it would be found on paying the next bill - the night I was taken he asked whether I would have the kindness to come down to trim his accounts; I said certainly, and on the Monday he asked if he should see me that evening - I went; I explained many things to them - they then brought many other things against me, and I rose to go home, when they told me I was in custody; Mr. Riley had a final settlement every Monday night, and if there had been an error one night he must have discovered it on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>MR. RILEY. I did compare the ledger and cash-book on Monday evening, and that was the way this was detected.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there often a surplus? A. No, my Lord. We have ascertained that he has called over a name from the cash-book which was not down; he called the bills, and I compared it with the ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear the sums here charged were omitted in the cash-book? A. I cannot say that; I well remember one instance in which he did.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you not two shops? A. We have a shop in Orange-street. The prisoner set up in business between that and our other shop.</p>

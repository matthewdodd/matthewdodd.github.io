               <p>Q. What do you mean by a terrible crash? A. Breaking in the windows and window-frames with brick-bats and stones; and part of a flat iron, without a handle, was thrown into the bar - I could hardly hear their expressions; for the shouts were very tremendous, and some observations passed - there was a general huzza; they broke in the windows and frames, and demolished the chairs in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did people come in through the window? A. Yes, they did - I could see four or five; but how many were outside it was impossible to state - when they came in, they endeavoured to catch hold of Mr. Miller and part of his men - he was under the necessity of leaving the house entirely to their mercy; and both Mr. Miller and the coallumpers, whom he employed, were obliged to leave the house and fly for their lives in all directions - Mr. Miller had some money in a basin on the table in the kitchen, which is a back room - a good deal more damage was done to my house, - they went up stairs - they pulled down a partition in the tap-room and the parlour, and the brick wall was pulled down - the brick wall which was pulled down was behind the house, in the garden - that was part of the house - I did not see any of the persons to distinguish their persons.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who is Miller? A. A person who employs a number of men as lumpers in the coal trade - my house is a beer-shop, in which the men were usually paid - I have nothing to do with the coal trade myself - Miller has no interest in my house at all - I had not the least quarrel myself with the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing to induce them to have any animosity towards you, whatever they might have had towards Miller? A. Not the least - I believe there was some ill will on the part of the men towards Miller, but I had nothing to do with it - I have not the least doubt that Miller would have been murdered, if he had not made his escape.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have very little doubt their object was to wreak a very atrocious vengeance on him? A. I rather think it was so.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Before they came to where Miller was, did they break in your windows as you have described? A. Yes; they knew that Miller resorted to my house to pay his men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it a notorious thing in the neighbourhood that Miller's pay-table was at your house? A. He used to check and pay there almost every evening - he has sometimes paid a hundred and fifty men of a night there - I have seen from a hundred to a hundred and twenty paid there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183402200007"></xptr>Q. Was there a difference among the coal-whippers - were they in two parties? A. It is impossible for me to say - I believe some worked at one price and some at another - there was never a disturbance at my house before - I lost 3l. 16s. from my up-stairs room - some of the mob went up stairs - I do not know what became of Miller's basin and money - I cannot say how many persons there were at the time the mob entered; I should suppose there were twenty-five or thirty - the mob dispersed us all - I was under the necessity of disguising myself, and getting into the next house, and the people there tried to prevent my remaining there - they were afraid of being murdered as well - I was not kept out of my own house more than seven or eight minutes myself, before I returned to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the policemen come? A. Yes; two of them acted like men; they were Barton and Sheen; they certainly did their duty - they called me from over the wall, and said the mob were all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When the mob came in through the window which was broken, did they do anything directly to the partition between that room and the next? A. Brick-bats and stones were thrown to such an extent that every part was demolished, both the window-frame and everything.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the partition between that room and the other pulled down? A. Quite demolished - that was between the tap-room and the parlour.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You pay your men by the ton, I believe? A. Yes; I pay them now a penny a ton - there was no discontent among my men - I believe there has been a great deal of dissention on the subject on the coast of Wapping - it was formerly three halfpence a ton, then reduced to five farthings, and then to a penny - there have been disorders among the whippers at several houses on the coast of Wapping, and several breaches of the peace, but not at our house - these prisoners were not among the men I employed.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Of your own personal knowledge, have there been any riots or breaches of the peace among coal-whippers? A. There had been pieces of work on the coast of Wapping at different houses - I am positive of that.</p>

I formerly worked at coal work, and live in Dean-street, Shadwell - I have been in Miller's employ - on the 6th of February I was at the White Lion before the mob came - I was there between eight and nine o'clock - I was standing near the front door, and the prisoner Kippin entered the door - a large mob was outside - he scarcely entered the door before brick-bats and stones came through the window like a shower of hail - Kippin rushed himself in - the door was not open - he pushed it open and rushed in, and immediately the volley of stones and brick-bats came through the window in such a manner, it alarmed us - we did not know what was amiss - I then turned from the front door and made my escape backwards - I did not see Kippin do anything except rush in at the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the mob come in the house before you left? A. No; I got away before they came - I did not hear Kippin say anything.</p>

             (policeman). I went to the White Lion on the evening of the 6th - I was in Stepney-fields about two hundred yards from the White Lion, and heard a shout of huzza - I ran towards the house - when I got to the corner of the street, I saw a body of persons, I should think between four and five hundred, as near as I can calculate - I heard the stones rattling against the house, at the time I got to the corner - I then ran between the house and the mob, drawing my staff at the same time, and told them to withdraw - I then jumped over the ditch - I saw two or three stones thrown at the house, while I was there - I received one blow from a stone or brick-bat - before I jumped the ditch, I saw Batt standing on the opposite side, among the mob - in fact, he was in front of the mob - he threw two stones or brick-bats - I cannot say which - after going a little way back into the field, I jumped over the ditch again, went to the house, and was about entering the house - I had one leg in, when the stones came rattling about me - I got over the ditch again, and drove the mob further back - I returned to the house, entered it, and called for the landlord - I received no answer, and called a light, which my brother constable brought - I turned round to the window, and saw some respectable persons, as I took them to be - I charged them to aid and assist, and enter the house with me - they did so - we searched the bottom of the house, and then went up stairs - I found the front bed-room door broken open - the back bed-room door was fastened - I returned down stairs, and went out into the back yard; called for the landlord; found him in the next yard - he spoke to me at the wall - I returned to the White Lion - there was search made, and some money found scattered about - it was picked up by different persons - there was eight shillings in silver, and four shillings and seven pence halfpenny in copper - I heard, some time afterwards, that a person was taken into custody - I went to the watch-house, about two hours and a half after, and saw the prisoner Batt in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say anything to the mob assembled about their proceedings? A. I told them to desist throwing; and the first man who threw a stone I would knock down, and take him in custody; but I knew my life was in danger - I cannot identify the other men; but next day I apprehended Kippin from information - I asked where he was the night before - he said, "At the White Lion," but he knew nothing about the row.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go in the house? A. Yes: with Bardon - there were whole bricks in the house, and parts of bricks, and stones - one of the constables has one stone.</p>

             (police-sergeant). I went into the house - I cannot identify any of the prisoners - I found brick-bats and stones there, which had been thrown, and I produce some of them - these are not paving stones, but large stones which had been placed on the road; and here is one brick-bat - I saw a great portion of the front of the house and the inside demolished - it was apparently done by the bricks and stones which lay inside - a portion of the wainscoating, and the sashes which divide the parlour and the tap-room, and the window of the tap-room were entirely broken - the glass and sashes were broken in, the wood work as well as the glass.</p>

I am innocent" (this was after it was over) - they were a mile, I dare say, from the White Lion - they were coming along in a riotous way - they stopped opposite the Pewter Platter, and broke the window - they were a disorderly mob - I took hold of Kippin, and a mob came and rescued him from me directly - I saw nothing of Donoghue - I apprehended him in Brook-street, Ratcliff-highway, two days afterwards (on Saturday) - in going to the watch-house, he said, "Mr. Murray, what have you taken me for?"

               <p>COURT. Q. How far did you see him go with the mob? A.

            . I am a surveyor - I examined the house of Mr. Lidyard, and found the sashes of the window in the front of the tap-room broken to pieces, as well as the glass that was in - the sash was broken to pieces, but not the outside frames - the middle frame, which we call the sash, which are the divisions between the panes - the frames were merely damaged with blows - the window of the front bed-room, over the tap-room, was literally broken, and the sash part and the frame damaged - the top part of the street-door had a sash, which was broken to pieces, and the door injured with blows from stones and brick-bats - the tap-room door, or rather the passage-door between the passage and tap-room, had the sash broken in, and the casement which turns on hinges - there was a pair of doors between the tap-room and parlour - one of those doors had a sash in it which was broken to pieces, and the panel of the other door was broken out - the back-yard wall was taken down, and the chairs in the tap-room broken to pieces - the wainscoat between the tap-room and the room behind was broken, and one panel broken out, and a panel between the tap-room and passage broken, and the partition very much injured with heavy blows - this all appeared to have been done with stones and brick-bats, by violent means.</p>

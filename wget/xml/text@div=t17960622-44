One kersymere waistcoat, a cloth coat, a pair of stockings he had on his legs, a linen handkerchief; he had the rest of the things tied up in a bundle; the kersymere waistcoat has got W. W. upon it; there is none of the other things marked, but I am sure they are all mine, I have had them ever since, the Justice told me not to wear any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say to you at the public-house? - A. He cried out for mercy, and said, he would give up every thing to me directly.</p>

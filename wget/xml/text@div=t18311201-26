I have known the prisoner two or three years - I appointed him to come to my house on Wednesday, the 9th of November; I was out, but found him waiting when I returned at half-past nine o'clock in the morning; I was going to recommend him to a gentleman to put up some curtains. On the Saturday following I missed a flute, which cost me 25s. - I went to the prisoner's lodging, but he was out; I went again on the Monday, saw him, and accused him of taking the flute - he denied it; I told him we had found it, and that he had pawned it for 15s. - he then said, "I did take it out, as my little boy was crying for something to eat, and I intended to return it;" he gave up the duplicate.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner at his lodging, in Windmill-street; I accused him of stealing the flute - he made no answer, but when I told him we had found it at the pawnbroker's, he said he would give up the duplicate, which he did; he said he did it through distress, and he meant to redeem it again - I found 6s. 0 1/2d. on him, which he said was part of the money he kept to redeem the flute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not find my apartment in great distress? A. I did - I know his wife went away about four years ago. and left him with an infant family, which I believe preyed on his mind.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a written Defence, pleading extreme poverty - he received a good character.</p>
               <p>MR. HARVEY. He was employed on the job I spoke of from the Wednesday till the Saturday, and he received a guinea for it.</p>

None of the family heard any noise in the night or at the time when the burglary was supposed to have been committed. All that I know myself respecting it is, that I was alarmed in the morning by Miss Forbes who was in the house, by whom I was informed that a robbery had been committed, upon which I went down, and found the things I have mentioned had been taken out of the house; upon the matter being known in the neighbourhood, a suspicion sell upon the prisoner. Some of the pewter plates which had been lost out of the house upon that night, were brought to me in the afternoon of the 28th, which is the day on the morning of which the robbery had been committed; they were brought to me by King;

               <p>I am servant to Miss Walker; I am the only servant in the family. About six in the morning I came down and found the door which leads into the back garden, and the middle door that opens into the kitchen both open; I did not observe on the night before whether these doors were fastened, but the door into the kitchen appeared to have been forced open from the hinges at the top wide enough to put in the arm, and the bolts had been drawn open; there were no marks of violence upon the outer door, it stood as if it had been opened in the usual way; it was fastened with two bolts, but there was a breach in the tiling over the door, and I think that the hole made there was large enough for a man to get in at. I went immediately and alarmed Miss Forbes, who alarmed the rest of the family.</p>

            . When you were alarmed in the morning and went down stairs, did you observe at all the state of the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you observe the situation of the door into the kitchen? - Yes; the person had first made his way through the tiling out of the wash-house into the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Was the hole in the tiling large enough for a person to come through? - I think so.</p>
               <p>The back door was not forced, but the middle door was forced? - Yes; the middle door opens outward; the upper hinge on the outside was forced off.</p>
               <p>What were the fastenings of that door? - Two or three bolts, I think; my grandfather can answer that question better than I can.</p>
               <p>Had any of those bolts been forced open or did they appear to have been drawn open? - They appeared to have been drawn open; there were no marks of violence on the bolts.</p>
               <p>How wide is the door? - It is a common size door.</p>
               <p>Were these bolts so placed that a man's arm going in at the top could reach all these bolts? - I cannot say whether there is a bottom bolt or not.</p>

               <p>Did you observe in what state the hinges of the door were in, in the morning when you first saw it? - The upper hinge was torn off.</p>
               <p>Was the lower hinge at all taken off? - No; the upper one was forced open so that he might reach the bolts.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that a man's arm being put in where the hinge was forced, could reach both the bolts? - The door was open so that he could reach the farther part of the door.</p>

Afterwards when he was carried before the constable at the Rose and Crown, he was searched; he still persisted that he knew nothing of the matter; he was searched and nothing of Mrs. Walker's was found upon him; but upon searching the hay stack we found some other table linen, a pair of snuffers, and some other things that belonged to Mrs. Walker, in the hay.

I remember the prisoner bringing two table spoons and a silver punch-ladle to my master's shop about ten or eleven in the morning of the 28th of September to sell; they were about the value of twenty-three shillings; I bought them; the punch ladle was marked M W M; one of the table spoons was marked in the same manner, the other had a crest upon it. Upon questioning the prisoner about them; he said they belonged to his father, that his name was

               <p>On the 28th of September I remember the prisoner's coming to my master's shop; he brought a silver milk pot and five silver spoons; he left them there. Whether they were bought, or what was given for them I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>I went to lie at that hay-stack, where the people who took me said these things lay; I went to pull the hay up where these plates lay; the two men, who were fixed in the ditch, jumped out; I ran away; they catched me in the plowed field, and knocked me down. They took me to the Rose and Crown at Tottenham-cross, and examined me; they found nothing of the lady's property upon me; they put me into the cage for examination next day. I was coming up to look for work on the morning when they said these things were stolen; I found them in a handkerchief; I came to London and sold them. At night I came to lie in the stack, and they took me in the plowed field. I know nothing of the robbing the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stable-keeper, and live in White Bear-yard, Lisle-street, Leicester-square—I know the prisoner. On Tuesday evening, the 24th of Sept., about half-past six o'clock, I went with some friends to the Crown, in Cranbourne-passage—I went in the front of the house into a little bar where they serve from—the prisoner was not there then—I saw him about half an hour after I went in—I was sitting down on the seat, and he commenced bullying me, stating something about a quarrel which I had with a friend of his on the previous Saturday—he said if I served him as I had his friend he would <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> my head—I said, "In what way?"—he said, "By calling me the names you called him, or saying any words to insult me"—I laughed at him, and said, "What words would insult you?"—I called him some name, I cannot exactly say what it was, but it was something to try to irritate him, and he directly struck me—I got up, and struck him again—a scuffle ensued—I got him in the corner of the bar, and he put his finger and thumb into my mouth, and tried to <hi rend="italic">gouge</hi> my eye out—he tore my mouth—it bled very much—I said, "If you don't take your fingers out of my mouth I will bite them"—he kept them still in, and I believe I did bite them—after this</p>

               <p>scuffle we went into the parlour—I went in first, and the prisoner followed me—we took our seats in different parts of the parlour—we were sitting there an hour or an hour and a half after the scuffle—during that time the prisoner came over to me, and said why did I kick his hat—I said, "Don't let us annoy the company any more, don't let us bother, "and I moved to another part of the room, and he to the other part—no words ensued between us after that—about half an hour after, the prisoner quitted the room—before he left he said to a person sitting alongside of him, "You are not going to leave the room just yet, are you?"—he said "No"—he said, "Then you will give an eye to my coat"—he left his coat on the settle, and went out of the room—he returned in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, went and sat down in the seat he had left, and drank out of a glass of gin and water which he had left—he then picked up a bit of cigar, and walked to the fire-place, which was within six feet of me—he had been sitting seventeen or eighteen feet from me—when he came up to the fire I said to him, "Myers, don't let us bear any animosity, let us shake hands"—I was sitting in a chair at the time—he said something—whether I said, "With all my heart," or whether he did, I do not know, but the words were used—he walked towards me—I extended my right hand—he held it with his left, and shook hands with me with his left hand—he put his right hand behind him, and scuffled with his coat—I could not see what he was doing—presently he drew a large knife out, saying, "You b—, I will have your b—heart," and stabbed me just above my left breast, right in the collar-bone—I felt myself struck with the point of the knife, and got up out of the chair—he made a second thrust at my left side, but I screwed myself round from him, put out my hand, and caught the knife in my hand—it was done so momentarily that I can hardly tell whether it was a violent blow—he then drew back—the persons in the room halloed out, "Do you know what you have done? why you have murdered the man"—he said nothing, but walked backwards towards the door, and stood at the door about a minute with the knife in his hand—all the people ran after him—there were twelve or fourteen—I saw no more of him till he was in custody—the knife was picked up in the passage—my hand bled very much—I walked to Mr. Morgan's, the surgeon, and saw Mr. M'Greal, who dressed the wounds—I was under him about a fortnight—I have the use of the hand now—I cannot get it up properly—I can use it very well, but not quite the same as before.</p>

On Tuesday evening, the 24th of Sept., about eight or nine o'clock I was in the parlour, and saw the prisoner with a large butcher's knife in his hand—to the best of my belief this now produced is it—he was standing in the middle of the room looking at everybody about the rooms, after he had struck Mr. Clayard he stood there about half a minute—I went behind him, and was in the act of laying hold of him, when my master who was on the other side of the room shook his head at me not to touch him—the prisoner turned round and walked out of the room—I followed him, and going along the passage he dropped the knife—he walked as far as the beer engine in the bar, and then commenced running—at the bottom of the passage I threw him down, and gave him into custody—we had no such knife as this in our house—it does not belong to our premises—I had seen the prisoner leave about twenty-five minutes to nine, which was about ten minutes before this occurred—I saw him return—I was standing at the top of the court talking to a lad who lives opposite, and saw him coming down the court shuffling something in his left coat pocket with his right hand—I was not present when the blows were given—I heard the screaming and noise.</p>

On Tues<lb></lb>day evening the 24th, about seven o'clock I was in the bar parlour when Clayards came in—my attention was called by my daughter saying there was a fight with Clayards and Myers in front of the bar—I did not see who gave the first blow—Clayards afterwards went into the parlour, and Myers followed him some time after—I was in and out of the parlour several times—when I first saw them I think they were not far from each other, but Clayards left and went to the other end of the room, which was seventeen or eighteen feet from where Myers was sitting—that was at a subsequent part of the evening—I recollect Myers saying to a person, "Give an eye to my coat," and he went out of the house—on his return I was in the parlour—I should say it was half-past eight when he went out—it was an hour or better after the commencement—on his return he said, "I suppose there has been a good deal said about <hi rend="italic">Abey</hi> Myers"—he resumed his seat which was about seventeen feet from where Clayards was sitting—he drank and sat down—in a minute or so he went to the fire to light his cigar, and Clayards wished to make friends—I believe he said, "Let us be friendly again," or something of that sort—Clayards was at that time sitting in a chair—he held out his hand-Myers went to him to shake hands—I was sitting by the side—he put his hand behind him, and I really do not recollect seeing what he pulled from it, but in the course of a second or so Clayards was stabbed—he put hit right hand behind him, and that is all I recollect till Clayards rose and said, "I am stabbed"—I saw the knife in Myers's hand after he drew back—I hear that he struck at him twice, but it was so quick I did not see how the blow was averted at the second strike, I was so close to him—I saw him put his hand out, but I was so alarmed—I saw Clayards hand and thumb bleeding, and he was sent to the doctor's—when Myers put his hand behind him I was so frightened that I cannot say what was said—he drew himself backwards to the door, and stood—my boy came in, hearing the noise—he says I shook my head for him not to touch Myers, but I do not recollect it—I got on a seat—Myers turned round, and opened the door, and we then all ran after him—when we got to the end of the court the boy had overtaken him—I had been in the parlour about half an hour before Myers went away—during that half hour I do not think there were any words of irritation on the part of Clayards towards Myers—I think Myers was fresh in liquor, and everybody more avoided him than to enter into any debate particularly.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner before your shop on the day of the robbery. - A. Yes, on the 17th of January I saw him a little while before the robbery about the door, he had another boy with him rather less then himself they were walking before the door, I had not any suspicions of what they were about, they both of them came a little way in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180602190044"></xptr>the shop, and I think this is the one that stole the jacket; they both attempted to take it, it was hanging up withinside of the shop, and they pulled it down.</p>
               <p>Q. How high did the jacket hang. - A. Nearly out of his reach.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get it down. - A. By pulling it down with force; they succeeded in pulling it down; the moment it was down they run away with the jacket, I pursued them, and within three doors of my house I took them both; I then not seeing the jacket, undid the blue wrapper the prisoner had got on, he had the jacket concealed under it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that your jacket. - A. It was, I then brought him back, and sent for an officer, and gave charge of him.</p>
               <p>- sworn. I am an officer, I took charge of this boy in Mr. Ingle's shop, this is the jacket, I wrote my name upon it directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along, I saw a boy go into the shop, I thought he was an apprentice there; that boy came out with something under his arm, he chucked it down, and I picked it up.</p>

               <p>Parker. This was the day before the Thanks-giving-day, about six o'clock in the evening. He said, "It is a fine evening, and the weather is warm," and walked a pretty way with me. Then he took hold of my arm, dragged me a little way out of the path, took me round the middle, and then pulled my breeches open.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he take you out of the path?</p>
               <p>Parker. But a very little way; it was about as far as from where I stand to the door coming into the court [which is about six or seven yards.] Then James Brown, the soldier, came up (I was turning myself from the other) and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, you rascal, have I catch'd you?" and struck me on my breast. Another soldier came on the other side, and laid hold of

A servant that has lived in my house twenty-five years informed me, that he was never out of my house after nine o'clock since he has been with me, except on a benefit night, when he has gone to a play with the maids; he is an honest, sober, faithful servant as ever lived - I would mention to your Lordship the reason why he was in the Park at that time: I sent him the evening before Thanksgiving day with a brace of pheasants to Great Queen Street, and ordered him also to go to the white house, which is joining to the Gatehouse, Westminister, and after he had been at these places it might be about six o'clock. I have inquired since, and found he delivered his messages punctually; I mention this to shew; that he did not loiter away his time. When the soldier Brown was before justice Fielding, he desired to be admitted an evidence, which was granted. Then he could readily tell where to find the other prisoner, who was taken and brought there; then he (that is,

             had his arm round the prosecutor's neck, whose breeches were down, and Brown said he wanted to put his tongue into his mouth. I laid hold of the prosecutor, and carried him to the first centinel I came to; he offered me money several times, and said he would give me any thing in the world if I would let him go; there is the soldier at the door whom I charged with him.

             has been a lodger with me about a year and seven months. He came to me last May was twelve months, under the character of a gentleman, had regimentals on, and appeared as a person that had a commission in the army, but he said he was dismissed. He has had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175912050023"></xptr> several gentlemen come after him, one was a lawyer. I never saw any thing by him, but what answers to the character of a gentleman. A gentleman that lodges with me has left his buroe open, with the key in it, and perhaps 100 l. within side, in money and bank notes, yet never lost any thing.</p>

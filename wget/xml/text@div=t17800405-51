               <p>I am a watchman. As I was coming to town in the morning I saw the two prisoners and two other men unskewer the cart and take the property out; they laid it down on the road; then they went underneath some new houses about a couple of poles from it in the path-way. When I came opposite to them they went to the property again, and took it up, and went over a gate into the fields.</p>
               <p>Did all the four men keep together? - Yes. I went after the young man, and told him his cart had been robbed. He and I went back into the fields, and saw them with the things.</p>
               <p>Afterwards you took these two men and the other two escaped? - Yes; they were never out of my sight till we took them.</p>
               <p>How came you to suffer them to rob this cart, when you saw them, without informing the the person of it? - I did not dare attack them by myself; as soon as they were in the field I went after the cart and informed him of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Docure. Who did you receive the goods from? -

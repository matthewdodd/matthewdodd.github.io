I am an iron and brass founder, carrying on business with my brother at Deptford-green—I have seen and examined the iron now produced, it is iron that I use in my trade—this piece is called pig iron, the other is scrap iron, and this is a tool called a lifter—this scrap iron has been broken up, but not used since; it was formerly a pan—the old iron is sometimes more expensive than the new—it is mixed with new iron in order to make first-rate cast-iron—the old iron is worth 75<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton, and the new 70<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is only one piece of pig iron here, all the rest is scrap—I don't know the exact weight of the iron produced, it is 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a cwt.—it would have been used in my manufacturing process—this lifter is my property—I could not say how long since I saw it on the premises—it had been manufactured about two days before the 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—it is used to lift the inside out of a casting—it could still be used, it is not broken—I can swear to the iron—I had seen it on my premises the day before the 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, and some on the 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—I know Mott and Leaves by sight—they were not in my employment—I saw them on the premises on the 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> and 18<hi rend="italic">th</hi>—they were sent by Mr. Ayres the contractor to clear away a quantity of rubbish that we had—these pieces of iron were not amongst the rub<lb></lb>bish—they had no authority to remove a bit of it.</p>

On the evening of 18th September, about half-past 7, I met Mott and Leaves coming out of Pym's shop as I was going in—I had not seen them go in—I asked Mott what he had been there to sell—the two were close together, each of them had a bag on his arm—he said he had only been in selling some old iron—I told him he must stop, and I must have a look at it—I went with them and Margetson, a brother constable, through the shop into the back-yard—Pym was there, and I saw on the scale all the iron now produced, except this piece of wrought iron—I looked at the iron, and said to Pym, "You ought not to have bought this, I must take it away, it is wrong"—he said, "I did not think there was any harm in buying it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk in the office of the South-Eastern Railway Company. We had five copies of "Kelly's Commercial Directory" supplied to the Company at the latter end of last year, through Giles, 24, Upper King-street, Russel-square—on 17th Dec. I sent a letter there on the subject of their account—it was brought back to the office and de<lb></lb>stroyed—I have a copy of it—it was to state that if Kelly would apply to the office he should receive his account of 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in a day or two afterwards a man named Humphreys came to our office and brought the letter, and a stamped receipt, signed with name of Collin Kelly, but not filled up—this is it—</p>

                  </hi>. I am treasurer to the South-Eastern Rail<lb></lb>way Company. On 19th Dec. this receipt was produced at my office, by a man, I cannot say his name; I gave him this check on the bankers of the Company—it is marked "and Co.," so as to make it payable at a banker's—on 22nd the prisoner came with Ludlow and a postman—I asked him what he had done with the letter—he said he had thrown it down on his desk, and thought no more of it till the next morning—I asked whether he was in the habit of throwing down letters that related to money on his desk, and taking no notice of them—he said no, he was not—I said he must see the necessity of making every exertion to find out who had obtained the letter—he said when he went to look for it the next morning, he could not find it, and had not seen it since—he asked to look at the receipt; I showed it him, and after examining it he said it looked very like an imitation of his father's handwriting—he then went away, on the understanding that he was to make inquiries whether any one about his premises had taken the letter—he said it could not be any brother of his—he came to me on the Wednesday or Thursday afterwards, in the evening; he said that persons about his premises gave him a great deal of annoyance; that they were inquiring about, and watching about there, and it was doing him incalculable injury in his business; and if we would have those persons removed, he would guarantee that the money should be paid in—I told him the matter was in the hands of the solicitors of the Com<lb></lb>pany—I think he asked for the address; I gave it him; he was going to write it down, and he suddenly checked himself, and said his hands were cold, and asked me to write it down—I did not do so, but I mentioned where he would find them—I am not quite positive whether he had taken a pen in his hand—there were writing materials on the table.</p>

                  </hi>. I was acting last year as agent for Messrs. Kelly, the publishers of the "Directory."

I was informed that the money was paid—I had not received it; I have now—this receipt is not my writing; I have no knowledge of it—I was at the office when the prisoner came there—Captain Graham asked him some questions—he certainly acknowledged having received the letter, but denied all knowledge of the money—this matter then came before the Magistrate, and Humphreys has been taken into custody—on 16th Jan, I met the prisoner opposite the Bank of England, between one and two o'clock in the day—he stopped and spoke to me—that was after there had been one hearing before the Magistrate—he asked me whether I had heard anything since the last examination—I said, "No"—he said, "Of course, in your position, I do not expect you to know much about it"—I said I had heard nothing since then; it was entirely out of my hands, and I had nothing more to do with it—he said, "I had much rather have been committed by the Magistrate than to have been remanded; I should have known what to do; I should have taken it to a higher Court (to the Queen's Bench, I understood him); but as I am remanded, I do not know what course they mean to pursue"—he said, "Of course, I know all about it; it was never intended to defraud the South-Eastern Company; it was thought the letter was intended for my father, Colin Kelly, and at this season of the year we thought to do him out of it, to have a <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">spree;</hi> we intended to have paid my father in a month or two's time"—that was all that passed, as far as I can recollect—I had been at the examination to which he alluded—I had seen Thomas there—I said to the prisoner, "I understand the person Thomas, you alluded to as having received the money, was in court at the time"—he said, "I know he was," or words to that effect.</p>

I was living at 6, Gray-street, Caledonian-road—I was very ill in bed on 18th Dec. till about two o'clock—I went to Mr. Kelly about four, and he said he should want me the following morning—he had employed me before—he knew all about me—I had sold him a little timber—I am not a timber-merchant—I had been engaged for him before, and this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in payment for services rendered before—he did not pay me anything for getting the check changed—I got the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. payment for that and other services—I thought it an honest transaction, and considered I was acting with perfect propriety—I knew on the Saturday from Mr. Kelly that it was a dishonest transaction—he said it was a mistake in the check, and he would settle it—he said a person had been from the railway, there was a mistake, it was the wrong party—I know a brother of the prisoner: I do not know his name, nor where he lives—I told the officer it was the prisoner's brother who gave me the check—that was false—I was given into custody, and charged with being the person who stole this, and then I told this story—the prisoner wished me to say it was his brother—I told the officer by his request, I believed it was Mr. Thomas gave me the check—I charged an innocent man to the officer—I am now in the cigar and tobacco line, at 1, White-conduit Place, Pentonville—I have been in that line about a month—I have been out of business and out of employ for the last six or eight months—I was living on my friends—the prisoner owed me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nearly three months—I generally got 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time of him—I did carry on business as a wine-merchant—I was not in partnership with a person named Ansted—I lived in Norton-street, Titchfield-street—I went to Epsom races about ten years ago—I took wine and spirits and beer there, but it did not pay me—I was tried in 1840 for drawing a check on Wright the banker for 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., when there was not sufficient to meet it—I had 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there—I had six months for that, though it was only a mistake—that was the only time I have been in trouble—I paid a bill away, and they charged me with forgery—that was three or four years ago—I was not tried for that—I was remanded for two days—I was taken before a Magistrate, and afterwards discharged—there was an action brought—I was at Epsom with a man named Nokes, who passed bad money, but it was not then he was token—I have never been charged with keeping a brothel—I was not turned out of the house in Norton-street for it—I left the house of my own accord—I have been through the Insolvent court—I got passed the first time I came up—I know a man of the name of Sparks—I remember getting a quantity of goods sent in from Birkit's—they were not pawned at Attenborough's; they</p>

I am an attorney, but am not practising—I know Humphreys—I remember seeing him a little before Christmas in Clare-market—I saw him receive a paper from the prisoner, to the best of my belief and recollection—he afterwards showed it me—it was a check for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., like this, and signed by three servants of the railway—I heard the prisoner say, "You see and get that cashed," or something to that effect—Humphreys asked me if I knew anybody who would do it.</p>

I again saw Kelly—Humphreys was present—he said to Kelly, "You see the situation I am in now?"—Kelly said, "Yes, it cannot be helped now"—he said, "You know it was a brother of your's gave me the check"—Kelly said, "It was not a brother of mine, it was a confidential clerk, named Thomas"—I asked if he could tell me where Thomas was to be found—he said no, he did not know then, for since the money had been obtained he had left him, but he had received a communication from him.</p>

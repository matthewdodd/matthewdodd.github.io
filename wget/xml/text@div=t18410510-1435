                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in Southampton-court, Queen-square. On the 31st of March, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came for a sixpenny account-book—she gave me a half-crown —I saw it was bad, and I sent for my brother—the prisoner said she had taken it about ten minutes before, from a woman she had sold some caps to—she was given into custody—I gave the half-crown to the officer after I marked it.</p>

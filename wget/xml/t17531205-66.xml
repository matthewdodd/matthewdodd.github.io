On the 25th or 26th of October my locker told me he miss'd a horse out of my ground. I was apprehensive he was stray'd away, but we could hear nothing of him. On the 1st of November I lost another, named Jolly, out of my stable. I heard the prisoner was in Wood-street Compter, and going to him he told me he had sold one the week before, but could not tell where he was; he said, he would come by and by, and tell me where I might meet with him. I asked him where my jolly horse was; he said, at the Black Horse in Bartholomew Close, near Smithfield, where I went, and saw the buyer of the horse, whose name is Stevens. The owner of the stables his name is Lewis.</p>

            . I am constable of Little St. Bartholomew. I keep livery stables. On the 2d of November the prisoner brought a horse to my stable, which he was suspected of stealing; he was charged with it, and I was ordered to take him into custody; after which the prosecutor came and owned the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lewis. Who brought that horse to your stable?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I was not at home at the time; but the prisoner owned he brought him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner had nothing to say in his defence.</p>

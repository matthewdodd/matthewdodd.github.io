                  </hi>. I am a servant, and live in Cromwell's-buildings, Hammersmith. The prisoner was staying on a visit at the Rose and Crown public-house, Knightsbridge, where I was living as servant—I had no inti<lb></lb>macy with her—we slept in the same bed—I charge her with stealing three of my bed-gowns, which I led clean in my box—I did not notice but what they were in my box when I left, and the day after I went to my box, and missed them—I then went up a day or two after, and asked her if she had got them, or had seen any thing about them—I asked her three or four times—she said she knew nothing of them—a policeman found them in her box, in my presence—one was dirty, and two clean—her box was not locked—it was in the same room—I had been discharged from the service—the dirty one was found in the bed she had been sleeping in—she denied knowing any thing about them for a fortnight or three weeks—I went up there in the week, and asked her about them—they were found about a fortnight after—I had washed them myself—I am sure I put them into my box, and not laid them about—there is no mark on them—they were calico, and new ones—they had been worn once.</p>

I went with Charlotte Adams to May's-place, Great Hermitage-street, Wapping, and found the prisoner there—I told her I came with a search<lb></lb>warrant after some bedgowns—she said if I would not tell the people who kept the house, she would fetch. me the bedgowns—I said I must go with her to her box—we went up stairs together—I asked her to direct me to the box—she took me to the box, where I found these two bedgowns—they were clean, and in the bottom of her box, under clothes of her own—I said, "There are two more wanted, you must produce them"—she said she had no more—said, "If you don't produce them I must make further search in your bed"—there was a bed in the room—she went to the bed herself, and in taking the clothes off I saw a bed<lb></lb>gown—I laid hold of it, and the prose<lb></lb>cutrix, who stood by the side of me, said, "That is mine"—I told the prisoner I must take her into custody—she said, "It is very hard, I have lost mine, and I don't see why I should be the loser"—I took her to the Thames-police—she did not say that she took them in exchange for those taken from her, but I understood her to mean so.</p>

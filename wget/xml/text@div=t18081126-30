               <p>Q. Are you a housekeeper - A. I have a house at four shillings a week; a room below and room above; I live in the under room myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is the owner of the house - A. Mr. Parker.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hire it of him - A. Yes; my brother pays part of the rent to me, he has his own bed and furniture; I pay the rent all together. Mr. Parker is a pawnbroker in Shoreditch.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your way of life - A. I sold cakes and oysters while I was able. I laid up eight dollars, four half crowns, a seven shilling piece, and half a guinea; in all three pounds seven shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you put this money and when had you seen it last - A. The week that she come to me, I put it in a mattress that was upon my bed; she came upon a Monday and asked me for a lodging; I said I had no lodging; she said it was only for a night or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known her before - A. I had known her for about a month, she used to buy one little thing or other of me; the first night she came to me I was taken very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know where your money was put - A. She made the bed while I was ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she in making the bed discover the money - A. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it that she must know that the money was there - A. It was in that purse, and I sewed the purse to the mattress that it should not go astray from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any body in tumbling this mattress about would have found that this money was there - A. Yes. On Wednesday following the Monday she came, she went and got a letter from the dispensary for me; then on Wednesday I was getting better and she sat up and gave me the medicines, and by the means of making my bed and going to the dispensary on the Monday following; she then asked leave to stop in my place while I went to the dispensary; that was the opportunity she took the money; then when I came back there was a jacket left by a baker for me to mend; she told me of it and asked my leave to lay on the bed; I went out a quarter after ten and was home at a quarter after eleven, and she lay till five o'clock; at four o'clock I go out with my cakes; I awaked her, she went out along with me between four and five; I was home in an hour's time, and as soon as I came home I saw the bed towzled and undone; I went and put the bed away then; there was the mattress and an empty purse to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the bed was tumbled when you went out at half after four - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you search then to see if any thing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260022"></xptr>thing was missing - A. I made no search at half past four. She had a bundle in her apron, and I thought she had been looking for it. When I came home I searched and missed my money she did not return that night; at eight o'clock the next morning she came in and sat down; I said to her Mrs. Glover give me the money you took from under my bed; she said I am deaf, I am hard of hearing; I said if you are deaf I will send for an officer; Ray came and made her hear; she said she did not know any thing about it; I said who have you let in to rob me while I was out; I got up in a passion out of the chair, she pulled me down in the chair again, put her hand into her pocket and took out two shillings and threepence and put it in my lap; says she that is all I have, I will pay you by the week or month when I get in place; she wanted me to make a debt of the robbery; I said I would not make a debt of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the sum you had lost - A. I did, three pounds seven shillings and sixpence; I mentioned what dollars I had lost; a seven shilling piece and half a guinea. Then Mr. Ray came; before he came she opened her box and put on velvet shoes, and dressed herself very fine, I never saw a stitch of them before; while I was at the dispensary she went to the pawnbrokers and got these things in.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship street, Shoreditch; I was sent to take this prisoner in custody upon Tuesday; when I went to the prosecutrixs house I found the prisoner there; she begged for mercy, and stated that she had robbed her, and the moment she got in service she would return the money to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the old woman by then - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the old woman state what she had lost - A. Yes, eight dollars, a seven shilling piece, and a half guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in answer to that statement of the old woman, that she had this loss, that this answer was given - that she would make it up when she got in service - A. It was; I examined what they call the ticking, which the old woman has got here, where the hole has been cut.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is the hole she cut; I never made my bed without feeling it; it was there that morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to say further, than if I was dying this moment before the gentlemen, her brother had a key, and wished God would strike her dead for the report; and I said if I was in place I would take pity upon her, but I could not; here is a pair of shoes I bought at Mr. Lindo's, they are lasting shoes, not what she says.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

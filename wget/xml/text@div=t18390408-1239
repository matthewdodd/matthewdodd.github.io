                  </hi>. I live in Chapel-street, Belgrave-square. On the 26th of March, about twelve o'clock at night, I was going through the Bird-cage-walk, to meet my father—the prisoner accosted me, and put her arm round my waist, and having a cloak on I could not resist her—I felt something drawn from my pocket, and saw her putting something in her own pocket—I then missed from my pocket two half-crowns, a sixpence, some halfpence, and my handkerchief—I accused her of it immediately, and the denied it—as she and the policeman were going through the Bird<lb></lb>cage-walk I saw her throw the money behind her, I picked it up and after they had got a short distance the officer stopped to put on his cape, and I saw her throw the handkerchief over the rails—I got it.</p>

I was on duty between twelve and one o'clock, and the prosecutor called, "Police," and told me to stop the prisoner, as she had taken from him a handkerchief, two half-crowns, a sixpence, and some halfpence—I asked her about it, and she said she had no handkerchief but her own—she then dropped some money from her left hand—I took it up, and found it was two half-crowns, a six-pence, and two pence—as we got to Storey's-gate I put on my cape, and the prisoner threw this handkerchief through the rails—the prosecutor got it.</p>

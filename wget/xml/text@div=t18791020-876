                  </hi>. I carry on business as a provision merchant at 148, Leadenhall Street, under the style of John Moir and Son—on 15th January, 1878, I entered into an agreement with the prisoner as my servant for three years to act as office manager, at a salary of 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the first year, 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the second year, and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the third year—he entered into my service at once on that agreement—on 28th May, 1878, I entered into a further agreement with him, which was endorsed on the old one, by which he agreed to act as cashier, in addition to his other duties, at an additional salary of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he continued to perform those duties till December, 1878—instruc<lb></lb>tions were given him that no loose cash should be kept in hand—a copy of those written instructions was given to him by Mr. Fletcher—I discharged him in December, 1878—I have stock taken on 31st May every year—after he was discharged he brought an action against me for wrongful dismissal—under the advice of our solicitor we settled that action about April—we had our accounts audited after 31st May as usual, and found that there was a deficiency of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when we tried to balance our books—our clerks went into the whole books for the year to find out where the discrepancy arose—they went into the whole operations for the year—one of my clerks called my attention to this entry of 393<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is an entry in the cash-book kept by the prisoner—it is in his handwriting—the figures 93 are inhia handwriting—the figures'at the end of the column (16771 14 5) are also in his hand<lb></lb>writing—the book was entirely kept by him—the 16771 14 5 is a correct total if the figures were 193—I have followed it out to the end of the month, and it is treated throughout as 193 to the end of the month, so that I am 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short—the balance at the end of the month is 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd instead of 245<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this cash book was kept from Mr. Thompson's own system—it was designed by himself—I employed Messrs. R. Fletcher and Co., accountants,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200004"></xptr>
               <p>at the end of every month to audit the previous month's transactions—it was the accountant's duty to look at the casting of the cash book, and see that it was correct—it was his duty to test the castings to sec if they were correct—it was no part of his duty to trace the cheques to see whether they were paid in, except at the end of the month he has to reconcile the bank book—it was his duty to see that the bank book balanced—he would see that there was a voucher for every sum that had been paid out—he would examine all the vouchers—after he had seen that the total for the month was correct, it was the duty of the ledger clerk to post them into the ledger—I have the ledger and the paying-in slips here—thesum is posted as 393<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the ledger—this cheque was placed to our credit at the Union Bank of London as 393<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was paid in along with other small amounts, amounting to 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—on 4th July the prisoner placed before me a lithographic form authorising him to sign cheques for the firm paid into the bank—I declined—he had only been six months in our service—he repeatedly wanted to get quit of the auditors—he said "You pay so much to the auditors; that could be saved by employing me, as I am a competent book-keeper"—he said that repeatedly—at last, after very often speaking in that way, I told him that Mr. Fletcher (our auditor) was a personal friend of mine, and it was no usebringing the matter up—if the ledger clerk had posted 193<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it would have brought to the knowledge of the persons paying in that they had been credited with too little—Messrs. Yates and Son, who were the parties, would have seen in the next statement that the account was incorrect—my attention has been called to the entry on 16th November, under the head of ox feet, tail, and tongue—that entry ought to have been 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at folio 106, and it is carried forward as 324<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I can't say whose writing the red ink figures'are—that is carried through to the balance at 324 until the last folio of the month, and there it is altered back to the proper sum—the figures are 263 9 1—it is now 315<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is a scraping in the body of the 5, but in the balance and at the top it has been altered to the right sum—it is altered in red ink from 515, and a red 3 put—when I dismissed the prisoner we told him to balance up his cash—he had to give us an I O U to square everything up—I think he was short 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some few shillings—this is the I O U he gave for it—that is one of the subjects of litigation—on 20th October I went to Seville, and returned on 21st November—it was after my return that I discharged him, in consequence of what I heard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was selected by my auditor (Mr. Fletcher) out of 400 persons who applied for the situation—I received a character of him from some of his former employers—this cash book commenced on 1st March, 1878—he was appointed cashier on 28th May—the auditors did not approve of the cash book—it is one that the prisoner framed for me—it is kept on double entry—all the cheques that come in are paid in to the bank—this book also keeps the banker's account—I can see exactly by this book what receipts I have had; also what moneys I have paid into the bank, and what I have paid out—when the prisoner left he gave me the whole of the cash according to the books for December—he had borrowed 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me when he entered my employ—I believe he had repaid me about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the I O U for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was in respect of that balance—he brought an action against me for wrongful dismissal—he afterwards went into the service of Mr. Volckman—I charged him with having received one or two other sums which appeared in the books—when we settled I released him from those</p>

               <p>items—a Mr. Gray was appointed after he left—he was in the office before the prisoner left, to take charge of the cash book—I intended to keep the prisoner as office manager, and Mr. Gray to have charge of the cash—we found that things were somewhat in a muddle in the office—he ought not to pay the money into the bank at the end of the month, until he had actually balanced his book—he had advanced small sums to some of the servants on I O U's—I don't recollect that he could not quite balance his cash in October—I think I must have been away from home at the time—when I returned I heard of his being away part of a day—he was also away three or four days in December—he sent back the keys by Mr. Rawlins, who he appointed to help him—entries in the books were postponed till he returned, and Mr. Rawlins kept a scroll of his payments—we balanced our books once a year—I have here the book showing the payments for wages on. 30th November—the wages cheque was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the amount of wages for the factory at Glass House Fields was 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—all our books are here—the ledger was balanced every month—it was generally pretty late in the mouth before the book was ready for the ledger clerk—things in the office were rather in a muddle, and therefore necessary delay perhaps arose—I sued him for a sum in the Mayor's Court—that was a private matter of my own, entirely separate from the firm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The wages are paid on Saturday—the wages book is not in the prisoner's writing—I find that the whole amount he paid on 30th, November was 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., including the 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for wages—he had 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in hand that morning, received from customers on that day—the book shows that he drew 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from—the bank that day—I have not been able to discover any honest or proper application of that 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which is shown to be deficient—this slip and counterfoil of 22nd November are in the prisoner's writing; it is a long list of cheques paid in, making up 515<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—amongst those was the cheque for 393<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he has entered 515<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the cash-book as being paid in to the bank on that day.</p>

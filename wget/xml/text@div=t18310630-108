               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. He took them out immediately you spoke to him? A. Yes; I am certain my partner did not give him leave to take them - we have a shop in Lamb's Conduit-street, but that is quite another concern; we had an excellent character with him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.When you charged him with it did he say your partner gave him leave to take them? A.Never.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at 18, Percy-street, in the dwelling-house of Mr. Tate. On 23rd July, when we went to breakfast, the plate was missing—it had been all in a basket together, and was worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen it since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Tate. On 23rd July, about seven o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for Mrs. Piper, who lodged on the second floor—I let her in—she went up stairs, and I saw no more of her—I afterwards heard her come down, run through the passage, and shut the door—I went into Mr. Bamfield's sitting-room and missed the plate, which was safe at a little after ten the night before—no one had been there that morning—I was up first.</p>

On 23rd July, a little after seven o'clock, I was in the drawing-room, and saw the prisoner looking down Mr. Tate's area—I saw her go in—she had nothing with her—she came out in about ten minutes with a bundle under her shawl, and ran up the street.</p>

I took the prisoner on 12th Aug.—she denied any knowledge of the robbery, or knowing where the street was—at the sration she said she had lived there as servant to Mr. Tate—I saw her near Mr. Tate's door about twenty minutes to six on the morning of the robbery, and spoke to her—I am sure of her, I have known her so long.</p>

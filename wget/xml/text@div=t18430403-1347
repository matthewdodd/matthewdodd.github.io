On Saturday, the 18th of March, about eleven o'clock in the day, the prisoner came to me for nine quires—he was then in the service of the owners of the paper—about an hour after he came for five more, or 135 copies—I gave him a delivery ticket for them—in the due course of business they should have been delivered to his employers—he did not bring me a ticket—he was to get one part of it signed by the publisher, and bring that part signed back to me—he did not bring the ticket of the five quires back—he did the nine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Spencer, of Blue Coat-street, Deptford New-town. At the time in question we lived at No. 5, Giffin-street, Deptford, at the house in which the prisoner and her husband lived—we were lodgers there—we moved into the house in March last—I knew them for more than three months, living in that house—I knew the little boy and the other child—they occupied two rooms in the lower part of the house, and we the top room front—I remember the Prisoner's husband going out on the 10th of Jan. last about a quarter-past eight o'clock in the morning—I did not see him again till be<lb></lb>tween half-past five and six—he then came up stairs into my room—he appeared in a state of very great alarm, and fell backwards on the bed in a fainting fit—in consequence of what he said I went down stairs into the room occupied by him and his wife, and saw the prisoner lying on the bed with her throat cut in a very, dreadful state, and the two children also lying on the bed with their throats cut—the parents were in very bad circumstances, very much distressed indeed—the husband was unable from ill health to do any hard work—I heard his wife say that he has never earned one penny since the birth of the youngest child, which was about a year and eight months old—he had nothing to live on as far as I know, except the small sums he collected from the lodgers in the house, out of which he had to pay his rent—he had the whole house, and let part of it—I know that they were in the habit of pawning the greatest part of their furniture and wearing apparel to obtain food for them<lb></lb>selves and children—they treated the children with the greatest kindness and affection—the children's clothing was very poor indeed—they had parted with some of it, there was very little, just enough left to keep them clean—I never saw anything on the part of the husband but the greatest kindness to the wife—they both appeared to me anxious to conceal their exceeding poverty—the woman more particularly was anxious to avoid exposure—I had spoken to her on the subject of her distress, and recommended her to go to Mr. Warman, the relieving officer, and ask his advice whether she could obtain anything for the family—she did not go—she did not assign any reason why not—at times I firmly believe the children to have had nothing but a bit of bread and butter and a few potatoes and a bit of salt for the whole day—I have known when the children have had a small portion of food, the parents have gone without—on one occasion the children went two days on two penny loaves, and both father and mother went without—at times the prisoner com<lb></lb>Plained heavily of her head, and has often said she was afraid she should loss her senses—she complained of pains in her head, and her mind wandering—at times she did not appear to know what she was about—she has lost herself in teaching the infants their prayers—she has forgotten what she was say<lb></lb>ing—I have been present—she borrowed a penny of me on the very day be<lb></lb>fore this happened to get half a pint of porter, as she felt so very faint.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Deptford, and am chruchwarden of the parish. I went to the prisoner's house about six o'clock, and found the husband in the front-room—not where the murder was committed—he gave me some account of it—I saw a razor—when I first went down, seeing the bodies lying in that dreadful state, and supposing all the three murdered, I thought it probable the husband might have done it—the two rooms opened into one—the prisoner laid on the bed—she could see her husband quite as plainly as I could, and could also hear what I said.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>had given her no promise to induce her to make my declaration—she appeared anxious to exculpate her husband from any guilt—while in the room the husband had told me he kept his razor on a shelf—he did not say where he first found it—he said in the evening, when he first came home, and saw his wife lying in that state, that the razor was lying by her side, and he removed it from the mattress, and put it on the dresser—the prisoner said, after she had cut the throats of her children she cut her own throat, that she then fell back exhausted on the bed, and thought it was not done effec<lb></lb>tually—in the evening she said in the presence of a reverend gentleman who was there, that she did attempt to do it the day before, but her heart failed her—she appeared in great agony of mind, upbraiding herself with her wickedness—the state of the room indicated very great poverty indeed—there was no bed or bed-clothes, only a mattress and a common rug—I found sixty-seven duplicates relating to wearing apparel, furniture, and almost every article you can imagine—there was a great many of the children's clothes carefully laid in boxes, and very clean and nice.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> About what time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five o'clock—I cannot form a judgment as to whether she was in a state to be answerable for anything she said at that time—when I arrived she was not in a state to give answers to questions, or to place any reliance on her remarks—I thought she was dying, and that was the opinion of another medical man in the room; but she became better afterwards—for many days I thought she would never recover—I do not think it would be right to attach any great weight to her answers—I have attended her from the 10th of Jan. to the 17th of Feb.—in the course of that time I have observed the state of her mind—I believe she was in a state of aberration—if she had done the act at half-past two o'clock in a state of aberration of mind, and afterwards cut her own throat, I think the discharge of blood would be very likely to relieve the brain—I first observed that her mind was wandering on the 11th, the day after the inquest—I have had experience enough to distinguish between real and simulated absence of mind—I have not the slightest reason to believe that she was affecting or pretending to be in that state—that aberration has occurred more than once in the time I have been attending her—what I observed was, ab<lb></lb>sence or prostration of mind, a sort of imbecility amounting, in my judgment, to unsoundness—I observed it for about a fortnight, daily, in company with other surgeons—they were precisely of the same opinion as myself—I should conclude that the state in which I found her did not result from what she had done to herself, but most likely from other causes—I think it could not have arisen from what she had done to herself—I attributed the state of mind I saw to something foreign from the wound.</p>

She was formerly in service in Brompton-square—she married from there—it was a week previous to the Coronation—I cannot exactly say how many years ago it is—it is not seven—her mistress's name was Norton—I was at that time stopping with my brother, a confectioner, in the Strand—I remember her mistress bringing her to me in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—at that time she seemed not to know anybody or anything—that was not the first time I have observed anything extraordinary in her conduct—I had noticed it seven years ago—the first thing I noticed was once at church, she got up in the middle of the service and walked out, and did not return—she was a person of rather moral and religious habits—she was in the habit of frequenting church—there was no reason which I can account for, for her not remaining—I found her in bed asleep when I returned from church, about nine o'clock in the evening—she had complained of her head the whole of the day—she always complained of the back of her head—a few days previous to that, she laid in bed for three days and nights—there was no reason for that that I know of—she gave no account of herself for doing so—she took no food whatever during that time—she might have had it if she chose, there was plenty of food for her to have—she did not account for it, no more than complaining of her head—we were both living at home with our parents</p>

               <p>at that time—a few weeks after that she sat up three nights in the kitchen, without leaving it for anything whatever—she was dressed—she said she could not lie down for her head—she took no sustenance during that time in my presence—I do not know whether she did or not—I was a very few minutes absent from her—as far as I know she had no sustenance during those three days and nights—this occurred more than once—she would dress and leave her home for hours, would come back, not take any food, and go to bed in the middle of the day—she would sometimes get up the same day, not always—she would wander about without speaking to myself or the other members of the family—I had not offended her, or done anything unkind to her—I could not account for that conduct at all—on the first time that she went out she returned in the middle of the day, and went to bed—she complained of her head—this was before the accident she met with in tumbling down stairs, at my brother-in law's—after this she was very unwell, she shut herself in her room for three days again, and expressed a wish to be bled for the pain in her head—she would walk about of a night in her sleep frequently—she would get out of her bed, and go over the house, up and downstairs—often she would not associate with her friends, or the friends of her family—she would quite seclude herself from them—at times her disposition was very melancholy—when her mistress brought her home to me in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, she said she had been very unwell all day, and she feared it was the brain fever—she did not appear in a state of consciousness at that time—I bathed her head with ice water, she seemed to find relief for a time—she has been bled for this complaint of the head three times within two months—it appeared to afford her temporary relief—since she had been married, I have not had the oppor<lb></lb>tunity of associating so much with her as I did before—I know that she and her husband have been the prey of misfortune—she was particularly kind and quiet towards her family and children—she was an inoffensive person—never in the habit of committing acts of violence—her temper was very good indeed—when she has had these pains in her head she has become sullen and desponding—it was on these occasions that she secluded herself from her family and friends—it appeared to me at those times that her mind was affected—I thought so years before I knew anything of this—I had an aunt, named Maria March, who was deranged—she was single—she was my father's sister—she died in London I believe—I am not certain whether she died in a house of confinement, but she had been in Bethlem twelve months previous to her death—Mr. Samuel Fernoe married another of my father's sisters—he had the charge of my aunt, both before and after she was in this asylum.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long ago is it since you remember to have heard your sister complain of these pains in the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Seven years—I have heard her complain of them six months ago—a medical gentleman, named Badcock, was called to attend her, seven years ago, at Brighton—I do not know the name of the gentleman who attended her in town—the family were at Brighton then—I have been in town seven years—Mr. Glenn, a surgeon, was called to attend her at Brompton—he is not here—when at Brighton she retired to her room, and complained bitterly of her head, and desired to be bled—Mr. Badcock was called to bleed her—he is not here—I have not seen much of her since her marriage—six months ago, I saw her for some weeks—I have not seen much of her since—it is five years, I think, since Mrs. Norton brought her home, saying she had the brain fever—Mrs. Norton is dead—we did not call anybody in to attend her for the brain fever—she recovered—I applied remedies, medicines, and other things, and they succeeded—when she left church during service, she told me some hours afterwards that the pain in the head was the reason.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has she done that more then once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three or four different times, while with me—during the time I was with her, six months ago, I frequently observed that she was subject to those attacks of the head—they appeared to me to have got much worse—sometimes I have known her to be walking about the room, striking her head, complaining bitterly of it—Dr. Jones has seen her—her husband has not been in a condition to find her medical assistance for these two years—I have not seen much of them for the last six months—her husband was not in a condition to have done so at that time—I was with her some weeks—she had medical advice, for I got it myself—he was not able to do so—this was six months since—up to the time I left her, I did for her as far as my circumstances enabled me, both as to me<lb></lb>dical advice and assistance of other kinds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am uncle to the prisoner—I married one of her father's sister—I had charge of another sister, Maria March, who was in Bedlam twelve months, and I was forced to take her out afterwards—I was one of the sureties for the payment of her expenses—she was deranged before I took her there, for nearly three months—I did not take her out because she was cured—she was incurable—I was bound to take her out at the end of twelve months—they will not keep patients there more than twelve months—when she came out, I took her back to a mad-house at Beth<lb></lb>nal-green, where I took her from before, and there she was, to the best of my recollection, six or eight weeks—I believe the house is called the "White-house," or else the "Red-house"—when she came out she came to my house—I had the charge and watching of her—she got better, and we got her a situation, but she was very <hi rend="italic">queer</hi> indeed—any little thing turned her brain, and she was very wild and roaming—we could place no dependence on her—she was always complaining of her head—she used to put her hands to her head a good deal—I have not seen her within the last seven years.</p>

                  </hi>. M.D. I live at Lutterworth, in Leicestershire. In Feb. last I was making a visit to the house of Admiral Sir Robert Otway—in con<lb></lb>sequence of a request made to me by the ladies of Sir Robert's family, I went to the prisoner's residence, at Deptford, on the 17th of Feb.—I examined her, and found her recovering, or nearly recovered, form a disease of the brain, which in my opinion would render her incapable of judging between right and wrong—I have been present to-day, and heard the testimony that has been given on the part of the prosecution and defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Regard being had to the state in which you found her in Feb., and the facts deposed to by the wittnesses on both sides, do you or not believe that at the time she did this act, she was of sound or unsound mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most decidedly of unsound mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the disease of the brain that you found her re<lb></lb>covering from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Probably inflammation of the brain, a disease of the brain which produces insanity—the vessels of the brain were surcharged with blood—it was determination of blood to the head—I observed the same symptoms which I have frequently met with in case of insanity—it does not follow in all case of determination of blood to the head, that the person is of unsound mind—disease might exist for a considerable time, and an immense quantity of blood lost might relieve the brain, and prevent disorganization—my belief was that she had laboured under that disease, but that it was subsiding, that disease being a surcharge of the vessels—I had conversation with her—she certainly seemed better—she described herself as all persons do who recover from insanity, as having passed a dream—there had been great loss of blood—apart from the circumstances of the surcharge of the vessels, the anxiety</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184403040122"></xptr>
               <p>and distress of mind might so affect the brain, that she might become insane in the course of a day or two, or in a few hours—the pains in the head, that I have heard described, are such that, with intense thinking, would produce insanity—that might produce the crime, and with loss of blood afterwards she might become sensible enough to answer the questions which I have heard of—I have heard of her complaining of pains in the head so lately as six months ago—it is form that, and form her committing this act, that I infer she did not know what she was about when she did this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had considerable experience, and paid at<lb></lb>tention to cases of persons affected with insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and have had insane persons under my charge in my house—insanity exhibits itself in a variety of forms; sometimes in the form of constitutional imbecility; Some<lb></lb>times form local causes; sometimes from disorganization of the brain, and very frequently from the pressure of blood on the brain—that would be the climax for the time being—a person labouring under insanity arising from pressure of blood on the brain, would be relieved extensively and speedily by liberal blood-letting—a person in that state cutting her own throat would be very much relieved—I have very frequently met with case of that sort—I have not the least reason to doubt that conclusion—the acts described are quite consistent with the state of mind I attribute to her at the time she was guilty of this act—anything that would lead to an increased pressure of blood on the vessels of the brain would produce the pain in the head, and the symptoms I have heard described—I do not believe that at the time the Pri<lb></lb>soner did this act she was an accountable being, decidedly not.</p>

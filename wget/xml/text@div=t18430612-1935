               <p>who sent him for the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said a man had sent him, and told him he should have 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. if he got it—he said he had the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the man, and he gave the man the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went with him to the station—he pointed out the corner of Russell-street, as where the man was—I asked if he had any money about him—he produced several things, but no money—I afterwards thought I heard something fall—I looked round, and saw a shilling close behind him, on the pavement—I said to him, "How could you tell me you had not any money, and you have now dropped that shilling?"—he said, "They can search me now, I have not any more"—when I got to the station, I asked him again who sent him for the money—he told me the same as before—I fetched his father to the station—Rabone was not in custody then—Smith told his fa<lb></lb>ther he and Rabone had divided it between them.</p>

I left about ten o'clock, and when I came up to the turnpike, the prisoner came up to me, struck me, and took my shawl - three men and two women were with him. I cannot say the prisoner was one, but one of the men came up struck me, and ran away. The woman struck me several times, and said,</p>
               <p>"If you say that man took your shawl, I will have your life." A short man came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"I took your shawl." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, the man is gone over there." I cried out Stop thief! and a watchman came up, who took me to the toll-house. I afterwards saw the prisoner standing with the others, and the patrol took him - it was the prisoner. There was a strong light from the lamps.</p>

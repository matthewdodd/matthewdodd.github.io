About four o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon of the 21st of June, I was opposite the Dock-gate at Woolwich, and saw the prisoner attempt several persons' pockets—at last I saw him take a hand<lb></lb>kerchief out of a man's pocket, and put it into his own pocket—there was such a quantity of people I could not speak to the gentleman, and before I could well secure him I saw him draw another handkerchief out of another person's pocket—I could not find the owner of the first handker<lb></lb>chief—I asked the prisoner, when I found it on him, if there was any mark on it, and he said, "No"—I found two handkerchiefs in his hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the Royal Artillery at Woolwich. On Saturday evening, 24th Aug., about a quarter to nine o'clock, I was in Hill-street, Woolwich, and saw the prisoner and another female near Mrs. Crichton's shop—I turned round, when I was about twelve or thirteen yards off, and saw the other woman go into the shop, and saw the prisoner go to the window, take hold of a basket of potatoes, and go away with them in an opposite direction from me, carrying the basket in front of her—I do not know what became of the other woman—I went to the shop, made a commu<lb></lb>nication, and went with Mrs. Crichton's son, who was in the shop, and is a bugler to our regiment, after the prisoner—we overtook her about forty yards from the shop, with the other female, carrying the basket of potatoes between them—I asked the bugler, in the prisoner's hearing, whether that was his mother's basket—he said, "Yes"—the prisoner said, "Oh, no; I bought this and the potatoes for 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." I understood her to say—I sent the bugler for a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a greengrocer's shop, at 12, Hill-street, Woolwich. On Saturday night, 24th Aug., I went out about a quarter to nine o'clock, leaving two baskets of potatoes under my window—I came home about a quarter to eleven, when one of them was shown me—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it, and the potatoes are of the same sort as mine.</p>

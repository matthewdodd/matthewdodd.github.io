I am one of the house surgeons at the London Hospital—on Saturday evening, 8th March, Kay was brought there, and I found an incised wound at the back of his shoulder, clean cut, apparently done with a dagger-like instrument—it was deeper than it was broad, and such as this knife might have made—a fair amount of force must have been used—it might have been deeper—it was about 11/2 inches deep—it was not dangerous from its position—he was under my care as an in-patient a little more than a week—I have not seen him since—as an out-patient he went under another surgeon.</p>

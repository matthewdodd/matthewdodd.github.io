On Sunday, the 23d of November, we had company - this large silver skewer was taken out of my pantry drawer, and used in a fillet of veal. On Thursday, the 27th, Herbert came for my linen, (his wife washed for me) - he was full an hour down stairs, in the pantry where the plate is kept. I had not seen the skewer after Sunday. On Saturday morning the officer brought it to me - I had not missed it; it has my master's crest on it. I never saw Gent at the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. He was not in the house on Sunday - A. Not that I recollect; he might have been there. I tied my linen up myself, and am certain the skewer was not among it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cotterell, pawnbroker, Oxford-street. On Thursday, the 27th of November, Herbert brought this skewer for sale, about half-past seven o'clock - it is worth a guinea. He said it was his own - I asked how he came by it; he said he found it in a hackney coach that afternoon, that he was waterman at a stand, and gave his name as Thompson, No. 24, Mary-le-bone-lane - that his coach put up at Willis's, High-street. I kept the skewer; I did not tell him my suspicions, but desired him to call next morning - he did not call till half-past five o'clock; Gent was then with him; I said, "I was just thinking about you, I am going about the skewer" - he said, "Can't you settle it now, I am in a great hurry, and have come a long way." I said I had not made enquiry yet, and asked how far he had come - he said, from No. 24, King-street, and that he was a coachman, and drove No. 42, and Gates, of Cumberland-mews, was the owner of the coach. I said he had given a false address, and gave him in charge. Gent began to be very insolent to the officer, and said he was with him when he found it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take down the conversation - A. I took down the address he gave. If the shop had not been full, I should have given him in charge the first time he came.</p>

I intended to take it back, but being in liquor, I asked the pawnbroker the value of it, and told him to take care of it, and I would call to-morrow for it. I took Gent to clear it up. I said, "I shall make an excuse, and say I found it in a coach;" he said he would say the same.</p>

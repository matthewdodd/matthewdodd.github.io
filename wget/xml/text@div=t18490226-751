About eight o'clock on the evening of 31st Jan., I was on duty at the Refuge for the Destitute, in Playhouse-yard—the prisoner had been in for a night's lodging—she was very impudent to the parties inside—when she came out, I said, "You have got your answer; go to St. Luke's-workhouse or somewhere else; they will not admit you again"—that is the rule of the place; they give destitute people a night's lodging—she made use of a very bad expression, and said she would do me some serious injury before the morning—she took a pen-knife from her pocket, opened it, and placed it in her bosom, and afterwards, in attempting to get her away, she cut me under the arm, and cut my two coats, and afterwards she stabbed me in the back of my arm—it bled very much—she was quite sober—she made several attempts to stab me—I kept her off with my truncheon—I did not strike her—the sergeant came up, and in attempting to take the knife from her she cut his finger and bit my thumb—we took her into custody.</p>

               <p>I keep a public-house. On Monday the first of May, the prisoner brought this paint, contained in this handkerchief, to my house: he left it, and said he should call for it at four o'clock in the afternoon, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300066"></xptr> by nine the next morning. I looked at it, and found it was what I did not chuse to have in my house, it being a prohibited colour. Knowing it to be of a dangerous consequence in my house, I conveyed it to a neighbour's, where I had it under lock and key. The next day a neighbour came and told me the prisoner was taken up for defrauding Mr. Hodgson. I went to Mr. Hodgson: his clerk was at home: he came down, and proved the property to be his master's.</p>
               <p>(The colour was produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is it?</p>
               <p>Mr. Hodgson. It is China cinnabar, a colour for the use of limners. The marks upon the several papers, I put upon them at the time I bought them, to know the qualities.</p>
               <p>Had your clerk, the prisoner, any of this colour of his own? - No: there were but few of us that bought any at the sale: it was bought out of a French Indiaman, a prize.</p>
               <p>Nor he had no business to take any out of your house? - No, for no purpose whatever.</p>
               <p>From the prisoner. Whether he can prove, by any possibility, that I had ever stolen any cinnabar from his house; and was it missed during the time of my residence in Mr. Hodgson's family? - It was not missed till Mr. Palmer came and told me; and when I saw it, I went and took the stock of this account, and found twenty-one packages gone, six of which are here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Can Mr. Palmer prove I delivered these goods into his house? - Upon my oath, he delivered these five papers to my wife, and I was close to her when he delivered them to her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There should be ten in each of these packages: there is now in one but nine; therefore one is gone out, I suspect, as a sample.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>This cinnabar has not been found upon me; I have neither stole it, nor did I absolutely take it from Mr. Hodgson's house, as it is alledged against me; neither did I know the nature, or quality, or quantity, of that material in his house; nor did I see it open in his house: it was given to me to dispose of by two persons, who said they belonged to Capt. Cotton, of the Hawk Indiaman; they must have it there, or else it must have been smuggled, because it pays a heavy duty here. I taught the science s and mathematics, at Aspley in Bedfordshire, and surveying, navigation, architecture, drawing, and geography, with other branches of the sciences. I have, for most part of my life, been in the country: I have not been a year in London since my infant age: I lived in the country till last Christmas.</p>

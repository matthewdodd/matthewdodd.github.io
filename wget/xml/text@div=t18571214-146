                  </hi>. I am a plumber, of Sydenham—I also carry on business in King William Street as a house agent—the prisoner was formerly in my service as foreman of upholsterers—he had 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and half a crown extra every day he was engaged in moving—he entered my service about the middle of Feb., and continued till 23rd or 24th Sept., when I discharged him for drunkenness—his duties were to superintend the upholstering department, and to collect money and hand it over at once—the receipt to this account for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the prisoner's writing—he has not accounted to me for that—I remember this bill being given to him to collect, with others, on 17th April, and on his return he said that Mrs. Jones would send down the money—I never mentioned it to him afterwards—about the middle of June he was down in Dorsetshire, attending a removal—the receipt to this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), is in his writing, and the bill has been made out by him contrary to my instructions—I did not know that it had been made out at all till the end of Oct.—it was the other clerk's, Mr. Barker's, duty to make out the bills—this sum has never been accounted for to me—I went through the ledger in the prisoner's presence, and the other clerk said, "Here is this account of Mrs. Payne's, we may as well send that in;" the prisoner said, "No; because we have to remove them into their new house, and lay down carpets and blinds"—and afterwards he said, "Here is this account of Mrs. Payne's again; we may as well collect that;" and the prisoner again said, "No, you must not collect that till the whole of the work is done"—the first conversation was about the middle of Aug., and the second about three weeks afterwards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see it taken from him? A. Yes; I do not think it possible for another person to have put it up his back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There were three lads following the gentleman; I got before them and some person called Stop thief! - the gentleman seized another lad, but he got away; knowing I was innocent I went to clear myself, and tried to get the other - I never had the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

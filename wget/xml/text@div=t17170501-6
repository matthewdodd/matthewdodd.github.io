            </rs>. The Prosecutor deposed, that the Prisoner had been employed in the house to go of errands , and heat irons for the workmen (he being a Taylor) and having been gone 3 weeks, came to the house the night the robbery was committed, under pretence of receiving some small matter of money due to him from the journey-men for the cleaning their shoes, and took the opportunity of stealing his money, breaking open a chest which was in his closet. The Prosecutor's Boy deposed, that he saw the the Prisoner in his Master's Chamber about 10 a clock at night. Another Evidence deposed, that happening to be in the Prisoner's company at the Tavern and other places where they were junketing, observed they were very full of Money, fared sumptuously, went to Plays, bought new Cloaths, and liv'd merrily, treating all the Company; and thereupon application being made to him from the Prosecutor, he apprehended them, upon which there were 2 Guineas found upon the Boy, and 19 and the Rings upon the Woman with a Trunk of new Cloaths reposited in one of their new acquaintance's house . The Prisoner owned the fact in part, that he did take 43 Guineas whereof about 8 were laid out in Rigging for him and his Mistress;19 she had, and 2 he had left, and the rest (tho' but four days time) he had spent upon the Guards.

There were some evidences that confirmed that circumstance: so it not appearing she was privy to the Robbery, nor proved that she knew how he came by the Money, she was <rs id="t17170501-6-verdict31" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I live at Glossop, in Derbyshire. On the 20th Dec., I got into an omnibus which was going to the Birmingham Station, between ten and eleven at night—I had a bundle with me containing eight books, a shirt, stockings, and other things—I had ridden perhaps two miles—I got out at Euston-square, and missed my bundle directly the omnibus was gone—it had been on my right-hand side—it was a pretty good size, and was in a handkerchief—I saw the guard of the omnibus bringing the prisoner back—I said the bundle was mine—the prisoner said, he would bet me a sovereign it was his—I gave him into custody, and gave the bundle to the policeman—this is it—the books and other things are in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Draper's-place. On the night of 20th Dec., I saw Mr. Prosho get out of an omnibus, at the corner of Seymour-street—he spoke to me—I walked with him towards the station—after we had got some distance, he said he had left a bundle in the omnibus—I went back after it, and saw the prisoner going towards Gower-place, with a bundle in his hand—I said, "You have got a bundle belonging to a young man"—he gave the bundle to me—the conductor laid hold of his arm, and said, "I will give you in charge"—Prosho came up and gave him in charge—the prisoner said, "I will bet you a sovereign that is my bundle"—the conductor said there was no bundle in the omnibus.</p>

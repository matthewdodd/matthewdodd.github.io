                  </hi>. I live at Craven-cottage, Richmond. On Wednesday, 28th Jan., about half-past 3 o'clock in the morning, I went into the White Hart in the Strand with Mr. Jones, who is a friend of mine—there were about twenty people there; I saw Connor there—Mr. Jones took charge of my money—we stayed there till half-past 6, when we came out, and Mr. Jones called a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, got into it, and from the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> window give me back my pocket-book and the money, which was a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note and eight sovereigns—the sove<lb></lb>reigns were rolled up in the note in the pocket-book, and I put the pocket-book into my coat side-pocket—I was not quite sober, but knew what I was about—I then went into the coffee-shop next door to the White Hart, and ordered some him and eggs—Connor then came in, told me he was hungry, and asked me if I would give him something to eat—I told him he might have the same as I was having—I then said I Wanted a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and Connor said he would fetch one—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was brought, and he was inside it when it came and the prisoner Watts was on the box with the caiman—I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and told the caiman to drive to St. Paul's Churchyard—I felt my pocket-book then safe—the caoman drove to St. Paul's Churchyard and stopped there; Connor immediately opened the door, jumped out, and told the caiman the gentleman inside would pay the fare—I got out, put my hand on my pocket, and immediately missed my pocket-book—I asked the cabman which way Connor had gone; he said he did not know, and said that Watts had gone off with him—I did not see Watts go, but the cabman is here—I then drove to the station and gave the charge.</p>

I am a watch finisher of No. 92, Aldersgate-street—I did live at No. 10, Merlin—place, Rosoman—street—the prisoner worked with me to run on errands, and he began to learn the polishing business—he left me about 20th July, and was not in my employ a month ago—I did not authorise him to apply to Mr. Symons for a watch, nor did he bring me one from Mr. Symons—I never sent him there while he worked with me, and he had no opportunity of knowing that I worked for Mr. Symons.</p>

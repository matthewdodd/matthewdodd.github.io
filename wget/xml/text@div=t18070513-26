            . I am a green grocer, I live in Essex-street, Kingsland Road. On the 8th of April I went to Barnet fair, I saw the prisoner with a mare, I asked him if it was to sell, he said yes; he asked eight pounds for it; I told him I would give him five pounds for it if he would give me five shillings back; I bought it for that money; he said the mare did not belong to him, he said his master was in the cow fair who it belonged to, and he had got two black cows and a poled white cow; he mentioned his name, out I cannot recollect it; I could not find his master in the cow fair. After I had paid the prisoner at a public house, at the door of that public house I put my little boy upon it; there were some people who knew the mare, they told me I had better get my money again, otherwise I should get into a hobble; I went into the public house, I told him I had a suspicion that it was a stolen horse, I told him he had better have the mare again, and to give me the money; he accordingly did give me all the money back again but two shillings and three pence, which he said he had spent in the public house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180705130016"></xptr> The prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

            . I live at Barnet. I was close to the public house door, I heard some of the horse dealers tell Allen to find out the man that he bought the mare of; Allen went into the house, I went in with him; he asked me to go with him and shew him the person that gave him the horse to sell; with that we went half a mile through the cow fair, and could not find out the person; Allen then says, you had better return me my money, and take your mare again; he returned him all the money within two shillings and three pence; with that I collared him and took him before the magistrate. I came up to town with him, I was handcuffed to him for safety; the constable did that.</p>
               <p>Q. You were only put as a sort of clog to him. - A. Just so. Allen charged the prisoner before the magistrate with selling him a stolen horse; the prisoner said he did not steal it. He did not disown but that it was stolen.</p>

            . The prisoner was delivered into my custody on the 13th; he came to our office for examination. Before I took him to prison I asked him how he came in possession of the mare; he said a man of the name of Benson that lived near Uxbridge had employed him, he was to meet him on the morning of Barnet fair, against the hand post at the end of the road leading to Harrow; he did meet him there; he had three cows, two black ones and a white one, and a brown poney; Benson kept on the poney, and he helped to drive the cows till they came to Barnet common, near a barn; there they met with one of the Oxford blues that came from Windsor; he did not know his name. The Oxford blue then said they must all change their names, and if we have the luck to sell the cows, as well as the mare, we will all meet at the top of Holborn, and buy new clothes; I'll desert, and we will go down into Yorkshire and steal horses, and sell them at fairs; he said he had met this Benson and the Oxford blue at Windsor, and there this appointment was made. I put him in prison, and went to Windsor; I could find no Benson; I heard of a person of the the name of

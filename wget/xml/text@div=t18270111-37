            . I live exactly opposite Anderson in the same court, which is about six yards wide. On the 8th of January I was standing just by the side of my own door, about eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner, Jones, on the counter in Anderson's shop - I saw him throw himself across the counter and open the till, and the moment after I saw him come out at the door with the bowl in his hand - I followed him about two doors to the corner of Haughton-street, where I saw him give the bowl to another boy, about the size of Burns, who ran up Haughton-street with it directly - I followed him, neglecting Jones, and as I crossed the way the bowl and money fell; I heard it chink; I still followed calling out, Stop thief! he turned up New-inn-passage into Holles-street and Stanhope-street, then into Newcastle-street, and turned to the right by the Olympic theatre, in Wych-street; and as soon as I turned down there, I saw him stopped by some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110023"></xptr>person; it was Burns - I lost sight of him twice for about a second, and cannot swear that the boy I followed was stopped, as I was rather too far from him in turning Newcastle-street, but I think it was him; I counted the money which was brought back into the shop; I had not picked it up, but I saw it thrown down; and as I returned I saw a crowd stooping down on the very spot; I believe they were picking it up; I swear to Jones, for his head was close to the gas-light, and I was not far from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you outside your door? A. No; I stood just within my door, which is very wide; I did not see him enter the shop, but I saw him open the till - I am certain of him, for I looked particularly at him, and had never seen him before - I heard the money fall, but did not look on the ground for it.</p>

            . I live in Milford-lane. On the 8th of January I was watching the prisoners from half-past six to eight o'clock; they were both together; I did not know them before - I was standing talking to a butcher at the corner of Haughton-street, and suspected them because I saw Jones snap his fingers, and come away from Anderson's window about six times and go up to Burns; I then saw Burns move away up to the corner of a wine-vaults at the corner of Haughton-street, two doors from Anderson's - Jones went into the shop - I saw him run out with a bowl, and his two hands on it; he gave it to Burns by the wine-vaults; he ran a little way up the street with it, and a man hit him on the arm and made him drop the bowl - I was following Jones, and caught him before he got to the end of Haughton-street - I took him to the watch-house; Burns had run off when the bowl was knocked down; it was just dropped at the time I caught Jones; I am certain of them both, as I had been near them before; Jones went into the shop - I walked down from the butcher's and looked at them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was this? A. Last Monday night - I was at a butcher's three or four doors off, at Joseph Lawrence's; I had done work and had nothing to do; I never had a doubt of either of them; I was about five yards from Anderson's; I saw Parrott run; I did not see Burns struck on the arm, as I was pursuing Jones, but I understood he was struck.</p>

I was standing talking to Elias, from about half-past six till eight o'clock; I saw Jones looking into the shop-windwo five or six times; he crossed over every time and spoke to Burns, who stood at Mr. Parrot's; and the last time he went back, I saw him enter the shop and come out with a bowl, which he gave to Burns, who ran away with it; Jones also ran; when Burns got opposite an oil shop, somebody struck him on the arm, and the bowl fell; I picked it up with some of the silver; Mr. Morris brought out a candle and helped us - he and I took it to Mr. Anderson's, where Parrot counted it - there were eight half-crowns, thirty-five shillings, and eleven sixpences; it was delivered to the officer - I then went to the watch-house and saw the prisoners, whom I knew to be the boys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known Elias? A. Nine or ten years; I saw Jones stopping by the next shop to Anderson's, and thought something was wrong; I fell down in endeavouring to follow him, and then I did not pursue, but picked up the bowl.</p>

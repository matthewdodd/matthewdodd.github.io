I am a furniture dealer of 16, Sussex Street, Pimlico—on the night of 6th July one of my men locked up the premises and I went to bed about 10 o'clock—I was shortly afterwards awoke by the police and went down and found the cellar door open; I had not noticed it when I went to bed—I do not know the prisoners—the door which I found open opens into the house—it was not very securely bolted.</p>

                  </hi>. I work for Mr. Wilson—I locked up the house on 6th July: the cellar door was never open while I was there as it was full of furniture; it opens into the area; there is no communication with the house, but there is a door into the area from the house; it was fastened with hooks outside, there were no bolts—I came back next morning at 8.30, and found the canvas com off the top of the cellar door, but it was not open; the kitchen door opens into the basement, I fastened it with two bolts, but there was no lock.</p>

On 6th July, about 9.30 p.m, I was in Winchester Street, which leads out of Sussex Street, and saw the two prisoners looking down the prosecutor's area; they went into the Monster public-house and then came back to the corner of Sussex Street—I passed into Camden Street, Murphy went away, and Neal was close by Mr. Wilson's area gate; I watched him—a constable spoke to me—I took Neal and handed him over to Hill; we walked over to the area gate, and when I got to the bottom of the area Murphy came out to the kitchen door and stood under the area steps—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he went down to ease himself—I gave him into Hill's custody—I found the door open and the hasp slightly bent—the cellar door is made of wood and canvas, which was broken down—it does not communicate with the house—I called up the prosecutor—I found on Murphy a candle and a box of silent matches—his clothes were not disarranged.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Can you swear to the tea? A. No; I can swear to the spoons - this basin matches the rest I have; it is full of sugar, and just as it was taken: the pattern is peculiar - these cloths have my name on them; she said they were master's property - she came into my service about a year and a half ago; I had no quarrel with her - I have found some fault with her about the business of the house; I never put my first in her face - I have a person named Frogget in my service; she has not been dismissed - she went away for a short time, on account of ill-health; I certainly never told the prisoner not to mention any thing that passed between me and Frogget; nothing improper ever took take place - the prisoner would not give up her key till the officer came, and told her to consider herself in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor sent for me; the prisoner went up stairs and consented to have her boxes searched - she then made some objection, but when she was given into my custody she opened a cupboard, and gave the key of her box, in which were these articles, which have been in my care ever since- she said these dusters and the napkin were her master's, but the tea, sugar, and other things were not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She acknowledge these dusters and napkin belonged to her master? A. Yes, and the glass and basin, but not the other things, nor the spoons; she said she could produce others like them.</p>
               <p>MR. MIVART. I believe these to be my property - the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050114"></xptr>prisoner was my housemaid; she could not have any of the silver spoons properly, nor this breakfast napkin, nor this cut glass, which was sent up with tea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I waited on the nurse, morning and evening, and she gave me a small portion of tea and sugar, which I put into my bonnet-box; there was a lady who had her breakfast carried up to her - I put the napkin into my box, to use in mixing the tea, the black and green together; I had bought a great part of the tea to send to my mother, and the sugar also - the silver spoons are my own- my master knows that the lady was in No. 17 room, who had her breakfast in bed.</p>
               <p>MR. MIVART. Her mistress was to take the breakfast to that lady, and these things were found in the floor over the one that lady was on - there were 20 lbs. or 30 lbs. of tea found in her box; the tea and sugar nearly filled a large clothes-basket.</p>
               <p>- ROGERS. I am the prisoner's mother. I gave her two spoons, ten or eleven years ago - there was an S. on them, and I believe these are the spoons; I had another daughter - on her marriage the prisoner gave her these spoons; her husband died, and then I took my daughter home, and all she had - she died, and I gave the spoons a second time to the prisoner; I live at Wetherford, forty miles from London; at chance times the prisoner has sent me a little tea and sugar, or thread or cotton - for my own use, I do not sell them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Upon your oath, do you believe these to be the spoons which, eleven years ago, you gave to your daughter? A. Yes, I do - the prisoner gives me tea and sugar sometimes, and sometimes I send her a trifle of money for it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the name of your daughter who died? A. Mary Selwin - she died three or four years ago; the prisoner has sent me a pound or a pound and a half of tea, not more.</p>

            . I am a waiter. I called on the prisoner about three years ago, and drank tea with her, in company with a female; it was at a broker's shop in Gray's Inn-lane, where the prisoner then lodged - my friend asked the prisoner if the spoons were what her sister had; I saw two silver spoons there of a plain make, and they had an S. on them in rather a large cypher - they were much worn.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How came you, three years ago, to take particular notice of two silver spoons? A. It was in consequence of my friend's remark - my friend's name is

               <p>MR. MIVART re-examined. Q. Had the prisoner an allowance of tea and sugar? A. No; they found their own - these were old spoons, which I bought some years ago.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did not Mr. Mivart supply you with spoons? A. No; I have bought metal spoons myself, and we found ourselves tea and sugar, and cups and saucers.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Where was she living at that time? A. She said she was in the service of Mr. Mivart - I was going to Farringdon-street myself, and I said I would go as far as the tea-warehouse with her; I went with her to Twining's - she then went with me to Farringdon-street, and I paid the interest on a bed; we then went to my house in Chiswell-street, and had tea - she then gave me something less than 1 oz. of tea, and took the rest home; I do not know where she had bought the sugar -I think there were 6lbs. or 7lbs. of that; she paid for 3lbs. or 4lbs. of tea - she put down a sovereign; I do not know what change she had.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Was the sugar tied up? A. Yes, in a white handkerchief - she said it was sugar; the tea was in two papers - I am not sure whether she had any change.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What priced tea did she ask for? A. I think 7s. green - I am not sure what the black was; I paid attention to the change - I think she had about 3 lbs. of tea.</p>

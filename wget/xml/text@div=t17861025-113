               <p>On Monday the 11th of September, the prisoner Patrick, who confessed he was the father to the little boy, brought this gold into my shop to sell it, between the hour of nine and ten; I asked the prisoner how he came by it, he told me, he gave four-penny-worth of oysters for it.</p>
               <p>(Handed up to the Court and Jury.)</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know this to be gold? - Yes; and afterwards he told me he had bought it of a watch-case maker that he knew; and I asked him where that man lived; and he said, Sir, I will tell you the truth; I gave eight penny-worth of oysters for it; I told him he must go down to the office in Bow-street, to give Sir Sampson

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Can you swear this to be yours? - No, I cannot; a confession was taken in writing, signed by the boy, and I witnessed it; the boy was taken an hour or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present when the confession was taken in writing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is a confession by the boy? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you seen the boy before that confession was made? - I went with him from my house with the constable; he had lived in my house seven weeks an errand boy; he lived with me when he was taken up to the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Did he tell him he would be prosecuted if he did not confess? - No, Sir, the boy began to make an excuse; telling me it was gold he found in the shop; I am sure I had not threatened him, or told him it would be better for him.</p>

               <p>Was this a free voluntary confession? - Yes, we desired him to tell the truth, for he could make the case no worse; that was all that was said.</p>

On Tuesday, the 13th of Fe<lb></lb>bruary, at half-past ten o'clock at night, I was in the parish of Ealing—I know the road in front of some houses—the prisoner occupied one of them—I observed a van opposite the prisoner's house—there were some goods in it—it was loading—I did not see any articles put in it—I saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183802260138"></xptr>
               <p>some hammer-handles in the van, and asked the prisoner, who was there, where he got them from—he said, "From Mr. M'Intosh's works"—I knew the prosecutor well, and knew that the prisoner worked for him—I asked if it was all right—he said, "Yes"—I went to Mr. M'Ewen, the agent of Mr. M'Intosh, and from what I heard from him, I returned to the prisoner again, and searched the van, and found in it a variety of tools—I found forty hammer-handles, eight hammers, twelve pieces of wood, four screw-plates, five coal-chisels, a piece of steel, and two pieces of iron hoop—I took the prisoner to the station-house—these are the articles—(<hi rend="italic">producing them.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the superintendents of Mr. M'Intoch. It is his custom to find all the tools used on the rail-way, especially black<lb></lb>smith's tools—the prisoner, who was a smith in his employ, could have not necessity to take these things—Mr. M'Intosh's name is Hugh—it is not the duty of the prisoner, or any one else, to take tools off the premises—Mr. M'Ewen is a superintendent of Mr. M'Intosh's, but he is ill—he was before the Magistrate—Mr. M'Intosh has a great quantity of timber—I have looked at the wood of these hammer-handles—in my judgment they are of the same wood as that on Mr. M'Intosh's premises—there are such articles as these screw-plates in the possession of Mr. M'Intosh—we very seldom make use of coal-chisels, but I believe these to be his pro<lb></lb>perty—Mr. M'Intosh had iron-hooping there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do I understand that you know any of these things by any marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are not marked—as far as my judgment goes these are his—the prisoner was in Mr. M'Intosh's employ for twelve months—he was discharged on the Saturday before this—we had no further employ for him—I believe he lived at this house at Ealing—we did not want him—I do not swear to any of these things, only as far as my judgment goes—I know what are called jaggers—they use pieces of wood at certain times—it is not permitted for men to take wood off the premises—none get off that I know of—these pieces of iron hoops are worth 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the coal chisels 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not say that the prisoner might not have hammers and chisels of his own, but it is our rule to find tools for all the hands.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The deposition made by M'Ewen was read here.</hi>)</p>

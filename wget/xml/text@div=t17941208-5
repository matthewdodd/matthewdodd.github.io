               <p>Q. Did you do it? - I did do it on my shoulder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see all the parts performed at the post office? - I saw that the bag was sealed and put in another sack, and that sack tied.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got this from the post office what did you do with it? - I brought it on my shoulder, until I got to the coach, and then when I got to the coach, I heaved them down, and I put them in the mail box.</p>

             got on the roof of the coach, and said, he was very much fatigued, and I says to him in this manner, I don't care if you ride these four or five miles in my place; and then he got over and got into my seat, and I stood up along with him for about half a mile or further.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you stood up; when you stood up on the mail box, and he was sitting in your seat, there was room for you both? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How far did you ride, think you, in that situation you have described? - About four miles and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What rate do you generally go at an hour? - We went very fast, nine miles an hour, I dare say or rather better; we were not above three or four and twenty minutes in going that stage.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080031"></xptr>Q. When you came near to the end of that stage, what alteration did you make? - I said to him, you and I must change seats; which we did; he jumped over the roof on to the coach box, and I got to my own seat.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after you had recovered your seat, and he his on the box, you came into Marlborough? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There, I believe, you left the coach? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. I do not know how many stages there are from that to Marlborough? - We make four stages from Bristol to Marlborough, and three from Bath.</p>

               <p>Q. You went quite out of sight from it then? - I was out of sight of it at Chippenham, but not at Calne, I did not leave it out of my sight as I know of; I stooped down and chucked the three out from my hand, and took the other three bags up as I went along.</p>
               <p>Court. How long might you leave at Chippenham? - About three minutes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I think you say that sometimes you stand on the spring and open the boxes; do you stand pretty high above the box then? - I put my foot on the spring.</p>
               <p>Q. That is a dangerous thing to a a person, when the coach is going pretty fast? - It is a dangerous thing.</p>

             told me that the prisoner at the bar was with him in the morning, of course he appeared much fatigued.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't tell us the conversation. What did you do? - He left his situation, on the coach box, and got on the roof of the coach, and I got on the coach box; I saw he was fatigued, and I was afraid he would fall down and cause some delay.</p>
               <p>Q. You had given him liberty? - I told him he might ride in my situation for a stage or two, if he pleased; on the top of Marlborough hill we generally pull up to give the horses a little wind, it is a steep hill, and in that place we changed stations.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your place an easier one than on the roof of the coach? - Much easier; and that was the reason, seeing him fatigued, I offered it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood, from the former witness, that your place is on the spring? - Yes, there is a spring.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you think you went, he in your station, and you on the box? - On the whole twenty seven miles.</p>
               <p>Q. From Marlborough Hill, how far did you go? - To near Thackum.</p>

               <p>Q. How many miles is it from Marlborough Hill to Hungerford? - Eight miles.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you changing horses at Hungerford? - Five minutes, generally more.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you and the coach while you were changing horses? - The coachman staid with the coach all the time, and I went in and exchanged the bags, but I was not long, I had a basket to leave there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he staid in your station while you went with the bags? - I left him, to the best of my knowledge, in my station while I went to the post office, which I was not gone more than two minutes to the furthest.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got the letter bag that you took from the post office, what did you do with it? - We had a road sack, which contains the Chippenham, and Calne bags, and we put it in that sack, and if he did not get down before he got down then, for me to put the sack in, and a basket of fish, which I had to leave at Hungerford.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had put your bags in, what seats did you both take? - He got in my station where he had been before, and I got on the coach box.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you came to Hungerford, you went on to the next stage? - We went on to Newbury.</p>

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. When you arrived at Reading, what did you do there? - I left the Reading bag there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you get the Reading bag from? - From a window; the coach draws up close to a window there, within five yards, and I left the Reading bag there, and took the London bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the Reading bag from? - Out of the mail box, as I was going along; as soon as I had taken in the London and Reading bag, I told Mr. Thomas he might ride again a few miles in my situation; I left these small bags at Reading, which I got from the towns, as I came along.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deposit these bags you had from Reading in your box? - Yes, I did. At Reading I told Mr. Thomas he might ride a few miles in my situation again, he rode till he came to Hare Hatch, seven miles.</p>
               <p>Q. And you changing your situation, got on the box? - Yes, at Hare Hatch, I told Mr. Thomas he must get on to the box again, which he did, and I got in my situation; about half a mile on this side the coachman and I exchanged situations, the coachman got in my situation, and I took the reins, and Mr. Thomas sitting by the side of me.</p>

               <p>Q. No further conversation? - No more than that that is material? - No more than that; but this circumstance enabled me to recollect him, and I looked at him stedfastly in the face.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I should ask you two or three questions only. Your humanity, and the lenity he received from the last guard, led you to give the prisoner an easier situation to what he had? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Seeing him very fatigued, perhaps sleepy, it led you to offer him your place? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How long ago? - It might be four or five years, I very often bought goods of Mr. Harwood, and he used to bring them on his back to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Mr. Harwood? - Mr. Harwood was a grocer.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner in the month of October last? - A grocer.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any money transactions with him on the 7th of October? - Yes, I had; there was a bill that was due, and I had a large sum of money to pay, more then I had in the house, I asked the prisoner if he could let me have thirty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any account between you and the prisoner? - Now I have balanced it, there was due to me at that time twenty-six pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he give to you? - He gave me a twenty pound bank note, a ten pound bank note, and a note of ten pounds on the Tewksbury bank; I refused the Tewkskury bill of exchange, and he said, perhaps as I was going to pay a bill, and probably had some bank notes and some cash, some of the cash might be light, and it would not be amiss of me to make use of this ten pounds in payment.</p>
               <p>Q. As I understand you, it was by his particular desire that you took the Tewksbury note in addition? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the money you had so received from the prisoner? - I took it home, and the moment I got in my house I paid to the clerk of Messrs. Dunn, Thornton and Co. a bill of fifty-one pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. What character does he merit from you? - I thought him an honest man, or else I would not have dealt with him.</p>
               <p>Q. In your dealings you have had with him he merits that character from you? - The earlier part when we began business, we dealed a great deal.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you present at any time when the prisoner was examined, after he was taken into custody? - On Thursday, the 9th day of October, having been informed that one of the bank notes, taken out of the Bristol mail, had appeared at the bank, and that it had been traced to the prisoner at the bar; I went to his house on the 9th, and asked him where he got that note?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080043"></xptr>Q. Do you remember the number of the note? - I do not recollect the number of the note. He said he received it on Monday evening of a person who was a stranger to him, and who made use of the name of a neighbour of his, of, I think, the name of Wordman; he said he gave cash for it, that in a few minutes the same man came in again and asked for change for other bank notes, which he likewise gave him; that in a few minutes more the same man returned again with a similar request, and he changed those that he brought the third time; that he came the fourth time with the same request with others, and that he complied with that request also; that he came a fifth, and that he believed he came a sixth time with a similar request, that he gave him cash in the whole to the amount of one hundred pounds, or upwards, he believed. I then told him it was my duty to take him to the public office in Bow-street; I intreated a friend of his to go there with us, who was a Mr. Seger, a friend of his; he came in while I was in his house, and I requested him to accompany him to Bow-street, which he did, and he underwent an examination.</p>
               <p>Q. He went with you readily? - Very ready, not the least hesitation about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the examination that was taken before the magistrate? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner, as to the length of time he had the notes, which were deposited with the Bankers, in his possession? - Those whom he described to have received from a person, he described to have received on the Monday before the conversation. He also said that several of the notes, which he paid into Dorsets, the banker's, he had had by him some time before.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not describe more particularly what he meant by some time before? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before whom was he examined? - Mr. Addington.</p>
               <p>Q. (Producing a paper) Are those minutes, minutes that were taken down at the time? - They are the minutes that I took down at the time, by the direction of the magistrate, from his own mouth; at first when it was read over to him, he said, it was true, at the second examination he said, that that observation what he said before of his being at Croydon was not true; upon which Mr. Addington discontinued reading it.</p>
               <p>Q. There was not in any stage of the proceeding any examination signed formally by the magistrate? - None, there was no examination but this paper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys objected to this being received as evidence, because neither the prisoner nor the magistrate had signed it, said it was not parrallel with Lamb's case in the Borough, because there, though the magistrate did not sign, the prisoner signed it.</p>
               <p>Court. I see no doubt on it being evidence, the same as he might have spoken to any other man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. In Lamb's case the magistrate had it taken down, and afterwards the prisoner refused to sign it.</p>
               <p>Court. In Lamb's case the court said, that if this is not evidence, the court must adopt this monstrous proposition, that whatever the prisoner says, when not before the magistrate, depending on the precarious memory of the thief-takers should be evidence against him, but the moment he gets before the magistrate it is not evidence, where certainly it ought to have the most weight, because it is given with all the solemnity possible.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080044"></xptr>Mr. Garrow. Before we read it we will learn the stage of transaction it was taken in. The prisoner was examined in the forenoon before Mr. Addington? - It was at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time what you have delivered to paper, was delivered by the mouth of the prisoner himself? - It was, before dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he withdrew was that paper read over to him. - It was, by Mr. Addington</p>
               <p>Q. Deliberately? - Deliberately.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say of its contents? - He admitted it to be true.</p>
               <p>Q. After an interval of some hours he was re examined? - In the evening. Then the magistrate proposed to read it again, and desired he would mention if it was incorrect in any respect, or if it wanted any alteration or correction.</p>
               <p>Q. That, I conclude, was with a view to be signed by him if he had chose it? - I suppose so. The magistrate began to read it. When the magistrate read about six lines of it, he said, that what he had related was not true, for that he had not been at Croydon, as was mentioned in his examination.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the false fact that he represented to state in that paper on his first examination, what was done on that? - He said also that he was at Bristol, in the mail coach, on Thursday preceding that day of the week; on that Mr. Addington said he should not proceed further on reading this examination as it was untrue in its onset. I made a memorandum on the back of the paper, for my better recollection of the circumstance.</p>

               <p>Q. In the forenoon of that Thursday had there been any charge whether the prisoner had been at Bristol? - The Thursday before I think there was no positive charge, but he was desired to speak in the forenoon, where he was on Thursday and Friday before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he disclosed that he had been at Bristol? - No, he did not, he was questioned where he was on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, 2d, 3d, and 4th, of November, with a view -</p>
               <p>Q. So that in the forenoon he had been questioned where he had been those days? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. And in the forenoon he had not represented that he had been at Bristol those days? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he represent where he had been? - He said he had been at Croydon Fair on Thursday.(Read by the clerk of the court.)</p>

            , Esq. one of his Majesty's justices of the peace for the said country, this 9th of October 1794, who says, That he left his house about seven o'clock on Thursday evening last, and went to Charing Cross, where the Croydon coach goes from; that he went on the top of the Croydon coach, and arrived at Croydon between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, was set down in the street, was booted; that he went into the fair, and continued there till the morning, and did not go to bed; continued at Croydon till about eight o'clock on Friday night, and not being able to get a coach, walked the whole way to town; stopped at a public house at Stretham, at about ten o'clock, where he drank a pint of beer, and arrived in London about twelve o'clock, and went directly home, and let himself in with the key of the street door, which he had with him, and went directly to bed; saw no person in the house, arose a little before seven the next morning, just as the boys were opening the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080045"></xptr>shop; one of Sander's men, the hair dresser, came and dressed him by half after seven o'clock; staid at home the greatest part of the day, and also the next day, Sunday, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson, from No. 3, Duke's-court, Bow-street and their daughter dined with him; was at home almost the whole day on Monday; about half past six on Monday evening last, a person, a stranger to him, came to his house and asked him if he could oblige Mr. and Mrs. Wigman with cash for a ten pound bank note? he gave the man cash for it; he went away and in less than ten minutes came again, and said, he saw that he had plenty of cash, and desired cash for another ten pound bank note, which he gave him; the man went away, and came again in ten minutes, and asked for change for another bank note, does not know what was the sum, but gave him cash for it; the man went away, and came again in a very few minutes and brought more notes, which he changed by giving cash; thinks the man came a sixth time, and he gave him cash for other notes; the whole amount of the cash, that the examinant gave to the man, was upwards of a hundred pounds. The man with whom the examinant had the above transactions was a tall thin man, middle aged, his hair tied behind, dark colour, wore a black coat and waistcoat, round hat; saw him on Tuesday morning pass by, says, he passed also Mr. Wigman's house, but he did not go in there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. He said that what you had taken down about Croydon was not true, and he refused to sign it? - He was not asked to sign it.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the notes that were at the bankers, Dorset's, he said that some of them he had had by him some considerable time? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q.There was a considerable number of notes besides those that you call in question? - It does appear so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys here proposed three objections upon which this case was incompetent to go to a jury. First, that they had not proved any letter was taken from the mail in the country of Middlesex, as required by the statute. Second, That the indictment had not stated the letter so directed as proved; namely, stealing it to be directed to

                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery at Woolwich—on Christmas night, about half-past 9, I was leaving the Uncle Tom's Cabin, when I met the prisoner—he snatched my Indian War medal off my breast, and ran away—I went in search of him, but never saw him till at the police<lb></lb>station the next day—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the medal—I had seen the prisoner that night before in the Uncle Tom's Cabin—I knew him again when I saw him at the Court House.</p>

                  </hi> I am waiter at the Uncle Tom's Cabin, at Woolwich—I saw the prisoner there on Christmas night—I did not hear anything about a medal until the policeman came and took Porter and Bate—that was somewhere about 10 o'clock, or a quarter to 10—I noticed where they were sitting when the constable took them—I found two medals under the table, but not where they had been sitting—one medal had the name of Johnson, and the other the name of Murray—one of them was broken—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the one with the name of Murray—that was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the prisoners were taken to the station.</p>

            . I am a footman to colonel Fitroy; on Saturday the 4th of March, the family went to bed about one o'clock, I rose between six and seven in the morning expecting to go into the pantry, I had the key in my hand; I went to the door and found it open; the larder window, which was a leaden casement was cut out and I found the cupboard belonging to it quite open, the knife cases also were open and I missed the chests of plate; I went immediately up stairs again to Mr. Gaines, the steward, and Gaines and I came down together, and when he came down and found the plate missing, he observed one of the chests was left in the coal-hole broke, the plate however was taken out, the iron area gate is never open, not even in the day time, it is always kept shut, the lock was picked; I never saw Jones before; I have seen Ridout who is one of the accomplices; I saw Jones before his examination in Litchfield Street, he was conversing with Hopkins, who was there, Hopkins said to Jones</p>
               <p>"Do you like pork?" "yes," said he,</p>
               <p>"and pease pudding too, and he hoped they</p>
               <p>"should soon get some as good as that they</p>
               <p>"found at Fitroy's" a woman in company upon this said to Jones, where did you get that good living; he said he got that at colonel Fitzroy's, in Albemarle-street, Jones came to me and asked me where my master's taylor lived, I said, what is that to you, he said my master's taylor had used his coat ill, and he would bring his bill against him for it. On the night of the robbery, there was a leg of pork and pease pudding in his house, when I came down in the morning, there was a cloth laid and knives and forks, pepper and vinegar and a great deal eat.</p>
               <p>"On his cross examination, he said, that the</p>
               <p>"first time he saw Jones, was when he was</p>
               <p>"in custody for this robbery, in a public</p>

               <p>"was made of pork and pease pudding, till</p>
               <p>"they mentioned it; that the men servants</p>

            . I was present at the public house. When they were in custody Jones came up to me and Doley asked, who was Mr. Fitzroy's taylor. Doley asked, what was it to him. He said, d - n him, he had ripped his coat open, and he would bring his bill for it against Mr. Fitzroy. After that, one Hopkins asked Jones, if he loved pork. He said, aye and pease pudding, by G - d, I hope we shall have some more of it by and by. A young woman asked him, where that entertainment was? He said, at Fitzroy's: this passed in the public room.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination, he said, the great coat was taken on the prisoner's back, that it was taken off on suspicion of it's being Doley's: that the taylor ripped it up to look at the lining, to see whether it was Mr. Fitzroy's servant's or no.</p>

            , I have been in Mr. Fitzroy's house several times, I used to assist cooper, and helped to clean the plate, I knew the ways of the house very well being frequently backwards and forwards in it, I have seen Jones at the king's arms in crompton street soho, once when prisoner Jones was there, he asked me about Mr. Fitzroy's house, this was 2 or 3 days after Cooper had called on me there it was about a fortnight before this happened, he asked me whether he had a great deal of plate, and he asked me if he could come, I answered without doubt you may, and upon that he said within a week it should be done, he said I was to have a share in the Wack, which is a cant word for part of the money, I told him where the house was and where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177505310037"></xptr> the plate was and that he could get into it no other way than at the kitchen window; I did not see him again to have any conversation with him till after the robbery. The day after, in the morning seeing an account of the robbery in the news-paper, I went to Jones in Peter-Street, St. Anns; I saw him in a public house, I said to him, I see Fitzroy's house is robbed; upon which Jones said is it, I answered. yes, Jones said, he knew nothing at all about it; I said, I thought it was very odd; then he called me to the door and bid me hold my tongue and say nothing at all about it, and said the property was not disposed of: he gave me no money at that time two or three days after I saw him again, and then I borrowed a couple of shillings or eightteen pence of him: about a week after he lent me half a guinea: at that time, Hawkins was with him; Hawkins lent me half a guinea also: there was nothing said about the property. I have seen Hawkins often with Jones and by himself. I heard no talk about the plate. Jones did say there was some French plate that would not come to any thing, at the time we were talking about the robbery; and he said the property was not disposed of, because the French plate could not be sold for any thing. I did not talk with him with a view of having part of the booty. I cannot say, but I did expected to be paid, but did not take the two half guineas as part of payment. About a week after the robbery, I saw Hawkins and Jones in Peter Street, they were just come from the country; and I observed Jones had better cloaths on than I usually saw him in.</p>

We went into the Bear and Drummer, Oxford Street: there he asked me, if I would accept of some plate, which he would got on Saturday night. I made answer, why do you bring it to me, why don't you carry it to the men to whom you used to sell it? Upon which, Jones answered, they gave him no price. Hawkins at that time was with him, I asked Jones, who Hawkins was. He said, he was one of his partners. Hawkins told me, that he sold fifteen watches for nine guineas, to

            ; and asked me, if I would give a better price. I said, I was not sure they would get it; I told them, I would call the landlord and give them a direction where I lived. The landlord came, and wrote the direction and gave it them, that they might call at my house, when they got the plate: my direction was at a fruit shop in Duke's Court, Whitechapel. Jones shewed me where he lived, at number 4, in some court, the name of which I don't recollect. I came on the Monday after, into that court, and began calling old cloaths; upon which Jones came out, and said, he had a great coat and hat to sell. I said, you have had a good pull, a good hawl; upon which Jones first denied it; and then Hawkins came, and theyboth told me, it was worth their while; that they had got as much silver as they could carry; and they said, they had sold it to

Upon my asking, why they did not bring it to me; they told me, that their reason for not doing it, was, I I lived in so public a place, they could not bring it to me. They asked me afterwards, if I would buy a great coat that they had with the things. I told them I would not buy such things, after such a robbery, I would not be concerned with it. They said, they had some meat in the house.</p>

            . I am a publican, at No. 6, in Mortimer Street, the Bear and Drummer. I have seen Wesselly, and to the best of my knowledge, the two prisoners, two or three months ago: I am not positive to them; but I have seen Wesselly in the back room, and two or three men in company with him; One of the company asked me to write his direction. I don't recollect which it was; but I recollect it was to Duke's Place; and there were three in company, but I cannot swear to them.</p>

            . Daniel. I am a barber in St. Giles's, I searched Jones's lodgings in John's-Street, Clerkenwell, some time after the robbery. I know it was Jones's lodgings, because when I came there I saw his wife, and Jones directed me to the house at the time he was in custody. (He produced a parcel of picklocks and screws in court, which he found in Jones's drawers among his cloaths.)</p>

            . I went to apprehend Jones at the beginning of March at twelve at night in Ruport-street; he knew what we were come for, felt in his pocket for a knife, swore he would not be taken, and made some resistance; after he was taken he had some conversation with Hopkins about eating of pudding; he said he had plenty of it, he would have more soon, that it was at Mr. Fitzroy's; I had never seen Hawkins before, I know nothing at all of him.</p>

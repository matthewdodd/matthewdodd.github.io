                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. It was immediately after seeing Moore and the woman together, on my third call, that I saw Ord—the reference to Welham I got from Mr. Ledger—I have never seen Ord write—I did not notice any name on the premises—I am aware that a Mr. Clift, a respectable sadler, in Birmingham, gave a reference for Francis and Co.—it was the habit of Francis and Co. to pay a certain sum on account of goods ordered—that was the mode of operation, to acquire confidence; that was why Mr. Clift gave the reference, he afterwards withdrew it—Ord told me that he had had business transactions with Francis and Co. for some time past as evidenced by his books, and that they were then indebted to him—I found these papers in the office, some on files and some lying about—I did not find any on Ord's person that I remember—there are none in Ord's handwriting except the references—he made no objection to the inspection of his books—there were some barrels in the shop—I don't know what they contained.</p>

When I showed Parker the paper marked Br, he said "I wrote that as the clerk of Buxton, Abbott, and Co."—he said that as he went to the station, not in his house—I only found hats there, not coal; the name of "Parker and Sons, hatters," was over the door—there was a case of whiskey that had not been paid for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POCOCK</hi>. I found four documents on Batson relating to his connection with Hudson, they are from a firm of accountants, as to a meeting of creditors, and a statement of Hudson's affairs—there was also a blank acceptance of Hudson and Co.—I have not found anything that I believe to be in Batson's handwriting, but I don't know his writing—he gave his address, Argyll Street; I went there and found he lived there occasionally—these letters were addressed there—he either said he knew nothing of Mellor, Green, and Co., or had no connection with them—he did not mention Jackson's name—Butters described Batson before he went to Bow Lane, and when he saw him he identified him as Green—Prendergast was not the man I thought was Mills, Mills was discharged—I have not got here to-day the pieces of blue paper found on Batson; I produced them the first day, there was some writing on them, I could not see what it was—I don't think there was a fire in the grate—I found 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Batson.</p>

Mootham told me he had acted as—clerk to Jackson for a fortnight, and before that he had known him some time—I apprehended him on the 15th—he gave his correct name and address, he said he had called in to see Jackson as a friend, I understood—I will not swear that he used the word friend; what I understood was that he had not called on business—this book, containing entries of Mellor, Green, and Co., was under what appeared to be a desk—it was quite possible or a person to be in the office and not see it; I did not see it till my attention was called to it—I think the writing in it is Jackson's—I have not seen Mootham write—he said he knew nothing about the book—jackson said it belonged to a friend, and he wanted Mootham to take it to him—Moothan said he bad nothing in the office belonging to him except a shirt—I arrested him without a warrant, I told him it was on a charge of conspiracy—I only found 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—on Jackson I found 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the address Tower Street on one of the cards found on Mootham was written by me—he told me that he had carried on business there some time before as Mootham and Co.—the signature "John Mootham," on the paper Dn, I do not think is his—I found a sampling card on him granted by the Broker's association—I have not produced it, I did not think it material—I have not made any inquiries that will enable me to say that he has been employed several respectable firms in legitimate business—I have no previous knowledge of anything against him—I searched his lodgings and found a few cards of Law Brothers—he has been in prison three months.</p>

I accompanied O'Callaghan to Jackson's premises in Water Lane on 15th December—the account he has given is correct—I brought Law up yesterday from South Shields—he was searched by Inspector Pattison, who handed me these memoranda—two of them are cards of "Law Brothers, Coal Merchants and Factors, Acorn. Wharf, Canal Bridge, Old Kent Road"—the third is a paper with the names of Jackson, Wood, Thompson and Law, and the other is a receipt of Law for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dated 15th November, 1876.—I read the warrant to Law—he said "I don't know Francis"—I said "You know Jackson?"—he said "I do, I have had two transactions with him; I had a barge load of coal for sale. Jackson paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account, and as 1 could not supply him with the coal I then returned the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back; I believe him to be an honest man"—he also said "I knew Mootham; he used to fetch my letters from 110, Cannon Street, and forward those letters on to Portsmouth, he was not allowed to open them"—I told him that he was in custody—he said "I am very sorry for he is a nice young man and well connected"—I spoke about the names of the others who were in custody, but he said he knew none of the others only Jackson and Mootham—I found on him this letter addressed Mr. G.

                  </hi> I am a clerk in the service of the Great Eastern Railway Company, in the coal department—between 25th November and 11th December we received twenty-one trucks of coal consigned to Darleston and Sons; seventeen were from the Cannock Company—they were delivered into Hughes', the lighterman's, barges.</p>

I am a barge owner at West Ham—between 28th November and 11th December I received twenty trucks of coal from the Black wall Depot of the Great Eastern Railway Company into my barges and delivered them to Hudson's Wharf, at Bow—I was employed by a Mr. Jacobs, a coal merchant—I saw Terry at Hudson's on one occasion—he gave me no instructions—I do not know what he was doing at Hudson Wharf—I had once to call at 159, Fenchurch Street with respect to Lighter age.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, at 10, Walbrook, City—in October last I was applied to by a man named George W. Law, of 110, Cannon Street, for a loan of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he gave as reference Mellor, Green, and Co., to whom wrote, and in reply, dated 19th October, 1876, they say "We have known G. W. Law for a length of time. We have had many transactions with him, and we are prepared at any time to credit him to the extent of 2501."—I also received two other letters from Mr. Law about the loan, and I sent a clerk to his office, and then another, and then went myself, but ire found no one there—I looked through the letter hole in the door into the office, and saw a small table and two chairs, but no sign of business—I afterwards saw Law at my office and told him his reference was worthless, and I did no business with him.

My orders were legitimate and paid for. I had an accident and afterwards worked for Hudson, who introduced me to Darleston.

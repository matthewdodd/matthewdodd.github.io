                  </hi>. I am a cork merchant, and live in Church-lane, White<lb></lb>chapel. On 17th Oct. the prisoner was brought to me by a party—I had not known him before—I had known the other party—the prisoner produced this bill to me (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he said it was for goods sold and delivered to Joseph Simpson, a neighbour of mine—he wanted it discounted—he said he understood I had accommodated a friend of his on one or two occasions, and if I could do it he should feel obliged—I knew Mr. Simpson by repute, and knew where he lived—I discounted the bill, and paid it into my banker's—it was presented when due, and was returned to me—on 16th Jan. I took the bill to Mr. Simpson, and told him I was rather surprised that a bill of to small an amount was returned—I never saw the prisoner afterwards till he was taken into custody.</p>

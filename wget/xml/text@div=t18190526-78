On Saturday, the 1st of May, in the evening, I found a parcel of tapioca secreted under a press-bedstead in the back-parlour; the prisoner's great-coat hung over it - he used to go home every Saturday night. Having lost considerable property, I retired as if to go to bed, and gave the prisoner leave to go home - I had prepared an officer ready. Immediately as the prisoner left the house I found the parcel gone. I went and joined Forrester, followed the prisoner, and took him at his own door - I found the parcel of tapioca on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The prisoner lived nearly three years with you as a confidential assistant - A. Yes; he visited my patients - I attended his wife gratuitously.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not customary to let him have necessaries in the medicine way - A. Not without permission; he said he took it for the use of his family.</p>
               <p>Q. He was about setting up business for himself - A. I never heard of it till after he was in custody. I had given him notice to leave.</p>

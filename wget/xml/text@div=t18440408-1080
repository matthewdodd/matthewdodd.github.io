                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. William Rhodes. On the 2nd of April, about eleven o'clock, I was engaged at Mr. Williams's, at the end of Cock and Castle-lane—I had been at Mr. Rhodes's brick-field, to cover the bricks from the frost—there is no pathway through the field—no one had any business there except those in Mr. Rhodes's employ—the pri<lb></lb>soner came up to me and said, "Halloo, what do you do here? you have got some one else with you"—I said no, I had not; there was the straw which I sat on, it would not take him long to look at it—the prisoner then knocked my hat off—I told him, if he did not let me alone, I would send for some one to put him out of my field—I meant my master, Mr. Joseph Banks, Mr. Rhodes's foreman—on that the prisoner hit me, then knocked me down; and as I was getting up again I picked up a small piece of brick, or a stone, and threw it at him—he then knocked me down again, and beat me about the head with his fist while I was down—he said nothing else—it was about a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve—when he left me I was not sensible—I am getting a great deal better now, and hope you will have mercy on him—I had known him previously—he had nothing to do with the</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">surgeon, North-place, Ball's-pond.</hi> On Tuesday morning, the 2nd of April, I was called to attend the prosecutor—I found him bleed<lb></lb>ing profusely from three wounds, two on the lower left eyelid, and one on the right lower eyelid, but that was a very trifling wound; those on the left were about one-eighth or one-tenth of an inch in length, and about three-quarten of an inch in depth—his head was extremely tumefied from extravasation of blood, his eyes having bled—measures were adopted to relieve him—he was in a state of torpidity from concussion of the brain—they were rugged lacer<lb></lb>ated wounds, and were done by some obtuse substance; probably it might be done with the knuckles pressed violently—they might be inflicted with a brick; I cannot undertake to swear they were—it was supposed that he was likely to die from the concussion of the brain—the Magistrate, Mr. Coombe, came down in the evening, about six o'clock, to take the deposition of the man, when partial sensibility was restored—he is not well yet; he is under my care now—in time the eye will recover, but the maxillary bone is still much hurt—there is still chronic inflammation about the eye—blood has been ab<lb></lb>stracted, and incisions have been made to take away the blood which has been effused—he had a very violent beating indeed—the wound on the eye might probably have been done with a nail.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was going through the brick-fields; I heard some one snoring in the straw; I found the man asleep; I pulled the straw up, touched him on the hat, and said, "Rise up, old fellow;" he said, "I will rise you;" he got up, and hit me on the arm; I hit him in the face; be took up a bit of brick; I hit him on the eye, and knocked him down with my fist; he hal<lb></lb>looed "Police;" I said, "If you halloo 'Police,' I will halloo Murder," and did so two or three times; I afterwards turned faint, fell down, and laid there till the policeman took me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 64.) I apprehended the prisoner lying on his back with one side of his face all over blood—I shook him two or three times before I could get him up—he seemed stupid when I first got him up—I asked him why he had done it—he said, "I cannot tell, but some one has knocked me on the head with a brick"—I said, "You can tell us who it is if you like"—he said, "No, I don't know who it was"—I heard cries of "Murder" two or three times, and "Police" once, which was why I went—I found him more to the left than where I heard the cries, about 150 yards from the spot—he was in liquor—he put his hand to his head, and said to me, "You b—, did you do this?"—I took him to the station, and saw a small wound of very little consequence just over the left ear.</p>

This caus'd other Words, and the Prisoner drew his Sword (the Deceas'd's hanging upon a Peg) which as soon as the Company saw, they interpos'd, and took it from him, but did not see him wound the Deceas'd, who soon fell down and dy'd. Being ask'd if the Deceas'd had any Cane in his Hand, they cou'd not say he had; but were sure there was no Sword drawn but the Prisoner's. A Drawer swore, That hearing a Noise, he ran up, and saw the rest of the Gentlemen between the Prisoner and the Deceas'd; and being ask'd if the Deceas'd had a Cane, said he saw none. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that the Deceas'd having given him ill Language, he reply'd he was a Gentleman, and as good as he; whereupon the Deceas'd struck him several times with a Cane, and he did draw his Sword, but did not make any Push, and believes the Deceas'd might in his Eagerness run upon the Point. To prove the Deceas'd cau'd him, one Mrs. Evans made Oath, that she lives just over-against the King's Arms Tavern; and being up in her Chamber, and hearing a great Noise, she went to the Window, from thence the Sashes being up) she could plainly see and hear all that pass'd in the Room, where the Prisoner and the Deceas'd, and the other Gentlemen were, it being a Room upon a pair of Stairs; and that she did hear the Deceas'd (as she since understood it to be) give the Prisoner a great many hard words, and afterwards saw him strike him, but could say nothing to the drawing the Sword. Another Woman swore, That going along the Street on the other side of the Way, she heard a Noise in the Room, and saw the Deceas'd strike the Prisoner with a Cane or a Stick several times. The same was sworn by a Watchman, that he heard the Words into the Street, and saw the Deceas'd strike the Prisoner 3 times. There were also several who had look'd at the Room where the Accident happen'd, from Mrs. Evan's Chamber, and from the other side of the Street, and swore, that high Words might be heard, and Persons distinguish'd from either of the Places. The Prisoner had several Gentlemen who said their Meeting was accidental, and that the Deceas'd and he never had the least Disagreement, and also, that the Prisoner had at all times behav'd himself after a very ineffective and courteous Manner, and that he was born a Gentleman, his Grandfather and Father being both Justices of Peace in Ireland, whereupon the Jury brought him in <rs id="t17140908-36-verdict194" type="verdictDescription">

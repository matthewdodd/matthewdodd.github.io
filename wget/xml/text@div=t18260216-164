I held her some time, and then took her to Chapple-street - I could not find the watchman, and I brought her back- I could not find a watchman to take her, and left her with the other woman - I then met two Bow-street officers, who took her - she said she had not robbed me - she had got no money. As she was going to the watch-house she said she had got but 3s., and when she got there she took her money out of her pocket in her hand, and laid it on the table; the officer laid his hand on her's, and said"What money have you got here?" she said 3s.; he said"Are you sure of that?" she said Yes.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. The prosecutor complained to me that me could not get a watchman - he then pointed the prisoner out to me - she was very drunk, and had part of her things off - she kept saying she had but 3s., which was her own, and when she came to the watch-house she put her hand with her money down on the table; I said "What have you got here?" she said 3s. I found I sovereign and two shillings in her hand. The Magistrate gave me two summonses to find the watchmen, but the prosecutor could not identify them- he was perfectly sober.</p>

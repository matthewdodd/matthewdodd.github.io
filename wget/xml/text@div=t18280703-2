On the 17th of June, at six o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by my servants, who stated the house had been robbed - I got up immediately, and found two pannels taken out of two separate doors at the back of the house, and a great many things missing from the drawing-room and the library; some of the things lay outside, on the step of the door - one is an outer-door, there is then a small entry; the inner-door leads directly into the house - the inner-door leads to the open air as there is no roof to the entry; the pannel might be large enough to admit a small boy; but I apprehend it was done to put a hand in and undo the fastenings - the doors were not in that state the night before; I missed the greater part of a clock, two silver candlesticks, a small pocket-book and sixteen or seventeen small articles; the candlesticks were certainly worth 25l. - the servant missed some forks and spoons; every thing was my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You know nothing of the prisoner? A. No - he was taken at a quarter before four o'clock that morning; I have recovered every thing of consequence but the body of one clock - some small articles have not been found.</p>

            . I am a patrol of St. George's. On the 17th of June, a quarter before four o'clock in the morning, I was coming up St. James's-street into Piccadilly, and looking towards the Park I saw the prisoner coming towards me with a bundle under his arm; when he came up to me I said, "You appear to be a sailor" - he said he was; I said, "I suppose you are going on board." and he said he was; I felt the bundle which he had under his arm - he said it was nothing but his clothes, and that he wished to go down St. James's-street a little way, not to expose himself there; we came down to Berry-street - he put the bundle down on a step, and I immediately saw something shine, which was a small ink-stand - I then found a large candlestick; I brought him and the property to the watch-house - he made no resistance; the constable of the night examined the bundle, and all these articles were found in it and taken in charge by Turner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I take it for granted you stated the conversation to the Magistrate the same as you have to his Lordship? A. I did - I have stated all he said; he did not tell me he had found the property under a hedge, nor that he saw three men digging; when he was fully examined I heard him say he got it under a hedge, where there were three men - he said so at the watch-house when he was examined by the constable; he said he was coming from Uxbridge, and had seen three men under a hedge digging - that he made the best of his way up towards them - they left this property, and he took it; he said the three persons ran away as he was coming up.</p>

            . I am a house patrol of St. George's, Hanover-square. The prisoner was brought into the watch-house five minutes before four o'clock on the 17th of June; I saw the bundle opened, containing the articles which have been mentioned - I searched him, and found this stock of a centre-bit concealed between the lining of his jacket; he had made a hole to put it in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The stock was not of any use without the bit? A. No - I found no bit; it was carefully concealed in his jacket; I did not know him before - he appeared a sailor by his dress, but his hands did not look like a seaman's - he said he had not been on shore more than six weeks; I have myself been a soldier and a sailor.</p>

            . I went to the watch-house at five o'clock, and took charge of the prisoner and these articles - I was not there when he was brought in; Bissix delivered them to me - I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you examine the premises? A. Yes - I should think it would have required three persons to have done what I observed there; I found the glass of an ink-stand just by the door - I found a screw-driver in the field in front of the house, near the door by the hedge, and this scissor-case.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the account he gave of the persons being under the hedge? A. He told me it was by the road side - I found this box near the hedge.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030006"></xptr>Q. Was it between the hedge and the prosecutor's house that the different articles were afterwards found, except the ink-stand? A. Yes - it appeared that the persons had gone from the house to the hedge, and dropped the things which I found; there are a good many officers about at four o'clock in the morning - there was no dirt about the bundle at all; he did not describe any particular spot where he had found it, but said by the road side - I went to the hedge about nine o'clock that morning, and found some persons at work in the road there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He did not describe any part of the hedge? A. No - I looked every where to find the centre-bit, and could not; I could see that persons had been lying under the hedge on the grass; there is a field between the hedge and the road coming from the house - there appeared to have been more than one person there.</p>
               <p>MR. FOX. These candlesticks are mine, I have no doubt - I had seen them in my room at a quarter to one o'clock that morning; this clock is my brother's, and was in my charge - these two ten-spoons and two forks I can swear to; the ink-stand is mine, it is silver, and worth 10l. and more; I cannot say whether more than one person had committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were the doors open, or only the pannels broken? A. They were open when I went down, but I was not present when it was first discovered.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming up from my cousin's, at Uxbridge - he used to be ostler at the Bell; I wanted to see him before I went away again; as I came up the road I saw three men digging at the side of the hedge- as soon as they saw me they ran away and left these things; I brought them along till I was stopped; I had come home in the Buckingham East Indiaman.</p>

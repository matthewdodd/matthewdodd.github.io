               <p>the third floor of the house—I found the two prisoners there at breakfast—it was at 12 o'clock in the day—McLeod, a police-officer, went there with me—we told the prisoners that we were two police officers, and had come to search the place for some stolen property—they made no reply—we only saw two rooms on the third floor, a bed-room and sitting-room—we searched the sitting room first—I found a bag of clothes—I said, "What is in that bag?"—Burrows said, "They are clothes; I am a dealer in clothes" I—I said, "Where did you buy them?"—he said, "I bought them in Petticoat-lane"—Richardson had not spoken to Burrows, in my presence, before Burrows iaid this—I suppose we had been there about five minutes when Burrows said this—we had been in the front room up to that time—I believe Richardson left and went into the bed room after this conversation—one or both of the prisoners was in the room during the whole of this first five minutes—Richardson might have said something to Burrows without my hearing it—I did not hear him say anything—McLeod pulled some of the clothes out of the bag and looked at them, and I put my hand in the bag and pulled out a cruet stand—I said, "Did you buy this, too?"—he said, "Yes; I bought them as a j ob lot, in Petticoat-lane, for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave half a crown for the cruet stand"—Richardson, I, and McLeod, then went into the bed-room—in searching the bed I found this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) amongst the bed clothes—I picked it up, shewed it to Richardson, and said, "What's in this bag?"—that was before I opened it—he said, "Oh, you know what they are; the things will account for themselves"—I untied the bag—there were eight skeleton latch keys in it—I said to him, "When did you use them last?"—he said, "About eight months ago"—he said he meant to throw them away—when I was at th« Itation I received two keys, a screwdriver, and a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> from Sergeant White—he was not with us on this occasion—we afterwards went there again in the evening of 12th February—McLeod was with me then—we took both the prisoners into custody in the morning—we did not then shut the rooms up and lock them—Richardson's wife was there, and his sister—in tb* evening I found in a table drawer in the front room, eight files, a pair of nippers, a knife, two screwdrivers, and a small hand vice, which is used for making keys—I also found two bunches of keys of different sizes—they are all here—I had not searched that table-drawer in the morning—I iwwi a quantity of cloth cut up—it is all here (<hi rend="italic">The articles were here produced</hi>)—I have heard that Burrows was a tailor—there was nothing there to show it—in a vase on the mantelpiece I found nineteen duplicates relating to wearing apparel—I had not looked at that vase in the morning—I found the cloth pieces in a box which I had looked at in the morning—they were there then, but I had not taken them in the morning—McLeod has got the nineteen duplicates—there are also twenty more duplicates which McLeod found.</p>

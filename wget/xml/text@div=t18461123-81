                  </hi>. I live in Clapton-place, Hackney, and am a baker. The prisoner was in my employ—he had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week at first, and three months ago I raised his wages to 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he lodged in my house, and had his bread—he was employed to receive money of my customers, and was to account in the evening directly he finished his round—if he received 4 3/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Argent, and 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Whitmore, he has not paid it over to me.</p>

HUDDLESTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you prefer this charge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him into custody last Saturday week—when I first went before the Magistrate it was not upon this charge—I keep books—the pri<lb></lb>soner enters what he receives—I have a ledger and day-book—this is the book the prisoner carries with him, and enters the money he receives—I book all the bread off in a book of my own—I have not that book here—I know by my own book what bread I deliver to the prisoner—the prisoner has to enter the money—I carry the several items into my book—I carry the sums I have received, but these are sums I have not received—I do not know whether I have received all the sums without referring to my books—I have not the book here in which I make the entries—I have not gone on with the other charge—it was not my wish to drop the charge—I did not take 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the prisoner, and refuse to give it up—the Magistrate did not make an order on me to give it up—I did not tell the officer not to give it up, nor yet to take it from the box—it was the Magistrate's order—I do not owe the prisoner 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his week's work—he had not completed his week's work—I gave him into custody on Saturday morning the 14th of Nov.</p>

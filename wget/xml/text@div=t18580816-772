                  </hi>. I am in the employment of Mr. Haydon. I was in his shop on the evening of the 21st of July—I saw the female Loveday there; she put a shilling in Mrs. Haydon's hands—when she left the shop, my mistress told me to follow her—when I got out Bide the shop, I saw her going across the road, when King came up and met her—they went across the road again, and went down Whitecross-street together a little way and came up again, and, as they were coming up, I saw the man pass a shilling into the woman's hand—they then both went on together till they came near Mr. Ellis's, a greengrocer—the man went ahead, and the woman stopped at Mr. Ellis's and asked for a halfpenny worth of goose<lb></lb>berries—she gave the boy at the shop a shilling—he gave it to his mistress, who bounced it on the counter, and put it in her pocket—then I went in—the woman had change given to her—when the woman came out of Mrs. Ellis's she went along with the man till they came close by Arbour-square—before they got there, the man gave the woman a shilling—they then went across the road to Mr. Howlett's, the doctor's, at the corner of Arbour-square—the woman went in, and the man remained outside, nearly opposite—I stood outside the shop—when she came out, she went along on the same side about two yards, and then crossed the road again—I then went into the doctor's shop, and made a statement—when I came out again, the two prisoners were both together on the other aide of the way—I went across the road, and followed them right close up—just by the George they stopped; there was a post the female prisoner was passing by—the male prisoner put a shilling by the post, and, after she had passed, he trod upon it—the male prisoner picked up the shilling again, and swallowed it—the prisoners then crossed the road, and opposite the George they stopped by the German Chapel—they then went on again pretty near up to Cannon-street, when they separated—before they did so, he said to her, "You go across the road." I walked on a bit till I came up to a policeman, when I gave the woman in charge—before they separated, I saw the man drop something into her hand—he had a silk pocket-handkerchief; he let down the corner of it, and I saw some silver—he took some shillings out—he wrapped it up, and put it into his side pocket—when I met the constable I told him what I had seen, and he took the woman into custody—I heard the sound as of a shilling dropped on to the pavement—there was a crowd,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185808160040"></xptr>
               <p>and it was not found—I pointed out the man in a crowd round the station, and he was taken into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">King. Q.</hi> You state, just before I came to Cannon-street you saw me give the woman a shilling and go across the road? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, you were both together when I gave the woman into custody. I did not give you into custody at the same time as the woman, because the policeman only caught hold of her. I said it was a black handkerchief—I did not say it was silk. I told the policeman I could swear to you by your clothes; I said you had a black coat on—I said nothing about a jacket—I described your dress when I went into the station—after the woman was given in charge I said the man had black corded trowsers on, a black coat, and a cap—I said I could swear to you by your corded trowsers and black cap—it was about half-past 8 to 9 o'clock when I first saw you at Mr. Ellis's shop. I was right behind you when I saw you give the woman a shilling—I could tell it was a shilling—I saw you put it into her hand.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Benjamin Howlett, surgeon, of Arbour-terrace, Commercial-road—on 21st July, the female Loveday came into our shop about 9 o'clock at night; she asked for two ounces of salts—I served her with it and she put something resembling a shilling on the counter; I told her it was a bad one—she said she had just taken it in change of a vegetable man; she took it up and left the shop—it bent nearly double—the police-constable Richardson afterwards brought the woman into the shop—the last witness came into the shop immediately after the woman had left.</p>

I took her to Mrs. Haydon's shop, when she identified her, and I then took her to the station-house. I saw a man resembling the male prisoner walking in front of the woman when I took her into custody—the lad (Hopkins) pointed him out to me about half an hour afterwards; he gave me a description of the man—he pointed him out at the station door—there were many people there—I and another constable took him into custody; I told him he was charged with being concerned with the woman Loveday with passing a bad shilling—he said he knew nothing about the woman—the inspector asked him whether he did not know a woman who lived at the same place as the female prisoner in the Commercial-road—he said he did not—the female prisoner was being searched at the time, and he did not see her—the man</p>

I said, "No;" he then said, "Do you not live with her at 9, Commercial-road?"

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, I know him very well, he lived at a mill in the <placeName id="t18090215-111-crimeloc622">Commercial road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18090215-111-crimeloc622" type="placeName" value="Commercial road"></interp>

               <p>Q. Had you occasion to put a horse of your's in a stable adjoining his stable - A. I had; I put him there about the latter end of September, he had been there about three months; the stable belonged to me, it adjoined the mill; the horse was in a very good condition when I put him there first; I gave fifty guineas for him, I sold him last week for about fourteen pounds. I sent my man there regular with from four to five trusses of hay a week.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some certain circumstances that you observed did you speak to Coombes the officer - A. I did; about the 25th of January; I watched the prisoner first; Mr. Coombes advised me to put a label in the truss of hay, we sent a man down to the stable with it, and my brother, and Mr. Coombes the officer likewise followed me; I saw the hay put in the stable and the door padlocked; this was the 25th of January, about six o'clock in the evening, it was moon light, but dark. I, and my brother, and Coombes went into an adjoining garden for the purpose of watching; we saw him go past; he staid there about a quarter of an hour; the prisoner went in about three or four minutes after the man had deposited the hay in the stable; we saw the prisoner go into the stable and take away the hay; when he took the hay out of the stable he came back the same way close to me, and when he came near we immediately rushed upon him; he flung the hay out of his arms; he was apprehended immediately. I saw him throw the hay down; we all three rushed out together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you lose sight of him before he was laid hold of - A. No, he was apprehended that very instant; he said he hoped I would forgive him, it was the first time. After the hay was picked up we got a candle and found the label in it. We took the prisoner to the office; I went back to examine the padlock of the stable door; we found the staple drawed; this is the adze that drawed it out; I found it on the ground by the padlock.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of a truss of hay - A. About three shillings and eight pence.</p>
               <p>Coombes. I have the label; it is both our hand's writing.</p>

On the 11th of August, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners together in Regent-street—I watched, and saw Chandler leave the others, opposite the prosecutor's shop—he crossed and went to the prosecutor's door, where this article was hanging"—I saw him feel it, and then he crossed again to the other two prisoners—he went over and felt it again, then went back again to the other prisoners, and they all three crossed—Bell got over the iron rail in front of the adjoin<lb></lb>ing window, to the prosecutor's, put up his hand, took hold of the top of this article, lifted it off the spike, and let it drop—they all walked off towards the Quadrant—I followed and took them—they did not see me—I was in private clothes-they did not come back to look for it—I secured them some distance on—the prosecutor picked up this article about two minutes after it was ropped—Bell waited, and saw him pick it up, and then they walked off to lhe Mutant, which is about three hundred yards off.</p>

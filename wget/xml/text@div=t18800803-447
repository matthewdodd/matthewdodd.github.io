                  </hi>. I live at 42, Charlotte Street, Kent Road, and am an engineer's labourer—the deceased was my wife—her name was Louisa, and she was 27 years of age next birthday—we had been married nine years—up to three months before her death she had been generally in the enjoyment of good health—about six weeks ago she was admitted into Guy's Hospital as an in-patient—I went to see her there from time to time, the nurse Ingle was attending upon her—on Sunday, 4th. July, I went with my brother to the hospital about 2 o'clock p.m.—we were the first in that day—my wife was lying down, and she asked me to lower the pulley down—I did so, and she pulled herself up in a sitting position, and continued to sit up talking to us until we went away, at 4 o'clock—she was cheerful, and getting on nicely; she even smacked my brother's face—on the following Wednesday, the 7th, I saw her again—I saw an alteration in her directly I went in—I said to her, "Louey, what is the matter with you?"—she was lying cross-legged, and made a com<lb></lb>plaint to me, in consequence of which I spoke to the prisoner, saying, "Nurse, how came these bruises on my wife's arm?"—she said, "I know all about it"—I said, "If anything happens to my wife, you will have to give an account of it"—she made no remark, and went away—I did not tell the prisoner what the deceased had told me—I then saw Dr. Pavy, and told him about the bruises, and asked him if he would allow me to come in a little oftener, and my sister-in-law, and I then left—next morning I saw my wife again, and she was worse still—I don't think I saw the prisoner then, I think it was another nurse that was coming in to attend her—I went to the hospital every day after till the day of her death (21st July)—on one of those occasions the prisoner called me out of the ward and said something about my wife being hysterical, and that it was a very bad case—I said, "I want nothing at all to do with you"—on the Wednesday before I had this conversation with the nurse I looked at my wife's arm and chest—there were five bruises on the left—the right arm she could not raise out of the bed—there was a slight bruise upon her chest—on the Saturday after the Wednesday I was sent for to the hospital—the prisoner had left—the deceased was afraid of her, and used to dread seeing her coming along the ward—she complained to me three or four times, and on Wednesday, 21st July, about five minutes past 11 p.m., she died—she never rallied no more.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR JOHN HOLKER</hi>. My wife had been ill for some little time before she went to the hospital—I think she went in about 9th June—I was there every time I could get away, I never missed any time both Sunday and Wednesday too—on the Sunday I was there with my brother—she looked a good deal better, and I went home quite cheerful—she then told me she had been trying to dress herself on the previous Tuesday, and that she had had a fall by the bedside, No. 1 I was there at the time and assisted, it did not hurt her, she had slipped down by the side of the bed—I did not knew that she was suffering from consumption when she went into the hospital, not until we saw the paper over her bed, the first Sunday; I could not make it out, as I cannot read—when I spoke to Ingle about the bruises she did not say, "I do not know how they came there, but it might have been from the way she held on to the side of the bath;" nothing of the sort—she did not refer to the bath—my sister-in-law</p>

               <p>was sitting by the bedside at the time—the prisoner did not say anything about going a second time to the bath and turning on the water when it was too hot—I was there on the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and every day afterwards—Ingle did not tell me after that that she was sure that the doctors and the sisters were making a tool of my wife, nor did she say to anybody belonging to me that they were doing this in order to get rid of her—she did not complain that the doctors had not informed her what the patient was suffering from; I never heard anything of it—she did not say a word to me about my poor wife being hysterical; I do not think we had two minutes' conversation together the whole time I was there, only by the bedside—I remember asking Ingle to accept a present of a shilling on the Friday, when she called me out of the ward—I said to her, "Be kind to my wife, and I will bring you some flowers," when I gave her the shilling—my wife said that the nurse had been very kind to her—I said, "Which nurse?" and she pointed out a tall young lady; I do not know the person's name—I said, "Is that the lady?"—she said "Yes"—I said, "Which is your proper nurse?"—she said, "The black lady"—I did say to Ingle, "If you will be kind to my good lady I will bring you some flowers on Sunday, as you will not accept any money"—she said that she liked flowers, and would gladly accept them—I did not bring her any flowers—I did not see the bath—I think there were six or seven bruises upon the deceased altogether—I did not count them, the day I saw them I saw Dr. Pavy—the skin was black and blue.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sister of the Mary Ward at Guy's, and have been so six years or more—the prisoner was a paid day-nurse under my direction—she had been there about four months, I think—I remember the deceased; she was in the hospital for consumption—the prisoner as day-nurse had charge of her, and would perform her duties under my direc<lb></lb>tion—she would have to come on duty at 8 a.m. until 9.50 p.m.—she would have to make the beds directly she came, and attend generally to the patients—if there was any dirt she would have to put on clean things, and if the patient was dirty she would have to attend to her—The prisoner came to me on Monday, 5th July; I was standing in the hall, in the centre of the ward, and she asked me if she might give No. 2 a bath (that was the number of the deceased's bed) as she had passed an evacuation in the bed—I said she might have a bath for the purpose of cleansing; that was all the conversation that passed between us—the prisoner then left me—there is a bath with hot and cold water in the centre of the ward, but not in the room where the patient was—a chair with wheels is provided if the patient is too weak to walk—the bath is 70 feet distant from No. 2 bed—I did not see the deceased taken to or from it—Dr. Pavy had charge of this case, and in the afternoon, between 2 and 4, he generally came round—there was nothing particular in the deceased's appearance that day, but afterwards there was a change—I saw her several times between the time she had the bath and Dr. Pavy's coming—I saw her that day about dinner-time, about 1 o'clock—I think most likely the last time was at 11 o'clock at night—I saw no very marked change in her that day—the next day she appeared worse—Mr. Howsell was the house-surgeon who had charge of this case—. he resides at the hospital, and is called the house-physician.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR JOHN HOLKER</hi>. The bath was given on the Mon<lb></lb>day—Dr. Pavy saw the patient on that same day, between 2 and 4 o'clock;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030120"></xptr>
               <p>I was there; I was sent for—Dr. Pavy, Mr. Howell, and several clerks were there, and the nurse—at that time I did not observe any marked change in the patient's appearance—Dr. Pavy asked me if I knew about the bath, and I said I knew that she had had a bath—a variety of questions were put to me about the bath—Dr. Pavy did not draw my attention to any alteration in the patient's appearance, nor did any of the other doctors, and I did not observe any till the next day—she then seemed to be weaker, and there was a change of countenance, a sort of vacant stare; the countenance wore a distressed look, and when spoken to she did not answer readily or collectedly—I have charge of the Mary Ward, not of any other—I am the sister and have charge of all the nurses in that ward; I am the responsible head of that ward—I have had a large experience in nursing—in order to get to the bath, <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 2 patient would have to get out of bed and then be taken between a number of beds across the central hall, then turn to the right and into the bath room—there is an arch between the ward and the central hall which you have to pass under, and then get into the bath-room—there is a long raised bath there, not against the wall; you can walk round it—this sketch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) fairly represents it—there are four day nurses and two night curses—I saw this patient every day; she had been getting better up to a certain time, but not quite so well three days before the bath; but on the Monday when her husband came she was better—I saw her on the Sunday, she was cheerful and seemed to be rallying—I knew that she was suffering from consumption; I knew it by being present when Dr. Pavy visited her, soon after she was admitted—when the physicans attend it is the practice to go round to the various beds and examine the patients, and the students occasionally accompany them, and the nature of the disease is explained—I was present when Dr. Pavy gave the students an explanation of this disease; I cannot remember when that was—I don't remember his saying "This patient seems to have been suffering from various aches and pains, for which there seems no apparent cause at present"—he might have said so—he said nothing to me about hysteria, I don't remember it—I remember his saying something of this kind; "There is a certain pallor denoting mischief of some kind, I should say proceeding from an anaemic condition of the body, but we shall hear more when her case is thoroughly gone into"—it was when he was addressing the patients at the bedside I learnt that in his view the patient was suffering from consumption—I do not know whether it was on the first visit or not—that was the only communication I had on the subject, hearing what was said—I am the sister who is responsible for the nursing—it is very important that I should know exactly what a patient is suffering from, and I did know in this case; I knew what was alleged; I knew it too by being written up on the bed letter, on the card—the card is put there the first day the patient came in, but it may not have been written on that day—I do not mean that the disease is always written up the first day; also the date, and the prescription—the disease is not always described for some time, it might be weeks; I have known many instances of that—possibly it has not been ascertained—phthisis was the disease put on the card—that was put on some time before the patient died, before the bath; I am quite sure of that—this consump<lb></lb>tion was not in an active condition, the reverse, it was quiescent—there was lung mischief, but it was not developing itself—Dr. Pavy did not tell me that she had hysterical tendencies; I do not remember his saying that—I</p>

               <p>heard that he wished her to get up, because she would become weaker by lying in bed—we very frequently have hysterical patients in the hos<lb></lb>pital, especially females—hysteria is a very common disease—a woman suffering from hysteria imagines that she has ailments which she really has not; many of them imagine that they cannot move their limbs; that is the form of the disease—a common way of treating them is to induce them to exert themselves—I have known such cases over and over again—Ingle is a fairly educated woman—when she came to me on the Monday morning she said the bath was wanted for cleansing purpose—I saw no harm in the patient having it, providing it was properly administered—I had not received from any of the medical men any injunction against the patient having a bath—she was put into a bath when she was first brought in—all patients are bathed upon admission—if a person is too ill they are not bathed—between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning, when this bath was given, the water would not be very hot, later on it would become more so—I gave no specific directions about the bath, I left that to Ingle—I gave her directions about the soiled bed—I saw her after the woman had been taken to the bath, and asked her where No. 2 was; I saw that the bed was vacant——she said she was in the bath-room—I said "Not in the bath?"—she said "No, she is sitting in a chair wrapped in a blanket," or something to that effect—she did not say she had placed her upon the chair in order that she slight have a good rest before she came back—I believe she said she was wrapped in a blanket—the prisoner has been there about four months—I lure had no cause to complain of her—we have not had many cases of tubercular disease of the brain in the hospital—I had an idea that this woman was suffering from it, after the bath, and before the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I was not informed of it—Dr. Pavy did not tell me—he said she seemed to have had a shock; he did not put it in any other form—none of the physicians told me that she was suffering from disease of the brain—I did not know that it was so important that I should know it—tubercular disease of the brain is fatal—I was not really informed of it, but I thought so from the symptoms—in tubercular disease the patients suffer from headache, and nausea, and torpor, a strong reluctance to use any exer<lb></lb>tion, a confusion of ideas, and difficulty in expressing what they want to ex<lb></lb>press—inability to control the motions is one symptom, and inability to stand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> From the Wednesday, 9th Juno, when the patient first came in I knew that she was suffering from consumption; I think after one or two visits had been made by the physicians, and from the card at the head of the bed—the moment it is ascertained what the disease is it is put down on the paper, it is also the custom to enter the medicines pre<lb></lb>scribed; I have 56 beds under my charge—I cannot tell you the date when the word "phthisis" was first written on the paper—as she gradu<lb></lb>ally got worse the symptoms led me to suppose she was suffering from tubercular disease of the brain; that was several days after Monday the 5th—as sister of the ward I act under the directions of the doctors, un<lb></lb>less I had any special directions the patients would simply be nursed—I should not take upon myself to give a bath as medical treatment—this was the only bath she had, except the cleansing bath she had when she first came in—I could not say that I ever saw any hysteria in this patient—after the bath I heard Dr. Pavy mention the word, but I could not tell you exactly in what way.</p>

               <p>morning, July 5th, I was coming out of the bath-room at a quarter to 9 o'clock, I think it was, I will not be sure, in the direction of the hall which leads into the ward—I saw the nurse bringing the deceased into the bath-room and she said to me, "She has been very dirty; she has dirtied all her things"—I did not answer, I went back to my work, and some time afterwards I had occasion to go into the bath-room—I do not know what the time was then, but I think it must have been about a quarter-past 10 o'clock—(the deceased was dressed in her night dress, with her bootson—she had no covering except her nightdress—I did not see them before they got to the bath-room, coming down)—it was about quarter-part 10 o'clock when I went into the bath-room and saw them again, and then I saw the deceased sitting in the bath, at the foot of the bath, with her hands on the woodwork, trying to raise herself up—as soon as I opened the door she said, "Oh, Mary, I am so cold"—I said, "Can't you get out of the bath?"—she said, "No"—I then said, "Where is nurse?"—she said, "I don't know"—I then came out of the room and shut the door after me, and went to find the nurse, as the sister was not in the ward at the time—I found Ingle, the nurse, at No. 13 bed; the de<lb></lb>ceased's bed was No. 2—I did not notice what she was doing, but I think she was arranging the quilt; I said, "Do you know that No. 2 is in the bath, shivering, and she says she cannot get out"—she said, "Yes, I know she is in the bath, but she really is so very obstinate, she won't assist herself, and I am determined I won't help her"—nothing more was said—while this conversation was going on between me and the prisoner; I did not notice what she was doing—I went into the hall and saw patient No. 42, and asked her if she would not go into the bath-room and help the deceased to get some clothes on—about 10 minutes after I had the conversation by bed 13 Ingle went into the bath-room; I could, not see what took place but; 3 noticed that there was not much water in the loath, not sufficient to cover the de<lb></lb>ceased's hips; I cannot say how much there would be—the hath is worked by three taps, hot, cold, and waste—I did not put my hand in the hath at all—during the time I saw the prisoner with the deceased she had hold of her arm taking her to the bath; one leg she dragged behind, and the other leg she moved forward—the prisoner had hold of her, because her arm looped in her arm, the same as you take hold of another person's arm; I mean arm in arm—after she came out of the bath I saw her bringing her from the bath with a blanket over her head, I could not see her face—I saw them coming across the hall—coming back the prisoner had hold of her arm, dragging her in the same way, and she pushed the deceased's leg which dragged behind; she put her knee underneath the leg which was dragging, and kicked it along—while she was doing that I heard her say it was obstinacy; that she could walk if she liked—Ingle did not ask me to help the deceased at all.</p>

Ingle had hold of her by one arm; I cannot say which arm. The deceased appeared not to want to go. I did not hear her say anything. No one was near her. The deceased was in her night-dress. I went into the bath<lb></lb>room before they went in"—that was true, as far as I can remember—from these steps I saw her being dragged by her arm, she was not walking—I intended to tell the Coroner's Jury that I saw her being dragged across the hall—I have not said that I was very glad that this woman was charged; but I never liked her from the first time I saw her—the deceased was not</p>

                  </hi>, M.D., F. R C. P. I am one of the physicians of Guy's Hospital—I have been connected with the hospital 33 years from my student days—I remember this patient, Louisa Morgan, being admitted into the Mary Ward, to No. 2 bed, on Wednesday, 9th of June—I saw her on the same day that she was admitted—she was suffering from consump<lb></lb>tion, affecting the lower part of the left lung, and there were various erratic pains, which, in the absence of any tangible cause, I put down to her being hysterical, and was supported in that opinion by the previous history, which was to the effect that she had been married at 16 years of age, which was 10 years previously, her age being 26, that she had had one child, a year after her marriage, and had no family since, and was the subject of a leucorrhoeal discharge—I examined her chest—there were no marked symptoms of consumption—we were guided by the results of the physical examination of the chest—it is the practice to put upon paper the name of the patient and the name of the disease; I have that paper here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is upon a printed form, "No. 2, Mary Ward; name of the patient, Louisa Morgan; age, 26; name of disease, phthisis, left side"—I don't know whose writing that is—the physician dictates the name of the disease to the clinical clerk, and the clinical clerk writes it down, and also the prescription—I prescribed for her and the clinical clerk wrote it down, and on that paper my first prescription is entered on June 9th—I do not go the rounds of the hospital every afternoon; I go three times a week—after the 9th June, I went from time to time to see this patient—I saw her on Friday, 2nd July—during all this time, from 9th June to 2nd July, she had no attack to my knowledge of hysteria—I had not all this time treated her entirely</p>

               <p>for the disease of the left lung; her general condition was weakness general weakness; that was the main feature of her case—about a fortnight afterwards I said to the sister that it was desirable that she should be got up in the evening if possible, saying that the longer she remained in bed the weaker she would get—on Friday, 2nd July, there was scarcely any difference in her from the time of her admission into the hospital—I found nothing serious in her state about that time; but on 2nd July, or it might have been the Wednesday previous, my attention was called to her com<lb></lb>plaining of a pain in her left leg; I examined her left leg, and could not find any tangible cause for the pain—she seemed to be as usual—the next time I saw her was Monday, 5th July, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, or a little after 3 o'clock—I was struck with her altered appearance, and I made the exclamation, "What has occurred to make this alteration?"—she was in bed—Nurse Ingle then was present, and the patient No. 2 made a statement to me—Ingle was standing at the foot of the bed, and I should think she could hear, I have no reason to believe that she could not; she was standing at the foot of the bed—the patient was in a feeble state and crying—it was made in a hesitating manner; disconnected or hesitating—I sat on the bed in order to hear better what she said—when she made the statement Ingle made no reply to it—she spoke in a voice which could be heard, and I should repeat her answers, because the students were all round—I had not to put my ear to her mouth—it was in a voice sufficiently loud for those standing round the bed to hear her, but in my way of putting questions to patients, I very often repeat the answers—I will not say that she spoke so loud that Ingle heard all she said, but she spoke sufficiently loud for a person standing where the nurse was to hear what she said—I was not obliged to sit on the bed to hear what she said, but in order that I might the better hear what she said; I am a little hard of hearing myself; I don't say it with reference to this case, but I find I am obliged to put questions twice to hear the answer—that may be the fault of the questioner—she was half crying—I do not mean to say that some portion of the conversation in my judgment she could not hear—just the same as I should say of every conversation, that I cannot say that every word was audible—it was ordinary conversa<lb></lb>tion, such as in my judgment a person standing where she was could have heard; and the substance of the conversation I am sure would be heard by the nurse—she made no remark, but she made a remark afterwards that I had not made any inquiries of her—the deceased said, "I was taken to the bath-room this morning, and placed in a bath with cold water to begin with, and was kept in the bath for an hour and a half;" she then went on to say, "I could not help it; it was a mistake that any one is liable to make sometimes"—she said she was in the bath some time before warm water was turned on—Ingle said nothing at that time—I found the patient half crying, and there was this further said, that she had not been able to get warm since—she seemed cold and was shivering—I did not examine her at that time to see if her state of health had been affected at all, but I made the observation at once that this patient's statement must be inquired into, and I sent for the sister of the ward, who was attending with another physician at the time—I told her what the patient had said—Ingle was there then, and I paid that the matter must be fully investigated—I requested the house physician, Mr. Howell, to obtain full particulars, and to place them before</p>

               <p>me at my next visit—he resides in the hospital—that was all that passed—supposing the statement of the patient was correct, she was in such a state as I should expect her to be in if she had had this bath given to her; in such a state of cold and shivering; just the state which would be produced by the bath which had been previously administered—I had not ordered a bath for her—in the state she was in it was not a prudent thing to take her from the bed and give her a bath, and keep her away for the time stated, but an ordinary cleansing bath would not be improper then; I should expect proper care to be taken, and if she could not walk she should be carried in a chair—I do not think she was in a fit state to walk from the bed to the bath and back—I saw her again on Wednesday, the 7th—the house physician was with me, and on account of what he said, I carefully examined her body, and found several bruise marks on the left arm—there were bruise marks also, but not to the same extent, on the right arm, and an extensive bruise on the left leg, and the skin there was abraded; the marks on the arm were just the bruises you would expect from the arm being pinched very tightly; when I say pinched, I mean taken hold of—when a patient is in bad health she would very likely show bruises more readily—she was depressed, but there were no inflammatory symptoms at that time, and she was able to talk to me in the ordinary way—on that Wednesday evening I went down specially to see her again, and she was in about the same state—next day, Thursday, the 8th, I found her in quite a different state; she had a flushed face, a hot skin, a frequent pulse, and she looked about in somewhat a vacant manner, giving me the impression that tubercular inflammation of the brain was setting in—there might be many causes for that, but to make the matter intelligible a little explanation will be required; I am quite ready, for the sake of assistance in this matter, to give that explanation—rough treatment and exposure to the cold, with a patient suffering from lung disease, would set up tubercular inflammation; with such a predisposition existing, and a person suffering from consumption has that predisposition, I should say that such treatment as the patient was subjected to would be calculated to act as a sufficient exciting cause—sup<lb></lb>posing what was done to the patient on Monday morning did operate as the exciting cause, I do not say tubercular signs would show themselves on the third day, but that would be an ordinary time—on this Thursday when I saw the signs of tubercular inflammation in the brain, the patient did not decidedly rally, there was a slight rally; she became more conscious for a time) but afterwards relapsed into a more serious state than she was before—I saw her afterwards every day, except one of the two Sundays; I went on pur<lb></lb>pose to see her, and from day to day the disease progressed in the ordinary course of tubercular inflammation of the brain, and she died on Wednesday, July 21st to the 22nd; that was a fortnight after I first recognized the tubercular inflammation of the brain—in the meantime I had caused the nurse to be removed from the ward; on Friday, the 9th, I thought her presence was prejudicial to the patient—I spoke to Dr. Stephens, and she was removed immediately—I was afterwards present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination with Mr. Howell—I found that there was disease on the left lung of long standing, not in an active state—I found that my belief of tubercular disease of the brain having set in was correct; there was an extensive tubercular deposit, with inflammation of the membranes, espe<lb></lb>cially noticeable at the summit of the brain, and inflammation of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030128"></xptr>
               <p>membranes; there were also two inflammatory masses just below the surface of one hemisphere of the brain; there was also some tubercular deposit at the base of the brain, but that was insignificant in proportion to the other—the immediate cause of death was tubercular inflammation of the brain—there was also disease found in the pelvic region of the body, connected with the Fallopian tubes, which are in the broad ligaments of the womb—that had preceded and had been at the foundation of her having no family and had been the cause of the hysterical symptoms—there were cysts, one of which had opened into the bowel, and the contents of the cyst had discharged into the bowel—there was an opening existing between one of the cyst and the bowel; a patient in that condition would be very likely to soil the bed, I think—supposing this disease of the brain had not set in, from the state in which I found the left lung she might have lived for some time—I was beginning to be unfavourably impressed by the feature, when she first came in I thought favourably of her case, but after some time I began to be unfavourably impressed by that feature, but I saw no imme<lb></lb>diate danger—I had before July began to be unfavourably impressed; not from the disease of the lungs, but from the general state of the patient not improving to the extent that I could have desired—I am merely mention<lb></lb>ing to you an impression after the patient had been in three weeks, and before the day of the bath—I did not look to the bruises in the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> room.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN HOLKER</hi>. The bruises had nothing to do with the death—the skin was discoloured, what ordinary mortals would call black and blue—the skin of an invalid is easily discoloured, especially that of a woman, and more especially if an invalid—I cannot say whether the flesh of a woman is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> easily discoloured than that of a man—the cyst connected with the broad ligament of the womb, was of old standing—they may have been going on for years—they might have started into existence after the first child was born, and they would have prevented her having a family—the cyst was in a state of suppuration—the cause of death was inflammation of the brain, tubercular meningitis; that is, inflammation of the brain set up in consequence of the presence of tubercles—there were a considerable number of tubercles, especially at the summit; there were some at the base—there were some masses of deposit on one of the hemi<lb></lb>spheres of the brain, what we call yellow tubercles, and there were also grey tubercles, but the principal portion at the summit of the brain were yellow tubercles—the grey tubercles were chiefly at the base of the brain—the disease which was the cause of death, inflammation of the brain caused by the tubercles, is caused tubercular meningitis—if there were tubercles with<lb></lb>out inflammation, we should simply speak of tubercles of the brain—the deceased had hysterical symptoms—I said so in consequence of the erratic pains, which I could not account for from disease—I have said she was suffering from consumption of the left lung, accompanied by hysterical tendency but no hysterical fits—when a patient first comes in she is examined—sometimes we have some difficulty in ascertaining what the disease is and on some occasions the disease may be only inserted on the paper after some time—that not unfrequently happens—the clinical clerk filled up this paper—it is filled up in different writings; one clinical clerk succeeds another—the clinicle clerk takes the account from the physician, and makes notes from day to day—you draw my attention to that paper being in a different</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030129"></xptr>
               <p>writing; the name of the disease, "phthisis," was said to be filled in after<lb></lb>wards; that is certainly not with my knowledge, I should consider it most reprehensible; and if you look at it you will find that it is in the same writing as the name of the disease—Dr. Steele, the superintendent of the hospital, suggested that—there has not been a great deal of difficulty about; this case—the public know well that there has been a good deal, of un<lb></lb>pleasantness at Guy's about the nurses; about some fresh system of nursing—there is a difference between the nurses; about some fresh system of nursing staff—I mean that some one suggested that this has been filled in since the facts were all discovered—I cannot tell you when I first saw the paper at the top of the bed filled up in tins way, but as far as I know it was filled in within a few days of the patient's admission; I am speaking of the name of the disease; if you notice, it is in the same writing as the first prescription, and the subsequent prescriptions are in a different writing; I cannot tell who wrote it—"Louisa Morgan" may be in a different writing to the words "Phthisis, left side"—I say, "The patient seemed to he suffering from various aches and pains, for which there was no tangible cause at present, but there was a certain pallor probably proceeding from an anaemic condition of the blood"—anaemic means pallid; the substance of it is that the patient was vary much out of health—if we have a patient suffering from acnes and pains of this kind, that is known as hysteria; but we have aches and pains also in the male subject which cannot be caused by hysteria—I say she was suffering from consumption with hysterical symptoms; I have to do. with a great many hysterical subjects—hysteria is a well recognised disease, but it is very peculiar—I do not admit that a person suffering from hysteria "fancies" she has got a number of aches and pains which she has not got; I believe she feels these aches and pains, hut the tangible cause on them does not exist; it is necessarily belonging to females—I have not known men hystarical, but hypochondriacal—there may be aches on pains without a tangible cause in a man or in a woman, just the same as there may be pal<lb></lb>pitation of the heart; it depends upon wrong nerve action;—a woman suffer<lb></lb>ing from hysterical symptoms may undoubtedly imagine that she is unable to more her limbs when she is able to move them; that happens from time to time—it is not the common thing for physicians to put the patient in such a position as she shall be obliged to exert herself—with a patient suffering from hysteria, galvanism may be used; we endeavour to bring to the knowledge of the patient that she has the power of using her limbs; we do that if we induce her to use them—if we have got An hystarical patient, and her feeling is that she cannot use her limbs, the best way is to induce her to use them—I have spoken about this woman having hysterical symptoms; I said that it would be better for her if she got up; that was about a fortnight after her admission—I may have said so twice, but not on sevaral occasions—after the sister had drawn my attention to the pain in the left leg, and I saw that she was very weak, and said to the sister, that she must use her own judgment on the subject, as to whether, she was equal to getting up or not, of an evening—when I saw her on 5th July, I have no decided knowledge of being informed that a few days prior to that she had got up and attempted to dress and had fallen—I heard it mentioned at the Inquest; I am not aware that I had heard it before—the consumption, the mischief in the lungs, had nothing to do with the other disease, except as predisposing the patient to tubercle—the real cause of death was the tuber<lb></lb>cular</p>

               <p>inflammation of the brain which was set up—as a rule, I do not tell the sister of the ward what the disease is which the patient is suffering from—the sister has nothing to do with the name of the disease; she has to do with the nursing arrangements, which are conducted on general principles, or with the disease itself, unless it is anything requiring special instructions—supposing the patient had been suffering from tubercle of the brain when she came in, I should not have given special instructions to the sister; nothing more than the directions which were given—tubercle of the brain is not uncommon—tubercular meningitis is a common form of death—tubercle of the brain does not invariably end in tubercular meningitis; it does not always produce inflammation—tubercle of the brain is not generally fatal—tubercle of the brain does not kill as tubercle of the brain, unless it has grown to such a size as to press upon the brain substance, and set up inflammation—we know nothing of tubercle of the brain until it grows, so as to press upon the brain; it is not the tubercle which we know, but the effects of the tubercle—tubercles have been found in the brain of persons who died from other causes; so I say, I do not know—how can I say that persons can have tubercle on the brain and recover—my answer is simply this, that tubercle of the brain is discovered in <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examinations without having caused death, and there being good ground for believing that it has existed for some considerable time previously, and therefore we do not know, if the patient had lived, how long it would have gone on; it might have got into a cheesy condition, and remained in a dormant state—I cannot tell you how long it might have been there, because there was no opportunity of knowing when it came there—if there are no symptoms to indicate the commencement, how can I date it?—I say that a person may have tubercle upon the brain without having any symptoms; you are putting me to answer an impossibility—tubercle of the brain generally produces inflammation and death—it must do, but there are cases where a person has all the symptoms of tuber<lb></lb>cular meningitis, and may recover, but you look upon it always as a fatal disease—I say tubercle may exist in the brain without any symptoms—inflammation will not set up unless the tubercle has grown sufficiently to press upon the brain—a slight rise of temperature is not an indication of tubercle, but it is an accompaniment; continued headache may be an accompaniment, and nausea may be; vomiting is another symptom of the inflammation; I must get you to distinguish between tubercle and inflammation—supposing the tubercle has grown, and is pressing upon the brain, that would produce headache; it is what constitutes a tumour of the brain, but you would have no inflammation—where the tubercle has grown and is pressing upon the brain headache would be one of the symptons I should look for, but not a rise in temperature, unless there is inflammation—I should look for nausea and positive sickness, but not torpor and great languor—I should not expect a patient to be in a state of torpidity—I should expect a patient to have an objection to exercising, and I should look for partial paralysis; paralysis generally appears more in one limb than the other—I should expect a patient to involuntarily cast motions, according to the extent to which the growth has advanced, after it has produced decided paralytic symptons: even without inflammation; you have a foreign body in the brain structure—supposing the tubercle had advanced to such an extent and pressed to such an extent upon the brain that it produced</p>

               <p>headache, nausea, sickness, disinclination to move, and inability to use the limbs, and loss of the power to retain the motions, I should say that the patient would be in a different condition altogether to this patient; in that case I should certainly not judge it necessary to give special directions with regard to her—I consider that in such a case that it would be a proper thing to give a woman a bath in order to cleanse her; even though she was in the condition described, she ought to have a cleanse bath; it is the duty of the nurse to give it—tubercle does frequently end in inflammation of the brain—its ordinary period of duration is about a fortnight; certainly not six weeks; that is a mistake; that is tubercular inflammation—if you cannot give the commencement how can you date it—tubercular meningitis has not been known to run six weeks, nor tubercular disease ending in meningitis; that is a disease which lasts for years—it is not well recognized in the profession that tubercular disease, which ends in meningitis, runs about six weeks, because there is reason to believe that tubercles may exist fox months or years—I did not see the patient on the Sunday before the bath; I saw her on the Friday—she was then complaining of a pain in her left leg, which was, I think, attributable to pressure of this cyst on the nerves, which would also account for any weakness in the leg—I said before the Coroner, that when I saw her she was as usual, that there was nothing urgent in her condition—she was in about the same state—I said there was no sensible alteration in her condition during the month previous to the use of the bath—I saw the clinical report to-day; I asked for it, it was taken away, I do not know by whom; I suppose by Dr. Steele, the superintendent—these clinical reports are for the physician—I considered it belonged to me—it is the ordinary practice to have reports prepared, and to-day is the first day I have had an opportunity of reading it—on the 11th June, that was on the day after the admission, the condition of her tem<lb></lb>perature is put as 100.4, and on the 12th as 99.8—the normal temperature is 98.4—on the 16th there is "still complains of headache; says she was worse after taking her medicine"—the medicine contained some opium—"A harsh sound is heard at the left apex;" that was in connection with the consumption—"Appetite not so good to-day; tongue rather furred; bowels open; headache is less than it was, but still complains slightly"—that is on June 20th; you will find no mention of headache afterwards—I think my attention was drawn to the headache at this date—there was nothingspecial in the rise of temperature from 98 to 100.4; then there is nothing until the 25th—there might be nothing to note down particularly—in an urgent case of tubercular meningitis there is a daily record—the headache had left her on the 25th—on the evening of the 7th July the temperature is 100.8; it is written as 7th July and evidently applies to the 8th, because the account on the 7th exactly corresponds with what I observed to be the condition of the patient on the 8th—I did not take her temperature—the report goes to July 14th, when the temperature is 103; that is the temperature of tuber<lb></lb>cular meningitis—we cannot say any specific temperature, but when a patient has a temperature of 102 or 103, we should expect it to go on in<lb></lb>creasing gradually until death—I see the last recorded temperature is 106—that is not precisely the temperature of tubercular meningitis it may be °f fever or inflammation of the lungs—it would be the temperature I should look for if tubercular meningitis was there, but there are modifying influences—I should expect it to be progressive, perhaps until just at the</p>

               <p>last, when a collapsed state might be induced—rise in temperature, head<lb></lb>ache, nausea, sickness, and so on would not be an indication of mischief in the brain, of tubercular deposit, or you would have hundreds and thousands of persons as suffering from inflammation of the brain who had none—these things may arise from other causes—there is nothing indicative in that report of disease of the brain—hysterical symptoms are not associated with disease of the brain—I never knew such a case—I do not know that I can call one to mind—there might be hysterical symptoms, the influence of the disease on the brain might act in that way—I do not say that the bath set up the tubercles—I cannot say that tubercles were there when the bath was taken—I have not said that the bath would probably cause tubercular disease—it would cause inflammation; any excitement would cause that, if there was the predisposition existing—I should think an animated conversation of some duration would be likely to set it up—a very slight cause can do so—a bath properly administered would certainly not be likely to set it up, not in my opinion—certainly not a cleansing bath—if this woman had been hysterical there would not be anything wrong in assisting her to the bath—if she had been suffering from tubercular deposit, not accompanied by inflammation, there wouldn't be anything wrong in it—the impropriety which the prisoner was guilty of was, in my opinion, giving her a cold bath and keeping her there for a long time, and in taking her to the bath as she did—when she found the patient couldn't walk she ought not to have exercised her own judgment that she could walk if she chose, she ought to have assisted her—it might be that if she was hysterical she would suppose she couldn't walk when she really could if she chose to exert herself; but it is not for the nurses to judge—I had recommended that she should try and sit up, to get out of bed and to dress—the marked difference which I saw in the patient was a distressed appearance—I questioned her and she answered in the way I have described—I did not ask the prisoner about it—I had nothing to do with the nurse—I did not ignore the nurse—a statement of that kind made by a patient, and a nurse implicated standing at the foot of the bed, it was not for me to decide between the patient and the nurse—I asked her nothing about it—I did not give her any opportunity of explanation—the first time time at which symptoms of in<lb></lb>flammation appeared was on Thursday—I then discovered tubercular inflammation, a fatal disease, which undoubtedly caused her death—I think you will find effervescents ordered on that day—no alteration was made in the name of the disease, or any special instructions given—I should consider that the bath ought to have been given in bed—it would have been im<lb></lb>proper to have taken her to the bath and have given it to her, when urgent symptoms set it—I would not say "most improper," if it was done with care—if she was put into a chair and carried to the bath, and then a cleansing bath used, I do not consider that would have been improper—that is my view—it would entirely depend on the state of the patient—I did not give any specific instructions as to how she should be treated by the nurses when I found she suffered from tubercular meningitis; no word as to whether she was to be given a bath or not—I did not tell any nurse that she was suffering from tubercular meningitis—I left it to them to exercise their common sense and humanity—their common sense would tell then what was the condition of the patient—they could easily see that she</p>

Yesterday had a very prolonged bath, almost cold water; remained in it a considerable time; appears to have suffered from a severe mental shock"—that is an accurate account of the state of the patient on that day—I believe the description on 7th refers to the 8th—Dr, Mahomed, the registrar of the hospital, would see this from time to time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR JOHN HOLKER</hi>. I think she was rather an emotional patient—that is not the same thing as hysteria—a patient may be emotional without any disorder of the nervous system, but she would not be hysterical without it, because that is a disorganization without any disease—she had consumption associated with hysterical symptons; in that shape she was emotional—she said she was unable to walk; I was unable to find the exact cause of that—it was not my view that if she tried to walk she could—I had not seen her walk, therefore I had not an opportunity of forming such an opinion—I could not discover any symptoms to satisfy me why she could not walk—hysterical symptoms are not generally associated with tubercular disease of the brain—hysteria is a disorder of the nervous system without any organic change—if you have tubercular disease you have organic change—it is a disease which comes on very insidiously; there might not be any rise of temperature at all except there is inflammation; headache might be a symptom of it, if enduring for some time; nausea and sickness might be symptoms of it, and inability to use the limbs and dragging of the leg, but that depends upon what part of the brain is affected—inability to control the evacuations is never a sympton until a late stage of the disease, then the disease would not exactly be tubercular—it might be from the presence of a tumour in the brain—I never directed my attention to ascertain whether this woman had tubercular disease of the brain; there was nothing to shew me that she had any disease of the sort—the symptoms just named did not indicate to my mind that tubercular disease was there; they did not indicate hysteria as far as I was aware—when I first saw her she had no rise of temperature—I tested it; I believe there was a loss of motion in one of the legs, but I never saw her walk—I did not hear that there was loss of motion in one of the legs; I knew there was pain in the leg; we tested her before the bath and she moved her leg perfectly—I did not tell the nurse that she would not try to move her leg; believe I said something like it, but that was not exactly what I said—this loss of power in the leg I was first acquainted with after the bath, not before—I believed there was a certain amount of reality in it, but I thought there was an exaggerated loss of power—inflammatory symptoms had set up when I sent in this report to the treasurer—I am alluding to the Saturday morning, the 10th—the evening temperature then was 101.6, that is a condition of inflammation; 99.2 is above the normal temperature—it may indicate inflammation or not, but you would have to compare something—you can have a temperature of 100 without inflammation, or 101—this was not the temperature of a day or hour, so it was the temperatures of disease—these temperatures told me that there was inflammation; that I am positive about—it does not exactly follow that in tubercular meningitis the woman would not be able to use her limbs—I believe there are cases on record were persons have recovered from tubercular meningitis; I have never seen one—it generally closes in about a fortnight—I have not had much experience in tubercular disease—I have not seen a case in which there have been yellow tubercles only—I have seen it in the lungs, not in the brain—I have seen grey tubercles in the brain, but never yellow that I am aware of.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR JOHN HOLKER</hi>. I have heard Dr. Pavy's evi<lb></lb>dence; I think I agree with him entirely; I would like to make one addition, that I thought that the signs of pain in the leg, headache, sickness, and the slight rise of temperature, which were recorded in the report soon after her admission, were fully accounted for by a suppurating cyst in her pelvis—they were utterly unlike the symptoms we find in tubercular disease—I did not discover, the cyst till the post-mortem examination; when I noticed the symptoms I did not in the least know of the cyst—it did not occur to me they might be produced by brain mis<lb></lb>chief—I thought there was something behind, more than mischief in the longs, which I could not find out, but I did not give any opinion; the lung disease was very slight indeed—I thought that would not account for her generally bad health; I thought there was greater debility—I thought there was something more than lung disease, long before she had the bath—I did not see any hysterical symptoms; I was told in the ward by one of the clinical clerks that she seemed to be hysterical—that was after her bath, and before also; he said she was nervous—he did not tell me that the physician said she should be induced to exert herself—it would be better for her to be induced to exert herself if she was hysterical, if there was nothing more; in my experience, I have had a considerable number of cases of yellow tubercle—they gives rise to no symptoms, nor to rise of temperature, I have never seen it do so—it might give rise to headache, sickness, inability to use the limbs, dragging of the leg, or inability to control evacuation; if I may explain I would say these were present in a marked degree, to such a degree that my attention would be immediately directed to the brain—her not being able</p>

               <p>to control her evacuations would be easily explained by the state of her pelvis, it would also be explained by the presence of tubercular disease if she was in the last stage of tubercular meningitis—yellow tubercule pressing on the brain would produce partial paralysis in some places—it would be very unusual for paralysis to disable a woman from retaining her evacuation; it might do so in a vital part of the brain; I was told she had dirtied the bed that day—I did not consider that a very serious symptom; she soiled the bed afterwards on several occasions—she was afterwards in a state of collapse and shock, and it was impossible to remove her; I am resident in the hospital—the senior physician is Dr. Habershon—Sir William Gull is consulting physician, I think the senior one—Dr. Owen Rees is another physician, Dr. Pavy is the visiting physician—Sir William Gull does not visit the hospital, he has not any charge over the patients; I believe he has some reputation. <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The consulting physicians Dr. Gull and Dr. Rees were formerly physicians at the hospital in the position of Dr. Pavy—after a certain time there is a compulsory retirement, and then they are made consulting physicians—they never attend the hospital; it is a post of honour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Deposition was read as follows</hi>:—"I was head nurse of Mary Ward. I attended on the deceased. I am willing to answer all questions. Deceased was in the hospital, I did not know what for. I can read. There was a paper at the head of the bed. I looked at the paper after the bath, and then had no idea it was consumption. I had no idea of it till the Treasurer mentioned it, and asked if I had seen the letter. She had complained of aches and pains, but none of which appeared to trouble her. I found the bed dirty when I went to make it, and I complained to her of making herself and the bed so dirty, and said she must have a bath whilst I changed the bed. She said nothing to that I told the sister that deceased was so dirty that I must put her into a bath whilst I changed the bed. She said very well, and gave directions about the bed, but not about the bath. I then went back and helped deceased out of bed, and with my support helped her to walk along the boards to the bath room. She had her boots on. I did not see Costello there, I did not say to Costello that deceased was very dirty. I walked by her side and had my arm round her back, and supported her. I may have taken hold of her left arm. I did not drag her along, certainly not She showed an inclination to slip on to the ground. I thought her object was to be carried, but she could walk, and I thought it unnecessary. I took her into the bath-room. There was no water in the bath. I sat her on the side of</p>

               <p>the bath, and when I had undressed her I lifted up her legs and twisted them over into the bath. There was no water in the bath when I put her into it I then took her under her arms and lowered her into the bath. I then turned on the hot water. I think I turned hot and cold together. There was not more than 6 inches of water in the bath altogether. I then left her to wash herself and, went to make her bed. She only complained of one leg being stiff. I can't say how long I was away. I came back once or twice. Once I found her clinging to the side with her head rather to the water. I turned the water off to get her into a sitting position again, and turned it on again, and she called out suddenly, and I concluded that it was too hot, and turned it off again. She was in the bath altogether from about a quarter to 9 o'clock, when I fetched her, and before 10 o'clock when I got her back. Taking her there took some time. I helped her out of the bath. Costello came to me once and said deceased was so cold in the bath. I said I had been to her and found her shaking, but I felt her back, and she was perfectly warm. I may have said something, of the sort that she was so obstinate I was determined not to help her. She could not get out of the bath alone. I told her to rest in the chair and then walk back, and not make herself a laughingstock to the ward. If she would help herself I would help her. I left her wapped up in the chair for 20 minutes. She then started walking very fairly with my arm round, her. going along she did not take hold of the wall. She did not drag one leg till a gentleman came forward. I put my foot to catch her leg from slipping sideways. I did not put my knee to push her on. She did not speak. I then put her into bed. I did not drag her along, of course not; I had my arm to her back all the way."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, carrying on my practice in Brook Street, London—I am the Senior Consulting Physician of Guy's Hospital—I have made myself acquainted with the details of this case, and have perused the clinical report very accurately—I cannot say that I have also perused the evidence of the medical men called before the Coroner—I am not acquainted with the evidence of my colleagues—I have perused the clinical report—tubercular disease of the brain occurs in two forms: when it forms slowly it is yellow, and frequently in masses; when it forms more quickly it is disseminated, scattered, and is more or less transparent—I should describe the latter condition as the grey tubercle—yellow tubercle is of common occurrence—the course of the disease is insidious, and attended with equivocal symptoms—the symptoms are headache; occasional sickness, or not; sometimes slight rise of temperature, but nothing much; 100° or 100.5° or 99° are about the temperature of the deposit of yellow tubercle, and sometimes a depression of temperature—the symptoms are equivocal, but they have a dreadful significance to the experienced phy<lb></lb>sician, although they may seem trifling to bystanders—the natural course for the yellow tubercle is into inflammatory mischief of the brain itself, or its membranes—it is an invariably fatal malady—the course of the malady</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188008030138"></xptr>
               <p>is uncertain, except in its closing stages, which may vary from a few days to a week or two—that is after the inflammation has set in—when I say "a week or two," I do not mean literally a week or two; I mean indefinitely one or two—I think it is not strictly governed by time—the yellow tubercle may exist in a latent form for a long time; and the grey tubercle for days, probably a fortnight or more; not before the inflam<lb></lb>matory mischief, with the inflammatory mischief—in the case of yellow tubercle you would be guided by the symptoms of the patient as to when it was first formed—I doubt whether a patient would live six weeks with the yellow tubercle without symptoms—loss of power in the limbs would be a symptom of brain mischief—the inability to control the motions would be a striking symptom of brain mischief—it is a brain symptom; it does not occur in hysteria; never, I think—I do not know hysteria as associated with tubercular disease—I have the clinical report before me—assuming that this woman, when she came into the hospital, two days after was complaining or suffering from nausea, from sickness, and that for some time she suffered continuously from headache, and her temperature was from 100.4° to something slightly over that, and sometimes something slightly under it; assuming also that she had lost power in her limbs, that she had been un<lb></lb>able to stand when she got up to dress, and that she had inability to control her her evacuations, then I say she had brain disease; whether tubercular or not would depend.—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But in your view should a skilful physician have known that brain disease existed?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There I must be careful—there is no doubt great difficulty in recognising brain disease at that stage—there is no doubt it is one of the most difficult parts of medical practice, but I cannot doubt that suspicion should have existed—there is great difficulty in determining with any degree of certainty, perhaps only suspicion—supposing this woman was suffering from brain disease on the 5th July, which rendered her inca<lb></lb>pable of using her limbs, in my opinion the administration of the bath would be most improper—I should say if there was the presence of yellow tubercle in the brain an ordinary bath might be used for washing purposes, but it would require immense care not to exhaust the patient or tire her—the skin or flesh of a woman who has been in bed and suffering for some time is easily discoloured, in strumous people, and this woman was—the attempt to lift herself from the bath might have produced discolouration—I do not think that the fact of the woman being put in the bath and kept there for some time would itself produce or give rise to the tubercle; if so, we should have tubercles all over the community every day—I very much doubt whether death would be accelerated by this treatment—the course of the malady is continuous and universally fatal—the bath did not produce any injury to the head, which is the chief seat of the malady—the dragging of the limbs would not increase inflammation of the brain, though in this case it was much to be deplored dragging the poor thing to the bath; but I doubt of its doing anything to the brain itself—it would subject her to dreadful suffering, I should think, as far as she was conscious—such people are not so alive as people who are well, I mean alive to suffering, not perfectly conscious—supposing the excitement or the shock of the bath had caused inflammation to set in, I should have expected to find an alteration in temperature; there was, however, no rise in temperature for two days after the bath, at least as appears from this report—four days after the bath there is no more rise in the temperature than half a degree—that does</p>

               <p>not lead me to the conclusion that the bath did not cause anything; it had not much to do with it—then, again, the bath could not in the nature of the case do it—you might batter a person about the head, and set up inflammation of the brain; but taking a bath would not, for remember this woman had not active disease in the lung—the evidence shows that the disease in the lung was quite latent, inactive—the yellow tubercle presses on the brain, but the transparent tubercle does not much—if the bath had been cold I do not think it would have caused inflammation of the brain—we put ice to the head in inflammation of the brain to check it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. We do not put ice to the feet and body to drive the blood to the head; we do not drive the blood to the head at all; we put it to the head—supposing this woman's head was not in the cold, but her body and legs in the cold, and she was kept for half an hour or more shivering in the cold, that would have a tendency to interfere with the circulation, but will you tell me what cold you mean?—this woman had brain disease, and they are given to shivering—supposing I found that she did not shiver at all till she had the bath, and that she did shiver after<lb></lb>wards, even that would not be a fair inference that the cold caused the shivering and not disease of the brain—it might be the first shivering—this shivering might fairly be considered the first symptom of brain disease—I mean it might be a nervous shivering—it might have been the first shivering of brain disease—a sense of cold often goes with real heat—with great care a person may have a bath and be washed, with disease of the brain, without doing any serious injury—I should think with brain disease the woman ought not to be put into a chair, but I should think it might be done without any injurious effects—I should not do it—it is not possible to tell when tubercle commences—you may suspect from the symptoms—I will not say that often suspicion is very inaccurate—you judge of the tubercular commencement from the symptoms—the symptoms are equivocal—they are uncertain—we cannot tell with any degree of certainty; we only suspect—the clinical report is a report made by the clinical clerk, who is a student—I sent for it when I read the report of the Coroner's inquest—I sent to the house, not to the Treasurer of the hospital, to Doctor Steele—I read the report in the paper—I had then two reports, the physician's report, which he said was singularly accurate, and this report—you cannot tell positively how long the yellow tubercle existed before the inflammatory symptoms set in; you can only suspect from the symptoms, sickness and headache.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. It was in the post-mortem examination I found that there had been tubercular inflammation of the brain, and if I could go back and have a record of the symptoms attending the patient during her lifetime for six weeks or two months, and obtain an accurate account of the symptoms, I then should be able to say, "I put my finger upon that day"—perhaps not that day, but that time—you find one symptom one day, and that joined with something else the next, and I should say that at that time the mischief was commencing—until the acute symptoms show themselves you cannot say with certainty there are tubercles—when on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination it was discovered that yellow tubercles existed during lifetime on the brain, and in that way caused death, then you might trace back and get the origin of it.</p>

               <p>great accuracy—the common time after the inflammatory grey tubercles set in till death followed would be about fourteen days—they remain quiescent; I will not say for a long time; we have no evidence of a long time—the best judge of the state of the patient ought to be the physician who sees the patient from day to day—a person who knows the case from the commencement at the hospital, and sees it from time to time, and watches it, and attends to it as the physician, no doubt ought to be the best judge of the state of the patient—his eye can descry the difference in the patient on the one day between what is done in that case, and what is alleged afterwards—in this case I should certainly put my judgment against the judgment of the physician who attended the case from the commencement; and I will tell you the ground of it; upon the students' report I would put my opinion against that of Dr. Pavy—the physician governs the students' report—his duty is to see it—I am not assuming that it is the same as if it was made by the physician himself; but I was a physician of Guy's for 20 years and my clinical reports were my own reports—I always dictated the report myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> In this case I put my judgment against that of the physician who attended to the case; because, when I read the report, I found there was headache, nausea, sickness, and rise of temperature, and all the signs of brain disease, and she dies with grey and yellow tubercles of the brain, and I know that these yellow tubercles would not be set up in fourteen days; I did not receive a report from the physician himself from the Coroner's inquest, which the physician said was singularly accurate—I did not find any symptom of hysteria—hysteria was said by the late Sir Benjamin Brodie to be a paralysis of the will, and the duty is to urge and rouse the patient—supposing a woman is suffering from hysteria, or there is reason to believe it, and she thought she could not walk, when in truth she could, trying to get her to exert herself would be the right thing to do—it would be the best thing to do; the late Dr. Jeffe, of Leamington, who had great reputation in cases of hysteria, used to treat it in this way, by taking the girls in his carriage a mile or two from home, and, then turning them out and making them walk home—that was proper treatment.</p>

I am a nurse at Guy's Hospital—at the time the deceased was in the hospital I was night nurse of the ward of which the defendant was day nurse—I had charge of the bed in which the deceased was—previous to the 5th July, she complained of pain in her right leg—I noticed nothing more particularly—from the way in which she behaved, I did not think that her complaint was quite genuine as to the pain in her leg—I do not think she herself gave as much assistance; as she might—I did not have any special instructions from the nurse or from the physicians with reference to this case—I recollect, on the 5th of July, the deceased being taken to have her bath—I saw the prisoner take her part of the way along the ward—she had hold of her under the arms: her right arm round the patient's back, taking her to the bath, and hold the left arm with her left hand; she did not drag her at all—she was not at all rough; she used no unnecessary force.</p>

I cannot watch every nurse at the same moment, so that a nurse may do it on her own responsibility without my knowledge—I remember this particular morning giving the order for the bath—as near as I can tell it was from half-past 8 to 9 o'clock; I know by my own duties—I should be in some part of the ward—I might pass by this bed, No. 2, in the course of an hour or an hour and a half twice or three times; there is no rule, I could not say—as I pass along I cast my eye on each bed—if a patient was absent from a bed for an hour or an hour and a half, that would be a matter that I should observe, but I do not pass by each bed; my duty is such as to keep me out of that division for a time.

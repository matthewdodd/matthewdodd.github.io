               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing? - A. Yes, my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there another with him? - A. Yes.</p>

            Who took the watch? - A. The other; this man held me; the other took the watch, and away he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner stop you from going after him? - A. Yes, and then they both ran away; I went into the public-house again about ten minutes after he had robbed me, and found him at the bar of the White-Lion, St. Catherine's-lane; I am sure he is the same man; I have never seen the other man, or the watch again; the young man with me said he was the same man, and he was taken into custody; mine was a silver watch and chain; I felt it go out of my pocket; I had seen it but a few minutes before in the public-house; I had got but two or three yards from the door before they came up to me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020027"></xptr>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. Do you mean to swear, that, during all the day, you had no liquor except this glass of rum? - A. In the morning I had a glass, a pint of beer to my dinner, and, at seven o'clock, another glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you had with your girls? - A. I had no girls; I saw some to be sure; there were plenty in the house, in another room; we were in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were not near any of the girls? - A. Yes, I do; I had nothing to do with them; they were in another room.</p>
               <p>Q. This was very dark? - A. It was dark, but I could see the men very well; there was a light through the window and door; it was before the door was shut; I could see that man as plainly as I see any body here; I don't know the other; this man laid hold of me, and the other pulled the watch away.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a foreigner, and perhaps your English friend told you about a reward? - A. Nobody told me about any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have never heard of forty pounds reward? - A. Never before now; nobody told me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said, if you could get a sum of money, you would swear against no man? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-34-person337">A. </persName>
            I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the Flying-Horse public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say so there? - A. No; the prisoner's father said, he would pay for the watch, and all expences, and offered me ten pounds; and he paid me ten pounds down, which I gave to Mr. Griffiths, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What else have you got? - 
               <persName id="t18011202-34-person338">A. </persName>
            Nothing else; there were some notes, some guineas, and some half-guineas; I believe I gave the officer six-pence more than I got from his father.</p>
               <p>CHRISTOPHER FIELD sworn. - I am a sailor, and belong to the same ship with the last witness; I was with him when he was robbed in St. Catherine's-lane; we were both sober; it was about half past seven in the evening; we went to the White-Lion about seven, to see Mr. Gibson, the landlord, who is an acquaintance of the prosecutor's, and we had one glass of rum a-piece; there were women in the house, but we were with the landlord; they were in one room, and we in another.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened after you had the rum? - A. Three men went out just before us; they came out of the same house; I was the last out; they had not been in our company, but was in company with the women; I saw the prisoner go out before me, and he laid hold of the prosecutor by the breast, and the other took his watch; I did not see the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know he took it? - A. I saw them just run from him; the third man, I suppose, stood to receive the watch; the other two ran away as soon as they had got the watch, and then the prisoner let him go, and ran after them; I am sure he is the man; I saw his face, which made me know him, for there were then three standing before us drinking at the bar, with one girl with them, and the prisoner was in the middle.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had the prosecutor got out of the house? - A. He might be about three yards from the door; there was a light in the bar-window, right facing where he was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face in the street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat on? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go up the moment they got out of the house, before the door was shut? - A. Yes, before the door was shut, they had hold of him.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18011202-34-person339">Q. </persName>
            If you did not see his face in the street, how could you know him again? - A. I saw him in the room, and saw the brown coat he had on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come out of the house? - A. Yes; he went directly up to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me, correctly, how you all went out? A. I asked this young man what o'clock it was, and if it was time to go a-board; he looked at his watch, and said, let us go; the three men were then just before the bar; then we were bidding the landlord good night, and these men went out; the Prussian followed them, and I followed him; I had just got upon the step when they laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. By the time you got out, were they walking on, or in waiting? - A. They were waiting for us.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as the Prussian got out, did you see them stop him? - A. Yes, upon the opening of the door, as they went out, we went out one after the other; there were other people passing and repassing, but not near us; I never lost sight of the prisoner from the time he left the house till he run away, after holding the prosecutor; I swear he is the man, I know him by his face.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you did not see his face in the street? - A. I know him again by the size of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you find him afterwards? - A. We went about ten minutes after to the house again, and found the prisoner standing before the fire; I had asked the prosecutor if he would go back, and see if the landlord knew the man; I was asking the landlord, and the prisoner stood there, and spoke to me; he was holding his head down at first, and I did not see his face, but I asked the landlord if he knew the young men that were there, because they had picked this young man's pocket; then the prisoner asked me who was the man that had lost the watch; I told him, he was the man who took it; he said, he was not; I asked the landlord if he knew him; he said, he did not; the landlord is not here; we then sent for an officer, and the prisoner told the officer he knew the men who had the watch;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180112020028"></xptr>the officer told him, if he did not find the men who took the watch, he would take him; the prisoner then took us to some place, in Whitechapel, I think, about three miles, to a house, and said the man lived there who had the watch; he enquired for a man who was not at home; then we took him to the watch-house; he said he knew the gang that went every Sunday night stealing watches and what they could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Raine. Q. When the prisoner said he would endeavour to find the man, he was in the officer's care? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had you got? - A. I had had a glass of rum in the morning, and one in the evening, I had nothing at my dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it told you about a reward? - A. Nobody; I never had such a job as this in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body has said that the door of the public-house was shut before the Prussian was held, that is not true, is it? - A. No; the door was not shut.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had seen this young man before? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went back to the public-house, why did not you know the prisoner again? - A. I did not see him at first.</p>
               <p>Q. There were people passing and re-passing? - A. Yes, on the other side; there might be three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment the two other men run away, the man that held the Prussian let him go? - A. Yes, and went after them.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRIFFITHS sworn. - I am an officer; the prisoner was brought to Lambeth-street office on Monday, and committed for examination on the Wednesday following; I know nothing against the prisoner, except that the prosecutor gave me this paper, (produces it), saying, he had it from his father; I had six guineas, five half-guineas, a shilling, a one pound Bank of England note, in all amounting to ten pounds and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I leave it to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

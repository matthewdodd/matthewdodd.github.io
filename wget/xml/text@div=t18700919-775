                  </hi>. I am not single—I have been living with the prisoner formerly, and left off living with him eighteen months ago—I began to live with George Meyer five or six months ago—I do not know where the prisoner lived at this time; but recently he lived in Kent Street, which is about three minutes' walk from Violet Place, where I lived with George Meyer—during those five or six months I have washed a shirt for the prisoner occasionally—he gave them to me to do, and threatened me if I did not—during the four or five months I have lived with Meyer the prisoner has spoken to me when he met me, and said "Do you intend to live with me any more?—I have said "No, I do not; anything I can do for you I will; but I do not intend to live with you any more as a wife, for I was so ill-treated, that I will not"—he said that if I did not he would do something to me" and likewise your man, too"—ou Saturday, 27th August, I was coming along Kent Street, and the prisoner came up to me, and struck me two blows on the head, saying that he wanted the duplicate of his shirt; but I had not got one of any shirt of his—he knocked me down; but I regained my feet, and went home, and George Meyer, the deceased, said "Emma, you are excited"—I made a com<lb></lb>munication to him, and between 9 and 10 o'clock that evening the prisoner came and knocked at the door—I threw the window up, and saw him outside the door—Meyer ran down stairs, in his trowsers and shirt, without his boots—he returned in a few minutes and said "Emma, give me my boots"—I said "No, George, I shall not," and I threw them under the bed; but he got them, and took his waistcoat off the bed, putting it on as he went down—I tried to stop him, and got before the door; but he threw me—presently, somebody said to me "Mrs. Meyer, your husband is fighting;" and when I got to my room Meyer was holding his bowels in and said "Emma, my dear, I am stabbed"—I laid</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and live with my parents, it 3, Violet Place—on Saturday night, 27th August, I was standing at the door, and the prisoner came up—I knew him well—he asked for Emma—I went to the bottom of the stairs, and called "Emma"—Mr. Meyer came down stairs directly—he was undressed—he went up again, and when be came down he said to Bailey "What do you want 1"—Bailey said "I want a shirt"—Meyer said "I will give you a shirt," and went up stairs—while he was gone up Bailey walked a little way down the street, and back again in the middle of the road—Meyer came down in about two minutes, and went into the road to the prisoner, who was about three yards from the door—I could distinctly see all that passed, but could not hear what they said to each other—I saw Meyer strike Bailey on the ear; it seemed a hard blow—I saw nothing more till I saw Meyer holding his stomach—he said "I am stabbed," and was stooping—until Meyer struck Bailey, Bailey had done nothing—they both went down the Dover Road—after a time Meyer came back, stooping a little and still holding his stomach—he said "Oh, he has stabbed me," and went up into his room—I saw no more of Bailey till the policeman was taking him along the street, at a little before 10 o'clock.</p>

On 27th August I was on duty in Kent Street—I went to 3, Violet Place, and saw the deceased with a wound in his stomach—I went to a lodging-house in Kent Street, and took the prisoner, at 9.50 at night—he was coming into the passage as I was coming out—I said "Your name is Bailey"—he made no answer—I said "I shall charge you with stabbing a man named George Meyer, at 3, Violet Place"—he said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station, and charged him—he has lost his left arm—I took him to Guy's Hospital about 10.30 the same night, and took him up to the bed where the deceased man was, who said "That is the man who stabbed me with something he drew from his breast pocket"—the prisoner never said a word—I had searched him, but found no knife—on the Sunday Meyer grew worse—Mr. Benson, the Magistrate, went to the hospital, to take his deposition, and I accompanied the prisoner there—the deceased was sworn—his statement was written down, and Mr. Benson signed it—the prisoner had an opportunity of cross-examining the dying man—(<hi rend="italic">Deposition read:</hi>

Emma Jones, the woman I am living with, ran up to me; she seemed to have had a blow in the face. The landlady called out, 'Mr. Meyer, you're wanted.' I then went down to the front door. I saw the prisoner there; he said 'I want the ticket of a shirt.' I said she had not got one, I said 'If you don't go away, I'll give you a ticket.' He said 'Will you?' I said 'Yes, I will.' I ran up, and put my waistcoat on. I came down again. I gave him a <hi rend="italic">punch</hi> on the side of the head. I said 'Now go, or I'll lock you up.' Immediately I said that, he put his hand into the breast pocket of his coat. He then carne close up to me, and gave me a plunge in the stomach. I felt that I was stabbed, and my entrails were coming out. He made no motion of opening a knife beforehand; it all happened in a minute. I put my hand to the wound. I walked 100 yards or so, to look for a policeman. I then went up, and laid down. I did not see what became of the prisoner. Some constables came, and took me to the station on a stretcher. Some people stood by, but nobody was near me but the prisoner. I have lived with Emma Jones about six months. The prisoner has quarrelled with me about it. I have heard him twice say he'd have his revenge.—George Meyer.")</p>

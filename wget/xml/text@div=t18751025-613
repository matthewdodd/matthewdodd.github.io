                  </hi>. I live at 10, Union Place, Draper Street, Newington—on 24th August I was in the employ of Messrs. George Cockerell and others as carman;—it was my duty to take out coals and deliver them to customers—I was supplied with two notes, one to give and one to return—about 5.30 that afternoon I took a ton of Wallsend coals to Mr. Miller, of 38, Manor Street, Clapham—at Blaokfriars I picked up the two prisoners, who went with me—I had had a drop of beer, but I was sober; I knew what 1 was about—the prisoners had something to drink with me—Finch shovelled the coals in, and I carried in all but the last sack; Gray carried that in—I gave the de<lb></lb>livery ticket to Finch to take in before the coals were shot—when he came out tie told me to go in and and get the ticket—I went in and found that he had signed my name and received the money—I had not authorised him to do so—when I came out they were gone—I saw nothing more of them till next lay, when I gave them into custody—Finch said he knew nothing about it;</p>

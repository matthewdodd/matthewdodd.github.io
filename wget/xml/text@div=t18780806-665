                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Randall and Angier, of Gray's Inn, and have carried on business there for something like 27 years—we had a client in 1875 named George Baden Crawley, who had been for about two years a solicitor in partnership with his father—we represented him in a supposed claim which Mr. Noyes had against him—from time to time a number of cards were brought to my notice addressed to Mr. Crawley, and shortly afterwards I received cards of the same description—this card with the postmark of 9th May was delivered by post at our office—the defendant had called on me, and I had had a conversation with him. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "George Baden Crawley, care of his two attorneys, Randall and Angier, Gray's Inn Place, W. C. If the two cruel rogues and sharp practitioners who have conspired with the felon George Baden Crawley, to cheat his creditors and defraud his partner, enable him to escape judicial retribution for criminal. conduct in a Criminal Court, as so many black sheep of their corrupt pro<lb></lb>fession are in the habit of doing in parallel cases, do not lake their names off the Rolls of their profession, their names will be taken off by the Lord Chancellor ere long.") I had had nothing to do with the defendant when I was concerned for Mr. Crawley—he was an entire stranger to me, but I know his writing—this post-card is his writing—I subsequently found it necessary in the Chancery suit to make an application to the Master of the Rolls, and while it was pending we received these nine post-cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they are in the defendant's writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. We have acted for G. R Crawley for about 18 years—I do not know how many times he has left England since that, or how many years he has resided abroad—he has been in Mexico, France, Belgium, and Spain—I believe he first acted as your solicitor in the matter of this mine—I am not aware that he was expelled from his firm in 1861, certainly not or that a circular was sent to the clients of the firm to say that he had left it, and was going to reside abroad—I do not know the date than an agreement was entered into between him and you, there was an agreement between you and others—I have no recollection of seeing it—I am aware that you put 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the mine, but not that you lent it to Mr. Crawley for the purpose of working the mine—I saw Mr. Maskelyne once, three, four, or five years ago, but I do not think Mr. Crawley put the papers into my hands at that time—I saw a note of hand in Court for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and recognised Crawley's writing—I am not aware that a joint account was opened in his name and yours at Hughes's bank—you produced an account in your joint names—I am not aware when it was—two or three solicitors</p>

               <p>have applied to me saying that you had a claim against Mr. Crawley, but I have not refused to furnish the accounts to them—your solicitor issued a writ against Mr. Crawley, but I do not know the date—I filed a demurrer on Mr. Crawley's behalf—when I obtained a warrant against you I did not tell you that I elected to proceed criminally against you, and intended to abandon the proceedings in Vice-Chancellor Malins's Court—I said on the return of the warrant, that if your friends would take charge of you I was prepared to abandon the proceedings—I did not proceed against you before Vice-Chancellor Malins while I had you locked up at Clerkenwell, without giving you information that I intended to do so—Mr. Maskelyne produced a bill for 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about 20 years old, and said that he believed it had never been settled, and asked if I would undertake, if proceedings were not taken, not to plead the statute—I said that it was a very stale thing, and I could give no undertaking.</p>

                  </hi>. I acted as your solicitor in 1858, but not to your father and yourself—I entered into some agreement with John Edward Hibbett Pearl", but I cannot tell you what it was—it was a long time ago—I did not represent a mine in Glamorganshire as being of very great value—I said that I knew nothing about it—I am not sure that it was not you who introduced Mr. Jones to me—I knew nothing but what he told me—I do not know what your occupation was, or whether you knew anything about mining—now you mention it, I remember that you were employed at the Home Office—I cannot say whether I invited your father to provide capital to work that mine, but he did advance 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to you, and you were to work it—as far as my memory serves me, you and your father borrowed money, which was what I was principally doing for you—the 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced by your father to both of us; he would not advance it unless I joined in taking a share in the mine, if I remember rightly—I do not admit giving you a note of hand for 1,250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but from what I have heard I believe it was so—I paid that note of hand by giving you up my half of the property, and handing you over the balance—that was at the end of 1860—I handed you</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187808060011"></xptr>
               <p>something above 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we settled accounts, and I handed you over the balance, but I cannot tell you where the receipt for it is—I have not got the originals of the three agreements between us—I have detained no documents whatever. (<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a notice to produce the documents, which he had served on the witness and on Mr. Angier; Mr. Angier stated that he had never seen the original documents</hi>.) I gave up every document, and I presume that, when I settled with you, you took them—it it possible that I destroyed them when I was removing from 117 to 104, Bishopsgate Street—I burnt several cartloads of paper, but I set my clerk to work for days, and the only documents he found I gave to Messrs. Randall. (<hi rend="italic">The</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was in Bucharest ten days ago, and was requested by Messrs. Randall and Angier to come to this country—I arrived here yester<lb></lb>day morning—the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. balance was handed to the prisoner in the beginning of 1861—there was no promissory note or bill between us which was not honoured—I have paid in hard cash, out of my own pocket, 1,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the prisoner—the Chancery suit was brought against me this year, all that time having elapsed—I have been carrying on very extensive railway contracts Abroad.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. EMMETT</hi> (<hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Solicitor</hi>.) I began to correspond with Randall and Angier with regard to your claim against Mr. Crawley in October, 1877, as far as I believe—they were acquainted with your claims against Mr. Crawley last year, long before this writ was issued—they did not plead ignorance of your claims against him—you placed the papers in the case submitted to Mr. Southgate in my hands—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the document referred to—I cannot say whether it contains a fair statement of your claims as they are founded upon your own statements—your demurrer was an admission of the facts, and I so advised the Counsel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner in his defence stated that he was a County Magistrate, and would not make any statement which he did not believe to be true. He com<lb></lb>plained of the absence of his solicitor with some most material papers, and that he had not subpœnaed Mr. Pigeon, and contended that by the evidence he was justified in his conduct, believing that Messrs. Randall and Angier were cognisant of all that Mr. Crawley had done, and were therefore his accom<lb></lb>plices; that what he had written under the belief that he had been grievously wronged was not a libel; but, having been told that Randall and Angier were innocent, he would withdraw the accusation against them, which he believed to he true when he made it. He further stated that he had been charged with lunacy, being a spiritualist and</hi> planchette <hi rend="italic">writer</hi>.</p>

Mr. Lloyd came to me the next day to let me know that such a robbery had been committed, and that they had secured the man. I advertised the bank note by hand bills, and in the newspapers. Mr. Lloyd manages the grocery business for me. All that I know of the matter is from his information.</p>

               <p>You came on the 21st of November to inform Mr. Davis that some robbery had been committed in your house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Inform the court and jury of the particulars. On the 20th of Nov. at night, near the hour of ten, the prisoner came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Was he belonging to the shop before? - No; I never saw him in the shop before.</p>
               <p>Yours is a retail grocer's shop? - Yes; the prisoner said he was an officer of the Excise.</p>
               <p>Had he any one with him? - There was a man in the shop at the time we supposed to belong to him; he came in before the prisoner, under a pretence of buying an ounce, or half an ounce, of tea. I do not know which. I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said he was an Excise-officer, what did he say he came for? - He said he came to see some tea weighed, and to examine some tea.</p>

            . I asked him of what place; he said of no place at all.</p>
               <p>Did he show you that paper? - He showed me a paper. I asked to see it, that I might know the contents; he refused to show it me, and put it into his pocket again.</p>
               <p>So you do not know the contents of the paper? - I did not then; I have seen the paper in court since.</p>
               <p>How are you sure it is the same paper? - I am not sure it was the same.</p>
               <p>He said he came to weight some tea, what did he do then? - He laid hold of a parcel of tea, and asked if there was a permit for that tea. I told him there was, and showed it to him; he then insisted upon weighing it, and we put it in the scale and weighed it, it weighed twenty-six pounds; it was green tea. After we had weighed it, and found it agreed with the permit, and had taken it out of the scale, he examined it by the candle to see that it was green; he then put it in the scale to weigh it again; then he took out a small quantity to examine, and took out a large quantity in the other hand; we detected it in his hand afterwards; when we detected him with the tea he threw it down, some on the floor, and some in the bag, and

               <p>Who was in the shop with you? - There was my wife.</p>
               <p>For what purpose did he draw a knife? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>What sort of a knife was it? - A long penknife.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing when he produced the knife? - No; he kept it in his hand open; my wife, who was behind the counter, was alarmed; she was serving the man that came with him; she ran out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Did he and the other man speak to each other? - The prisoner, while he had the tea in his hand, called to him to aid and assist him in seising that tea, when he had made it disagree with the permit by taking a handful out, by which means the scale turned the other way.</p>
               <p>Did you make any resistance? - Yes, I did, when he was detected by my wife with the tea in his hand; I did not see it in his hand at first; when he threw the tea down, and had the knife drawn in his hand, as I said before, my wife ran out frightened, and left the till open; she went to call an opposite neighbour; the prisoner stood with the knife open in his hand, close against the counter; he looked over the counter, which I understood was to see if there was any tea behind it or not; then he clapped his hand into the till, and took some cash and a bank note.</p>
               <p>Do you know what cash he took out? - I know he took to the amount of 4 l. 10 s. by the quantity that was in the till afterwards, and from the quantity that was in it before.</p>
               <p>When had you told it before? - At nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>There was 4 l. 10 s. less than there was at nine o'clock? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You do not know, I suppose, what species of money it was in? - Yes I do; there was in the till at nine o'clock five guineas, three half guineas, and about 1 l. 13 s. or 14 s. in silver.</p>
               <p>What was there left after the prisoner had put his hand into it? - Two guineas, two half guineas, and about 18 s. in silver.</p>
               <p>Had you paid any money during that time? - No; not any at all.</p>
               <p>Then there was missing about three guineas, a half guinea, and 16 s.? - There was.</p>
               <p>That you are positive of? - That I am positive was missing; there might be some shillings more, I cannot be positive how much; there was a bank note in the till.</p>
               <p>Do you know the number of the note? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did you see that in his hand? - Not particularly; I saw him put in his hand and take out as much as he conveniently could. The note was for 10 l. It was No. H 233, dated the 28th of May, 1779, payable to

As the prisoner took it away he dropped some in the till and some on the counter; then he ran out of the shop as hard as he could; the other man staid in the shop, when the prisoner went out, and stood in my way, as I suppose, that I should not go out after the prisoner. I did not think at that time that he stood purposely in my way, but that it might be done through ignorance. I followed the prisoner and endeavoured to kick up his heels; I kept in sight of him; I was not more than five or ten yards from him at the farthest distance. I took him in Grace-church-street. The shop is in Fenchurch-street. I took him after running a good chase after him. He got away from me and ran round the coaches, and wanted to get up White-hart-court, but was interrupted by some gentlemen, and I secured him. There was a constable on the spot, and he insisted upon my delivering him into his charge.</p>
               <p>Did you search him? - No; the constable insisted on my letting him go to him. I did not understand it. It was half after ten o'clock when I got home again. The constable took him to the watch-house, and a man went home with me.</p>

               <p>This was about ten o'clock at night? - Yes.</p>

               <p>You had not been out of the shop? - No.</p>
               <p>You had not seen this Hudson before that evening? - No.</p>
               <p>Had you been stopped by any body that afternoon with a bundle? - I brought home this parcel of tea in the afternoon, from Holborn, between seven and eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Had you been stopped by no man in the way as you was bringing that home? - No, I was not obstructed by any body.</p>
               <p>You came home then between seven and eight o'clock, and was never out afterwards? - I do not recollect that I was.</p>
               <p>This tea was in a bag? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When the prisoner came in he said he wanted to look at the contents of that bag? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he weigh any thing besides that bag? - No.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness.</p>
               <p>You was at Mr. Davis's shop with your husband, on Saturday the 20th of November? - Yes, the prisoner came into the shop.</p>
               <p>Who was in the shop when he came in? - My husband and myself.</p>
               <p>No body else? - No body else but a man that came with the officer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner is the officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner and the other man came both in together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What business did they pretend to have there? - The prisoner said he was an officer, and he demanded to take stock, the other man came with a pretence of wanting an ounce of tea, which I served him. One spoke to my husband, the other spoke to me. I was behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Who spoke to you husband? - The prisoner.</p>
               <p>You had no other customers in the shop before? - Before we had, but not at that time.</p>
               <p>Did you serve him with the ounce of tea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did the officer say to your husband? - He demanded the weight of the bag of tea which stood in the shop; he had the tea weighed and it was weight. Then he demanded the permit, and took out a handfull of tea to prevent its being weight; upon that he said the tea was seiseable, and ordered the man that was in the shop to aid and assist him.</p>
               <p>Did he say he would seise it, or only that it was seiseable? - He said he would seise it.</p>
               <p>The man he ordered to assist him was the man that came in with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they seem to be acquainted as they came in? - I cannot recollect that.</p>
               <p>Did they seem to know one another? - I cannot say that they did; I perceived rather an intimacy between them; he stood beside the other to see him weigh the tea; and though he saw he had a handful of tea that made it not weight, he never spoke of it till I did to my husband, who was on the other side of the scales.</p>
               <p>Did the other man pay for the ounce of tea which he had? - Yes, and I gave him change to take for it.</p>
               <p>When he had paid for the tea and received his change, he did not go out of the shop? - No, he stood still in the shop.</p>
               <p>When you saw the tea in the prisoner's hand you took notice of it? - Yes, and then he threw down the tea on the ground, and pulled his knife out of his pocket and opened it, and kept it open in his hand.</p>
               <p>Was it a knife that was fixed in the haft, or a clasp knife? - I cannot recollect that, I saw the knife open in his hand.</p>
               <p>What sort of a haft had it? - The haft he held in his hand, I did not see the haft.</p>
               <p>But it was a penknife you are sure? - I think it was a penknife.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said nothing, only used ill language to my husband; he called him names and said he was a flat; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080016"></xptr>did not see him make use of the knife; it frightened me, I ran over the way to call a neighbour; when I came back the prisoner was coming out at the door.</p>
               <p>Did that neighbour come over? - Yes, he followed directly, his name is

               <p>You was at home all the afternoon? - Yes, my husband came home at dusk, I believe it was between four and five o'clock; he staid at home from that time all the evening.</p>
               <p>How did you employ yourselves during that time? - We served the customers between whiles.</p>
               <p>Did you do any thing else? - I cannot recollect.</p>

               <p>You take the money out every night I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then the money in the till is the sum taken that day always? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what had been taken that day? - I believe near eight pounds besides a note that was taken of a young lady that was going to the play that night; I took it of her and gave it to my husband, and he put it into the till.</p>
               <p>What is that lady's name? - Lawrence.</p>
               <p>You do not recollect the description of the note? - I cannot recollect any thing of that.</p>
               <p>You now and then receive Bank notes in the course of your business? - Sometimes, and my husband takes care of them.</p>
               <p>Does your husband keep a bill-book? - I believe he does.</p>
               <p>What time was this note received? - At about five o'clock I received it, and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Did he enter it in a bill-book? - In a sort of memorandum book.</p>
               <p>You put down every thing in some book I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it put down in that book? - Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lawrence is an acquaintance of yours? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where does she live? - At Burford in Oxfordshire.</p>
               <p>She only left the note with you to take care of it till she came back from the play? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. How long had you had this tea which was in the bag? - It came in the evening about dusk; my husband brought it.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the prisoner. This tea your husband brought home about dusk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you where he brought it from? - From Holborn.</p>
               <p>Not from the Borough? - No.</p>
               <p>He pitched upon this bag as the first thing he wanted to weigh? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Miss Lawrence staid in town some time after this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She was at your house that evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>She kept an account of this bill perhaps? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask her? - No, my husband might.</p>
               <p>As the note was only left to be taken care of, and to be returned to the lady when she came back, how came it to be entered in the book? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>I understand that book is the shop book, whose book is that? - Mr. Davis's.</p>
               <p>How came it to be entered in Mr. Davis's book? - My husband was left in trust, and therefore he would take care of one thing as well as another.</p>
               <p>Don't you recollect how long your husband had been at home when this man came in? - He came in at dusk and was in all the time.</p>

            's, a leatherseller, who is very particular with regard to the time of going to bed, seldom sitting up later than ten o'clock, I should not have concerned myself about it at that time, had he not, upon my crossing of the way to go home (Mr. Beck's house being on the contrary side to that we were both on) immediately followed me, and upon coming up to me, gave me a kind of push, as though evidently meant to insult me (he being to appearance in liquor) and accosted me with these words, he supposed I had a suspicion of his having something he should not have, and that if I had, then was an opportunity for doing my duty. Upon which I asked him what reason he had for thinking that, unless it was so, and told him, as it is a common expression, that a guilty conscience needs no accuser, and since he had thus accosted me, when I did not mean to have said any thing to him, and as I knew very well where he lived, and it was not far (Fenchurch-street) and I thought as it was not ten o'clock, that I had time to go to his home with him, which I told him I would, and as I had the authority, I would go and see what it was he had got, which after having done, by examining the said parcel, and confirming my suspicion of its being tea, I accordingly required to see the permit in order to satisfy myself that it was a legal one (goods being often conveyed with illegal ones, with regard to dates, quantity of such goods, or the proper name of the person to whom going) that is, its corresponding in weight and quality with the tea he thus had; it specifying twenty-six pounds of green, I accordingly took a little in my hand to the candle, which was standing on the counter to see the quality, which being satisfied in, I then took and put it in, after taking off the loose bag he had over it, putting it into a large pair of scales, hanging in the middle of the shop on the outside of the counter (the inside of which my business did not lead me to) when it was deficient, with paper and package included, which is usually<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080018"></xptr>estimated at a quarter of a pound - three or four ounces - but which difference from the permit not thinking sufficient ground for seisure, I was, after having done all this, (during which time I was abused by both him, his wife, and a man who was standing on the outside of the counter, who seemed to have been a customer) coming out of the shop, when I observed, that while I had been thus engaged, his wife (who was in the shop when Lloyd and I went in) had slipped out of it to call some people from a shop over the way, nearly opposite, and which I believe is a hosier's. When I had got but a little way, I suppose about six or seven doors, I perceived this same Mr. Lloyd and these people coming after me, and although I was conscious of not having committed any crime, or with doing any thing more than I conceived to be my duty, I knew it could be with no other design than to use me ill, by collecting, as would consequently be the case, a mob about me, and which, well knowing the inveteracy of people against officers of the Revenue, I immediately attempted to prevent; when I had not got farther than to White-Hart court, Grace-church-street, they all beset me, and began by striking, and other means, to use me ill, until a peace-officer came up, one Foshart, to whom they gave me in custody, for having, as they said, robbed his till of a handful of gold, silver, and halfpence (but no mention of a Bank note at that time) by putting my hand into it, and taking them out together and indiscriminately, upon which I was, without being searched, had to the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>To Lloyd. Did you know this man before? - No, I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Did you know him to be an Excise officer? - No.</p>

I will explain the matter of the Bank note to your lordship more particularly, if your lordship pleases. Miss Lawrence had bought an urn of Mr. Gosling, in Fenchurch-street, and some things in Moorfields; this note was to pay for these things when they came in. I put it in the till for the purpose of paying for them; she was to have some things from our shop. I entered the bill in the book. I was to give change for it.</p>

               <p>How long have you known Hudson? - I think my first knowledge of him was in the latter end of 1773, or the beginning of 1774; about that time the administration of an estate of considerable consequence fell into my hands. I sought about for a proper person to manage that estate, and to collect a considerable quantity of outstanding money due to that estate. This man was recommended to me in as warm language as ever man was recommended. I employed him a considerable time, and during the time he served me, I remarked him for his honesty, attention, and industry, and I thought he merited the character I had of him.</p>
               <p>What are you? - I am a barrister of the Middle Temple; the troubles of America brought me to this country, and I believe brought Hudson. I gave him letters to some of the best of my friends here to employ him when he came over.</p>

               <p>You are, I believe, a dealer in brandy? - I am.</p>
               <p>It was the business of Hudson to survey you? - It was.</p>
               <p>How long have you known him? - Three years.</p>
               <p>How was his behaviour and conduct? - Always very well from what I saw. I left things of value in my cellar, and have been for several months in the country. I never missed any thing; if he was capable of being guilty of any mean thing he had opportunities to do it in my cellar. I think from my heart he is not guilty of the charge.</p>

               <p>I am a dealer in rum and brandy. Hudson has frequently stocked me in the course of two or three years; my clerk, who has attended him, and I, have found him a very troublesome man, and I have never wronged the revenue. One day in particular, when I was going out to dine with Mr. Dunnage, he came and said there was an increase in my stock, and he should seise. I said to my clerk I know nothing of it, whatever he had a mind to take away, I bid my clerk charge him 14 s. for the rum, and 18 s. for the brandy. I said if he took it away I should arrest him for it; I had nothing to do with the commissioners.</p>

               <p>I have been called upon by the prisoner; if I am called upon now I must give him a most infamous character. (He is sworn)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg to mention to your lordship Mr. Dunnage is a partner with the gentleman who has spoken so disrespectfully of me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Dunnage. Are you partner with Mr. Hayward? - No.</p>
               <p>What is your business? - A brandy merchant in one branch, and many other branches of business.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the character of this person? - My lord, and gentlemen of this court, it is an extreme disagreeable business for me to speak in. I have been forty years in the trade, and of all the officers that have surveyed me I never had such a troublesome one as this; it is his general character.</p>

               <p>Court. It is his moral character that is in question before the court, not any squabbles between him and others? - He is frequently making increases in our stock, and taking them away, what is his motive I do not know.</p>
               <p>Does the profit of the surplus in the stock go into the pocket of the prisoner? - Part of it, and he has done many unjust things of that kind.</p>
               <p>- FINLEY sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you know how many officers have been turned out in your district for neglect of duty? - Several; I am general surveyor. I have known Hudson about three years; he has been an officer under my inspection.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080020"></xptr>What has been his character since you have known him? - He has been very anxious for the good of the revenue, and to take care of the division; those that wish to carry on frauds, I believe, would wish him out of the division.</p>
               <p>And many officers have been turned out of that division for neglect? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Counsel. They were turned out for being too civil.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you ever any complaints against him for making increases in an improper manner? - None but what he could make out to my satisfaction.</p>
               <p>When an officer detects an encrease in the spirituous liquor branch does the profit go to the officer, or to the publick, or part to one and part to the other? - Part goes to the officer to be sure by law.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My lord, I wish to call an officer of undoubted reputation, who has made seisures at these gentlemen's houses.</p>
               <p>Court. We cannot go into that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It would seem that I was a fool-hardy thief that would act thus in the face of an avowed enemy, and I flatter myself I had no need to commit this robbery; can it be conceived by any one, that knowing my accuser, knowing myself in an avowed enemy's house, where it was extremely necessary that I should be very circumspect and careful what I did, that I should be guilty of this charge. - I am sorry I cannot call evidence to the badness of Mr. Lloyd's character.</p>

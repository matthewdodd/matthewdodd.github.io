            . I am landlord of the Green Man; I saw the prisoner at the bar coming down stairs, with the trunk or box in his hand. This was on the 26th of April, between three and four in the afternoon; he went backwards and forwards to the house for years before I went to it. I was alone, by the bar door. and there is a light that looks from the tap-room to the stair-case, and that was where I saw him. The stair-case fronts the door-way, and he went towards the privy, instead of coming out. There was a man came in just at the time, and called for a pot of beer; I drew it, and when I went back to see for the prisoner in the privy, he was not there. The door was open and I never saw any more of the prisoner, There was no trunk or box there; the prisoner had no box at my house of his own.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I let lodgings. I do not know that the prisoner was a man who goes about the country hawking goods. There was no man there on whom he was in the habit of attending. There were a great many persons it the tap-room at this time. There were no persons up stairs. This was three or four o'clock in the afternoon. The soldier was not in the house at that time, when the serjeant asked for a candle, to go up to bed; he discovered the robbery. My house is in Bedford-street, which is in the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields.</p>

            . I belong to Bow street. I went and searched the prisoner's appartment, on Saturday, the 27th of April; I found the door was fastened, and I knocked, and they asked who was there, and I said a friend; and when the door was opened, I saw the prisoner at the bar; I knew him; he has been known some time by the name of the Old Duffer. I told him I had an information against him for taking Cooke's, the serjeant's trunk away, and his property in it. He was very much in liquor at the time, and was getting his dinner. I made him get up, and in his waistcoat pocket, I found this watch-key, and overall chain. On the Tuesday following, I called at the Green Man, in Bedford street, and part of the property was returned.</p>

               <p>John Cooke. Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I left the room door locked.

I am positive that both the overall chains were in my box, they were a pair I purchased myself. Ten pounds were lodged in

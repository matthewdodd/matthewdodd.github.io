The first Friday in August, at about five or six in the evening, the prisoner came and asked to look at some lace. I gave her a pattern. She asked for a pair of stockings and a pair of pockets. She bought a pair of stockings and a pair of pockets. She bought the pockets first: she gave me a shilling, which I put in the till, where there was no other silver. Then she gave me 2 s. 6 d. The price of the stockings was 2 s. 3 d. I was to give her 3 d. in change. There was one sixpence I rather suspected, which I shewed to Mr. Steel, the shopman. He said, he must cut it. The girl said, she did not know it was bad, but she would fetch 3 d. and went away with the stockings and pockets.</p>
               <p>Did she come back to the shop? - No: the next evening Mr. Steel saw her go into the next haberdasher's, and he brought her into our shop.</p>

               <p>I am shopman to Messrs. Sleath and Thurpp. The prisoner came into the shop. She asked the last witness to let her see some pockets. She paid for the stockings. The money was put into the till. When she paid the other money, a sixpence was brought to me: it was a bad one. I said to the girl, Do you know what you are liable to? She said, Lord! Sir, is it a bad one? I said, Yes: I must cut it. She said, she would bring 3 d. and leave the sixpence as security. When she was gone, I thought the shilling in the till might be bad. I took it out, and looked at it, and the rest of the money; and found it was all bad, except one sixpence. The next evening, I saw her in the next shop. I said, You did not bring me the 3 d. She said, You owe me 3 d. I brought her into the shop. I asked her if she had a father. She said, yes; but he was drowned at sea. I charged a constable with her, and we took her to the compter. There she was searched. A guinea, and about 2 s. and something that made near half-a-crown, was found upon her. That was all good. We asked her how she came by the guinea. She said her mistress gave it her, to buy some things, or fetch some things out of pawn: the other money was her own. She would not tell where her mistress lived. There was a key: I asked her how she came by the key. She said she found it in Moorfields. We asked her what it was the key of. She said, any door. A man came in, and asked her something: she said, there was no occasion to answer their questions, and she would not answer them. On Monday, she was taken to the magistrate. Her mistress came to see her in the compter: she proved to be a Mrs. Lyney, in Hope-street, Spitalfields. The Lord-Mayor asked the mistress if she gave her any money. She said she gave her a guinea, to fetch things out of pawn, and gave her three shillings and two sixpences. I went to Hope-street, to enquire if Mrs. Lyney lived there. I found she did. The girl was committed for further examination. I gave the money this afternoon to the moneyer of the Mint.</p>
               <p>That was the money you saw given? - Yes.</p>

               <p>They appear worse to the eye now than they would two months ago? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They do not appear to the eye to be very obviously bad? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You looked at them by day-light, from the difficulty of discovering them by candlelight? - I did. I have often taken bad money myself. by candle-light.</p>

               <p>With your skill of money, you thought it necessary to cut some of them by day-light, to be certain it was bad? - I was certain they were bad, before I cut them.</p>

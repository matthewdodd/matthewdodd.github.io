On the 3rd of May, about eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner come into the shop - he took this cloth off the counter, and marched out with it; it was just at the time my young man was lighting the gas, and he could not see any body; I did not see him take up the cloth, but saw him carrying it out at the door; I proceeded after him, and overtook him- he then had the cloth under him arm; he was quite a stranger - the cloth is worth about 10l.</p>

            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's son - he has no partner. I saw the prisoner come into the shop, take up the piece of woollen cloth, and walk away with it; I was at the further end of the shop - I immediately followed him, gave an alarm, and seized him with it under his arm; the officer has the cloth.</p>

            . I am an officer. The cloth was delivered to me at Guildhall - Mr. Shoobridge accused the prisoner of stealing it; I have kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>MR. SHOOBRIDGE. I have seen the cloth - it is mine; I never lost sight of it till the prisoner was taken with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was by the Jerusalem coffee-house, trying to get a ship; I went there to see the captain - I was coming back, and by the Mansion-house a gentleman asked if I wanted a job, and said he would satisfy me for my trouble, for he had some things to take to the west-end of the town; I went to Cheapside with him; he said he had bought a piece of cloth - that it laid on the end of the counter, and he was going to buy more things, and would wait at the corner of Friday-street till I came out with it.</p>
               <p>MR. SHOOBRIDGE. When he was taken he said something about a man at the corner of Friday-street, having sent him for it - I never saw that man.</p>

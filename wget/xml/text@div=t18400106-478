                  </hi>I am of no profession—I live at No. 312, Duke-street, St. James. The prisoner White was in my service, as cook, for about a fortnight and two or three days—in consequence of suspicion, on the 3rd of January, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I went out of my house, and secreted myself a few doors off on the other side of the way—I could see my own door from that place—I had not been there above five minutes, when I saw White come out of the private door—I have more than one door—she had no bonnet on—I saw her come out of the house with something in her apron—she came up the street, nearly opposite to where I was standing, when she was met by Sellers, with a basket in her hand—White took something wrapped up in a white towel from her apron—Sellers opened her basket, and White put the bundle into it—they stood in con<lb></lb>versation about two minutes, and then walked together towards Piccadilly—I followed them, hoping to meet a policeman—they went as far as the White Horse cellar public-house before I could find one—I then gave them into custody—they did not see I was following them—the basket was searched by the policeman, and in it was something wrapped up in a towel, which appeared to be the same bundle I had seen put in—it contained a quantity of bread, three kitchen candles, some soap, and some butter—I examined the towel, and know it to be mine—there was nothing else in the basket which I claimed—Sellers was carrying it—I searched my house, and we missed the towel, some candles, bread, soap, and butter—we have missed two more towels besides—I know this towel to be mine.</p>

                  </hi>I am a policeman. On the 3rd of January Mr. Peat gave me directions, in consequence of which I took the two prisoners, by the New White Horse cellar public-house, Piccadilly—I found a basket in possession of Sellers, and a bundle in it, containing the articles stated—I have it here.</p>

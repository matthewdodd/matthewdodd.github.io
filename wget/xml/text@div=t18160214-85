            . It is a childbed linen warehouse. On the 26th of January. between four and five in the afternoon, the prisoner came into our shop; another youth was with him. We had silk handkerchiefs hanging up in our shop window. To the best of my recollection the lamps were lighted. They asked for a stiffner for a cravat. I shewed him some, and he objected to the price; and said it was very dear; I told him to go into the Strand where he would meet with some cheaper. This <rs id="t18160214-85-deflabel501" type="occupation">boy</rs>

On my telling the bigger boy that he could get one cheaper in the Stroun, the both went away. Mr. Hawkesworth just then came in; Mr. Hawkesworth and I were the only persons in the shop. I missed the handkerchief, I told Mr. Hawkesworth to pursue them. In the course of five minutes, Mr. Hawkesworth returned with the prisoner. I am quite sure that this boy was in the shop, and standing near the window where the handkerchief was. They went close to each other; but this boy was nearest the handkerchief. My attention was engaged by the boy buying the stiffner. I am sure the two boys came in together. I can't swear I saw the boy take the handkerchief; but I am sure one of thom must have taken it.</p>

            . I called in at the shop by accident. Upon Miss Richmond's request, I went out and saw the two boys running, and I immediately pursued them. They turned down Ryder-street, St. James's-street; at the corner of a street in Berry-street, I overtook the least of the two; he was behind the other. He had at the time I took him, a silk handkerchief in his hand, which he was endeavouring to conceal.</p>

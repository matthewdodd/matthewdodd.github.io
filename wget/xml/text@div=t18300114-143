On the 8th of December I was going through Tylor's-court, to go home, and when I got within a yard or two of the end, I heard Hobbs say,"Not yet," which induced me to think something was going on; when I got to the end of the court, into Berwick-street, I turned. and saw Cockran in company with another man taller than himself - I went on to my own house, and saw Cockran with his hands up against the prosecutor's window; the other man pulled down something, and they went off together - Hobbs was not more than three yards from them; when they got to the end of the court, they said to Hobbs, who followed them, "You stop here" - I walked after them, to see if I could see a Police-man; I heard Hobbs say, "Don't be long" - the two men then went to Jacob's shop; I stopped outside, and saw them show her a pair of trousers, which she appeared to purchase, as I saw some money pass - I went on, and saw a Police-serjeant; we went to Jacob's shop, and knocked two or three times, but could not get in - when we got in we found Hobbs there with them; I said."These are the two men who took the trousers, and Mrs. Jacobs, you have bought them" - I saw the tall man shuffling off to the back of the shop, and I said to the Police-man, "Do your duty;" he said, "Go to our station for some of our men" - I went, and there were none there.</p>

               <p>Cockran. Q.Did not you say it was the shortest man took the trousers, and ran into the shop? A. Yes, and I say so now.</p>

               <p>I was at Ball's Pond turnpike, going to drink out of a pot of beer with the turnpike-man, and I heard the cry out of murder! I said there is a robbery; I immediately ran and got half way up the lane, I laid hold of a man that was running; says I, I have you, and I seized him by the collar; I put him into the turnpike-house; and says I to the man at the turnpike-house, I will go again; just at the end of the lane the prisoner was running at a very great rate, I pursued him about one hundred yards, he passed me, I overtook him; says he, I am not a thief: says I, damn me, I do not think you are an honest man, by your running, if you are, it will be soon proved; I brought him to the turnpike-house, and the next morning I went to the place where I took him, and I saw this stick and cutlass laying near; I searched him immediately when I took him in, and found a knife and handkerchief; it is not above nine hundred or a thousand yards from the place of the robbery; I can run as quick as any person of my size, and had the hardest work to overtake him; he had a light coloured drab coat and blue stockings; the coat he had on was taken off his back, and there was fresh blood on it.</p>

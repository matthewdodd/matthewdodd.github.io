                  </hi>. I am a linen draper of Stratford. The prisoner entered my service as assistant, on 3rd March, at a salary of 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—in consequence of information I received on 31st Oct. I marked a shilling and a sixpence, on the head of the coin, and gave them to Mr. Golledge—I went up stairs to dinner, leaving Mrs. Whitter in charge of the shop—she rang the bell for me, and I went down and asked the prisoner how much money he had received—he hesitated, and did not say; I said, "You had better tell me at once, because I know all that you have received"—I had a constable with me, and gave him into custody—he was searched, and the</p>

               <p>shilling and sixpence which I had marked were found in his pocket with several other coins—he had no business to put money into his pocket—it was his duty, for every amount he received above 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to make a bill and have it examined by a second person, and pay the cash to the cashier imme<lb></lb>diately, before the customer left the shop—he would not give change from his pocket; the cashier would do that—I afterwards searched his boxes, and found a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and five sovereigns.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you paid him any wages? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, every shilling that was due to him—I paid him monthly—when I came down stairs, the child who had come was out of the shop—my wife was in the shop—I cannot say whether she was looking for some velvet, but she was keeping the prisoner occupied—he went outside the shop to look in the window to see what velvets and ribbons were hanging there, but I do not know that he was looking for velvets for my wife—I do not know whether any hats were being made up at that time—we do make up hats—I believe there was a customer in the shop; I do not know what that customer was being served with—if they wanted velvets to trim hats with, they would have to be looked out, and he would have to go and look in the window to see if they were there—Mrs. Whitter had taken the office of cashier, because the cashier was at dinner—the cashier is a youth named Potter, but sometimes I act as cashier, and sometimes my wife—a person named Webbe may also act as cashier on an emergency—the cashier keeps the books, enters the amount, and files the ticket—it is the duty of the person receiving money to enter it in a book of his own, and the cashier enters it also: so that there are two entries—I charged the prisoner imme<lb></lb>diately I came down stairs—I asked him what he had in his pocket, and he produced the money from his pocket.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, of Stratford, and collector to the West Ham Gas Company. On Friday, 30th Oct., I was in the prose<lb></lb>cutor's shop, and saw the prisoner serving a customer—he received 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and two halfpence—he went to the cashier's desk with it and put it on the desk, and then immediately put something into his waistcoat pocket, and when Mr. Whitter went to look what was there, there were the two halfpence—I mentioned it to the prosecutor—I went again to the shop on the same evening, and saw the prosecutor mark a shilling and a sixpence—I took them home and sent them to the shop next day by my daughter, aged eleven, to purchase two pairs of socks—she brought the socks back, and not the money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you waiting to see Mr. Whitter? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I went for the gas account, but he was up at dinner—the customer that came in was an elderly lady—there was no cashier at the desk—Webbe, the assistant, was in the shop folding up a table cloth at my right—I did not mention it to him—I wear classes occasionally, but I am very long-sighted—I was nearer to the door than the lady—the counter is longer than from me to you—the prisoner does not speak very plainly, he stutters sometimes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did your daughter bring home an invoice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the customer takes the invoice for every amount received, from 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. upwards—it was your duty not to let a customer go from the shop without a bill.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi>). On Saturday night, 31st Oct., I was called into Mr. Whitter's shop—the prisoner was standing against the window, looking in—he seemed confused when Mr. Whitter asked him something—Mr. Whitter said, "I give him into your custody for robbing me"—I said, "We had better go in at the private door, as there are people passing"—we did so, and Mr. Whitter said, "Search him now"—I put my hand in his waistcoat pocket, and he pulled several pieces of silver out of his trowsers pocket, and this marked shilling and sixpence with them—he said, "Pray forgive me, for the sake of my friends," or "Will you forgive me, for the sake of my friends?"—I took him to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it not, "Do not lock me up for the sake of my friends?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am sure he said, "Forgive"—he did not give me an answer immediately—he seemed confused, and as though he could not speak for a minute.

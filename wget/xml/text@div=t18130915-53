On Monday morning last, I stopped him as he was going out to his breakfast, and conducted him into the accompting-house; he was told that he was suspected that he had borax in his pocket, which he for some time denied; after some hesitation he took a piece of borax out of his pocket, and said that was all he had, that it was only a little bit he was going to give to a friend. On the constable being sent for, and proceeding to search him it was found I think in three other pockets, different parcels; the whole weighed three pounds and a half; he was then conducted into the work-room, where he worked in a box, of which he kept the key, we found six pounds and half more; the prisoner acknowledged that he had taken it from Mr. Maud's premises, and hoped we would not hurt him for it.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the shop on the 10th of February, when I went in; and when I went back, my son called to me to know if I had noticed which way the man went—I looked at the half-crown, and put it at the back of the till—on the next day my son called me into the shop, and I saw the prisoner there—I knew him to be the man I had seen in the shop the evening before—there was a second half-crown taken of him—I gave them both to the officer.</p>

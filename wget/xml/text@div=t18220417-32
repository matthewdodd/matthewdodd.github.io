            . I am turnkey of Bridewell; the two prisoners were both prisoners there. Mr. Gill applied to me in August, and left a trunk in my care. I deposited it in the strong-room in the prison; the prisoners had no access to it. Early in February I was taken ill, and remained so till the 24th of March, when I returned to my duty, and on the 26th I found the door of the room had been opened, and the box broken open. I had not seen it since February; they were both prisoners there then. I watched and saw Green deliver a shirt and handkerchief to a woman, to get washed for him. Mr. Gill afterwards claimed them; an officer searched Dodd and on him found a shirt, marked T. G. which Mr. Gill claimed, and the stockings on his feet. I then searched Dodd's cell, and found two pair of sugar tongs; nobody but him was confined in that cell. I also found two pieces of silk, and two pair of stockings, in his cell, all claimed by Mr. Gill. I found nothing in Green's cell. I charged Dodd with it; he said he was very sorry any body was blamed besides himself; that he committed the robbery, but nobody but himself knew any thing of it. Green said he had the things of Dodd; he might go to the room unobserved in the day time. The locks must have been picked. Dodd was committed for two years from Guildhall Sessions, and made a wardsman in the prison.</p>

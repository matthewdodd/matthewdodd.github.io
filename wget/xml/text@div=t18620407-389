About half-past 10 on the night of 7th March, I was on duty near the premises of Mr. Richardson, of New-street, Bishopsgate—my attention was drawn to the roof of the warehouse there—I found the prisoner lying down on the roof—I took him to the warehouse and found that two panes of glass were broken, and the skylight</p>

               <p>of Mr. Richardson's house—the prisoner was about a yard from the skylight at the time I took him—as I was taking him to the warehouse he threw away this chisel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I searched him, and found on him some lucifer-matches, two knives, and a pocket-handkerchief—the knives are common pocket knives—the chisel is an instrument used in house-breaking.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector</hi>). I examined the roof of Mr. Richard<lb></lb>son's warehouse—I found the glass of the skylight broken, and the sash partly prised up—I fitted this chisel to the marks where it had been prised and it fitted exactly—there is no question that this is the instrument that he partly prised it up with; there is a notch in it, and that notch exactly fitted a mark in the paint.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> In what part of the skylight were the marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the wood-work—there is sufficient lead round the skylight to prevent the water getting through, but there is some wood-work also—it is a lean-to in a shoping position, fitting down on to the frame—the marks were on the frame, and under the sash as well—that part of the warehouse is much lower than any other part—it is only about eight or nine feet high, and there to a gate at the end of it by which a roan could get up himself; with the assistance of another person he could get up in a minute—this chisel n the sort of instrument that we often find used in house-breaking.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Greenwood, Hadley, in the parish of Enfield. The prisoner Lock was about six weeks in my service—on the 6th of December about twelve o'clock at night I was going to bed and was undressed—my dressing-room is almost over the pantry—I heard people talking, and went down stairs and listened at the pantry door for some time—I still heard talking, and tried the door, but could not open it—I said to my servant Lock, "John, open the door"—he said, What, sir?"—I said, I insist on your opening the door"—he opened it—I found he was in liquor—I said, Who were you talking to?"—he said, I was not talking to any body"—I said, Nonsense, I have been listening at the door"—he said, I was not talking to any body"—I went to the adjoining place, where there is a sink and a door which leads to the wash-house, and found a man concealed behind that door—I dragged him to the light, and found it was the prisoner Matthews, who had been in my house some time previous, brewing—he had two bundles in his hand—I said, What have you got here? put them down on the ground"—I desired him to open them—Lock was going to open them, but I would not let him—Matthews opened them, and in one was two pairs of shoes which do not belong to me—the next bundle contained some bread, which, as Í bake at home, I know to be mine—while I was looking at him I observed he had a bottle stuck in his breast—I collared him, and said, I will see what is in this bottle"—he said, You shan't,"—I said, I will"—we had a scuffle-at last we got against the sink—I pinned him, and when he found he could not help himself he smashed the bottle against the sink—it contained sherry wine—I was dragging him back to the pantry, and he struck me three or four times, but did not hurt me—I pulled him down—my maid servant was gone to the stable for the groom—my wife came in, and, being nervous, I was obliged to let him go, to go to her to get her away, and in the meantime Matthews escaped, but he was apprehended at eight o'clock next night—the wine was taken from my cellar—I know that from Lock's confession—I always kept the key of the cellar myself, and gave out per haps two or three bottles of wine at a time—I did not miss any wine—it is difficult to miss any, for there is a good deal of wine drank in my house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183712110019"></xptr>
               <p>when I am out—I might easily lose a bottle of wine without knowing it—I know the bread—the loaves are a very peculiar shape, and we bake them ourselves—this is a loaf that came out of his handkerchief.</p>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you in any business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am a merchant—I have lived at this place since July—before that I lived there with my father—I had my wife's mother and sister stopping with me at this time, and I had given out several bottles of wine—I had not a dinner party that day—my friends were staying at my house—there was a little mutton and veal in the handkerchief—Matthews had been employed there as a brewer, but previous to this—it was only one bottle of wine that Matthews had—a bottle does not hold a quart—Lock was in liquor at the time-be slept in my stable that night—he walked out of the house and shut the door—he could not get in again, and slept in the stable—he re turned next day, and was refused admission—he came to the house, and I desired him to walk out—there is a Mrs. Delarby in my establishment—she is my wife's lady's-maid.,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many bottles of wine did you give out that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three quart bottles of sherry, and I think three pint bottles—the bottle I found on Matthews was a quart bottle—it is evident the cork had not been drawn, and the quantity spilt must have been as near a bottle as possible—the cork was not broken when I first saw it in his possession—I did not take it up myself after he threw it down, till the policeman took it up, which was about two o'clock the same morning used almost always to decanter the white wine—I used to decanter the port wine myself, for fear he should shake it—I gave him three quart bottles and some pints of sherry, but they were all safe in the cellaret after wards, for I looked at them—not any of the wine I gave him out that day was used at all—I had given him wine about three or four days before—when he was out of wine he asked for more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any part of the former quantity of wine remaining in the cellaret that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One bottle—I generally gave him four or five bottles, and sometimes three—I did not look to see what remained in the bottles, but it I had thought there was a small bottle I should have remarked on it—part of the bread found on Matthews was broken, and part not broken—I bread was not all under the control of Lock—Mrs. Delarby and the cook had access to it—I gave Matthews 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day while he worked for me—he had no business there that day—I did not know he was in the house—he was not in the habit of assisting to clean the plate, to my knowledge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a patrol belonging to the Barnet Association. I was sent for to Mr. Paris—he gave Lock into my charge, who directly went out of doors—Mr. Paris wished me to keep in the house till the morning—it was between one and two o'clock in the morning—I searched for Matthews—I found in the adjoining room to which Lock had been two small loaves in the sink, with part of a bottle, and part on the ground there was a little wine in it, which I tasted, and it was sherry.</p>

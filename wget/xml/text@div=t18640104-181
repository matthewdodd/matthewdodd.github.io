                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Holloway—I first saw the prisoner on 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> December, at Mr. Holloway's shop—I asked him the object of his coming to our shop—he stated that he had seen the cashier on the day previous, and that he had brought a letter from a Mr. Horsford, of Euston hotel, Euston-square; that the cashier was perfectly aware of the contents of that letter, and he was awaiting the appointed time, which was 12 o'clock—he remained there till the cashier returned from the Bank, where I had sent him—that was about an hour and ten minutes or an hour and a quarter—I gave him the newspaper to read—on the cashier's return I told the prisoner that I should give him into custody, as I believed there was some<lb></lb>thing wrong—I said, "You state to me that you have come from a Mr. Horsford, of Euston-square, is that so? I shall give you in charge"—he then stated that he had not come from Mr. Horsford—I said, "Then where have you come from?"—"Oh," he said, "from a Mr. Bassett"—I said, "It is a very strange thing you should tell me in the first place you had come from a Mr. Horsford, and now, when I tell you I shall give you in custody, you come from Mr. Bassett; pray who is Mr. Bassett?"—"Part manager of the <hi rend="italic">Limerich Chronicle"</hi>—"Where is Mr. Bassett stopping?"—"No, 4, Pitt's-place, Drury-lane; a coffee-shop"—"Then how is it you previously stated to me that you came from Mr. Horsford, of Euston-square, and now you state you have come from Pitt's-place, this coffee-shop; here is the letter, do you know the writing?"—"Yes"—"Who wrote that letter?" (that was the first letter, of 28th November)—he said,"Well, Bassett wrote that letter"—I said Bassett was a stranger to me—he said, "Oh; he is part manager of the <hi rend="italic">Limerick Chronicle;"</hi> as he had previously stated—I then told him I believed it was a forgery, and in the meantime one of our people was in search of a police-officer to give him into custody—I asked how long he had known Bassett—he said something like eighteen months—I said, "Have you been doing anything for Bassett?"—he said, "I have been doing little errands; little jobs for him"—I said,"Then why did not Bassett come himself?"—he replied that he had hardly a coat to his back, and that he was in such a poor state that it would not have done for him to present</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Conduit-street, Paddington. On the 21st of Feb., at a quarter before twelve o'clock at night, I went into the Star and Garter public-house, in Marylebone—I called for some half-and-half, and laid two books in a handkerchief on the form by my side, while I paid for it—I turned, and they were gone—I went out, and saw the prisoner run<lb></lb>ning—I pursued and collared her by the neck—she screamed and straggled, and called, "Police!"—I took the hooka and handkerchief from under her cloak.</p>

I heard a woman cry "Police!" and "Murder!"—I went up and asked what was the matter—the prisoner said, "This man is pulling me by the throat"—the prosecutor laid, "She stole my property"—he had these books under his arm—his great coat was torn, and he was out of breath—when he recovered himself I found he was not in liquor.</p>

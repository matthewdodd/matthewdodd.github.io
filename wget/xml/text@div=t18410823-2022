On the 8th of July, at half-past nine o'clock at night, I left my desk in the shop—I am not certain whether I left any half-crowns in it—the prisoner was brought to me by a person who told me something—I said to the prisoner, "What have you been doing at my desk?"—he said he went there for a pen—I said, "You must have gone for something else"—he said, "Only for a pen"—he began to pull his pockets out, and three half-crowns dropped from him—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Fred,</hi> this tells what you are"—he began crying, and said he had taken them—I asked if this was the first he had taken—he said it was—I said, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Then you have taken this"—he said, "Yes."</p>

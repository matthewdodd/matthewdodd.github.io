            . This John Brown, Jemmy Wint and I were in Moorfields, playing at Skittles, and from thence all went through Coleman street, and along the City, to see if any Chance offered. When we came to Aldersgate, we saw a Cart going through the Gate: Wint said, - here's a Chance, and he jumped up, and pulled the Box towards the Tail of the Cart, but at Long-Line End, the Carman turned about and put it farther in the Cart again We followed the Cart to the Horse-shoe Inn; then the Carman took the Box to carry up the Inn, and cry'd, - who will hold my Whip? Wint said, - I will. Then the Carman took a Truss and carry'd it and the Box up the Yard, and Wint followed with the Whip. In a little Time he came down the Yard again, and said, - 'twas hoddy enough; - we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173906070011"></xptr> shall have it presently. Then he went up the Yard again, and brought the Box as far as the Horse-Pond, but a Woman coming up the Yard he set it down, and when the Woman was gone, he went in again, and brought it clear off. Brown stood at the Watch-House at a little Distance from the Inn, and I sat upon a Bench, where I could see all he did; we kept asunder, that the People might have no Occasion to suspect us, from seeing too many of us together.

            , the Handsome Drawer. I am Servant at the Farthing Pye House, the Sign of the Maiden Head, a Publick House on Windmill Hill. I have seen them several Times together, but can't recollect the particular Days. I have often seen them together in Moorfields, and they have been several Times, since last Christmas at our House, and at other Ale-houses. I know nothing of their Characters, for I never conversed with them, nor do I know how they get their Bread. I have heard, that one of them is a Calender, and the other a Weaver.</p>
               <p>Wint. Have you ever heard any Harm of me?</p>
               <p>Staples. Harm! - I never saw any thing of Harm. - I have heard but an indifferent Character of them. - I can alledge nothing against them. - I have heard their Characters are but indifferent.</p>
               <p>Akins. When we had got the Box, we carry'd it into the Fields, and there we broke it open, and took out the Goods. We carried them to my Room, and fetched Bullinbroke and Deal to buy them. We bargained for 7 l. 8 s. 6 d. She knows 'tis true, and that this was not the first Time she has been at our House, and she knew how we came by our Goods. I went to her that very Night about Eleven o'Clock, and she told me, she could not come to look at the Things that Night, but she lent me a Shilling, and she was at that Time a-bed with Deal. On Sunday Morning she came to see the Goods; we bargained, and she took the Silk away with her then, and gave us a Guinea in Part, out of a Green Purse. On Monday Morning they came and took more of them, and gave us another Guinea, and in the Afternoon they came and took all the rest away, and paid us the rest of the Money.</p>
               <p>Bullinbroke. Did I, or Jemmy Deal, buy the Goods?</p>
               <p>Akins. She made a Bargain for the Silk, and was to give four Guineas for it. Deal and she fetched away the Gloves in a Hand-Basket. The Woman knows me very well, her Husband,

            , in Angel-Alley; I believe I have seen him at Work, within these twelve Months. As to his general Character, I have heard but very little amiss of him. - He might be given to Drinking, or so, - I have not heard much against him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chamberlen. On the 23d of May, Brown was bought before me, and made a voluntary Information of ten or twelve Robberies, and put Akins into his Information. I had heard of this Robbery, in Goswell-street, and asked him if he was concerned in that. He said, - upon his Word he was not. I bid him conceal nothing, and told him, if I found he did, I would have nothing to say to him. Akins had put this Robbery into his Information, and so I would not stop him. If Brown had confessed this, I should have admitted him an Evidence against Akins.</p>
               <p>Three Witnesses appeared for Brown. One always thought him to be honest and just: Another took him to be a sober Lad, but as to his Character<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173906070012"></xptr> he never enquired into that; and the 3d never knew any Harm of him.</p>
               <p>A Woman appear'd for Wint, and gave an Account that she had employ'd him in carrying Fruit, Greens, &amp;c. for her to Spittlefields Market; that he did this Business for her about four Months, and then enter'd himself on Board a Man of War; that he came home about Christmas last, and since that Time had fetch'd Scores of Pounds for her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had Brown Part of the Money?</p>
               <p>Akins. Yes. Out of the first Guinea we had 7 s. a-piece, and the Money was shar'd in the Room where we liv'd. The other Guinea was shar'd in the Street, at Whitechappel, and the rest we shar'd in the Afternoon. Brown had his Share of the whole. Wint, <rs id="t17390607-16-verdict80" type="verdictDescription">

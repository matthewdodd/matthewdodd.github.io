               <p>The Council for Mr. Hales observ'd, That Mr. Harl had his 450 l. paid him again, and therefore concluded, That Mr. Hales could not be brought under the Imputation of defrauding him; but this was answer'd, That the 450 l. which Mr. Hales paid to Mr. Harls Goldsmith, was not paid as a Discharge of that Debt, but placed to accompt, Mr. Hales being at that Time indebted in other Sums to Mr. Harl, and an Instance given. That if it had been otherwise, his Crime would have been the same, that is, If a Thief steals Goods out of a House, and does not keep, but bring them back, it is still a Felony, the Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment.</p>

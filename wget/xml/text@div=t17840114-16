               <p>How can you be sure of them, it being dark, and not having seen them before? - I was under a lamp at the same time so I could see them.</p>
               <p>Are you positively sure now that these are the two boys that robbed you? - Yes, Sir, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Had you changed your guinea? - I had been into the public house for change, but he could not give me change.</p>
               <p>Did you see them in the public house when you went to get the guinea changed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they see you? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Milton. When we were before the Justice this little boy said there were five or six of us that went into the public house, and that we were taken out of these five or six.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you say so? - I said four or five.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 13th of December, at seven in the evening, I sent my son to get change for a guinea, and in about 5 minutes I heard a great noise, and a mob came and brought a boy up to my house, which was Jones; and my son was crying, and said, he had been robbed of his guinea, accordingly the boy was brought into my house, and we searched him to see if he had the guinea about him: We found no guinea about the boy, as we went along, some of the mob said, there was another of them, pointing to the biggest of the two lads, and accordingly my son looked at him, and said, that was the boy that stopped his breath, then we went to the Rotation Office and the prisoners were committed.</p>

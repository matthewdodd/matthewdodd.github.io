The constable searched her pockets and found a tumbler glass in her pocket, which was my property. We took her to the watch-house. She denied it still. The constable and I took Hutchins up. A soldier who was quartered upon me had given me information that he had heard a woman and this man appoint to meet at such a place. We went there and took up William Hutchins. He confessed he had the watch of her and pawned it. We brought him to the watch-house. We went and told the woman (for they were separate) that Hutchins has confessed he received the watch from her. Then she begged for mercy, and confessed she had taken the petticoats and things in the indictment out of Mrs. Harrett's chest. Hutchins said, she gave it to him in another man's name, and desired him to get some money upon it. He told us the pawnbroker. We went there. It was next door to the watch-house, and there we found the watch. The man used to come after her, and sweet-heart her, as he said.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. On Friday the 5th Mr. Macnavan sent for me and gave me charge of the woman at the bar. I found a glass tumbler of Mr. Macnavan's in her pocket. I took her to the watch-house; after that I took up Hutchins at the Gun. I asked him if he knew Mr. Macnavan's cook? He said yes. I said I have taken her up for stealing a watch. She says you have got the watch. He said he was innocent of the crime, but he had pawned the watch, that she told him she got it of one Harry who owed her money to make money of it; that he took the watch to Mr. Gordon's, and pawned it for half a guinea. I took him to the watch-house directly. He said he was to meet this woman the next evening, and give her the half guinea. I went down to her and told her the man had confessed all the robbery. She then went on her knees and confessed the fact herself. The prisoner said he was waiting for the woman when I took him at the publick-house. He went with me very readily. I believe the man to be innocent of knowing the watch had been stolen.</p>

               <p>the sub-treasurer, who would enter it in his book, and then hand it over to the treasurer at the close of the night's proceedings—the prisoner should make an entry in his own book, and sign the contribution-card—the two books ought to correspond together at the end of the evening's takings—the prisoner kept the book called the contribution-book—it was principally kept at his own house—he would enter the moneys in that book at the end of every quarter, and tally it with his other book—that was kept as a sort of ledger-account between the subscribers and the Society—the two principal books were the sub-treasurer's book and the secretary's book—he would enter in the contribution-book as he thought proper—it would make no difference to the society what he put in it—he had not to account from that book—that merely shows what was owing from each individual member—he would account for the money from what was entered in his own book and the sub-treasurer's book; he accounts for it on the card as well—the Society issues those cards—on the book produced for Davy be gives a receipt to Davy in his own name—he ought to have paid the money into the sub-treasurer's hands, and the sub-treasurer would pay it over to the treasurer—the contribution-book has nothing at all to do with it; the prisoner made that up himself, and brought it occasionally to the court when he thought proper—it was only wanted at the court once a quarter—these others are the two principal books, and these ought to tally one with the other.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Q.</hi> Did you go to Mr. Jower's house in company with your co-trustees, Mr. Bass and Mr. Mott? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; that is not the time I am speaking of—I think it was in December that I went to his house—it was on the 19th December that he made this statement to us—that was after the summons had been taken out—we did not give him into custody but took out a summons; we were going to the court-house about the summons when he met us at Ilford; previous to that I had been to his house and asked him to deliver over the different books—after two or three meetings there, he gave them over to us—I went there with my co-trustees, Bass and Mott—I showed the prisoner a paper with certain amounts upon it—he did not ask to be furnished with a list—he said, "Ask the secretary to give me an account of all the defalcations, that I may examine the books"—I believe he afterwards came and examined the books himself—we showed him the account—I did not give him a copy of it—this is the paper I showed him (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) and he said to us at the same time, "I have received all these moneys; I must have received all this amount of moneys, or I should not have made entries on the cards for them," or "I should not have given a receipt on the card for them, and in the case of Davy, I remember quite well taking his money in the court-room"—I am certain about that last matter—I recollected it when I was at Ilford, and stated the same thing there, I think, or pretty nearly—I know this paper was put in evidence there—I will not swear that I mentioned about Davy's name in particular before the Magistrate—I will swear that the prisoner admitted the amounts of moneys he received—the accounts were audited every quarter—I never was an auditor myself—they were audited from these two books, and the contribution book; not from the members' cards—it is not the rule in Forestry to examine the members' cards, unless some<lb></lb>thing is found out—the auditors signed the accounts as audited and cor<lb></lb>rect, as far as regards these books; the contribution book would be there, but not the cards.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>books—it would be the next night after the quarterly night—the courts are held once a fortnight; the audit was always a week after the quarterly night—that audit would have been some time early in April—it was to suit the convenience of the secretary, he fixed the audit night, and went to the auditors and told them when they were to attend and examine the books, and they attended and audited for him when he was prepared with the books—he kept the contribution book at his own house—when the accounts were audited the contribution book was produced and compared with the other books—I cannot tell whether, at the time of the first audit up to 25th March, these items were entered in the contribution book; the book being in the prisoner's possession, it might have been made up after the audit—the auditors do not sign that book in any way—there is a balance<lb></lb>sheet made out which they sign—if the contribution book was made up subsequent to the audit, we should have no check from that, but the sec<lb></lb>retary can explain more about these matters—this is the piece of paper that was produced to the prisoner by me—the name of Davy, and the amount 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is on that—he admitted receiving all this money, and Davy's amount he admitted receiving in the court-room—the amount of deficiency alto<lb></lb>gether may be about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not on this paper, we have not got all on this paper—the amount here may be about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. perhaps—I think there are 106 or 107 members altogether—the 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. consists of, perhaps, eight sums, of eight different members—Brayshaw's is the largest amount—I think that is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in June, August, and November—they are three separate items—there is one amount of 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is the amount of a quarter's subscription.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it would take twenty-four of those to make 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—Brayshaw's is the first defalcation on this paper—that was in June, 1862—there are none in 1861 on this paper; in the course of the twelve months the amount of the blundering was about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other deficiencies were before that—no; these are the first—I don't know of any item in 1861, I have not examined, or in 1860—the last date here is August—the prisoner was dismissed in September—the other items go on, perhaps, for three or four months after August—we did not go through the books, when we took out this summons—we suspended the prisoner in September, 1863—these amounts were all in 1862—we discovered the other sums between August, 1862, and September, 1863.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the trustees of this Society—I was with Mr. Lock when we met the prisoner at the Rabbits at Ilford—he asked if he could speak to us—we told him "Yes, if we are all three together"—he said, "Yes; all three"—we went into an adjoining room, and he there and then asked us not to press the charge—he said he was ruined; that he had lost his place, and that he was prepared with any money to pay whatever we wished—we referred him to our solicitor, and told him we had no power to do anything of the sort—I was present on a previous occasion when this paper was produced to the prisoner—we had the contibution-cards of the persons here referred to, with us at the time—I believe that was in December—my co-trustees, Mr. Lock and Mr. Mott, were there—I produced this paper to the prisoner, and likewise, I believe, a card of Brayshaw's, and said, "We have examined about this, and we find deficiencies; we find the sums on the cards, but not in the books; can you account for it?"—he said, "That is my signature, and I acknowledge the money, otherwise I should not have put my signature to it, but I can't account for the money." <hi rend="smallCaps">MICHAEL LYNCH</hi>.

               <p>before that an ordinary member—I am now acquainted with the course of business—it is the duty of the secretary to receive money for the Society, more especially from country members—when he receives money he gives these receipts on these cards—the money is received in favour of the Society—it is my duty to account to the sub-treasurer for that money—I enter it in the secretary's book, and hand the money to the sub-treasurer—the con<lb></lb>tribution book has always been the property of the society, but it is kept in possession of the secretary at all times—it was handed over to me on 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of last September—being kept by the prisoner it might, of course, be posted up by him at any time—I have examined the items charged in this paper of deficiencies, with the contribution book, to see if they are entered—there are four which are entered—I cannot, of course, tell the time at which these were entered—there are no dates.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer in the service of the London and North Western Railway Company—on 5th May, in the morning, I was on duty at the booking-office, Euston-square, I there saw the two prisoners together, and saw them accost several ladies who were going by the 10 o'clock train, an ordinary train which did not carry persons who had tickets for Marcus' Excursion—I saw Waugh go up to a woman as she was going into the booking-office, and he said, "Where are you going to, is it to Manchester?"—she said, "No, to Liverpool"—he then showed her this ticket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and then pointed to Gordon, and said, "I will sell you this ticket for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., my friend came up with it on Wednesday last, and is not going back"—she said, "What can I do with a Manchester ticket?"—Gordon said, "If you give 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for this ticket, and go to Manchester by the excursion train, when you get there pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Liverpool, and you will go the whole distance for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d."</hi>—Waugh said to her, "You will save by that, because if you went third class you would have to pay 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the woman hesitated very much—Gordon said, "Go and ask the porter the fare from Manchester to Liverpool"—she ultimately gave the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Waugh for the ticket, and the prisoners both left the station; I sent some one to stop them, and followed the woman to a second class carriage of Marcus' excursion train, which went at ten minutes after 10, ten minutes after the other, it is the Company's train—I believe Marcus receives a commission—the woman got into a second class carriage; I went up to her and asked her for the ticket, and she gave it me, it was to Liverpool, second class, 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by an ordinary train, I am informed that the third class fare from Manchester to Liverpool is half-a-crown; the prisoners were stopped, and I took the woman into their presence, told them I was a detective officer, and that I was present, and had seen them when they were accosting ladies, and heard all they had said, and as it was a very constant occurrence I should take them into custody for defrauding the Company—the woman then said, "You have got me into a mess"—Waugh said, "Yes, we have, we must get you out of it"—Gordon said that he had come up from Manchester by the train on the Wednesday previous, and paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it; he gave me this excursion bill, which he said he had received (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him if he had read it, and pointed out "Not transferable" to him—he said, "Yes"—Waugh said, "I will tell you the truth, we were both in a lodging-house together last night, and we agreed to come up here to sell the ticket as Gordon said he did not wish to go back, Gordon remarked that we should get into trouble if we were caught, and I told him to leave that to me, I would see to that"—they were all three taken into custody—the woman was discharged by the Magistrate, she was an emigrant about to proceed to America—no ordinary passengers were allowed to go by the 10.10 train, that was for excursionists—the woman got to the station six or seven minutes before 10—she told the prisoners she was about to pay 26<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a second class ticket.</p>

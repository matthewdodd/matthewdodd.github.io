                  </hi>. I am in the service of Sarah Tighe; a pawnbroker, of Deptford Broadway—about 1 o'clock on 25th March, Joseph Lee came and offered to pledge an Albert chain; he asked 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it; I asked him if it was gold; he said that it was, and that he bought it in Oxford-street, and gave 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and could if necessary produce the invoice—I tested it, and told him it was brass; he made no reply—I sent out for a policeman, but before he arrived the inspector brought Oscar into the shop, who said, "Oh, it is my brother, we are dealers, you can do nothing with us; they are 9</p>

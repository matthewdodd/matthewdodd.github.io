I had not known the prisoner or Mansfield till the 14th of May, when I was standing at my door, about half-past nine o'clock in the evening - I then saw the prisoner in the passage of a chandler's shop, kept by a person named Thompson, and Mansfield was standing by the public-house next door to him, in the street; Pearce then came out of the passage and joined Mansfield, and in a few minutes I saw them both go to the door of my father-in-law's house, which is next door to the chandler's shop - there is a batch-door to my father's house, about three feet six inches high; my father has been a soldier, and now keeps a marine store shop - I saw the prisoner put his hand in, open the door, and hold the bell from speaking; there is a bell and a bolt to the door; I had not then shown myself - Mansfield entered the shop immediately; I waited a short time, and then went over - I asked the two persons how they dared to enter the shop without giving any alarm, or ringing the bell, and the prisoner answered it was no business of mine; I said it was my business, and how dared they to enter there - Pearce then said he came to buy a second-hand jacket; he was then on the threshold of the passage door - Mansfield was in the shop, and had his hat off, and was in the act of getting into the bin where the rags are kept, under the counter, at the back of the partition which separates the shop from the passage; Pearce was then going out of the passage, and as he went out he told me he would knock my b - y brains out; he then went out, and said to Mansfield,"Come, Tom, this won't do here;" Mansfield then followed him out, and they stood there for some time - I begged and prayed of them to go away, and said if they did not I would charge the first Policeman who came by with them - Pearce then again told me he would knock my b - y brains out; I said there was no occasion for that - I thought they were about to rob, and I several times desired them to go away; Pearce then made at me, to hit me, and struck at my head with his fist - my father-in-law, who had then come out, caught the blow; my mother-in-law then came out, and pulled me and my father-in-law into the shop, and shut the batch - she had also told them several times to go away; Mansfield had before that made a blow at my father-in-law, while he was outside, and my father was on the threshold of the door - neither my father nor I had offered to strike either of them; but after the prisoner had made the blow at me my father took up a piece of an iron bedstead inside the passage, and in his own defence struck at them, but he did not hit them, the passage being so low it caught the ceiling; Pearce then took a long shut knife from his pocket, opened it, and made a blow at my head with it - I put my hand up; it just missed my head, and cut my little finger, it was a cut about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170033"></xptr>an inch long, and nearly to the bone; it was not a stab, it was an over-handed cut - my mother's doctor saw my finger, and dressed it the next day; the prisoner only made one cut - the blade of the knife did not touch my head; I felt it brush my hair, and if my hand had not been there it would no doubt have cut my head - when the prisoner drew his knife, Mansfield drew his knife also, and made a blow at my mother; they then went away, and as they were going, Pearce said, "You b - rs, we will serve you Portuguese fashion;" I saw no more of them till they were at the station.</p>

            . I am waiter at Mr. Lamb's - it is a house which many of the girls use. I saw the prisoner come there the first of the morning of that day; he had several pots of ale, and stopped there the greater part of the forenoon - he came again between six and seven o'clock in the evening, quite drunk, and another man with him, who I do not know; I heard of a man named Mansfield by an advertisement which I saw in the paper.</p>

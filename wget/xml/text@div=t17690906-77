I said I had no watch. He said he was sure I had more money. I said I had no more, and desired they would not use me ill. I gave him then my halfpence; but he said, D - n the halfpence, and gave me them again. He that did not hold the pistol took my silver buckles out of my shoes. They then bid me go about my business. I went on. It was so dark, that I cannot particularly swear to the men. One was in a surtout coat, and one of them was taller than the other. The tallest is the evidence: the short one took my buckles.</p>

            . I am a cooper by trade. I have known the prisoner a little better than twelve months; he was concerned with me on the 28th of July. We were coming from London, and stood at a gate till the prosecutor came by us; we let him pass a little way, then we followed, and I bid him stop. I had a pistol. I asked him for his money, he told me he had but very little; he gave it me. There was a nine-shilling piece, a half-crown, there shillings and six-pence, all bad money; there was none good; we could not pass any of it. The prisoner took his buckles out of his shoes. We went into a public-house, and had but one shilling, which was my own, that would go. I was taken this day six weeks, and the prisoner about three days after, by the information of a girl. I had given information of him before, but did not know where he was.</p>

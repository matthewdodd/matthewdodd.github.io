I am son of George Meyers, builder, of Belvedere-road, Lambeth—the prisoner was in his employ two years—we have a wharf, and the prisoner was employed in getting the timber from the rafts in the river—we have for some time missed scaffold-ropes, but the prisoner had no right to take any away—that was generally known among the workmen—this rope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is good and serviceable—some of it has been cut—junk is old rope—there is none of that here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman at Mr. Myers' wharf. I have con<lb></lb>tinually missed rope—about a month ago I marked some, and soon afterwards missed it—on the Friday or Saturday before the depositions were taken, I marked some scaffold ropes, and missed them in half-an-hour—this is one I marked (<hi rend="italic">pointing it out</hi>)—it was found in the sack—it was whole when I marked it—on the Saturday I saw the prisoner go across towards where the saw-pit is, which is separated from the wharf—on 6th June I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner come running out of the upper-yard with a bag on his shoulder, as fast as he could—I followed him, and a policeman who was watching at the gates, and Coghlan followed him, till he got to the Commercial-road, when he stopped and dropped the bag—he must have seen us, we were thirty yards off—when I got up to him he was in charge, and I said, "Day, what have</p>

               <p>you got hare?"—he said, "Some old junk"—I said, "I think you will find something more than old junk; who gave you leave to take it?"—he said, "Robinson"—I said Robinson had no right to give him leave, and he said he did not know that—he was taken to the station, and I there identified the rope—he must have known it was not old junk—I have seen him take ropes to the saw-pit, and come away without them.</p>

Pomeroy showed me some marked ropes, and they were left on the wharf—I afterwards went to the saw-pit, and found a sack of rope at the end of it, covered with saw<lb></lb>dust—it had no business there—I watched it from time to time; I missed it one night, and next morning saw Day with it on his back in the yard; at soon as he saw me he put it down behind a cart—I went away to the next yard, came back again, and met him coming out of the gate with the rope on his back—I followed him, and he was taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to a solicitor. On the morning of 16th Jan., I was in Bedford-street, at the end of Bedford-row, and about half past 10 o'clock, I saw the prisoner emerge from Hand-court, and cross Bedford-street towards Bedford-row, as if to enter Bedford-row—instead of doing so, he suddenly turned to the corner of the railing by Bedford<lb></lb>row, and stood there—he was doing something that attracted my attention, as if he wished to do something secretly, that a passer by might not observe what he was about—I could not see what it was, he had got something up his sleeve—he then proceeded up Bedford-street, my eye followed him—I then saw Mr. George Waugh, the deceased, whom I had known for five or six years, proceeding in an opposite direction—the prisoner, when within about four yards of Mr. Waugh, presented his arm, and I saw something in his hand; it seemed to glisten, and looked like brass—I did not know</p>

               <p>what it was at the time, and immediately he presented his arm, he made use of the words, "You villain, you have ruined me; why did you rob me of my property?"—I immediately heard a report, as if from a pistol—I heard Mr. Waugh exclaim, "Hold him, collar him, he has murdered me!"—I then walked towards the prisoner, and when within about a yard of him, as I was going to put my hand upon him, he drew a second pistol from his right hand coat pocket, and cocked it with his left hand—I then said to him, "Why did you shoot the poor man? you ought not to have done that; why did you do it?"—he immediately replied, "He has ruined me, and robbed me of my property"—I said to him, "Now you have ruined yourself"—he said, "I don't care, I have done it;" and he dropped the second pistol—Mr. Waugh was not dead at that time—he was down on the ground—he did not drop for two or three seconds after the report—whilst he was exclaiming, "Hold him, collar him, he has murdered me!" he was on his legs—persons then came up, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

I posted a letter directed by Mr. Waugh to the prisoner—I have a copy of that letter—these letters of 11th and 28th Oct., and 5th Nov., are in the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">The following letters were read</hi>: "To Mr. C. Westron. 10th Oct, 1855. Sir,—Your conduct was so insulting, and your remarks so impertinent and unwarranted, at my office this morning, that I find it necessary to revert to the decision I some time since adopted, when you pursued a similar course, of declining personal intercourse, and desiring that any further communication may be made either by letter or through one of my clerks, and kept within the bounds of reason and truth; in answer to which, every information will be given you as to the Burrow and Munscomb estates. Had you taken a proper course of conduct and conversation this morning, instead of using such expressions as and—scoundrel, and other infamous ones of a like nature, I should have shown you the agreement, signed by your brothers and sisters, for granting a new lease of the property to Mr. Howse for ten years, at the same rent and the like covenants as those in his present one, with the addition of a power from the lessors to determine the same upon any quarter day, upon giving one year's previous notice so to do, and pay<lb></lb>ment of the usual outgoing tenant's valuation, and for any permanent improvement made by him to the property, with their consent in writing. I now have to ask if you will sign such agreement, which is left with my clerk for your inspection. I remain, your obedient servant, George Waugh." "11th Oct. (<hi rend="italic">To Mr. Waugh from the prisoner.</hi>) "Sir,—You have been told by me, over and over again, that I will not sanction, on my own behalf—that is, you say, I can do nothing—Mr. Howse taking a fresh lease at a rental of 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, subject to such swindling deductions as are made through you, namely, expenses, collecting the half year's rent for me, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. two sums of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, taxes against income, making 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent, upon the rent, besides other expenses. The first part of your letter contains a quotation of some expression you state I made use of in your presence. It is possible I have, but more probable I have not, exactly as you write it, without an additional consonant tnat would have given a more significant bearing, and have been a more apt return of a <hi rend="italic">sotto voce</hi> benediction of your own to me. With respect to the other part of your letter, wherein you state you will not see me, I must distinctly give you to understand, that you are too dear to me to allow of my breaking a five years' acquaintance in that abrupt manner; and therefore I shall take the liberty of not only calling, but requesting that you will be visible on the 21st of this month, which will be three months from the time I last wrote you, of which you appear quite oblivious, as also the lapse of time since you served me with a notice of your intention to dispose of the property. I shall have nothing further to say to you, but simply this, that it is my intention to see your son, as I presume he will be placed in your shoes before long, and I should like for him to know how he will be situated</p>

               <p>with me when such an event occurs, as there seems more truth than you may perhaps fancy in the remark made by Mr. Ellis, at Tiverton, when he observed that my life hung upon a thread, and had he completed the sentence it would have been, 'and this gentleman's life on my right hangs on a puff of smoke.' I do not intend to have any more correspondence with you, having answered your letter. I am, Sir, yours respectfully, C. B. Westron."—"Oct. 28th. To. Mr. Waugh. Sir,—Since you now seem to be quite oblivious, or rather I should say regardless of time that has elapsed after the first notice you gave me of your intention to dispose of the property, I will thank you to forward me particulars of your account, that some mode of settlement may be devised, and a balance struck between us, as I have a little set off against you. At the same time have the goodness to inform me what your views are with respect to the property; and if, in accordance with mine contained in the late correspondence between us, let me know, as I am desirous of carrying out the promise given to Mr. Coombe, although extorted under a threat of not going into your office, and thereby creating a return of that serious delusion of which he informed me at the same time you laboured under. I am, Sir, yours most respectfully, Charles Weatron." "5th Nov. Sir,—In answer to your letter, I have only to state that you must have been as well aware as myself its contents only amounted to a part of a promise of something being done between this and Lady Day next, provided nothing occurred to prevent it. I have now instructed Mr. Sandys to dispose of my share in the property by 10th Dec. next, let the loss that very probably will occur be what it may. He suggested what perhaps never occurred to you, that my brothers or the other branches of the family might, through your assistance, be induced to give me a trifle for my interest, and then you might have succeeded in your original purpose of managing the property, and your son, of course, would follow in his parent's pattern. Previous to all this taking place, I think it but right to let you know that although my judgment might err in condemning a solicitor who acts in behalf of both plaintiff and defendant, yet I cannot be made to understand how a person is expected to sanction the sale of a pro<lb></lb>perty previous to his having seen the title or description of it, as you were so anxious for me to do at the time of compromise; nor how any solicitor calling himself respectable could induce a client to accept a compromise to the value of 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., now states that the purchaser won't have it, but the client must take what he can catch, or perhaps 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., provided nothing occurs between this and Lady Day. You are perfectly aware of the terms of compromise, but not perhaps quite so enlightened as to the difficulty I had of procuring a sight of my title to the property, or either my reason for sanctioning 6,300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a public auction, which was not carried out; I therefore consider that I am entitled to have the original offer of 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. carried out. I am afraid, from the letters you have written me, that you have made a very slight mistake with Mr. Burridge's affairs, but you will excuse my speaking a little enigmatically—thereby hangs a tale, but not an entail. You had better make out particulars of your account, and furnish me with same, when I trust, if a settlement is made, it will prove satisfactory to both parties. Mr. Sandys' address is No. 4, Gray's Inn-square, and he will call on Monday or Tuesday. Sir, I am yours respectfully, C. B. Westron.")</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Ogborn, a City policeman—in March, 1854, we lived in Angel-court, Skinner-street—we are now living in Paternoster-row—in March, 1854, the prisoner came to take a lodging at our house—my husband went up stairs with him, I went also—the prisoner said that he could not believe the bed was long enough for him to sleep upon, and before he took the lodging he should like to measure it—it was a full sized bed, quite long enough for my husband to sleep on, and he is about six feet high—it was a six foot bed—my husband told him that it was long enough for him, we quite laughed at the idea—he still persisted in measuring the bed—he ultimately took the lodging—and remained until May—during that time I had opportunities of seeing him—I used to notice his behaviour every day, and I named to my husband how very eccentric he used to appear, different from what I ever noticed any other gentleman—if I spoke to him on any matter of business, such as letters, I have had brought to me, I would speak to him three or four times, and he would make me no answer whatever—I used at one time to think he was deaf, but I found to the contrary, that he was not deaf, it was only his manner—he used to hold conversations with himself very loud, at night as well as in the daytime—he used very bad language at times, and seemed in a very excited state, when by himself—I have heard him knock his fists on the table in the bed room when he was by himself—I was ill at one part of the time, and lay in bed in the next room to him, and he used to disturb me very much—after I had made his bed he used to strip it almost every day—whenever he was going out, he always stood two or three minutes in the small garden in front of the cottage, eyeing the house over—it was very seldom that I could get him to enter into any conversation, even respecting himself, but when I did, he would break off very abruptly, and say no more—at times he spoke rationally, and at times his conversation was very frivolous, it was quite nonsense, childish talk—when he used to enter into any kind of conversation he used to talk quite childish and silly talk—from what I saw of him while he was with us, I thought he was not correct in his mind, and I spoke of it to his brother.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner came to lodge at my house on 5th Feb., last year—I noticed his conduct during the time he was there—he had very peculiar strange ways about him—he used to have such strange ways with cooking his victuals, and he locked himself in—I used to light his fire, and after I had done so he used to poke it out again—he did it four times in one afternoon—I do not remember whether the weather was cold or not at that time—he desired me to light it again; four times I went up—one night I went up, and he was in a very bad way—whether it was a fit, or what it was, I could not say, but he was lashing cold water about his head; the window was thrown open to the very top, and all the doors were open—he was walking up and down a large room, which did not belong to him—I asked him what was the matter—he said he could not tell; he thought he was going to be strangled—his handkerchief was off his neck, and all his clothes, except his trowsers—his shirt was on—he seemed to look very strange, and to think that something was going to come over him—I observed his eyes—they used sometimes to look very small, and his features would be'quite altered, and at other times he was more calm and composed—it was by candle light that I saw him on the night I speak of—I asked him if he would have any medicine—he told me he always kept medicine by him—I said, "Then you had better have a drop of brandy"—I went down stairs to get it; and when I came back with it, he had locked the door, and locked himself in—I knocked at the door as hard as I could, thinking he was perhaps in a fit, or something, and he would not answer; so I went down stairs, and saw no more of him that night—I do not recollect whether it was that night that I heard him out of bed, or not—it was his own room that he locked himself in—I inquired of him the next day how he was, and he seemed to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> off the story—he did not seem to like to answer anything about it—he did not say much about it—it was merely as he was going through the passage that we inquired how he was that morning, if he was well again, and he muttered something, I could not tell what—he seemed not to be pleased to answer us—I once saw a pistol in his bed, under his pillow—I do not know whether it was loaded or not—I had gone up to make his bed—he was down stairs at breakfast—I happened to lift the I pillow, and saw the pistol—I did not go near it, but went down, and asked him if it was loaded—he said, what was that to me, because it would not hurt me if it was—I said I would not give it the chance, for, until he went up and removed it, I should do nothing to his room—he went up and removed it, and put it into a cupboard, and I never saw it afterwards—sometimes he would take no notice of what was said to him—one morning, in particular, he came down to breakfast, and the cloth was on the table from 10 till 12 o'clock, and he sat, looking at a book, but never speaking—I came down, and said, "Don'tyou want any breakfast to-day?—he never answered me—I said "Are you well, or not?" and he turned round, and asked me what I was asking him that for—I said. "Because when people are not well they can't eat"—he turned about to me very abruptly, and said, was it anything peculiar to me that he was not taking any breakfast—I said, "Oh, no, not the least"—so I took the doth off the table, and he went up stairs.</p>

               <p>was a peculiar look about him—he had a book, and was sitting before the fire, and never troubled his head about the breakfast—the table was waiting for him, with his breakfast—he always brought down his own victuals—he was very particular in his victuals—he always did everything in his own place—I live at No. 2, Coburg-street—he was there from 5th Feb. until April—he would boil his tea in a little tin pot, and coffee and everything in the same concern, not at the same time, coffee at one time, and tea at another—he used always to bring in his victuals at night, and make us cook them—we used to cook them up stairs at night, and he used to keep them in his room—he brought in his bread and butter, and whatever he wanted—we did not supply him with any of his victuals—they remained in his cupboard until they were finished—I know that he poked the fire out four times on one occasion, because I heard him, and I told him of it at the time—all the remark he made was that his fire would not light, and he wanted to lay me a sovereign that it would not light—he never called to as on any occasion, when he wanted anything, he always came out on the landing with his stick, and knocked, and called, "Hoy!"—that was his signal—I took up wood and firing four times that afternoon—on each occasion the fire seemed as if it had been poked out, the pieces of wood were lying in the fireplace—I do not think it was above an hour, from the first time I lighted it to the last.</p>

                  </hi>. In Sept last I lived with my mother, at No. 94, Lisson<lb></lb>grove. I had previous to that time been one of the attendants at Grove<lb></lb>hall Lunatic Asylum—whilst I was living with my mother, the prisoner came to lodge there—I think he came in April, and he remained about five months—the greater portion of the time he slept in the next room to me—I frequently used to bear him talking very much in the night, and some<lb></lb>times he would appear to be shouting out to somebody—I have heard him say sometimes very bitterly, "No, d—you, you shan't do it," and that sort of thing—that was sometimes at 12 or 1 o'clock in the night—it disturbed me very much, and I used to notice it—I got used to it, I had been used to it long before—I cannot say that it was every night, but it was very frequently—I have often conversed with him—sometimes he would speak very ration<lb></lb>ally, at other times perhaps in the midst of his conversation he would break off in a very strange sort of manner—sometimes he would not answer at all—I have frequently gone in, and he would not speak to me at all—he seemed quite lost, and would take no notice—I have sometimes noticed</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 23, Kaphael-street, Trevor-square. The prisoner came to lodge with me on 12th Nov., and remained till 28th Dec.—he was very eccentric in his ways—he talked to himself very much and very loud, so that I often used to hear what he was talking about—one day I heard a great noise of scuffling in his room with the fire irons and fender, as if he was fighting with some person—I thought he had some one in the room; I heard him say, "Oh! I have got you now, have I; I thought I should catch you"—I was in my front parlour, and he was in the back parlour—I did not go in to him—I found out afterwards thai he was by himself—a few minutes afterwards, I heard him say, "I shall set the place on fire presently"—next morning when I went into the room, I noticed that my toilet covers were lying on the floor, and I picked them up, and exa<lb></lb>mined them, and saw that the corner of one of them was very much burnt, both of them were burnt, and the counterpane also—he went out in the morning as usual, before I saw him—in the evening he knocked at my door, and said he was ill—I asked what was the matter, he said he had had a fit; he had a basin three parts full of cold water in his hand, and he was bath<lb></lb>ing his fece—I asked if he was subject to fits—he said yes, he was—my husband asked if he should get him a doctor—he said he did not know of one—my husband asked if he would allow him to take him to a doctor—he said he thought he should like to go to a doctor—he said he was sub<lb></lb>ject to these fits, and if I ever found him in one, I was to put his head in a pail of cold water—he said that from nine years of age he had always been ill every Friday—I observed a wildness about his appearance—we thought it was not a fit, we thought he looked very wild—I observed this sort of conduct very much during the time he was with me.</p>

               <p>you had a fit, as you have been subject to them since you were nine years of age"—he said, "Oh, no! it was nothing of that"—he said nothing more; we wanted to know what it was, but he was so very strange in his manner we did not name it again, as he was going to leave—I think he was in the habit of reading in bed—I used to observe a light in his room very late; I cannot say whether he was up or in bed—bis habit was to be in his room very early, but whether he went to bed or not I do not know—I used often to hear him putting up the shutters at 2 o'clock in the morning, or 12 o'clock at night—one night about half past 12 o'clock, he knocked at the folding<lb></lb>doors between my room and his, and asked me to call him at 8 o'clock in the morning—we had been in bed for some hours, and I thought he had been also—he was very irrational—I really thought he was not quite right in his mind—all his ways were not like other gentlemen that I had been used to—he was very strange in all his manners, in every way—I used often to see him sitting over the fire with his hands on his knees, and I would knock at the door three or four times before he would answer me; and I have heard him say inside, "What the devil does she want here, I won<lb></lb>der?"—once when I spoke rather loud to him, because he did not answer after I had spoken once or twice, he was in such a desponding state, he said, "I am rather deaf," but at another time I observed that he was not deaf—he heard me at some times better than at others—I used often to hear him talk to himself very much—he used to say, "I will give it to him; he shall have it; I have put up with it long enough; I won't put up with it any longer; I won't stand it any longer"—he used to talk like that very frequently, but I could not hear every word distinctly—I often heard him mumbling and talking to himself night and day; if ever I awoke, I used always to hear him talking to himself—I think I have told you all that I recollect hearing him say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the medical profession. Three years ago I was called in to attend the prisoner—he was then living at Park-hill, in Somersetshire, with his brother in law—it was a difficult matter to say what was the matter with him, in as much as, from his extreme peculiarity, I could not get any rational reply to the questions I put to him—he was evi<lb></lb>dently suffering under considerable mental disturbance at the time—if I asked him a question to get at his ailment, his replies were so perfectly irre<lb></lb>levant that I could not at all satisfy myself as to the precise nature of his disease—I had no question at all that his mind was affected at that time—the opinion I then formed was that he was evidently suffering from mental aberration—I have not had much to do with the treatment of luna<lb></lb>tics, not more than falls to the ordinary lot of men in general practice—I have not been attached to any institution at all—I have been in Court to-day.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean seriously to say that you think the circumstances you have heard stated, and what occurred when you saw him three years ago, will justify you in saying that in your, opinion he was not aware that he was guilty of any infraction of the law when'he shot Mr. Waugh? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is asking me a question perhaps which I should be hardly expected to</p>

               <p>answer 90 unequivocally as you put it—I am further convinced, from the evidence I have heard, that his mind has not improved since I saw him in Somersetshire—I did at that time consider him in a state not cognizant of tight and wrong—I do not know that he would not know it was wrong to kill a man—I was not surprised at this at all—he evidenced a very dis<lb></lb>turbed state of mind, such as that I inferred from it that he was incapable of judging right from wrong—I inferred it from the circumstances I have named, his irrelevant answers, and sometimes, in reply to my question, he would put a question to me, but expressed in language of a very inco<lb></lb>herent character, such as no one could understand—I cannot now recollect the questions he put to me—I am speaking of the impression upon my mind at that time.</p>

                  </hi>., M. D. I live at No. 16, Eaton-terrace. I have had a considerable amount of experience with lunatics, and in insane cases, for some years past—I have attended Dr. Sutherland's establishment, and been under his instructions, and acted with him for a considerable period—I have seen the prisoner—I had a short interview with him in Newgate yesterday evening, in the presence of the surgeon of the gaol—I had never seen him before—it was only a short interview, I should have preferred a longer one—I was able, from the length of time I was with him, to form a judgment—I formed the opinion, that there was a very great deficiency of mind about him—in arriving at a conclusion as to the sanity or insanity of a person, the state of mind of the father and collateral relations is a most important feature—I have heard the evidence that has been given on the subject of his father, his uncle, and one of his aunts, and I have also heard the evidence that has been given throughout the whole of this case—if all the facts deposed to by the witnesses be true, I think the prisoner was not able to distinguish right from wrong at the time he committed the act in question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that you think he was not aware that killing a man was wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not say that, but I say I do not think him conscious of the moral guilt he was about, to commit—I do not think he was aware of the enormity of the act he was about doing—I do not say that he did not know that the act of killing a man was wrong, many lunatics do—many lunatics know that such an act would be wrong—I do not say that I believe him to be among them; I think not—I do not think him capable of judging whether he was acting right or wrong—I did not hear the letters, with the exception of the letter written about the two notes, that was the only letter I heard—I do not form any judgment at all from that—I never recollect a patient treating his delusion jocularly upon any occasion; whatever the delusion may be, they believe it with all their soul—I should consider the expression in the letter</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040084"></xptr>
               <p>that the life of the man on his right hung upon a puff of smoke, to be a threat that he intended him some injury by means of fire arms—I have heard that he stated to one of the witnesses that he had been cheated of his property by a rogue of a lawyer, and that in giving his account of it he was in a very excited state—I cannot say that that produces any impression upon my mind—he may have made up his mind long ago to destroy Mr. Waugh—I never saw him until last night—I was with him about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes—I asked him first after his general health; he made no answer at first; afterwards he said, "Pretty well," or "Pretty good"—I said, "What was your motive for killing Mr. Waugb?"—he said because he had robbed him or plundered him of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that he had given him a written promise to pay him upon a certain date a sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the money was not paid to him; that he was very anxious to go abroad, but he could not do so, not having this money; that Mr. Wangh knew a great deal too much about him—he then became quite confused in his manner of speaking; in fact, he spoke unintelligibly about certain parties agreeing with certain other parties to do this, and others to do that—those were his expressions, as near as I can recollect—he walked away from me, and returned once or twice, but I could get no further explanation from him than what I have mentioned, that certain parties wanted to do certain acts, and had combined with others to do them; but no further explanation could I get—he did not name the other parties, he mentioned no names, only answered my questions about Mr. Waugh—I asked him many ques<lb></lb>tions, to which he appeared to pay no attention, or as if he did not hear them; at any rate, he took no notice of them—I asked him how long he had made up his mind to shoot Mr. Waugh before he committed the murder—he gave me no answer to that—I asked him how he slept—he said, "Pretty well"—I again came back to his general health, and asked him was it good—he mumbled an answer which I could not catch—I think that was the whole of the conversation, as far as I can recollect—from his manner of answering, and his general appearance, I should have certainly considered him a person of unsound mind—his general appearance was suspicious, indi<lb></lb>cated by the sudden sidelong look of his eye; extreme suspicion—I think I have now described the symptoms I observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to tell us, upon the judgment you have formed, upon the oath you have taken, that you are enabled to come to the conclusion, by way of opinion from what you have stated, after his giving you his reasons for shooting Mr. Waugh, that he did not know that killing him was contrary to law, and was wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From his manner, from the evidence I have heard here from the different witnesses, I have no doubt in coming to the conclusion that he was not conscious of the enormity of the crime he was committing—I think he did not know it was wrong to kill a person—I am prepared to say that, upon my judgment—in the course of my conversation with him the onlv delusion I discovered was that about the 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was not true, I have heard so in Court—he said to me that he should have had 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if it had not been for Mr. Waugh, but he should now only get 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I say that was a delusion—I could not tell then that it was a delusion, but it appears by the evidence to have been so—that, taken with the proof that he was subject to delusions, confirms my opinion that he is not a responsible agent—I think he did not know right from wrong, or that it was wrong to kill a person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You think he did not know right from wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have seen and attended some hundreds of lunatic patients—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185602040085"></xptr>
               <p>judge very much from appearance and demeanour—it is almost impossible to convey by words the appearance and demeanour of a lunatic patient, nothing but experience will teach it you—it is sometimes difficult to fill up a certificate, even where no doubt exists as to the mental state—you can<lb></lb>not bring forward proof to put down in black and white until you have had many opportunities of examining the patient—if I had had a larger oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing the manner and demeanour of the prisoner yesterday, I have no doubt my opinion would have been strengthened, as he had the appearance of a person of unsound mind—I am sure he did not then under<lb></lb>stand that he had committed a crime, and it would be presumable that he did not know it at the time he committed the act—the tying the neckcloth on two occasions, and talking in his room to imaginary persons, are indications of insanity—the descriptions given of his manner and restlessness generally are strong indications of insanity—I have found in lunatics a most intense earnestness of purpose, and whatever reasoning is applied to show them that they are wrong has no effect whatever—supposing the prisoner to be a lunatic the fact of Mr. Wangh's behaving extremely kind to him and his family would not alter his impressions—when I saw him yesterday, it was in company with Mr. Gibson, the surgeon of the gaol.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You used the term delusion, is it your opinion that the prisoner was labouring under entire defect of reason, or that he had delusions upon particular subjects only? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been proved by the witnesses that he had delusions upon particular subjects—no madman if mad upon every subject—he has delusions upon certain subjects, but on others his judgment is untouched—in my interview with the prisoner I judged from his manner of speaking that he did not know it was wrong to kill a person—in persons of unsound mind you can never answer for the moment they may take a homicidal or suicidal tendency—it may come on at any moment without previous warning, where clear unsoundness of mind has been first proved—it has been proved by the witnesses that he had delusions, which show a diseased state of mind, and in such a state of mind a homicidal or suicidal tendency may at any moment arise—he enter<lb></lb>tains delusions on some points, so it is proved in evidence—in some matters his mind may undoubtedly be sane—whether upon those matters he would be capable of distinguishing right from wrong, would depend a great deal upon whether he was labouring under excitement at the time or not—if an excitement was produced, it would render him incapable of judging for the time being, although the matter might not have relation to his delusions.</p>

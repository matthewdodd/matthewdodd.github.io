            . About three weeks ago, I saw the prisoner at Douglas's wharf, where I ply as a coal-porter; he brought a bundle with him, and came and asked me to go with him to the Cannon, public-house, in Hungerford-street. The bundle was a sack rolled up, and tied round with string. He said I was to draw two shillings of Hornsby, the landlord, for this bundle, and tell him they were to be delivered to

            ; he went with me to the Cannon; he carried the sack to the door; then gave it to me, and I delivered it to Hornsby, and received two shillings. I gave the prisoner the two shillings. He and I went into a public-house in Villiers-street, and had some beer, and parted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Who do you work for - A. Douglas and Co., or any one who employs me. This might be three or four months ago - it was a small bundle, and did not contain above one sack; it was certainly a sack; he said that Purfit had sent him with it. I understood nothing wrong by it. My rooms were searched, but I never understood that I was suspected of it. I was not taken up.</p>

            . I kept the Cannon, public-house, in Hungerford-street, until the beginning of June last; I remember Burrows coming to my house, about a month or six weeks before that; a person was with him who did not come into the house, but stood at the door. Burrows brought what appeared to me a sack or two sacks, rolled up and tied with string. I was in the bar; he said he had got a parcel from Purfit, and was desired by Purfit to ask me to lend him (Burrows) two shillings to pay the man for bringing the parcel, and Purfit would pay me when he came in the evening to take the parcel. I took it, and lent him the two shillings.</p>

            . I know Hornsby; he left the Cannon, public-house, ten weeks, or three months ago. I am a coal-porter, in Scotland-yard. About fourteen weeks ago he gave me a sack rolled up, but not tied round - he never asked me for anything. I took the sack home - my room was searched. I kept the sack in my room, and used it as a rug - they took nothing out of my room in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you do with sacks - A. We use them in our business. I paid Hornsby nothing for it. I do not think it was so long as four months ago. I was taken up on suspicion of stealing it. It was a corn sack - it was not fit for the coal-trade.</p>

            . The prisoner was in our employ, at Scotland-yard, as watchman. The sack is our property. When we send a quantity of meal from our premises in Scotland-yard, he always accompanied it to see it delivered, and see the sacks safely brought back. I never authorised him to sell or give them away. We placed great confidence in him, and thought him an honest servant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you not occasionally let out sacks? - A. Yes, to persons in the neighbourhood, on hire. We cannot have lost this one more than nine months. He has nothing to do with collecting the sacks which are lent out.</p>

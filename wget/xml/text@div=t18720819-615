                  </hi>. I live at Thomas Street, Limehouse—on 21st July I was in Commercial Road about 1.30 or 2 o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner standing, with a lot of other fellows—I turned on one side to go by—one of them rushed out, caught hold of my arms and held them down; another took hold of my neck and took my watch away, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—they ran away—I ran after them, but one ran up and struck me and knocked me down—I jumped up again and ran as fast as I could—I got a constable and he caught the prisoner—I don't know who took my watch and money, but I am sure Green was in the group.</p>

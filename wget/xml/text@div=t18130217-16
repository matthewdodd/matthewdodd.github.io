I opened the box, and found the things that are laid in the indictment, two shawls, half a yard of cambric, and three pair of stockings, all my property. I asked him how he came by them. He said, he took them while I was at dinner. I sent for an officer, and had him taken up. I sent one of my men with an officer to his mother's, where they found a number of things belonging to me.</p>

            . On the 22nd of January, a pair of breeches was brought home by a woman for the prisoner, and with them a remnant of calico and brown Holland. On Saturday morning, when Mr. Fisher came to town, he was acquainted with what had taken place. He immediately went and charged the prisoner with having taken it out of the shop. Mr. Fisher then thought he had more property in his box. Mr. Fisher took him up stairs. He gave Mr. Fisher his key. Mr. Fisher opened his box, and there he found the articles laid in the indictment. I was along with him. He found two shawls, a remnant of cambric, and three pair of stockings, two pair of silk and one cotton. There were other things in the soner's box which were not marked, such as silk handkerchiefs.</p>

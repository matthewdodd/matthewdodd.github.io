We call this receipt a cart-note—it is originally taken by the carman with the goods, and if they were not paid for he would bring the receipt back and deliver it to the foreman, who would pass it to the cashier, and it would ultimately come back to the prisoner for collection, but he got possession of it before it came to him in ordinary course, I don't know how—we keep twelve or thirteen clerks, and a great many of these notes pass from hand to hand—errors are sometimes made.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole; the night this robbery happened I went with Vogle and Eckford when they opened the foundry; I saw him taken out of the foundry, and this parcel was in his hand; I was left centry outside for fear he should jump over out of window; the prisoner had the bundle, he carried it to the watch-house out of the foundry; I went to the watch-house with them, I followed behind; Vogle had the prisoner in his hand; Vogle and I had the key of a Small cupboard where the articles have been kept ever since till now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the conduct of the prisoner during the time he was going from the foundry to the watch-house? - I saw nothing only that he seemed very dull.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he got it? - He said he went and slept there after the men had been at work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been locked out of my lodgings and I knew that the men got in to sleep in the foundry if they were locked out, and I got through the window to sleep there.</p>
               <p>Court to Bishop. Did the prisoner ever work at your shop? - I came to work in September last and he worked there then, some time before Christmas he had a burn, and he said he was not able to work, and by that means Mr. Eckford had got another man.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Leadenhall-street; I am a jeweller; I keep a shop there; I mean to impeach the evidence of Vogle and Macdonald; I know enough of Vogle as far as the best of my belief he is not to be believed on his oath, and I know enough of Macdonald to say the same.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in Leadenhall-street? - Seven years.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor's Counsel. You was rather fortunate to meet two of old acquaintance again. It is a lucky circumstance that you should happen accidently to be in court when there were two witnesses that you know. - When you have done with your soliloquy I will speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Mr. Davis we will take Vogle first. How long have you known Vogle? - I believe about three months.</p>
               <p>Q. There must have been some very peculiar transactions to enable you to form this opinion. - There were. I have a house in Cheapside which I occupy and carry on the same business as in Leadenhall-street, and I thought it my duty to serve constable, and I cannot say whether it was in the month of November or December, it was my night to be on duty and set up in the watch-house; I always made it my duty to patrole the streets instead of setting in the watch-house. One night one of the patroles led me towards Blackfriars, when I came there, I never had been down one street in which there is a watch-house, the watch-house is very little distance from our patroles beat; sir, says he, this is the way; I went after him thinking it was my duty to go that way; when I came into the watch-house I understood there was no constable there; this man passed as constable and with a great deal of importance asked me who I was; he was sitting dressed in his patrole dress and asked me what I wanted; I told him I should be glad to speak with the officer of the night; says he, what do you want? I am the officer of the night; the officer was sent for and this Vogle came and struck the patrole that was with me, it was after some words<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179302200053"></xptr>had passed between them about his innovating on their premises in their ward; Vogle then struck him, in which this man I believe Macdonald, assisted him; I had got my great coat on, and there was a gentleman watching at the window all the time of the transaction; I waited nearly half an hour and said, I would go away, they made a prisoner of me, and kept me there; these men after the constable had come in, they declared and said, they would swear on their oaths, that I pulled off my coat to fight them, and had used a great deal of abusive language, which was quite the reverse.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this cause ever tried? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Court. I cannot help then expressing my astonishment at your swearing that you would not believe these men on their oath on this cause, and which cause was never tried.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that your wife? - It is; we have been married twenty years; we were married at St. George's church.</p>
               <p>- EMERY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife of the last witness; I knew the prisoner just a week, by sight; I know about her neither good nor harm, only that she took my property. No other person knew that I had such a thing but her; no other person was in my place; it was laying in a cup and saucer, upon the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it lay open to any body that came into the house? - No woman ever came into my room but her; I lost it; and I found it again at the pawnbroker's; the prisoner pawned it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you pawned it yourself, or desired any body to pawn it for you? - No, I missed it on the 18th of last month; I found it at the pawnbroker's the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to the pawnbroker's to enquire for it? - I missed it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it into your head it was at the pawnbroker's? - I thought I would endeavour to find it. I first went to Brown's, I could not find it; I went from there to Mr. Wright's in the Ambrey.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever pawned any thing at Brown's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At any other pawnbroker's? - No, I went and asked, if any body had taken in a spoon, with three letters on it, I and two E's, they produced it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker, I know the prisoner; about nine o'clock, on the 19th of November, she brought a spoon; Emery's wife came about two or three hours after; I gave her 18 d. Emery's wife asked me, if I had taken in a spoon, with three letters on it; I told her I had, and shewed it her. (The spoon produced, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went down into the yard, about eight o'clock in the morning, and I found the spoon by the sink hole, and I took it, and went and made away with it; I never was in the woman's room; she cannot say I was in the room from Sunday night. Pray, Mrs. Emery, did you see me in the room? - No, but she was the only person that knew the spoon was in my room; it was in my tea cup the night before, when I went to bed, in the morning it was gone; I did not know she was in my room; but no other person had been in my room since I have been in the lodging but her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was down in the yard, and there I found it; she saw me standing by the street door when she came down, going with her husband's breakfast.

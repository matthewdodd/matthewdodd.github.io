                  </hi>. I am a short-hand writer. On Sunday, 4th June, I attended a Chartist meeting held in Bonner's-fields, which is a large open common or green—there had previously been a meeting of the Irish Confederates that afternoon—the Chartist meeting began at a quarter to six o'clock—there were about 3, 000 people present at the meeting, and a larger number scattered over the place—many of them had remained from the former meeting—there was no chairman appointed—Sharpe first addressed the meeting—I took a note of what he said; this is it:—" My friends, you can perceive that I have kept my promise; and on yesterday morning several parties, who pledged their words to attend this meeting, I expected here; but if some men, in the time of anticipated danger, will not come forward, it is necessary that some one should; and as I have been here during the calm, I am prepared to be here when the storm comes on. This being the most stormy time I have kept my word, and consequently I am prepared to make a few more remarks. You will, perhaps, not consider that I am actuated by any motives of fear, when I tell you, and when I find that I stand alone, I shall not give the Govern<lb></lb>ment the horscu hipping that I promised them; but still I will address you. While I was speaking to you this afternoon, in reference to the various meet<lb></lb>ings that had taken place in London during this last week"—(cries of 'Ernest Jones! Ernest Jones!')—Mr. Jones appeared in about a minute or two after,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030111"></xptr>
               <p>not then. "Gentlemen, I believe there is Ernest Jones coming. Friends, I am very glad to find that Mr. Jones has not run away from the post of danaer; and when I made my remarks previous to his coming, I did not include him in the list, but I included those men that had addressed you Sunday after Sunday for many weeks; and I do not think that it is con<lb></lb>sistent of men, while we can talk quietly together, that they should desert their post, as I have observed before, when there is something like an antici<lb></lb>pated danger. I will not detain you long, because I know that you are desirous to listen to Mr. Jones. Now, my friends, I wish to speak to you with reference to the unnecessary interference of the police this morning, with a number of working men who attended a meeting at Nova Scotia Fields. It is well known that we have met there for about four or five Sundays; we have discussed our grievances, and the men have quietly dispersed; but what with the tyranny of the Government, and the officiousness of the police, I understand they came there this morning, and abused, and insulted, and brutalised the great majority of the men who had there assembled. I under<lb></lb>stand that the people acted the part of cowards, and do not blame me when I say so. I was not present, because I was at another meeting, on Blackheath. The people, I understand, ran away—(a voice: 'The people had nothing to defend themselves with.') The gentleman says the people had nothing to defend themselves with. Now, if ever you come in contact, Sir, with the police, you must expect a knock-down blow with their truncheon; but when you have about three to one, one man falls out of three, and the other two can secure him. Now, will any man tell me I am wrong when I say that you acted the part of cowards when you ran away? What was the conse<lb></lb>quence? This morning, when I was at Black heath, there were five inspec<lb></lb>tors pointed out to me; there was a number of special constables, and like<lb></lb>wise a number of sergeants, and of other men connected with the force, all in private clothes, pointed out; and some of them said, 'For God's sake, Sharpe, be careful what you say.' I consider I am always, because I am always desirous to speak the truth; and when I speak the truth I state what I mean; when I tell men what they should do, it is what I am prepared to do myself, believing that what I stated is all that is required to carry out our ends; and consequently, if you are men, and determined to establish your rights, that you should embrace the opportunity when it presents itself. Now, then, with regard to the meeting that took place on last Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, on Clerkenwell-green, I was absent, because I was at Green<lb></lb>wich, the same as I was on the. Monday; and in the words of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> they certainly were men of the right sort—men who, under any circumstances, if attacked by the police, would be the vanguard and destroy them. Those are the men of Greenwich, and I trust that the men of the Tower Hamlets will not be behind them, Now my friends, I live at a dairy myself; I wish to give you a little instruction—it is an idea of how many of these men are situated that address public meetings during the so-called turbulent time. I live at a dairy; and a I stopped at Greenwich last Wednesday night, I did not go home till the Thursday morning; but of course my wife, like every other woman anxious for the welfare of her hus<lb></lb>band, sat up for me. A man came to my house at eleven o'clock on Wed<lb></lb>nesday night, and wanted a gallon of milk very particularly; but she told him that the man would not get up to serve it, and he consequently went away. At one in the morning, (my wife still sitting up for me, and in great anxiety,) two men came past, and said they must have milk, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030112"></xptr>
               <p>demanded it. After a great deal of persuasion, the bell which led to the man's chamber was rung; he got up, and the man put the question to him, 'What the devil do you want the milk for? 'Oh!' says he, it is wanted; the <hi rend="italic">specials</hi> are ordered out for two o'clock in the morning, and they want their breakfast before they go out.' I treat the <hi rend="italic">specials</hi> with the same con<lb></lb>tempt as I do the police, because I consider the united force of the work<lb></lb>ing classes of England will destroy that petty power which they hold at the hands of the Government at the present time; and I do hope that you wiil act as men, not be scared at the sight of a policeman or a <hi rend="italic">special</hi>. I trust not; but if ever they insult you, if ever they brutalize you, if ever they strike you, act upon the defensive; and if you cannot knock them down, close with them, and do the best that you possibly can; for I can tell you no more nor less than this, it is only man to man, and sometimes it is a little man to big man, and sometimes it is a big man to a big man, so that, consequently, you stand an equal chance to each other; he has a staff and youhave not, there<lb></lb>fore it is just possible that you, using your strength, might dispossess him of that staff, and make as good use of it as he did himself. You are aware that I have addressed you previously this afternoon, and Mr. Ernest Jones is anxious to address you; and I am very glad, in the presence of my friend Jones, that I have proved what I stated to him yesterday, that there would be from 20, 000 to 30, 000 people at this meeting; and I hope that when he gets up, he will grant to me that I have at least spoken the truth for once." Ernest Jones then addressed the meeting—he spoke from a chair that was placed on a natural mound—he spoke thus:—" Mr. Chairman and men of the Tower Hamlets,—In the first place I have to apologize to you for not having been here sooner; but a man cannot be at two places at the same time. There was a meeting announced for Irongate Wharf, Paddington, and the police, I understand, had forbid that meeting taking place. I was invited to attend it, and therefore I did attend it. There were a good many police there, but they did not venture to interfere with the meeting; and I can tell you this, hold your meetings; for although the Government certainly are mad, they are not mad enough to put down public meetings; and if they were mad enough to do it, I for one hurl defiance in their teeth, and dare them to dis<lb></lb>perse this legal and peaceable assembly. I must ask likewise for your indulgence to-day, inasmuch as I start by the mail-train to-night for Lanca<lb></lb>shire and Yorkshire; and as those places are both in a very excited state, I shall have to use my lungs there a good deal; and as London is not so excited as those parts of the country are, excuse me from wearying you at any great length to-day. All that I say is this, stand fast by your colours; do not shrink from the Charter, and the whole Charter; do not mind the nonsense of the half-and-half men; do not pay any attention to the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch;</hi> and if you see any bodies of police coming near to this meeting, marching on to this meeting, stand your ground, shoulder by shoulder. Do not run; there is danger for those who run; there is safety for those who keep together. Dare them to strike you, and my word for it, they dare not strike a blow. If they were to strike a blow, bad as the laws are now, still they are sufficiently stringent to punish those men who assault peaceable citizens in the peaceable execution or performance of their duty. In nine cases out of ten it is your own fault, it is your own cowardice that invites others to strike a blow, it is men saying, 'We will not do this, we will not do that, because it is forbid.' Make up your minds, stand by it, and whatever comes, stand to your ground. There cannot be more heads broken than are broken on those occasions when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030113"></xptr>
               <p>men run away. All I say is, that the Government are desirous of marring the performance of your present great duty—that duty is organization. I have not been amongst you for some little time. Where are your classes? Have you pot your wardmotes? <hi rend="italic">I</hi> Have you got your class-leaders? Have you perfected your organization? If not, call public meetings, and elect the class-leaders at those public meetings; do not let the class be formed before you have the class-leaders. You will find it much more easy to form class after the class-leader is appointed; for if you form classes, and then afterwards appoint the class-leader, you may spend two or three hours or more upon the formation of every class, and can never come to a fixed determination with regard to it, as one man will live here and another there. Elect the class-leader; the class-leader then knows the men likely to form the class living in his neighbourhood; he will go to those men and invite them; and there can be no dictation, no assumption of that power, because you all elect the class-leaders at the public meetings. Rest assured, if each locality elects about 100 class-leaders, you will soon have 1, 000 men under the banner. That is the way to get up the organization; and then you may elect wardmotcs—one out of ten will be a wardmote. Commence at the foundation right, namely, the classes and the wards; all the rest will follow of itself as a matter of course. Begin by forming your classes. It is no use coming among you, when there is no organization; and it is not the Executive that can get up the organization. The Executive cannot go to each locality, and get up the organization of each locality—it nust be the men in the localities. Show us your organization, and you will have a glorious opportunity on the 12th. Prepare in the mean time. Show us your organization then, and depend upon it we will show you some very feasible means for getting nearer to your rights; depend upon it we will not be backward. Show us your organization, and depend upon it you will not have to make one false step, depend upon it you will not be called to undertake any one step that you will not be fully prepared to carry out, and that the officers that you entrust with office will not lead you in the carrying out of. Steer clear of all partial outbreak and partial rioting. There has been an outbreak at Bradford and Manchester. We sent down Dr. M'Douall, who is now addressing a glorious meeting at Paddington, to tell them to have no partial outbreak—no partial riot. That is just what the Government wants. In a riot of that kind they immediately seize upon the leading men; they will immediately cripple the organization, and your organ<lb></lb>ization will be thrown back. Go on organizing, organizing, organizing, and the rest will come, never fear it. And there is one thing more that is wanted, which is funds—funds are wanted. Without funds, the organization is of little use. The country is beginning to do its duty nobly, and that is a great test of public feeling. But mark you, suppose that it was true, as we heard last night, that the fighting had begun in Dublin—suppose that it is true, as we heard last night, that Government has ordered the daily papers not to say one word of insurrectionary news from Dublin, so that this country is kept in the dark about it—suppose that it should be necessary that we should send a man over to see with his awn eyes, and to hear with his own ears, and thus breathe defiance to the lying press. Suppose that this should be all neces<lb></lb>sary, and suppose that we have not got the money to send that man over, see What danger the movement runs; see how the movement might be thrown back and injured, from the mere consequence of not having a few paltry pounds wherewith to pay a messenger, a trusty messenger, to ratify the bond</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030114"></xptr>
               <p>of union between the English and the Irish people. Union, I say, of senti<lb></lb>ment—union of democracy, but separation from a yoke which binds the one nation in the thraldom of the other. I sav you must excuse me, if I do not: address you at great length, as I am about to start to-night bv the mail-train. Rest assured that I will be struggling in your cause in Bradford, in Halifax, in Manchester, and in the other places where storm and turbulence is now going on. Rest assured that I shall not preach a miserable <hi rend="italic">namby pamby</hi> doctrine of non-resistance and passive obedience; but at the same time I shall preach a doctrine of manly firmness, and of no hot—headed impetuositv. But if you mean to do a thing, see well first if you have the power to do it; and then, having made up vour minds, do not let even death itself prevent you from carrying it into effect. I shall be able to send you" good news <hi rend="italic">one</hi> way or the other. Good news from the north, from Yorkshire, and from Lancashire, namely, the news will be that we have got such an organization spreading there—the news will be that there is such a spirit spreading there, that success must be the certain result. Recollect one thing, gentlemen; part of the West Riding has got the true spirit in its heart, but two great towns stand like an incubus upon the West Riding, namely, Leeds and Sheffield, which are torpid and apathetic. My duty will be to endeavour to get Leeds and Sheffield up to that mark to which Bradford and Halifax are now. I believe that the feeling of the men of Leeds is the true feeling in reality; but men have been preaching among them for a long time an unconditional peace doc<lb></lb>trine. Those men are mistaken men; for though I talk not now of insurrec<lb></lb>tion, I say this as to a peace doctrine, there shall be no peace in the country as long as I for one humble individual can prevent it, until the poor man has his rights, and until the rich man has brought his nose to the grindstone. They are trying to sow dissension and mistrust between you and those men whom you have honoured with the advocacy of your cause. The <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> tells you that the mantle of Oliver and Cashes "—(in my original notes I hare <hi rend="italic">got</hi> it "Oliver Cromwell," but I was <hi rend="italic">corrected</hi> by the defendant before the Magi<lb></lb>strate, and he changed it to "Oliver and Castles ")—" has descended on my shoulders, and it tells you that I was a Tory ten years ago. It lies. I fought three times for those principles which I uphold now, and I can give. the <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi> a proof, if it requires it, that J bear one of the bayonet wounds of the King of Hanover's soldiers about mv person at the present moment. Well, again, there is Cobden, who tells you that demagogues are going about, disturbing and breaking into the middle-class movement; and he says in his letter to the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, that the individuals who go about disturbing those meetings, have got the wages of despotism in their pockets. Ask Mr. Cobden where are the 70, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that were given to him? Ask him where did he get them from, and what did he get them for? and tell him, at least, that the wages of despotism are in his pocket, if he dares to accuse honester men than himself of having the wages of despotism in their pockets. And again, when Cobden the other night challenged the Chartist myrmidons, as he called them, with daring to confront him, why did he, when at the London Tavern, not get up on that platform, instead of sneaking among the reporters as he did <hi rend="italic">I</hi> Recol<lb></lb>lect tin's that their game, their plan is this, to sow mistrust among the various branches <hi rend="italic">of our</hi> organization; to make you believe that if you help them, you will gain afterwards your result. But they cannot deny this, that if you help them they will gain their object. Now, why should your pupils—for you have taught them—why should they, your pupils, gain what they want at once, while you have been so many years struggling for and have not gained it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184807030115"></xptr>
               <p>yet? No, my friends, stand by your own cause. They say they can prevent you from putting the wedge in the rotten phalanx of power. We are strong enough to split it up at one blow altogether, without waiting to put a middle-closs milk-sop wedge in. You will recollect the story of the farmer, whose field was overrun with thistles, and he wished to destroy the thistles; and what did he do? he cut off the tops of them, and the thistles spouted out more luxuriantly than ever. But there came another farmer, and that man was a Chartist; and what did he say? he said, dig them up by the roots. The middle classes are cutting the tops of the thistles, and they will sprout up more luxuriantly now with labour than ever. I want you to take the spade and the hoe to them, and to root up the noxious weed altogether. When you have once destroyed it, it never comes again. Organize—organize—organize! Dr. M'Douell will remain here amongst you; and on Whit-Monday come up in your classes, come up in your wards. Give them such a display as they sever had before. Give them at least another Kennington (but not on Ken<lb></lb>sington-common) meeting, at all events; show them your organization. I trust that much may be done between this and the 12th; and no doubt on the 12th your movement will make an advance again, the same as it did on the 10th April last; only a greater and a better advance. Now, my friends, I bid you farewell. My friend, Sharpe, wishes to say a few words to you on something particular. Now, that I am going off, shall I tell the men of Brad<lb></lb>ford—shall I tell the men of Halifax, who acted so gloriously and who acted so gallantly—shall I tell the men of Manchester, who made the piece-monger<lb></lb>ing [<hi rend="italic">blank</hi>] skip over a garden wall—shall I tell the men of York—shall I tell the men of Leeds—shall I tell the men of the West Riding—shall I tell them that London is determined to do its duty? Because, recollect, they are look<lb></lb>ing to the metropolis—they are looking to you. I verily believe that not a single blow need be struck for liberty in this country. I "believe that in Ireland it must be struck; and what is more, I believe in Ireland it will be struck. But whatever may be the consequence, organize—organize—organ<lb></lb>ize! and prepare for anything. Only preparation—only organization is wanted, and the green flag shall float over Downing-street and St. Stephen's. Only energy is wanted—only determination—and what will be the result? Why, that John Mitchell and Frost will be brought back, and Sir George Grey and Lord John Russell will be sent to change places with them."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what manner was this speech received by the meeting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was received with "hear, hear," and cheers, at various places which are marked, but I did not think it necessary to read them—he left immediately he had done speaking, and Sharpe again addressed a few words to the meeting—he said, "My friends, I shall not detain you at any length; as usual when this meet<lb></lb>ing is concluded, I intend to adjourn to the Prince Albert for the purpose of enrolling names, and as Mr. Jones has told you that you should organize, I exhort you likewise to do so, and we have the plans of organization at the Prince Albert, that you can have for a 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, so that all persons who are sincere, and who are desirous to carry out Chartism; if they will only ad<lb></lb>journ to the Prince Albert, they can have the plan of organization, and all those who in any locality want these plans can have them at half-a-crown per 100, and sell them at what price they like, and realize a profit to increase their funds. Only one remark more, and that is this, the Press has endeavoured to make the public believe that Chartism is dead; I would merely wish to state this—that Chartism is alive and kicking, and that ere long it will kick the damnable Whigs out of office; I adjourn to the Prince Albert, no pro<lb></lb>cession."</p>

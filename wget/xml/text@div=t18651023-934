                  </hi>. I live with my husband at Harlington, he is a farm bailiff—the prisoner lodges in the same house—on Saturday night, 8th October, I went to bed at half-past 12—there is only one floor to the house—after I had been in bed some time I heard some one in the room—I</p>

               <p>called out, "Who's there, what do you want; is that you, Willie?"—we call the prisoner "Willie"—there was no answer, and I jumped out of bed directly and saw the prisoner go out of my room into the passage, and he ran from the passage to his own room—I followed him, aroused my father, who sleeps in his room, and told him that William had been in our room, and I asked William what he wanted in our room, and he gave me no answer—I then went down stairs for a light, came up again, and woke my husband, and told him the prisoner had been in our room—he looked in his trousers-pocket, where he had seventeen sovereigns when he went to bed, and when he looked there were only twelve—I had seen him count the sovereigns before he went to bed—a policeman was then sent for.</p>

On this Saturday night, 8th October, I and my wife went to bed about half-past 12—I was disturbed by my wife saying, "William has been in our room"—I at once asked her to bring me a light, which she did—I examined my bag, which was in my trousers-pocket, and found twelve sovereigns instead of seventeen—I had counted them two or three times over before I went to bed—I am certain I had seventeen—I then went to the prisoner and said, "William, what business had you in our bedroom?"—he said, "What room? I don't know what room you mean"—I said, "You acknowledge to the truth, and that you have robbed me of five sovereigns"—he said he was not aware that he had been into ray room—I said, "You know you have been into my room, do you own it?"—he would not know anything—I fetched a policeman, and he told the prisoner what he was charged with, and asked him if the clothes</p>

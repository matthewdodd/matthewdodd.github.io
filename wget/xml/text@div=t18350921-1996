                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Burn. I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner between sixteen and seventeen years, and his wife also—she had been living at my house for five or six weeks before this happened, which was the 26th of August—she had been living with her husband before that time—he was not at home at the time I first took her into my place—a dis<lb></lb>tress had been put in their primuses by the landlord, and I then took her in—the prisoner was in prison at that time—before the 26th he had come to my house a number of times—to speak to his wife, and when he came in he used often to ill-treat me, and ill-use me, and knocked me down several times because he wished me to go out of the house—I did not object to his coming to the house while he was quiet, and did not ill-use any one, but he ill-used his wife several times in the house, and I forbid him coming to the house a number of times before the 26th of August—he used to come and order me out of the place, and huff his wife, and ill-treat her, and he broke a number of articles of furniture, taking up the chairs and smashing them down, and smashing the tea-things off the table, and wine-glasses, and different things, knocking them about the place—I believe he was neither drunk nor sober—on the 26th of August he came first of all at one o'clock in the morning—we were all in bed—I was sleeping then with his daughter, and his wife was in bed in the same room, and his son William was in bed in a room—his wife had four children, but there were only three at home—he came and knocked violently at the door—I looked out of the window, and said, "Who is there?"—he said, "Me, let me in"—I said, "I cannot, why not go to your own lodg<lb></lb>ing, why come to us at this time?"—he spoke in an outrageous manner, and said, "Why do not you let me in? if you do not I will tear you and smash you to pieces"—I called to the policemen to come to my assist<lb></lb>ance—they said he had a right to come where his wife was, and they would not take him—I said I was in danger of my life, but they said they would not take him—I was so alarmed, I laid on my bed, and trembled a good deal—after that his wife looked out of the window, and said the policemen had taken him away; but before that he had broken open the window shut<lb></lb>ters by wrenching them open in a violent</p>

               <p>manner—they were fastened by three bolts,—he went away at that time, and returned about half-past four o'clock in the morning—the window has sash which slides down—there were two holes bored with a gimblet to fasten it—he smashed the window, pulled down the frame, and got in and ranged about the place in a violent manner, knocking the things about, and smashing the doors about; and then he entered the room where I and his daughters were sleeping, and his wife also—he came and knocked against the bedstead in a violent manner, and doubled his fist in my face, and uttered some bad word, I could not understand what it was—I took no notice of him, and he went out of the house entirely—by this time I think it must have been about half-past six o'clock—he came again at about a quarter or twenty minutes after eight o'clock—we were sitting at breakfast—he took the tea-pot off the table, and smashed it under the ashes, making use of violent words—he said he would smash the things all to pieces, and was swearing, and so on—w took no notice of him to give him an answer—we put some tea into the tea-pot again—It was not broken, it was a pewter pot—he broke a wine-glass at that time—he snatched it off the table, and went up stairs with it, and then his daughter went and got it away from him—he went out up the street, and afterwards came down into the kitchen, and sat down very pacified for more than an hour, I should think—he asked me if I would allow him a room in the house—I said no, I could not—he did not seem much intoxicated—I believe he had been having a little—I said I could not let him have a room, as he was violent and desperate to his wife, his temper was so violent I could not ecounter it—he had often before applied for permission to live in the house, I always refused him for the same reason—he went away—I told him to get a room, I would give him a bedstead, any thing he wanted, but not to come and annoy us—he went away without using any more violence—It was then near eleven o'clock—a young man came in-doors to caution us—he did not hear that—we wished the young man to go down to the kitchen to him, and I saw him go in the kitchen to him—they had a few words—he came up through the pa<lb></lb>sage and said, "Where is Mrs. Fitz" which was the name his wife went by—I said I did not know—he said, "Well, I am going to receive 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I su<lb></lb>pose you will let me see her when I return? "—I said, "I suppose so"—he went out, and returned in about an hour and a half, with two pistols—be<lb></lb>fore he went out there was a great coat of his, which he now has on, in the front parlour—he said to his little boy, "You go and take my great coat to William Appleby's;" and when he returned again, he had got his great-coat on—at eleven o'clock he had a green jacket on—when he re<lb></lb>turned at one o'clock, he was alone—his wife was down in the kitchen with me, and as he came down the kitchen stairs, he said to his daughter Jane, "Jane, will you shake hands with me?"—she said, "No, father, your cruelty is so great to my mother, I cannot be friends with you—I will decline it"—he then called to his son James, and asked him to shake hands—he pulled some silver from his pocket, and said, "Money is no object to me, here is a shilling for you, call your brother William, "who refused coming—he said, "Go and carry him a shilling"—he gave a shil<lb></lb>ling to the baby I had in my arms—one of his sons wanted to take it and spend it—I said, "Never mind"—the prisoner said, "Let the baby go into the street"—he turned round to my elder son, and said, "Thomas, go and get a shilling's worth of gin"—the wife said, "Do not go, we do not want gin; if he wants spirits, let his own child get him half-a-quar<lb></lb>tern"—she said, "Think you had better give me two shillings to buy the child a frock"—he said, "Yes, you shall have it"—he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled out something—I could not see what it was, but his wife screamed out that he had pulled out a pistol—I turned round to ✗what it was, and saw him put hand into his pocket again, and pull out</p>

               <p>a pistol and present it at my face, and pull the trigger—I had not seen the first pistol pulled out, but I heard his wife cry out most dreadfully—the pistol was not a yard from me—the muzzle was pointed as near to my head as it possibly could be—when he pulled the trigger, I saw the flash from the pistol—I heard a little noise, a snap which the pistol made—It was a small pistol—the flash came from by the lock—he said nothing, but made a great noise in puffing his mouth in an outrageous manner, when he found he had my got my life—I flew under the area—he endeavoured to come after me, but my son pinned his arms, and as he went to make an attempt again, he got hold of him, and his hand went through a pane of glass—my son pinned him down to the side, and took the pistols from him—one from his hand, and the other from his coat pocket—they were de<lb></lb>livered to his wife, who delivered them to the policeman—one was the pistol which had flashed—the policeman took the prisoner to the station-house directly, as people gave an alarm—when I got to the station-house he arose in a very confused manner, and said, "Woman, what, are you here? (his wife was with me) Are you going to hang me, or what are you going to do with me?"—we went into the room at the station-house, and did not answer him, but gave our account to the inspector, and went before the Justice the same evening, but it was postponed till next day—he has remained in custody ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you ever any dispute with him before his wife was taken into your house about the distress? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only once, and that was when he had been kicking her in a violent manner—that was a fortnight before, I think, and I spoke a little sharply to him about it, saying it was a bad thing he should use his wife in that way, and have her locked up—he had given false evidence against her at the office—I said I could procure her bail, and hoped if he was locked up, he would not have bail.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Messrs. Walkers, pawn-brokers. On Tuesday, the 25th of August, the prisoner came to our shop alone, and said he wanted to purchase a pair of pistols for the captain of a ship—I showed him this pair, and asked him a guinea for them—he said I must take little less, as he wanted something for himself—I said, if he brought the captain down with him I would see what I could do with him—I would sell them him at the lowest price—he said he would bring the captain down in the evening—he went away—I saw nothing of him till next day, when he came with the witness—he said the captain could not come himself, as he was lying off Woolwich, and he would buy the pistols and take them to him—he bought them for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I merely told him I could take 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them, and he gave that—he asked me for two or three percussion caps to try them—he put one on and presented it at a woman, and said, "You are a dead woman"—the cap exploded—he merely did it out of a joke—he laughed at the time, and snapped it at her—he tried the locks of both, but only one with the cap—nothing more passed—they both went away together.</p>

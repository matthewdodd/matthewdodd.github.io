                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of police—I am employed by the Mint—on 3rd January I went, in company with other officers, to 17, St. Ann-street, Westminster—we found the street-door open, and proceeded upstairs to the second-floor front room, the door of which we found securely fastened—there were two doors, one inside the other—I don't know whether they were both locked; the inner door was bolted—I have the inner door (<hi rend="italic">it was here produced</hi>); the bolt was sprung—the outside door we shattered to pieces—this is the oak post of the inner door—we broke open both the doors, and got into the room—we found the prisoners there in bed together—I had some conversation with the male prisoner of rather a coarse nature—I said to him, "It is quite certain you intended to resist, by all the means in your power, to prevent anybody making an entry in here"—he said he did not know what I meant—I said, "By placing this additional extraordinary strong</p>

               <p>door inside"—he said, "The b—doors about here have got no strength in them"—I told him I had received instructions from the Solicitor to the Mint to endeavour to put a stop to his extensive coining and dealing in counterfeit coin, and that we came there with a Magistrate's search-warrant to search his place—he said, "You will find nothing here, unless you have brought it with you"—we then proceeded to make a search—I found in the cupboard this galvanic battery, charged with solution in both jars, a quantity of while metal which had been melted, files with white metal in their teeth, a pipkin with a small portion of white metal in it, a pad, a piece of marble with plaster of Paris upon it, as it now appears, a gallipot with some plaster of Paris in it, some brushes, some plaster of Paris in powder, and several bottles containing acid—there were also two tin bands with plaster of Paris adhering to them, a tin box containing white sand, and a canister containing several pieces of antimony—some of these things were in the cupboard, and some in a little drawer close by the cupboard; all in the room—I have a bag here containing plaster of Paris; that was found in the bottom of the cupboard—these are all articles used by coiners for the purpose of making counterfeit coin.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector, B</hi>). I accompanied Brannan and the other officers to this house—when we got into the room I found an earthen pot on a sideboard near the fireplace, and in it were these four counterfeit half-sovereigns, wrapped separately in paper—I showed them to Brannan, and said, "Here are counterfeit half sovereigns;" upon which the male prisoner said, "Then I'm b—if you have not brought them here."</p>

               <p>knocked at one room door; there were two doors to that one room—we were three or four minutes from first knocking until the door came open—we did not knock at any separate door; the only knocking was the breaking open—we went upstairs as fast as we could, and broke the door open imme<lb></lb>diately—I believe there was some knocking at the door of the back room about the same time.</p>

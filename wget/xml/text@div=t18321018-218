               <p>BENJAMIN BRIERS. I live at Bedley-heath, South-mimms. On the 16th of October I lost some ducks from my farm at <placeName id="t18321018-218-crimeloc1216">Hadley</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. When had you seen the ducks? A. I had not seen them that day; there is a near way across my fields to Barnet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Do you know Mr. Morgan? A. No; I know that Turner lives at Barnet now, but I did not then.</p>

            . On the 16th of October I received information of this - I went and took Turner at his father's house; and Cox at Holloway, the next morning; Turner said he was very sorry, but he did not kill the ducks-Cox said poverty drove him to it, and he had only had one penny roll for two days, which I believe to be true; he has a wife and two children, and has been hard working and industrious.</p>

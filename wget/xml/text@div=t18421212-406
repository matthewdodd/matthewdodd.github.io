                  </hi>. I am a miller, and am agent to Mr. William Carpenter, of the Greenwich Steam-mills—I go round to various customers, in my gig to sell the flour—I take a boy with me. I was out on the 1st of Dec., and saw Mr. Carpenter's wagon standing opposite the prisoner Onions's house, in the Old Kent-road, on the other side of the road—Johnson had charge of that wagon—I saw a sack of flour, with Mr. Carpenter's name on it, being carried across the road from the wagon—the man who carried it was going towards Onions's house—he went down a sort of hill, and towards a lane, where, I suppose, he thought there was a side-door to Onions's house—Johnson beck oned him—he came back, and went to Mr. Onions's—the way he was going would have taken him by an indirect way to Onions's house—at this time Johnson had not an opportunity of seeing me, because I was behind a wagon—Onions was standing at his own door, and saw all that was going on—Johnson had joined the man who had the flour, assisted him up the hill with it, and then went into Onions's house—I then drove up to the door, and said "Well, Johnson, what are you after?"—he said, "I have brought Mr. Onions a sack of flour"—I asked how he received that flour—he said the order was given at the mill, and he received it out of the delivery-book—I asked him to show me the ticket—he said it was in the house—I requested he would fetch it me—he said he would, and went in—I expected he would bring me the ticket—I sat in my gig some time—he did not come—I got out of the gig and ran into the house—there was no one in the shop, but I heard a talking below—I ran down stairs to the bake-house, where I saw Johnson, with the sack in his hand, and the flour was shot into the trough—I said, "Johnson, where is the ticket for this flour?"—he said he had not got one—I said "Then, I won't suffer this, this flour is stolen"—Onions, who was there, said "The flour is shot now"—I said, "I do not care about that, I will have the flour put up again; I will send for a policeman, and have you put into cus<lb></lb>tody"—I took charge of the wagon, and when Johnson was at the station I asked for his delivery tickets, and he gave me two, one to Mr. Amos, for thirty sacks of flour, and the other to Mr. Dyer, for one sack of meal—the wagoner is bound to have a delivery ticket with every parcel of goods de<lb></lb>livered to him—Onions had been a customer of Mr. Carpenter's several years</p>

               <p>ago, bat at this time he was not trusted with goods, he had to pay the money beforehand—he paid ready money, and took the goods away with him—the delivery tickets are given from the counting-house—when a person gives orders for floor, he goes to the counting-house, and a delivery-ticket is made out, and the wagoner is charged with it, and has the ticket—there is no mode of taking out flour without a delivery-ticket made out from the counting-house—both the prisoners were aware of that—when I sent the wagon home I told Bell, the boy who was with me, to follow the tail of the wagon, so that he could swear that nothing was taken out of it; and when I got home to the mill I counted and found thirty-one sacks of flour in it, and one of meal, in<lb></lb>cluding the one Onions had had, and which was put back again.</p>

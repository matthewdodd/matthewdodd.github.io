            . I keep a chandler's shop, in Widegate-alley, Bishopsgate-street. On the 1st of June, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, the female<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300118"></xptr>prisoner came and asked for half a quartern loaf - I was at the back part of the shop; my wife gave her the loaf, which came to 4d. - she offered a base shilling; my wife took it up, and said, "This is bad," and returned it to her - the prisoner put it into her mouth, and said it was bad, that she knew where she took it, and would go back, to see if they would change it; she went out, leaving the loaf behind - I followed her, and in Bishopsgate-street, she went up to the male prisoner, who was standing at the corner of Widegate-street, looking up the street, the way the woman was coming down; they joined - I was three or four yards off, and could not hear their conversation; I saw the hand of one go to the other - something appeared to pass from the woman to the woman; they then turned towards Bishopsgate church - I followed, and in the pursuit they stopped and conversed two or three times in the space of a hundred yards; they stopped again at the end of Rose-alley, and just at that time Sapwell came by - we followed them up Rose-alley, to the Rose public-house - they stopped at the door; Sapwell directly caught hold of Edwards' hand - he 
               <persName id="t18310630-255-person1849">drew</persName>
             a shilling from it, and said, "This is a bad shilling, we will take them into the house, and search them further;" I had taken the woman - we took them into a room at the Rose; Sapwell took Edwards to a table to search him - a good shilling and some coppers were found on him; Sapwell then said to the woman, "Come, let me search you;" she said she would not be searched by him, but he caught hold of her, drew her to the table, and just at the place where she stood, I saw something white - it might be two or three feet from where Edwards was searched; I got another light, stooped down, and picked up a piece of cloth; it felt heavy, and was just twisted round, not fastened - I handed it to the officer, and saw it opened; it was ten base shillings, which Sapwell took charge of.</p>

               <p>Eastbrook. Q.They were as near the young man as me? A. No; I think they were three feet from where he had been - he did not pass her; Sapwell took him to the right - if any thing had passed from her to the man, in the house, I think I must have observed it.</p>
               <p>Edwards. Q. Did you not swear before the Alderman that it was the shilling which Eastbrook had offered your wife? A. No; I said I could not tell.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q.Where were you? A. At the back of the shop; I could not see what she tendered, but heard what passed.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL. I am a constable. I was on duty; Skinner came to me between nine and ten o'clock, and I watched the prisoners into Rose-alley - at the door of the Rose I ran up, seeing them close together, and took a counterfeit shilling from Edwards' hand; I marked it - this is it; I took them into the parlour, and on Edwards found a good shilling and 2d. or 3d. - I put it on the table, and he made a scramble for it, saying, "Don't take my money;" Eastbrook was standing just behind me - Skinner said, "Here is something down here," and picked it up - it contained ten bad shillings; I do not think there were three yards space between us all - we were pretty close together; on the way to the Compter Eastbrook said, "The shilling found in the man's hand, was the shilling which he gave to me."</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN FIELD. I am an inspector of counterfeit coin. This shilling is counterfeit, and cast from Britannia metal; the other ten are also counterfeit, and the whole eleven are cast in the same mould.</p>
               <p>Eastbrook delivered in a written defence, stating, that the male prisoner had given her the shilling to purchase him a loaf, and at the public-house had contrived to throw the 10s. down near her.</p>

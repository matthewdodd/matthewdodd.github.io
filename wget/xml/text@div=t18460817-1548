                  </hi>. I live at No. 17, Joseph-street. About three weeks ago Thomas Alexander Bartlett was playing at a game called "Pussey-cat"—that is done with a bit of wood, and a stick, with two points to it, and you hit it as it is up in the air—I and his eldest brother were playing at peg-top—I saw the wood go up against the prisoner's hoop-sticks—the prisoner came out of his door, and hit Bartlett on the head with his open hand—the boy ran away, and the prisoner ran after him, and hit him with his double fist under his right jaw, and knocked the left side of his head up against the brick wall, and then left him—the boy tumbled down, got up again, and went in doors—I and his brother went in with him to his father's house—his brother had picked him up and we helped him home—he went to bed.</p>

On the 26th of June 1 was in my house, and heard a scream of a little boy—I went to the door, and saw the prisoner running after the deceased, and when near the middle of the railway arch, he struck him twice under the right ear with his fist—I cannot positively say whether his head struck against the wall—the prisoner's fist was clenched—he struck him twice before he fell—the boy got up by himself, and walked by himself to his father's house—nobody assisted him—I saw him go in by himself—the prisoner went away as soon as he had struck him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe he has complained of the annoyance of the boys? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—he never complained to me—he has complained of boys occasionally, and men and women as well—he appears to be a very quarrelsome man—he is constantly quarrelling with people about—he has not quarrelled with me—I did not take a young man out, and want him to fight with him—I did not go to his house, with a young man, to challenge him to light—I never knew any one challenge him to fight—I do not recollect going to his house with a man—I have been to his house—I never instructed any roan to fight him, or him to fight the person I brought—I never heard of such a thing—I cannot tell you the man's name—I cannot undertake to swear it never happened—it might have occurred, but I cannot call to mind any thing of the sort—I know that he has fetched a policeman several times to keep the boys from his premises—he was very ready to fetch a policeman—he did not fetch one that day that I know of—when the child went in doors I went in myself—I have three young children, who play about—the prisoner has complained of my children—they are mere babies—he has told me about the children going round his house, and playing before his door-be did not like it—he did not like any children—I never had any particular dispute with him—my husband has disputed with him several times, but not me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ropemaker, and live at 15, Joseph-street. Thomas Alexander Bartiett, my son, was eight years old last Jan.—on the 20th of June, I came home, and saw him—he had a cold, but was not very ill—I went away about half-past four o'clock—I gave him some cooling medicine the next day, Sunday, the 21st—Mr. Clealand attended him a fortnight afterwards, and after<lb></lb>wards a person named Hawkins—he remained in the house from the 20th of June up to the time of his death—he was not kept to his room—he went about the house—he was treated as a person with a violent cold—on the 21st of June I went out, and saw a man named Brown, who told me something—the prisoner was in the street, but did not hear it—I saw the prisoner im<lb></lb>mediately after—I told him I understood he had misused one of my chil<lb></lb>dren last evening, and begged him not to do it again; if he had any com<lb></lb>plaint <hi rend="italic">to make</hi>, to make it to me, and I would correct him—he said he should do no such thing; he had done it, and would do it again—Mr. Haw<lb></lb>kins attended my son till his death, which was on the 11th of July.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at 36, Collet-place, Commercial-road. On Thursday, the 9th of July, I was called to attend Thomas Alexander Bartiett—I found him labouring under excessive fever—he was in a <hi rend="italic">comatose</hi> state, insensible—he could not put out his tongue when asked—he died on Saturday morning—his symptoms were those of pressure on the brain—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, with the assistance of Mr. Hayes—there were no external marks or bruises on the head—there were some marks which we could not say were bruises—on removing the scull-cap, there were two patches of effused blood; one, nearly the size of half-a-crown; it was extravasated blood, between the membranes and the brain; the second, was about the size of a sixpence; the vessels were generally congested, and we con<lb></lb>cluded that these effects could only be attributed to violence—their position did not enable me to judge where the violence might have been inflicted—any blow on the head might produce a rupture of the vessel—there had been time for any considerable signs of violence to have gone—we generally observe these symptoms to come on about a fortnight or three weeks after an injury—if a blow inflicted produced a bruise, that bruise would cause extra<lb></lb>vasation—there was time between the 20th, and the time I saw him, for the whole of the extravasation to be absorbed, and the bruise gone—we examined the stomach—the organs and the abdominal cavities were generally healthy—there was nothing at all in those regions to account for death—I attribute the death to the rupture of the vessel, and effusion of blood on the brain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> you will not undertake to say positively what caused the rupture of the vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—it is quite possible it might have been from violence, but I will not positively undertake to say it was—it is possible it might have been from other causes, but it is most improbable at that age—in some respects it depends ou the state of the vessels—in a high fever there might be rupture of a vessel—I found a general state of congestion ex<lb></lb>tending</p>

               <p>over the whole of the membranes of the brain—I should attribute that to the fever—there was very considerable fever, which is always the case in an injury of the brain—the vessels are so minute that the size of the ap<lb></lb>perture <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the rupture cannot be detected—it was <hi rend="italic">on the pia mater</hi>—we could not detect it in other places—I cannot say from what particular orifice the blood came—the vessels are so transparent that it is very difficult—the turgidity of the vessels extended over the whole of the membranes—they showed general vascularity—it is not common with infants in a state of fever to rupture a vessel of the brain—from fifty to seventy is a more likely age—I never knew it arise from fever in a child eight years old—it is possible—the two patches were both on the left side of the head, about the temple—a; violent blow under the ear, or any part of the head, might produce this injury:—a violent blow would rupture a vessel on the opposite side—falling with his, head against a wall might produce it—the only doubt I had was whether he might have fallen on the head—he could have got up and walked home after; such injuries—inflammation of the brain frequently does not come on for two or three weeks—my attention was called to it by sleepiness and fever.</p>

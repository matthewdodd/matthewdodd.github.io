                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Borough. The prisoner was engaged as porter in my house, by my traveller, about the beginning of June—on the 20th of June I purchased six pieces of lawn at Messrs. Lainson's, in Bread-street—they were deposited in the warehouse—I repeatedly missed goods, and on the 17th of July this one was pawned at a pawn<lb></lb>broker's in the New Cut, it is mine—the selling mark has been rubbed out with india-rubber, but they have left the other mark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. Last Tuesday afternoon, at half past four o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming past Newington gate—I had had information from Mr. Brooks that he wished to take him again—I took him—he said, "What is this upon—is it for Mr. Brooks?"—I said, "I believe it is"—he said, "I do not care about that—I have been tried and acquitted about that"—I said, "Do you know that Goodman is at home?"—he said, "There is nobody can hurt me but the boy Goodman"—I said, "You must have had some transactions with him"—he said, "That is to myself."</p>

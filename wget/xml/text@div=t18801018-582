                  </hi>. I reside at 7, Monmouth Road, and am now the proprietor of a licensed billiard-room there—up to the end of March this year it was carried on as a limited company, duly registered in pursuance of the Joint Stock Companies Acts—the club was formed in March, 1877—they were large premises—it was closed when I took it; it had never been opened; I believe it was built for a public-house—I was the manager of the institution during the time it continued a limited</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188010180059"></xptr>
               <p>company—I was the holder of 35 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. shares, 30 in the first place and five afterwards, fully paid up—I furnished the money and laid it out for fitting up the club, for and on behalf of the company; the capital was not sufficient—I expended in the first instance 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., altogether over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as the thing went on and the requirements became more—my attention was called to an article in the <hi rend="italic">Bayswater Chronicle</hi> of 15th March, 1879, commencing, "But there are one or two so-called clubs in Bayswater of the very worst kind;" it refers to my club—my attention was also called to further numbers of 5th April, 17th May, 24th May, and 31st May, 1879; also to 24th January and 3rd April, 1880—in my opinion those articles refer to me and to the management of the club. (<hi rend="italic">These articles in general terms described the club as a gambling hell, where play was carried on to a late hour and also on Sundays, and that it was an institu<lb></lb>tion most pernicious to the neighbourhood.</hi>) The club was closed on 31st March; the effect of these articles was such that members ceased to come—in the previous two years, up to 15th March, the club was going on favourably, and I believe it would ultimately have been a paying concern, but from March, 1879, new members became fewer and old members fell off—I attribute that to these articles, damaging myself and the place generally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known Mr. Rice some years, perhaps 10 or 12—he is clerk to Mr. Johnson the solicitor—he witnessed the signatures when the club was started—before going into this speculation I did not inquire whether a licence had been refused; I did not consult Mr. Johnson then, I did Mr. Rice; I had heard that a licence had been refused, but I did not know anything of the facts—I have sometimes been in the habit of attending races and betting; that was not my occupation up to the formation of this company—I never made a book at that time—I had money; I had previously been in business, but I had no occupation at that time; I lived private—the persons forming the company were myself; my brother Albert Copping, who had 10 shares; Richard Cutler, of Barnes, a gentleman, one share; Henry Batten, a gentleman living privately, two shares; William Ellison, gentleman, 42, Park Road, one share; George Henry Bacchus, one share; and Charles Barnett, 41, High Street, one share—that was all the com<lb></lb>pany; seven, holding 51 shares—there were never any more—there was no banking account, not collectively; I had one—I kept a receipt and counterfoil book—there were subscribers as distinguished from share<lb></lb>holders—this is one of the books; this is only this year's; there was another which was filled up—I don't know what has become of that; the place was closed, and it was mislaid—this is the only one I have—I did not take any dividend on my 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not pay any dividend—the original subscription was intended to be a guinea—I afterwards reduced it to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 7th March, 1878—it was not brought down to 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the purpose of getting Whitley's shop boys in—the article of 15th March is not distinctly personal to myself, nor that of 5th April—ecarte was played at the club; bets were made on the players—I have seen gold on the table—I could not say that I have seen notes—play has been carried on all night, a few times—there was a fine for late hours—I have not gone round with a plate called "Kitty" at 2 o'clock in the morning requesting contributions, more from winners than losers—I have said "Gentlemen, the time is getting late, you will have to pay the fine for late hours," with a view of inducing them to go—they went on playing after paying the</p>

               <p>fine—drinks were sold—I don't know that the plate was called "Kitty"—I did not call it so—I have heard them say "Here comes Kitty"—after that contribution I served drinks, and charged for them; very little champagne, beer and claret; not much grog, principally beer—the profits from the drinks were applied to the purposes of the club generally, rent and other purposes—my salary as secretary and manager was 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I took that out of the takings; I had to live, with my wife and six children—my wife assisted me in the business—I make no complaint of the article on 10th May; it is untrue in a great measure; I don't mean totally untrue—there was billiard playing on Sundays for a few weeks; I could not say up to what hour—when they came in on Saturday night they did not stop the game as they would do now the place is licensed; they would beg to go on playing—I don't think they would play up to 11 o'clock on Sundays; we did not open till between 11 and 3 o'clock—ecarte and Nap was not played on Sunday nights—I strictly forbade it; I believe it was done on one or two occasions upstairs, not with my sanction—I don't know whether they played for money—I believe Nap was played for money—there were two billiard matches, and I believe the stakes were 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was between a gentleman belonging to the club and a member of another club; that was the only time I knew; it was a set match, quite a sensational affair—we had a rule that no game of chance was to be allowed—the directors were the committee of management—there was no screen put up to prevent people looking in—the windows were high, and the shutters shut on Sundays; I believe the entire article of the 17th May is copied from <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>, and also that of the 24th—I had no money to proceed against <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi>, or else I very likely should have done the same as I have in this case; I took counsel with my friends, and they said "Let it be, it will only be a nine days' wonder; it won't injure you in any way," and that was how we allowed it to go on; no doubt Mr. Labouchere could pay any damages; ho is a very rich man, they tell me—the paragraph headed "Dissipated Bayswater" on 31st May is a very unfair thing; they have cut out all the favourable parts and put in the worst—I never gave any champagne to any sergeant of police—the police were never supplied with drinks gratis, either by me or to my knowledge—the account of the fracas is false; a dispute did occur, but nothing was said about cheating—it is true that on 21st May, 1879, at 4.20 a.m., Herman Qpponheim and Frederick Milray were charged with stealing a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from the person of Richard Hutchinson at the club; but the man was not turned upside down, it was merely a dispute at the curd table; they were all three members of the club—I did not give Hutchinson 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to settle it, nor any money, or know of it being given him; the man was drunk, they were all more or less the worse for drink, they had been in town, and I begged the people not to play with him; he was a quarrelsome man—I took no stops to prevent the charge being heard before the Magistrate—I did not stop one of Mr. White ley's young man as he was going to the Court to give evidence, and tell him that I had given Hutchinson 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to stop the row, it is untrue—I never said that it was worth my while to give the money, as it would probably avoid having the club shut up—I don't know that Oppenheim did or did not give bills for card losses in the club, I have made one or two bets and sometimes played at ecarte and billiards with the members if no one else was there to play with them—I did not allow friends of members to order drink, prior to the first of these articles, we were very</p>

               <p>particular in that matter, there is a rule referring to it; there was a notice up from the commencement that members only were to pay—no appren<lb></lb>tices of Mr. Whiteley's came to the club that I know of; salesmen, about 30 I should think—5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was not taken from them for membership, I gave them a receipt when they paid their subscription—I did not know any one coming to the club who had the name of <hi rend="italic">Barnacle</hi>, there was a man named Shelstone who was a member only for a few days, who committed suicide, he never lost 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is one of the libels we hare omitted to charge, there are several that we have omitted—I have had several disputes with a man named Barker; he is not a betting man, he kept a mantle warehouse—I did not employ Mr. Rice to settle with him—there was an account between us, a balance was struck, and I paid him 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in full of all demands—I said at the police-court, "My complaint is that the articles reflect on the committee of management, not on myself personally," that was to some of the articles, but I think that was qualified—I never spoke to Mr. Walker but once, on a matter of business, with reference to an advertisement about the opening of the club—since this case has been sent for trial, and since the plea of justification, I may have said, "Bother the case, I wish I had never taken it on," on account of the worry and bother and anxiety—I said, "It is out of my hands, I am not finding the money for it"—since the committal the club has been fined 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the Magistrate, and there was nothing to pay the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with; I do not think it has been paid to this day—I was fined 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. last Satur<lb></lb>day, as manager and director; I have not paid it—I have no money, through these articles ruining me; I had a good balance since 1877, but now I am out of means—I do not sue Mr. Labouchere, I wish I had money to have a go at him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The proceedings of last Saturday had nothing to do with these libels, it was for not sending a return to Somerset House, it was a vin<lb></lb>dictive summons—I never was a bookmaker—the promoters of the club were respectable men, some of them are here—we had regular printed rules, and as far as I could I took every means to enforce their fulfil<lb></lb>ment—the first subscription was a guinea; 107 members were elected under that subscription, a great many more were elected, but 107 paid their entrance fee and were elected, being regularly proposed and seconded by members, and I was satisfied of their respectability; they were trades<lb></lb>men and people living in the neighbourhood—they used to come in at 11 or 12 in the morning to read the papers, and had whist parties in the evening, commencing about 6 or 7 o'clock, and a lot came in for social conversation, they had refreshments and smoked their cigars—about half the article in <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi> headed "Dissipated Bays water" is omitted in the <hi rend="italic">Bayswater Chronicle</hi>—I should think <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi> circulates very little in Bays<lb></lb>water; the <hi rend="italic">Bayswater Chronicle</hi> is much more extensively circulated in the immediate locality—there is not one word of truth in the insinuation that I have bribed a police sergeant or given him champagne, or done any<lb></lb>thing to induce him to give false testimony—the sergeant came to the club on one occasion shortly after it was opened, to see how it was conducted—I have never given any of the police champagne or any other refresh<lb></lb>ment as a bribe, that I swear—they could always have admission when they pleased, to see how the place was conducted, and they did come after wards in consequence of these libels and anonymous letters being circu<lb></lb>lated—I never heard of any complaint against me by the police—I believe</p>

               <p>Oppenheim has gone abroad, I don't know where Hutchinson is; there is no truth in saying that I gave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him—I believe Shelton committed suicide from something connected with a lady—I said before the Magis<lb></lb>trate, "The whole of the articles refer to the club, and were calculated to, and did injure me in my business as manager of the club," that is true—there were some members of the Jewish persuasion, and some foreigners; they desired to play billiards on Sunday, that was how it originated; it continued for about six weeks and was then put a stop to—the usual hour for closing was about 1 o'clock, or between 1 and 2 o'clock, not particular, sometimes I could not get them out—I have never seen as much as 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the table, I never heard of it—no one has ever complained to me of losing a large sum of money or of cheating.</p>

I am at present in Pentonville undergoing a sentence of five years' penal servitude, in reference to Mr. Whiteley, my master—I am 25 years of age—I first knew anything of the Monmouth Club at the latter end of 1877; I was then 23—I was an assistant at Mr. Whiteley's, behind the counter—I was introduced to the club by a man named Ingram—he was employed at Whiteley's; he gave evidence against me on my trial—I heard Ingram invite others at Whiteley's to join the club; on every occasion he tried to get members, but on one particular occasion I think 20 or 25 members joined in one night—some were younger than myself, some older; that was not in 1877—Ingraim canvassed for members—I did not pay any thing—I began to go there at the end of 1877; I became a member in 1878—before I was a member I did not pay for drinks; I went with Ingram generally, and he paid for them—when I became a member Ingram gave me a ticket—the entrance fee was supposed to be 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; that was not paid for me—from the time I became a member I was there nearly every night till I was taken into custody last May—sometimes I got there at 7, sometimes at 8; as a rule I generally got there about 8 or 9 o'clock—I slept on the premises at Mr. Whiteley's part of the time—we were required to be in at 11 o'clock, except on one night in the week, at 12 o'clock—I could have leave of absence on Sundays if I wished—I have stayed at the club sometimes till 12 or 2 o'clock, and up to 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning—my employers would not know but I had been sleeping on the premises—I have seen games of chance played; ecarte and Nap were the prin<lb></lb>cipal games, sometimes whist—I have seen money change hands—ecarte is played by two persons, others standing round and betting; that was the way it was carried on—the bets were nearly always put on the table, not in every instance—I have seen 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the table two or three times—I don't know in what position the parties were who were betting; I thought they were members of the club; I only knew them by seeing them there—some of them were Whiteley's men; not the actual players—they were young men—I had to be in business at 8 o'clock in the morning when I slept in the house, and at 8.30 when I slept out—I have many times gone without a night's rest, spending it at this club—the proceedings I have described have been going on all night—I have been present when billiards were played—I never saw any money staked on the billiards, and very seldom any betting—I have never seen money staked on horse-racing—betting used to take place on races—I remember the <hi rend="italic">fracas</hi> on 21st May, 1879—Hutchinson was about 35; I only knew him by seeing him there—Milray was about my age; Oppenheim was about 23 or 24—Hutchinson was sober that night; he was rather excited; he had drink there—he won the whole time he played till the row com<lb></lb>menced; he went on till he won about 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; they finished by staking 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time; they played at ecarte—he played with different persons—Oppenheim was the last—he won what money Oppenheim had, and to have his revenge Oppenheim played him again with borrowed money, and won all Hutchinson's money until it came to the last 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Oppenheim</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188010180064"></xptr>
               <p>won that, and Hutchinson said Oppenheim had played a wrong card—they played again, with the same result—there was a bit of a row, and Hutchinson lost the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—Milray held him, and some one took the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note out of his pocket—Copping was present; that was about 4 or half-past in the morning—he served drinks and took moneys—Hutchinson stood drinks round when he won—Davenport, Chraplin, Wilhelm, Jacobs, and Forsyth were present—they had what they liked to drink; I think there were one or two bottles of champagne—Hutchinson went out and returned with two constables, and gave Oppenheim into custody, and Milray was charged at the station—several of us went to the station—the two men were locked up—we were to go before the Magistrate at 10.30—as I was going I met Copping coming back, and he said the case had not come off; Hutchinson withdrew it and apologised, and he said he was obliged to square it with Hutchinson because it would not do to allow such a thing to appear in the papers after certain articles had appeared in some of the papers—he said he had given him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to square it—I said "In that case you ought to see Jacobs, as they all had the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they ought at least to give half;" he said "They would not give me a penny, they are Jews"—I have seen Oppenheim lose perhaps 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there—he told me he gave a bill—Davenport was a very good billiard player; I don't know what he was; he was always there—I think I nave seen his brother there once—I have seen Kennedy there several times; he was a regular frequenter till he left Bays water, and got a situation at the West-end; he was about 22—I have seen him backing, but never saw him playing—I did not know of any company—I have seen persons who were not members paying for drinks—I nave taken in friends who were not members, and they have paid for drinks—I re<lb></lb>member the Forsyths there; one was about 26, and the other about 32—I don't know what they were—the elder one was there always; he used to be sponging, as we called it, on anybody; I have lent him money he never seemed to have any himself—we used to call them the Bayswater Captains—I remember a man who went by the name of <hi rend="italic">Barnacles</hi>—I have seen him there a great number of times, principally in 1879, perhaps for two or three months—he was not employed at Whiteley's, to my knowledge—the night he committed suicide he was at the club playing ecarte; I understood that he lost—I have seen <hi rend="italic">Kitty</hi> go round about half-past 1; Mr. Copping, as a rule, passed it round, and you put in your shilling or sixpence, it all depended upon whether you had been winning or not; if he got enough by the collection the game would go on, and the betting and drinking too—I have been there on Sundays; I think the latest time I have stayed there on Sunday would be about 3 o'clock in the morning—I have left persons there then, card-playing, betting, and drinking—I have been there about half-past 11 on Sunday morning, just to have a liquor and come out again—I have played billiards—the 30 from Whiteley's paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. subscription, that was termed "Whiteley's price" on that particular night; the majority of those were young fellows like myself—as far as I know, there was no precaution taken to exclude strangers—a man named Cox frequented the club, he was a cashier at Whiteley's; I don't know where he is now, I have heard that he is abroad—Dauncey was another from Whiteley's; he left, I don't know where he went—Mayhew was at Whiteley's; he did not pay for his ticket; I don't know what has become of him; a man named Campbell</p>

               <p>was always there; I believe he had a little money; he lost it all—alter Oppenheim and Milray were taken into custody the number of persons frequenting the club fell off very much—I knew two young men there named Fuller and Hatton; I think they were medical students—I have seen them win and lose money—I knew Forteseue, Littlewood, and Wilson, they were at Whiteley's; they Were convicted at the same time I was—I did not know Snooks; I hare heard the name—I knew Jacobus—I might know Marsden by sight, not by name.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before I went to Whiteley's I was with Goode and Gainsford in the Borough, nearly four years; then I went to Whiteley's in February, 1875—I did not join this club till 1877—I had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year in salary and premiums, with board and lodging—before I joined the club I used to spend my evenings principally in the neighbourhood of Bayswater—I used to go into public-houses with friends, but never spent the whole evening there—I very seldom went to music-halls—I did very little betting, not the first part of the time. I was at Whiteley's; I think at the Derby of 1877 was the first time, that was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I lost it—I know George Harrow, a bookmaker; I betted with him to the extent of a sovereign in 1878—after I joined club I made several bets at various places, not at the club, but meeting bookmakers at the club I became acquainted with others outside—perhaps I have lost 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by betting in the last three or font years: those bets were on horse races—I paid those bets by robbing my employer—I was charged with conspiring with others to do so—Ingram introduced me to the club; I could not say whether he paid for me—I have played ecarte there; I never saw the game before—I have lost between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one night there; that was the most I have lost at one time; the most I ever won was 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. one night; I did not play every night—I left Whiteley's in 1878—I had lost 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on races before I joined the club—no one was present when I had the conversation with Copping about squaring Hutchinson with 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made that state<lb></lb>ment to a gentleman who came to see me; he told me I might be brought here as a witness—the payments to <hi rend="italic">Kitty</hi> were not as a fine for late hours; Mr. Copping would say "Now, gentlemen, <hi rend="italic">Kitty</hi>, the time is so and so, I am not going to stop up all night for you fellows playing"—there were several Jewish members, and foreigners—I could not say for how long the club was kept open on Sundays; it was much longer than five or six weeks; it was only shut while the public-houses were closed—I never heard that it was the Jews and foreigners who desired to have it open on Sundays for play, in that ease they mast all have been of the same persuasion—it was open for card-playing and billiards, if you chose to play, after 6 o'clock, up to the time I was arrested; I have played billiards on Sunday—I pleaded guilty to the charge of robbing Mr. Whiteley—I did not attribute it to having lost money on horse-racing, I attributed it to being led away, principally by Ingram; he was the first man that induced me to rob Mr. Whiteley; it was solely through him; he suggested it to me; he told me that he had got his money by robbing Mr. Whiteley—I said nothing about Ingram or the club at the time I was convicted—I did not say anything about betting on horse-racing; I said I was led away by bad company and late hours—I did not rob my master before I joined the club.</p>

I know Johnson, I have heard what he has stated about champagne being given to Eccles, there is not the slightest; truth in it—on no occasion have I drunk with Eccles or he with me—I know Jabloniski; he never said to me, "What were you giving that fellow champagne for?"—I swear positively that I did not say to him, "That bottle of champagne is not thrown away"—I swear I have never given champagne to any constable—I heard the convicts examined yesterday; their general statement is altogether incorrect—I did not know them and they did not know me; one said that he had only been there once—it is not true that I refused them admittance after I found out who they were.</p>

I was a member of the club from its commencement, I used to go there three or four times a week—I have been there as late as 2 o'clock, but I generally left at 11 or 11.30—I used to play at whist for nominal stakes, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a game—I met no one there answering the description of beardless youths or shop boys, or blacklegs or swindlers; I met my fellow-tradesmen—I did not see any particularly young men, some were 20 or 25; as far as I saw the club was carried on in a respectable way—I have never seen money played for to any extent—I have not been requested to go when I stayed late—I do not know of</p>

I am a private gentleman, of 5, Gloucester Terrace, Kensington—I joined the Monmouth Club in January, 1879, and visited it four or six times a week—I played at whist and billiards—I know most of the members; they are tradesmen in the neighbourhood—I played at whist with them—the stakes were 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a game—I left at all <hi rend="italic">times; the latest was 2.30, or later occasionally when I had been out to</hi> parties—I never saw piles of gold on the table, or gambling for high stakes—I have often heard Mr. Copping ask the members to leave at 12 or 1 a.m., and after a great deal of persuasion they have left, but very often they have stopped in spite of what he said; we were all to blame, I think, by stopping—the club was well conducted, as far as I saw, most decidedly.</p>

            . I live in King-street, Southwark. On the 8th of September, about one o'clock in the morning, I was in <placeName id="t18341016-159-crimeloc852">Cheapside, near Foster-lane</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. You swear you saw the watchman take it from her hand? A. I do positively - it had three sovereigns in it before, and they had been taken out - in going to the watch-house, she dropped the sovereigns - the watchman picked them up - I heard more than one fall from her - the watchman could only find two - I heard them fall from her - I had about 4l. when I came from home, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - I am employed in the City - I met her soon after one o'clock in the night - I had been to the Albion Tavern, and dined with about 120 gentlemen - I had very little wine, and was as sober as I am now - I went to the watchhouse - I did not charge the watchman with taking one of the sovereigns; nor any one else - I said there were three sovereigns taken from me - I saw I had three sovereigns and a half and a little silver safe at the Albion - I was not two minutes with the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a constable of Aldersgate-street. The prisoner was brought to the watchhouse between one and two o'clock in the morning - the prosecutor charged her with robbing him - I found nothing on her - the watchman handed me the purse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prosecutor quite sober? A. He seemed very talkative - I presume he had been drinking - he talked rational enough - I should say he was the worse for liquor - the prisoner appeared quite delirious when I told her the situation she was in - she said, "Oh my child" - there was a half-sovereign in the purse - I asked the prosecutor what he had been robbed of - he said, three sovereigns more - I said, "Who has got them?" - Martin said, "I have one, and Vine has got the other" - the money was produced, and I had it marked - Vine is a watchman - he is not here.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I took the prisoner, and on her person I found the purse containing the half-sovereign - in taking her to the watchhouse, some sovereigns dropped behind her - Vine picked up one - nobody could have dropped it but her - I swear she dropped it - I took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there another watchman with you at the time? A. Yes; I saw her drop the sovereigns behind her - one watchman was on each side of her - we each had hold of her arms - she put her hand behind her and dropped them - I took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The watchman swears falsely - he did not take the purse out of my hand - he told the constable of the night that he found it on the pavement.</p>

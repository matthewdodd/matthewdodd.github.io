                  </hi>. I am an oilman, and live at Camberwell. On the 21st of Oct., I was in the New Kent-road—the prisoner accosted me—I have no doubt she is the person—I did not want to say anything to her—she put her arms round me, and I felt her hands in each of my trowsers' pockets—I had a frock coat on, but it was open—she took her hands out of my pockets and ran away—I directly felt that she had taken my purse out—I caught her shawl, and said, "Stop a minute"—she ran off, and left her shawl in my hand—I hallooed out, and two gentlemen and a policeman came up—I had in my pocket a diamond, a ruby, and a purse with 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—my trowsers were rather low down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty about two o'clock that morning—I had seen the prisoner on the road several times that night previously, and about two minutes before the robbery, I saw her speak to the prosecutor—I went on about forty yards—I then saw her run down Lyon-street, and saw the prosecutor with this shawl lying at his feet—I know the shawl—I had seen the prisoner wearing it often, and had seen it on her not two minutes before—I went to her</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gold dial painter, of 3, Percival-street, Clerkenwell. Early on Sunday morning, 21st Sept., about I o'clock, I was in the Lower-road, Islington—I was rather the worse for liquor—I could walk, see, and understand—one of the prisoners came up to me, and asked me for some halfpence for some beer—I gave him some, and he left me—I am sure it was one of the prisoners, but cannot say which—I turned down Duncan-street, to avoid going past the Angel, at Islington; and had not proceeded many yards before the prisoners came up behind me, caught hold of me by my shoulders, and round my body and arms, and put their hands in my trowsers pockets—I turned round and struggled with them—I knocked one of them down; I cannot tell which—I then called out "Police!" and was knocked down—they did not get the money from my trowsers pocket, because I doubled myself up and prevented them—I had a ring on the third finger of my left hand; they cut the finger it was on in endeavouring to get it off; they did not get it—the police came up and the pri<lb></lb>soners ran away—the policeman ran past me—the prisoners were all brought back in a minute by the police—I am quite sure they are the same men.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where had you been to? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the Southgate-road, to a friend in New market-terrace—I was tipsy—I cannot swear which of them it was spoke to me in the Lower-road, but I am positive it was one of the three, because he had hardly got out of my sight—I am sure there were more than two—there was one on each side, and one in front, who was trying to get the ring off; I cannot tell which that was, it was dark, and I was struggling with them—the one who I threw down was brought back covered with dirt—I think it was James I threw down, but cannot positively swear—there is a mark on my finger, which shows when my hand is cold.</p>
               <p>

               <p>you see the faces of all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and I could see the faces of the men the police brought back, I believe they were the same three.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">James. Q.</hi> I should like to know if you can positively swear to me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I would not swear positively—I threw the man down in Duncan-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="largeCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you are sure these are the three men; which was the man who stood in front? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The furthest one, Low; he had hold of my arm, trying to get the ring off—I have not the least doubt of him—I had not known him before—there were gas-lights in Duncan-street—the policeman brought them back almost immediately; but I am certain of them from observation of their faces at the time.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">DANIEL WRAIGHT</hi>(<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 159). On Sunday morning, 21st Sept., I was on duty in Vincent-street, near Duncan-street and the Lower-road—I heard a cry of "Police!" three times in Duncan-street—I went there, and saw the three prisoners and Blackwell <hi rend="italic">ruffling</hi> up against the wall, all strug<lb></lb>gling together—one of the three knocked Blackwell down; I ran up imme<lb></lb>diately, and they all three ran down Duncan-mews—I ran after them sixty yards—Schofield, another policeman, bad them—I assisted in taking them back to the prosecutor; he looked at them, but did not say any thing, nor did he at the station—he did not say whether they were the men or not—I did not ask him—I knew the prisoners before, and am certain the three men Schofield had were the three I had seen <hi rend="italic">ruffling</hi> with the prosecutor—I found 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence, and a knife, on Powell; and on James a knife; and on Lowe, one shilling—the prosecutor was drunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How far were you from them when they were <hi rend="italic">ruffling</hi> together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About sixty yards—it was a dark night—I could see them, and am sure the prisoners are the men—Powell was not out of my sight; the other two were.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 121). I was on duty in Duncan<lb></lb>mews, and saw the three prisoners running from the prosecutor—I heard a cry of "Police!" and stopped them—I asked them what they had been doing, they made no answer—I took them into custody, and gave one of them to Wraight, and we went back to the prosecutor, who said they were the three men who ran from him—I had seen Low five minutes before, at the entrance of Duncan-street—he asked me where he could go to ease himself—I told him to go down the mews, on the opposite side of the road; not the mews I do duty in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You brought these boys up to where the other con<lb></lb>stable was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The constable followed them down; we both took them back to the prosecutor—Wraight was with me then; he was close behind me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How far were you from where the prosecutor was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Forty yards, in a straight direction—I could see him; he was lying on the ground, at the entrance of a gateway—I did not lose sight of them till they got to me—they ran alongside an omnibus, and I caught them in my arms, and kept them till my brother constable came up—I gave him one, while I kept the other two.</p>

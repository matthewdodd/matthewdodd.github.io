            . I live in Closeall-court, Barbican. In August last, I got my husband's watch out of pawn, and met the prisoners in White-cross-street - they had lodged with us - they asked me to go and drink, I said I was in a hurry, for I had been redeeming my husband's watch; they pressed me, and I went to a public-house, and had two glasses of rum and water, and called for a third. I paid 1 s. for it, and said, when the last glass was drank I should go - Mrs. Rowley said, it was a long time since we had met, and I need not hurry - another glass, and a fifth was called for. I was getting very sleepy, as I had been up all night - another glass was brought. I said,</p>
               <p>"This is too much, we don't want it." I had not got much money, and gave my husband's watch to the landlord to take, instead of money, and said, I would call in the morning for it, but Rowley would not let me - he paid for it - I laid my head down, and fell asleep - Mrs. Rowley awoke me, saying, the house was going to be shut up - they both came home with me, and sat for an hour, and, when I undressed, I missed the watch, and found my purse in my pocket, but empty. I had 29 s. 6 d. in it - my husband's name is on the watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you not been to some other public-houses before you went to this - A. No; I was quite sober when I went in - I was not over and above drunk; I was very heavy and sleepy I did not offer the landlord the watch to pawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Why offer it, when you had so much money - A. I did not want to own to my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the landlord send his servant to see you part of the way home - A. No; I drank my share of four glasses, but none of the fifth.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met the prisoners, did they not take you out of a mob, and bring you into this house, to save your life - A. No; I was in no row. I did not give Mrs. Rowley the watch to pawn.</p>

I met this woman in Golden-lane, quarrelling with another - I got her out of the mob, took her into the public-house, and she gave me the watch to keep for her, and in a few minutes asked me for it again, and after that, she went out with my wife - I do not know what we drank, for I fell asleep.</p>

They drank four or five glasses of rum and water in my house.

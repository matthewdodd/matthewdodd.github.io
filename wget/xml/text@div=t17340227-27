               <p>Hugh Hughs. The Prisoner and I both liv'd in the House of Mr. Westfield, a Sugar-baker. The Prisoner had been there 7 Weeks, he lay in the same Room, but not in the same Bed, with me. On Friday, the 15th of this Month, he got up by 5 in the Morning, and went away. Soon after he was gone I found my Wig box empty; my Trunk was broke open and I miss'd 2 Shirts and a Bag, in which there was a Gold-ring, 10 Guineas, and 7 s. - He was taken the same Night with one of my Shirts upon his Back, and but one Guinea, and 6 d. left in his Pocket.</p>

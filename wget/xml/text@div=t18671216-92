               <p>witness Dear—I had a hare in my hand—the prisoner and another named Webb came in after we had been there about ten minutes—the prisoner said, "You have got a hare there, governor"—I said, "Yes, I have"—he said, "Did you catch it?"—Dear made answer and said "No, he bought it"—the prisoner looked round at Dear and said, "You, you b----, you don't know how to catch a hare"—I asked my friends whether they would leave; I did not like the way in which they were speaking; I said, "We will get out of this as soon as we can"—as we were going out of the door Dear said, "Perhaps I could catch one as well as you if I had the chance"—we then left—I went out first, about half a second before my friends; they came directly almost, it might be half a minute or so, and we all three went straight across from the Swan to the Bridge Road, to the left-hand side of the road, to the corner of a small shop there, I should think about forty-five yards from the Swan—we stopped talking there; it might have been ten minutes—I bade them good night, and had got a few yards from them when I saw the prisoner and Webb in front of me—they came straight across from the Swan to the corner where we were standing—Thompson was on the right-hand side of Webb—they were on the path crossing the road when I first saw them, coming towards me—Thompson said to Webb, "That is one of the b----s, let them have it"—I was knocked down directly by a blow on the face from Webb—I got up again directly and said to Webb, who was standing in front of me, "You have made a mistake, governor, I have never insulted you in any way"—I was knocked down again directly—I don't know which of them knocked me down the second time; I can't say whether it was either of them; there was no other person present at the time—I don't know what took place afterwards, I was stunned—I could not say how long I remained so—when I came to myself I was looking for my hat—a policeman came up—some one told him I was one of the three that had been knocked about, and he said, "There is one dead; do you know it?"—I said, "No, I do not"—I went with the police to the hospital, and there saw the deceased.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a millers labourer, and live in Rose Gardens, Hammersmith—ou Saturday night, 23rd November, I was in the Bridge Road, Hammersmith, about twenty minutes past twelve—I had just left off work, and was coming home—as I was passing across the Broadway I saw two men fall down—I went up to them, and there were three lying on the ground when I got up to them—there were five or six persons there, or something like that, when I got up—I saw Thompson and Webb—I heard Thompson say, "You have been trying to kick up a piece of work with me all night, "alluding to the three men—I did not see him point to them, I was looking at the poor fellow that was lying down—I saw blood on the deceased running down his trousers—he seemed quite dead.</p>

Shortly after twelve on Saturday night, 23rd November, I was in the Broadway, Hammersmith—a boy came and fetched mo to the corner of the Bridge Road, Broadway—I saw a crowd of about twenty or thirty persons—I passed into the middle of the crowd, and there saw the deceased lying on his back—he appeared to be dead when I turned my light on—one of the witnesses called my attention to the prisoner—he was walking away, about twelve or fifteen yards from where the deceased was lying—I went after him, and told him to</p>

On Saturday night, the 23rd November, at ten minutes past twelve, I was on duty at the Bridge Road, Hammersmith—I saw the man lying on the pavement, and I saw the prisoner there—another constable, who was with me, went and fetched him back—Mr. Melville pointed him out, and told us to fetch him back to detain him—I took him to the station—I asked him if he had a knife—he said he had—he took this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his right-hand waistcoat pocket—it was clasped as it is now—I opened it, and found blood on the blade—I showed it to the sergeant—it was quite damp—he wanted the knife back again—I heard him say they had been kicking up a row with him all the night.</p>

About half-past twelve on Saturday night, 23rd November, I was at the police-station, Brook Green, Hammersmith—the prisoner and another man were brought in, accompanied by a number of persons—they were afterwardt identified by the witness Collins, and were charged with killing and slaying Frederick George James, by stabbing him in the breast with a knife—when Collins, and Fitch came in I asked them to point out the man that had committed the deed—they looked round the charge-room, and pointed out Thompson and Webb—they said they were present during the assault—Collins also complained of being assaulted—after the charge was read over to them, Thompson said, "They had been annoying us all night"—Webb said, "I was there with my mate; I know nothing about it"—I ordered them to be searched, and last witness handed me this knife—it had marks of blood on both sides of the blade, and on the haft—it was quite damp—I might say wet—I said, "This blood is quite fresh on the knife"—the</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the West London Hospital, Hammersmith—on Saturday night, 23rd November, I was at the hospital at twenty-five minutes past twelve, when Policeman Haydon, 329, and a crowd of persons, brought in the deceased—he was just alive—I saw him breathe once—his under-shirt and flannel shirt were saturated with fluid blood—I examined his body—I found an external wound over the region of the heart, and the surface of the chest and abdomen were smeared with blood—the wound was an inch in length—this knife, if used with violence, might produce such a wound—it is not a very sharp knife, but if driven with sufficient violence it would easily make that wound—it was over five inches in depth—the external wound was over the region of the heart, but it penetrated into the cavity of the right ventricle of the heart—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found that the wound penetrated the wall of the chest in the space between the fourth and fifth rib—the wound in the heart was the cause of death—I remarked at the time I first saw the wound, that the lower angle of it was not so acute as the upper angle, consequently I thought it had been done with a knife with only one edge to it, which edge had gone uppermost—that corresponds with this knife—the upper border of the cartilage of the rib was notched, proving that great violence had been used—the knife had partially divided the cartilage of the rib, which is a dense structure—I found a slight bruise on the lip, which might have been done by the teeth—there was no mark on the face beyond that, no bruise, or anything, nor anything about the knuckles or hands, or anything else to show that there had been a fight, or anything of that kind—the deceased was a very fine fellow, a very square-built man, and I remarked at the time, although the body was very pallid from the amount of blood that had been lost, the left side of the chest was full of blood, and the heart too—his clothes were saturated—I saw the witness Melville—I could not say whether he came with the body—I think he came after—I saw him there, and he looked at the body.</p>

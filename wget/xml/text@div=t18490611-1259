                  </hi>. I am a student at law—I live with my mother Mary Buchanan Mansfield, who is a widow, and lives at 51, Grosvenor-street—the prisoner was butler in her service for four or five months—she was about to discharge him—I was present on Thursday, 17th May, when she told him to be ready to give up the plate at six o'clock that day—he was to go as soon as he had given it up—he went away without giving it up—I examined the plate that afternoon—I missed a pair of sugar-tongs, twenty. eight spoons, a cup and cover, a kettle, and a great many other things—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody at Vine-street—I received one letter from him, and my mother received one—they are signed by him, but I do not believe they are his handwriting—these articles produced are my mother's—her house is in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square—it is her dwelling-house.</p>

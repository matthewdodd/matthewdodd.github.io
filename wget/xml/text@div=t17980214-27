               <p>Q.Could it have fell out of the waggon? - A.No; it was so placed that it could not, without somebody had moved it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Matthews. Q. Where was this box placed? - A.Upon the fore-part of the waggon, at the top of the flour; I had put it there in the morning.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Was it a tilted waggon? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p> - LEVERTON sworn. - On the 5th of February, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was walking through Broad-court, at the west end, joining to Bow-street, and a waggon was passing by at that instant, I saw the prisoner close to the tail of the waggon falling, with the box, either upon his head or shoulder; it did not occur to me that he had stole the box at that time, I supposed he might be some porter who had taken an opportuity of resting his box on the waggon a little; seeing him in that situation, I stopped in the middle of the street, and expressed my fears that he was hurt, as he had had a desperate fall, he was then lying upon the ground; he said he was not hurt, and immediately took the box upon his shoulder, he was going away with it up Hart-street, and immediately opposite the office-door belonging to the Theatre, the waggoner ran up to him, caught him by the collar, and said, you have stolen this box from my waggon; in consequence of the man making that declaration, I helped to detain him; the prisoner made great resistance, so much so, that his coat was nearly torn off; he said, he had found the box, and had not stole it; I insisted upon taking him into the office of the Theatre, when a constable was sent for from Bow-street, and he was taken there; when the waggoner gave the same evidence that your Lordship has heard this morning, and he was committed. (The box produced).</p>
               <p>Williams. This is the box, the direction upon it is in my own hand-writing; this bowl with a silver top, I remember very well; and this blue coat and waistcoat, and breeches, and the velveteen breeches, two shirts, velveteen coat, seal-skin waistcoat, and two whips; I am sure they are they same.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, My Counsel, I understand, is not here, or has not exerted himself, in defending me with respect to the charge laid against me.</p>
               <p>Court. You do yourself no credit by that observation, your Counsel has done all that could be done for you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Counsel has so far defended me I trust, as fully to satisfy your Lordship and this honourable Court, that I am innocent of the charge of felony; I do not pretend to say, contrary to truth, that I did not see the box, God forbid! I was coming down Broad-court that evening, on my way to St. James's market; I saw the box laying upon the causeway, and I took it up, as any innocent man might have done; my intention was no other than to take it to an adjacent house, and there advertize it for an owner.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

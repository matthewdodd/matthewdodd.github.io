            . About the 3d or 4th of December I missed two or three pieces of ribbon, which were taken out at the square of the window which was broke. My maid put a pocket handkerchief to that place, and tied a string to that, and the other end to the bell. On the next night but one, being Dec. the 10th, two or three little boys were drawing that handkerchief thro' the window, and the bell rang. We went out and took two of them, but neither of them the boy at the bar. They gave us intelligence where this boy's father and mother lived; then we took them before justice Welch, and they were discharged. On the Monday following we took this boy at the bar,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175801130014"></xptr> and he was committed to Bridewell; where he said he and his cousin had given the ribbons to a young girl, but we could never take that other boy. Two or three days after this the boy's mother told us she had seen the girl at the bar mother with some ribbons I went to her lodgings, and there I found about a yard of four different patterns of ribbons, all figur'd. This was in Brown's-Gardens, St. Giles's. The girl's mother said the girl had them in Covent Garden. We took up the girl, and she confessed she bought a great deal of ribbon of this boy at the bar for a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the boy ?</p>
               <p>H. Crossby. I am informed he is but nine years of age.</p>
               <p>Ann Davis. I am not thirteen years of age.</p>
               <p>As the boy was not capable of distinguishing between good and evil , so no felony, and if no felony no accessary, wherefore they were both <rs id="t17580113-15-verdict88" type="verdictDescription">

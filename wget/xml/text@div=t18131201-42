When I got into Lower Thames-street there were four or five men following me; it being a dark night I went down a turning to the boat, and went a little further than <placeName id="t18131201-42-crimeloc226">St. Mary's-hill</placeName>

They took from me my great coat, and at the same time picked my left hand inside pocket of my pocket-book, and a memorandum book. In my pocket-book were four one-pound notes. They pulled my bundle from under my left arm, and while I was striving to disengage myself three or four gentlemen came up, and one of them said the prisoner was the man.</p>

            . On Monday evening, the 29th of November, I was going along Thames-street, I saw three men at the bottom of a court; immediately after I saw a fourth man knocked down. There were two men with me. As soon as we saw the gentleman knocked down we went up to him, two of the men ran away, the third man was stooping over the gentleman, the prosecutor. On our nearly approaching, the third man ran away. I immediately said to one of the gentlemen, this man has been robbed. We immediately pursued the third man; he was stopped on St. Mary's-hill. I never lost sight of him; I saw him stopped; he was brought back, and nine one-pound notes were found upon him. I believe they belonged to himself. I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

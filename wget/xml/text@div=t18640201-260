On the morning of 19th of January, at half-past 1, I was on duty in Broad-street, St. Giles, and heard a cry of "Police"—I ran across immediately—I saw the prosecutor on the ground, and seven men running away up Dudley-street—I saw the prisoner; I pursued him up the left-hand side, and he ran across down White Lion-street, and ran into the arms of another constable, who caught him—I returned to the spot where I left the prosecutor—he was very much excited, and this waistcoat was torn off his back—it was picked up from the ground, and identified by him—he had been drinking—I took the prisoner to the station-house, and another constable brought the prosecutor—he said he had been roughly handled, and he could not identify the prisoner—he said he had lost seven shillings and sixpence, which those ruffians took away.</p>

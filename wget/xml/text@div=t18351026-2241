                  </hi>. I am an officer. On the 19th of Octo<lb></lb>ber, I went with Fogg to the prisoner's house, No.5, Pell-street, St. George's—we had information that he lived there—he was not at home—we found on the sideboard, in his front parlour, twenty-nine books, some of which have Mr. Dampier's name in them—we went down stairs, and found in a chest, in the kitchen, sixty-one books of a similar description, making ninety in all—we found up stairs, in the drawers, twenty-five towels, eighteen pillow-cases, seventeen sheets, nine petticoats, three night<lb></lb>caps, twenty-one shifts, seven pairs of drawers, and a few other trifling arti<lb></lb>cles—I remained in care of the property, and Fogg went out, and re<lb></lb>turned in about two hours with the prisoner—he said to his wife, "These gentleman have come after the things I bought"—Fogg told him to come down stairs, and he showed him the property—he said, "That is the pro<lb></lb>perty I bought of two Irishmen on the other side of the water, and gave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—I asked if he knew who the Irishmen were—he said no, he had never seen them before—the prisoner is a carpenter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames police-officer. I accompanied Evans to the prisoner's house—I had seen the prisoner at work at Mr. Mangles, as a joiner—I went to Shoreditch and found him at work—I had some conversation with him, but not relative to this—when I had got him into the street, I told him what I wanted him for—he asked who gave me the information—I told him Mr. Mangles' clerk, and we had been to his house, and found a great many books, and some wearing apparel, which had been stolen form Mr. Mangles' warehouse, where I had seen him at work—he said, "I must account for it; I bought it of an Irishman over the water, and gave 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it"—I said it was very heavy, had he bought it all at one time—he said no, at three different times, that there were two Irishmen who met in the same place, and he bought them in the street about six weeks before that—he had paid them part of the money then, and the rest about three weeks after—the man he had them of said he had them from a ship, and he was going away for about a fortnight, and he had not seen him since—there was a plane and an oil-stone there, which had Mr. Kidd's name on them—I asked him where he got them—he said he had them altogether.</p>

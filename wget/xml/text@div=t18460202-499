                  </hi>. I am an invalid, from the navy. On Sunday night, the 4th of Jan., I was at the Three Cranes, Brick-lane, in the forepart of the evening—I was afterwards at the Rose and Crown, in Wentworth-street—that must have been after eleven o'clock—I saw the prisoner there—I had no conversation with him—there was another man in company with him, who endeavoured to get me into conversation, and called me a b—liar once or twice, from answers which I gave him—I saw they wanted to pick a quarrel with me, and I drank my beer up, and asked the landlady to let me go out—she opened one half of the door, and as I was going out, the prisoner came and struck me a blow in my left cheek—I would have come in again if I could, but the landlady kept me out—I went across the street, and made water, and when I turned round, the prisoner was in front of the public-house door—I crossed the street to accost him for striking me in the face—he was on the pavement—I had no time to speak to him before he struck me on</p>

               <p>the forehead with a stick, which threw me forward—I cannot say whether he came to meet me—it is a narrow street—I had a blue cloth cap with a peak to it, which was knocked off my head—I did not fall down—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber receiving any other blows myself—I recovered my senses before I got to the station—a policeman had me in his arms, behind the prisoner—I was sent to the hospital that night—I was bleeding severely—I do not feel any injury from that blow, but I do from another on the joint of the jaw—I can scarcely eat—it is decreasing.</p>

I live in Keate-street, Spitalfields—on this Sunday night I was in Wentworth-street, outside the door of the Rose and Crown—I saw Adams come out of that house, and as he came out I saw the prisoner hit him with his fist once—Adams then went across the way—the prisoner stood outside the door during that time—Adams then came back again, and when he came as far as the pavement, the prisoner took the stick up, and hit him with it three times on the head and on the face—I saw the blood stream<lb></lb>ing down Adams's face—I did not see him strike or do anything to the pri<lb></lb>soner—I called the police.</p>

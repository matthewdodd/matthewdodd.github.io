He asked for a job; I said I thought I could give him one. We had a pint of beer together; he said he was apprenticed to the same master as myself. He promised to meet me next morning between ten and eleven o'clock; he came, and when I came from dinner about one o'clock, I missed these tools, which I had seen safe about eleven.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you agree to lend me tools at 4 s. a week - A. Never. I never knew him before. The saws are not mine.</p>

            . On the 1st of May, Wigley applied to me - I took the prisoner on the 2d of May, at his lodgings - he gave the pincers into my hand, and said he took the saw, and hoped Wigley would not prosecute him, and he would endeavour to make them good.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I borrowed the pincers of him, to do a job. I went home before twelve o'clock, and was not out afterwards. Next day he came to see if I was at home - I said I was, and in an hour he brought the officer; I immediately gave him the pincers, and said I had pawned two saws, alluding to two of my own.</p>

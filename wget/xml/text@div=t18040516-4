               <p>Q. Was the window put to, or only hasped? - A. There was no hasp at all to it, it is a small sash, it draws with a slide, I saw my husband put the sash to, it was only closed; I saw the prisoner put his head and arms in, and the moment I saw him I screamed out; I had seen him the same morning in the house, I know it to be the same face, I looked very stedfast at him, but the fright seized me much; he took nothing away from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your screaming out, what did he do? - A. He went to roll off from the tiles; he got up the shed and on the tiling, to get into my window; my husband got out of bed, and saw him roll off the tiles.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the Bear and Ragged-staff public-house, Whitecross-street: On the 7th of May, about half past eleven o'clock at night, I was in bed, my wife screamed out, Oh! Eldridge, here is a man coming in at the window; I immediately jumped out, and saw the prisoner go from the window, I knew his person before, I saw his body but not his face; I had suspicion before, and sat up on purpose on Saturday night to watch; a neighbour of mine told me, on Saturday the 5th, that he saw some persons of suspicious character about my house; I put my family to bed that night, there are two ways to my house, I shut up the house, and left the candle burning in the bar, and after shutting the front door, I went and walked in the street to see if any body went up; about half after one at night, I saw a man and a woman go up to the front of my house; I followed up, and saw the two prisoners close to the door; I said to them, what do you want here; I spoke to both of them; the man made answer, d - n it we only want a glass of gin; I said, you did not come after a glass of gin; the woman said, let us have a drop of gin; to have a better sight of them I went and unlocked the bar, and went into the bar, a misfortune happened, the candle went out; he said, governor, give me hold of the candle, I will get you a light; the prisoner Williams got me a light, and then I served them each with a glass of gin.</p>

               <p>Q. Having seen these prisoners so satisfactorily that night, can you say it was the prisoner at the bar that rolled off the tiles? - A. I saw them again on Monday morning; when the man rolled from the tiles, I put on my breeches, and went out immediately, I pursued them in the street; I saw the woman stand close by the tiles, she said, make haste, come along; the tiles broke where he rolled off, and one of the rafters gave way, and he fell; she said, get up, come along, make haste; I sleep in the front room, the house is back from the street, there is a shed on the right-hand side going up, at the front of the house, and any person getting on the tiles of that shed may easily get in, the window is not above a foot, or a foot and a half, from the top of the tiles; it is a sliding sash window, without any hasp.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down, you saw the two prisoners at the bar run away? - A. I did; I saw the man go first, and the woman follow; a neighbour of mine was coming up the gateway, he said to me, it is a tallish man, and a shortish woman.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw this neighbour of your's, the prisoners then had got out of sight? - A. They got out of the gateway over to Gloucester-court, I was as quick as possible, I was not above two minutes; I then ran after them, I went over to them, and catched him by the collar; he resisted very much, made use of very bad language; he swore to me, and said, you b - y thief, what did I want; I said, what did you want, getting in at my window; he tried to get from me, and dragged me near twenty yards to a corner of an alley; the woman stuck close to him, I did not observe her assist him in any thing; there were some women standing at the end of the alley, they said, that is the thief; a neighbour was coming by, his name is Prince, and the watchman came up, and we secured them both that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when you went to bed, whether there was any thing on this chest of drawers? - A. There was a gilt metal watch, and a parcel of halfpence in the room; near to the drawers there was a club-box containing twenty or thirty pounds, about three or four yards off; and on the drawers there were about ten or a dozen shillings, I had not counted them; he had opened the window far enough that I could easily get in or out, or any middling sized man; I gave charge of them both that night; the watchman was negligent, and did not search either; I positively swore to the woman; the officer was reprimanded, and fined forty shillings, by the Magistrate; I took her up again on the Saturday following of the Monday.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH PRINCE sworn. - On the 7th of May, I was coming from my benefit-club about half past eleven at night, I saw Mr. Eldridge coming along with only his breeches and shirt on; we took the man up, and the woman followed us to the watch-house, the watchman took him to the watchhouse.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Police-officer: I apprehended the woman on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Williams's defence. I had been hard to work that day, I mended two pair of shoes, and was not done till nine at night, and I had to take them as far as Tooley-street before I sold them; coming along I met this woman, and was going over the way to an alley to get some drink; this man came to me, and said, were not you up at my window; he went away, and brought another man to me, he tore my jacket; I said, if you are a constable do not use me bad; he called two watchmen, I laid hold of each of their arms, and went with them.</p>
               <p>Prince. He tried to make his escape before the watchmen came up; I did not tare his jacket, he tore my waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Nun's defence. Mr. Eldridge gave charge of me the same night; he told me, after my name was taken down in the book, I might go home, and come again in the morning; he said to me, what a d - d piece of nonsense this is, I cannot swear to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180405160007"></xptr>Williams; tell him from me that I cannot swear to him, nor my wife neither. He made it his business to follow me to Playhouse-yard, and told me the same, and last Saturday he took me up on the same suit; he said at the watch-house he could swear to me, but he could not swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw her in the street the next morning, and I said to her, tell me the truth, did you come after the club-box, or privately to rob me? she said she did not know what he was after, he was so drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her you were not positive to Williams? - A. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prince.) When the prisoner at the bar tore your waistcoat, did he appear to be drunk? - A. He did not.</p>

On the 15th of last month, I went out between six and seven o'clock in the evening; I left my wife and two children in my house; I shut the door after me; it is a spring lock, which shuts itself by being pulled to. I returned at about half past nine; I had the key, and let myself in; I found the candle as usual, standing on the table in the front room. I observed a light in the back room shining across the passage; I went to see what it was; I missed the light before I got to the door, and I put my hand to the door, and something stopped it; I went back, and pushed the door, and saw the bed clothes rolled up; I pushed the door open so far as to see the bed, pillows, and clothes, rolled up, and the mattrass, all rolled up in three parcels. the feather bed by itself. I then looked at the further end of the room, and saw the prisoner laying across the bedstead; I had a candle in my hand; the back door was not bolted; I slipped the bolt in case the prisoner should get out before I got assistance; I went to the front door, and called the watchman. I had not spoken to the prisoner before I did that. The watchman and two neighbours came in, and went to the back room with me. I spoke to him, and struck him a blow; he did not answer when I spoke, nor did he answer when I struck him. I then pulled him off the bedstead; he said he wanted to go to sleep, let him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181602140019"></xptr>sleep, and seemed very heavy. The window was fast. I then gave him in charge to the watchman, and took him to Whitechapel watchhouse. I asked him what he expected to find there; but he gave me no answer. My wife was out at this time; the back door went into a yard of mine behind the house; that was a private yard belonging to my own house only; there are no houses on one side of my house, but there is a piece of ground fenced in for building on; but it is not built up; the side of my yard is a boarded fence against this piece of open ground, in some places that fence was six feet high, in some eight; but the highest part was broken down that evening; we found it broken down when we came back from the watchhouse; there was an appearance as if a person had come over the wall at the bottom of my yard; first over the other wooden fence, and then over the wall. The way I found he came over the wall was because a shutter had been laid over the corner of the wall, over a water-cask, and that shutter was thrown down near that, there stood a corner cupboard, and there were marks of lime on it, where he came over the bricklayer's premises.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure you left it latched - A. Yes, I sure of that; because I must pass it in going to the door, and I know I had fastened it when I went out, and I fastened so when I came back; I came back a little before nine to get a child that was awake, and I took it to a neighbour's house, where I had a younger one; I took the child from the back room; there is only one back room on the ground floor. I did not return again until I was alarmed, and told that a man was in the house. When I went to the house the second time, I left nobody in it. There is only one door to go into the yard. The value of the bed, the bed clothes, and the pillows might me worth about eight pounds.</p>

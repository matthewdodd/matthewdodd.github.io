                  </hi>. I am a washerwoman, at Westbourne Place, Pirmlico—I washed for the prisoner Alfred Thomas—I gave that shirt to the constable on Friday, 8th August—I had received it from the last witness the Tuesday before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do a considerable deal of washing, chiefly ladies' things—sometimes I have two or three shirts, sometimes five.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Benjamin's Defence.</hi> I have about 5,000 letters through my hands a week, and I believe that letter never came into my hands at all. The two letters I am charged with stealing I have pleaded guilty to, but this letter did not come into my hands, and I am quite sure my brother knows nothing of it.</p>

               <p>Did you deliver the bundle voluntarily? - No, they made a snatch at it.</p>
               <p>Did you give them your money? - I had no money, they felt my pockets and gave me a push, and bid me go about my business or else they would cut my head off: they went down towards Buckingham House.</p>
               <p>Where did you go? - I was going up to Piccadilly, and I met a gentleman soon after, and I told him what had happened, and he bid me come along with him, and just as the word was out of his mouth we heard a woman cry stop thief, and then we cried stop thief, and kept-running back towards Buckingham House, and directly a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140061"></xptr> mob gathered up together, and immediately I went in and saw my bundle lying in a ditch, near the rails of St. James's Park, opposite Buckingham House, then they carried the prisoner to St. Martin's watch-house, and in the morning Bow-street.</p>
               <p>When did you charge the prisoner? - He was carried to the watch-house on my account and the young woman's.</p>
               <p>How do you know the prisoner is the man? - I saw him, the moon was up, but it did not shine very bright, it was cloudy; I know the prisoner by his person, and seeing him again directly; he was not from me I suppose five minutes.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed at that time? - He had not that red waistcoat on, his coat was buttoned, he had the same coat on, and a red handkerchief about his neck.</p>
               <p>Do you know what was in the bundle? - I have an inventory of the things.</p>
               <p>Who took it? - My mother.</p>
               <p>Is she here to give the account of it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see any of the things yourself before the bundle was delivered to you? - Yes, but I did not take any notice of them.</p>
               <p>Cannot you tell what there were? - No, only by this inventory; there were a couple of shirts.</p>

               <p>Did you ask him about the bundle? - He said we were mistake in the person, he said he had no bundle in his hand; the bundle in throwing down parted in three of four different parts, and while we were taking him, the boy and a girl came up, and the boy owned the bundle and picked it up.</p>

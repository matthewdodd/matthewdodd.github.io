My lodger went down for a pail of water and she saw something in the dust hole, and she came up and told us, and we went down stairs and she was coming up stairs, and there was a sheet in the dust hole from whence she came.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>I lodge in Mrs. Smith's house; I went down for a pail of water and I saw something lay on the dust hole which I pulled; the dust hole is at the bottom of the kitchen stairs; I laid hold of it, it pulled against me, I drawed the pail of water and went by the dust hole again and pulled it again, and it pulled very much against me. I went up stairs and knocked at my landlady's door, I saw, but I could not particularly observe what it was I saw, it was a person laying there, which very much alarmed me; I desired them to go down and look into the dust hole for there was somebody there that ought not to be; my landlady went down and met the old woman the prisoner, standing on the stairs, and went down and found the sheet in the dust hole; she said that she had been there to sleep and I had awaked her; it was between eleven and twelve.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Smith. How long had you left the kitchen? - It might be two or three hours, I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Elder. Was the old woman drunk or sober? - She appeared stupid.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the sheet nor had it till I see the gentlewoman had it in her own room; I had four witnesses here on Saturday but they could not come to day.</p>

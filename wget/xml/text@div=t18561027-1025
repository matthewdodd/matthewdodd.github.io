I was on duty in Petticoat-lane, on the night of 9th Sept. last—I saw the prisoner with a wicker basket on his head—I asked him what he had got there—he said, "Clothes"—he said he was going to Moses and Son's, and he said he had brought them from Brick-lane, Shoreditch—I asked from whom, and he said a man and a woman asked him to carry it—I found the basket contained thirty-four ladies' mantles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, living in Canterbury-place, Walworth. I make up caps and other goods for Messrs. Nicholson, of St. Paul's Churchyard. On 9th Sept., about 5 o'clock in the evening, I sent a quantity of mantles, in a wicker basket, to Messrs. Nicholson, by a lad in my employ—the articles produced are some of those I sent in the basket—I have seen the remainder—the basket produced to me was the same in which I sent the mantles—I do not know the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi> (<hi rend="italic">written</hi>). I am a porter; on the evening in question, I was coming from the Bethnal-green-road; as I came down Brick-lane, a man and a woman stopped me against the Bricklayer's Arms, and asked me if I wanted a job; I said, "Yes;" they said if I would carry this basket of cloaks to Moses and Son's, in the Minories, they would give me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; being out of employment, I took the basket; I was told to go down Went<lb></lb>worth-street, and down the lane, as that would be the nearest way; I was going along Petticoat-lane, and the policeman stopped me; I then looked round for the people that employed me, but I could not see them; but I saw them just before, and they told me to go straight on; I could swear to the persons again that employed me; it was not for me to ask those that em<lb></lb>ployed me who and what they was, as I should have insisted on their paying me when I had done my job of carrying them; the police, I do think, will admit I gave them every assistance in my power, and told them no untruth; I am indicted for stealing the things; the prosecutrix admits she gate them I into the porter's hands, and sent him away with them.</p>

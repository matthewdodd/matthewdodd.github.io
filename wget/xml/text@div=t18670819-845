                  </hi> I am a sculptor, living in St. George's Road, New Kent Road—on a Monday night at the latter end of July, about twelve o'clock, I was going home, and was near the Elephant and Castle—a man came up—I do not know what he said, but he spoke to me—he asked me to change a shilling—I gave him two sixpences—he then asked if I could give him coppers for a sixpence—I told him I had not enough coppers, and wished to leave his company, and I went away—I afterwards saw him with two other men—one of the other two took me by the throat and the third man took my watch from my waistcoat pocket—he cut the chain—I lost the watch and part of the chain—the man knocked me down and ran away—I saw the prisoner on the Tuesday afterwards and pointed him out to a policeman—I was sure he was the man who came up and spoke me.</p>

                  </hi> I have known the prisoner some considerable time, and remember his being taken into custody, the 30th July—I was out taking a walk—I saw the prisoner in the Rotherithe Road about two o'clock—I left him at the Green Man turnpike at ten minutes past twelve—he went towards Peckham—no other person was with him.</p>

On Saturday night, 28th November, I was on duty near the corner of Gray's Inn Road, with Carter, Policeman E 117; we were in plain clothes—about 12 o'clock, I saw the four prisoners, and a woman not in custody, standing at the corner of Gray's Inn Road, in conversation together—I watched them—they remained there about ten minutes—they then went down Holborn as far as the White Horse in Fetter Lane, all five together—two of them, I believe Hopkins and Williams, went into a lodging-house there, the others stopped outside—Hopkins and Williams came out of the lodging-house again, and joined the other three—they then went up Fetter Lane into Holborn, down Red Lion Street, through Princes Street, down Bedford Row, and through Feather-stone Buildings—they stopped there some minutes, and separated—two of them stopped opposite No. 20, Featherstone Buildings, which is a working jeweller's, two went past, and the other stood against the lamp-post in the centre—they then joined at the end of Featherstone Buildings, and went down Holborn together as far as Brownlow Street, went up Brownlow Street, along Bedford Street, and got to the corner of Featherstone Buildings again; they stood there, and then went along as far as Red Lion Street, down Red Lion Street into Holborn and into Featherstone Buildings—Hopkins, Singer, and Williams, and the woman not in custody, stood in a corner there, which is rather dark, and Edwards went up to the door-step of No. 20—the other four were standing nearly opposite No. 20—I went to the corner of Featherstone Buildings, and crossed over to Great Turnstile—Singer saw me and called out, and they all ran out—the two women crossed over on the opposite side of Featherstone Buildings, the other three ran down Holborn, and we caught them opposite the Holborn Theatre—Carter took hold of Hopkins and Edwards—I caught Hold of Williams—some other constables came to our assistance—I told Williams I should charge him with loitering in Holborn and the neighbourhood for the purpose of committing a felony—he said, "I have done nothing, and I sha'n't go"—I said, "You may as well go quietly"—I got him as far as Eagle Street, No. 40, which is a lodging house where thieves live—just there he stopped, and tried to throw me—I called out for a constable to come and assist me; constable Smith came up—we then went about three yards further, when he again tried to throw me, and we both went on the ground—whilst on the ground he dropped something—I could not see what it was; I heard it fall—Smith picked it up; it sounded like iron—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it is a crowbar—Hopkins was behind, in custody of Welch.</p>

               <p>of the Royal artillery, stationed at Woolwich in September last. Cox and Greenwood are agents to the Royal Artillery—when money is wanted for the subsistence of the troops, it is usual to write receipts similar to this, and have them signed by the commander of the detachment—the prisoner was then employed in the office, as second clerk to Captain Pester, who was adjutant; he might have seen these receipts filled up from time to time—it was never any part of his duty to assist in filling them up—when they are filled up, and signed by the commanding officer, we take them either to tradesmen, or to the Woolwich bank, to get cash for them—there is an account of the number and date of the receipts, sent once a year from Cox and Greenwood's, but we give an abstract of the amounts required once a month—we send them an account of the receipts which have been drawn and signed, during the month—that return is made between the 1st and 6th of every month—a receipt, dated on the 26th of September, would be mentioned in the abstract sent between the 1st and 6th of October—the prisoner's employment about the regiment, would give him an opportunity of knowing the abstract would be sent between the 1st and 6th of October—he deserted on the 29th of September—to the best of my belief, the writing in the body of this receipt is the prisoner's—I did not send him to Mr. Barber's on the 26th of September, to get cash for that receipt—I had no knowledge of his going to get cash for it, till after the forgery was dis<lb></lb>overed.</p>

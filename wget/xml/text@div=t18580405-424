                  </hi>. I keep the Golden Last, in Cannon Street. On Tuesday, 9th March, the prisoner came, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, for a glass of porter, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he put down a half crown, I tried it, it was good, and I gave him two shillings and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence—I turned my back for two minutes, and he said, "Is your porter only a penny a glass?"—I said, "No"—he said, "I have got a penny, then"—I took two shillings and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence off the counter, tried both the shillings, and found one was bad—I am quite sure both the shillings I put down were good—Ihave a patent machine, and try all money I take—I said, "This is not the shilling I gave you"—he said, "What do you mean?"—I gave him in charge, with the shilling.</p>

I took the prisoner on 9th March, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the evening, and received this shilling—onthe way to the station house, he said that it was a very bad job to give a respectable man into custody for nothing—I found on him a half crown, a key, and a thimble—he refused his address to the inspector, and also at the Mansion House, till he was placed in the cell, and then he gave it, and I found it to be correct.</p>

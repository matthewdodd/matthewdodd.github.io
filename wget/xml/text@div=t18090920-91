On the 23d of June I delivered 70 blank policies to the prisoner to take them to the stamp office to be stamped. They are bound until they are used, and then they are torn off. In a week or ten days, I enquired if he had left them at the stationer's to be bound he replied he had left them. After they are stamped they are left at the stationer's to be bound.</p>

               <p>Q. After they are delivered to you they are put in books - A. Yes, but these not having the stamps, were not put in books, they were returned to the office.</p>
               <p>MR. PORTER. On the 19th of July, I received a warrant to apprehend the prisoner, I could not find him, his wife said, she had not seen him; I went again in the same evening, and watched till a late hour, and on the day after, I went again, I could not find him.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you read that, which was taken down by you, what the prisoner said, was any promise or threat made use of - A. No. He said that he made use of a part, and was robbed of the other part, that is all that he said to the charge that was made by Mr. Bowra. He said he paid him 103 l. 8 s. 6 d. for stamps at the stamp office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Are you sure he did not say, it is very true, I was robbed of a part, and for the recovery of it I spent the other part, that would make all the difference - A. If he had said so, I should have taken it down.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Frederick-street, St. George's-in-the-East—on Friday afternoon, 5th December, about 4 o'clock, I went to a chandler's shop in Fenchurch-street for a quarter of a hundredweight of coals—as I came out the prisoner passed, and said he would assist me in taking them to my house—I had never seen him before—I allowed him to take them up into my room—he offered to stand some beer if I would drink it, and gave my servant 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to get a pot of half-and-half—the girl said that she could not get it for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., it was 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—nobody drank it but himself—he jumped from where he was standing into my bed with his clothes, and his dirty boots on—Catherine McCarthy was in the room—I asked him to get out of the bed, and so did she, and he kicked me in the stomach—I had done nothing to him—I afterwards got him by the legs to get him out of bed, and then he kicked me on the stomach—McCarthy asked him why he kicked me, and he said he would let her see, and he hit her on the forehead with his fist—he then laid hold of me by my hair, threw me down, and kicked me most fearfully on the body and face—he drew me along the floor to the cupboard by my hair, having kicked me for about ten minutes before he got to the cupboard—he then opened the cupboard-door, got a knife out; he said he would cut my throat, and stabbed me in the back of the neck with it—McCarthy said, "Oh! he has got the knife"—and she ran down stairs and screamed, "Murder!"—I was covered with blood—I screamed, "Murder!" and struggled to get away from him—several people came up stairs, and cried "Murder," and then he left me alone, and said by his Maker, that the first man he met he would rip him open—I was taken to the police-station and washed, and my wounds were dressed by a surgeon—we had had no dispute, about money, nor had anything happened but his</p>

I am a servant, at 14, Frederick-street—I was up stairs when the prisoner came in with the prosecutrix—the prisoner sent me out for a pot of half-and-half—he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of coppers—I said that I could not get it for that—he took the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and said, "I will go and get it"—he took the jug from the cupboard, and went out and got it, and asked us to drink—we said we did not want it, and he drank it all himself—then he jumped from where he stood into the bed with his dirty boots on—we got him by the feet, but we could not get him out, and he kicked the prosecutrix in the stomach—he then got out, caught her by the hair, and dragged her down, and struck me on the forehead with his fist—he was kicking her ten minutes, and then he took his foot and stamped on her chest as hard as he could—he then went over to the table, dragged her with him, opened the cupboard-door, and took out a knife—I called out, "Murder! he has got a knife"—he then <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> her into the back room, and stabbed her on the back of her neck—he then kicked her, and said to me, "I will out your d—d throat"—I went and got a policeman—there was no quarrel beyond what I have described—neither of us had done anything to provoke him.</p>

I sent three times by a nurse, and a girl about six years old, and a boy about eleven; one laid out 16 d. the other 15 d. the other 3 s. the nurse, named Dadson, had 1 s. 6 d. and the six-pence she carried was afterwards found in the prisoner's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after was it found?</p>
               <p>E. Smith. That was in less than five minutes after it was laid out; Mrs. Bedford staid at my house till the money was laid out, and went home.</p>

            . We having several times missed money, on the 17th of July I sent all my people out of the way, but the prisoner at the bar, and went over to Mrs. Smith with some money, which my husband and I marked; there were five shillings and two six-pences; I desired Mrs. Smith to send some of her neighbours to lay out that money at my house. She sent a woman for two ounces of tea and some sugar that came to 16 d. another woman was sent for a quarter of a pound of tea, that came to 1 s. 3 d. there was 6 s. sent in all, and all marked; when it was all sent, I went home, and behind the counter to the prisoner; he said, I have received this money since you have been gone, which was 5 s. 6 d. he opened the till and shewed it me.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it marked ?</p>
               <p>J. Bedford. It was marked with a cross on the woman's side. My eldest brother came in, and so did my husband; I said, the person that robbed you is now found out. Then he called the prisoner up into the dining-room; what he said I can't tell.</p>

            . We went over to Mrs. Smith's house, and marked five shillings and two sixpences, and ordered them to be sent to my shop for goods. I had sent all my other family out, except the prisoner. After it was laid out, we went home, and there were but 5 s. 6 d. in the till. I called him up stairs, and said, you are a rogue; he pulled out his money, and shewed me it, and said, that was all he had. Then I insisted upon sending for an officer; then he pulled out of another pocket this six-pence that was marked, (produced in court) I marked it myself; I told him it was mine; he said nothing for a considerable time. I said, I insist upon seeing your box; then we went up to it, in which I found rhubarb, and a quarter of a pound of tea, that I had missed before. There was three ounces or better of rhubard, I have valued it at 1 s. 6 d. it stands me in more than three times the value; there are many other things now in the box, that he cannot give an account off. I asked him how he could serve me in this manner? He acknowledged they were my property, and that he had gone on with that trade above a year.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>When I have laid any money out, I used to pay myself out of Mr. Bedford's till, and I had laid the money out before. I think it was on the 13th of that month I had been on board a vessel in the river, called the Carolina, and had paid six-pence to the waterman, and had not taken that six-pence till that day; and as I was going out again, I having no money in my pocket, took it out of the till. The goods in my box were none of Mr. Bedford's, neither were there any rhubard or tea found in my box.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When had he been upon the water for you?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He had not for seven days before, and that was only crossing at Executioned-dk to go to Deptford, and he had daily and hourly been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175412040034"></xptr> behind my till after that; he never mentioned this when he was detected.</p>
               <p>Q. You hear what he says, that the rhubarb and tea were not found in his box.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mrs. Smith saw them in his box, as well as myself.</p>
               <p>E. Smith. After the box was opened, I saw some rhubarb and tea, besides several other things, and he said all in his box was his master's, and that he took them from him.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. How long had the prisoner lived with you ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This was the 17th of July; he had lived with me about fifteen months before that.</p>

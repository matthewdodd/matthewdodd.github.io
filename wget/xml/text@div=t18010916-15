               <p>Q. What time did you discover you had been robbed? - A.Before eight o'clock I missed the pocket-book and the money; it was all in the pocket-book; I had left the key in the bureau, but not locked; I suspected the prisoner, because he was the only person in the house; he could not go down stairs to go out, without going through my bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him that morning? - A. Yes, I had seen him that morning, and drank with him, I was in bed; I asked him what he got up so soon for; he said he did not know, he could not sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he stop any time with you? - A. No, only drank with me in bed.</p>
               <p>Q.What, at six in the morning? - A. Yes; he went down, and got up about eight in the morning; he fetched the liquor for me; he drank with me, and the man that gave me the money drank with me too.</p>
               <p>Q.How long had that money been given you? The night before the 23d of July.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it given you as a present, or to take care of? - A. It was a man just come from sea, that always gives me every thing, just as if he was my husband; the prisoner never came back to my lodging; he had lodged five weeks in my house, and never paid me any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you notice that he was going to quit your lodgings? A. No; I saw him again last Thursday, at Wapping, in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to have any money when he was at your house? - A. No, not a shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there not a man and woman in bed, below stairs, at the same time? - A. No; no other person in the world.</p>

             sworn. - On the 23d of July, I called upon Charlotte Pugh, and there was this man who had come from sea, and I saw him give her the money the next morning; she came and told me she had lost it all; there was a great deal of foreign money, doubloons and dollars, and I recommended him to Mr. Morris's, in the Minories, he sold it there, it was changed into paper, and he gave it her, and told her to take it home, and put it in her drawer; this day week, I saw the prisoner as he was coming up to the Justice's; he was in the lock-up room; I spoke to him through the hole; I said, I was very sorry to see him there, and he said he was very sorry himself, but it could not be helped; I said, it was very cruel to serve her in that way, after he had taken away all her clothes but what she stood upright in to support him, and to take away a favourite watch that she had; he told me, if he was cleared, she should have the watch, and not cost her one farthing; I asked him where the watch was, and he said, if I would go to the second turning through Deptford turnpike, I should find the watch at one James Holland's, but he did not think they would give it to me without he was present, and he said he would give a note under his hand, if she would get somebody else to write it, that he would return what money she had lost, within a month; I went as he directed me, through Deptford-turnpike, but could not find any such person.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. That woman is now a common prostitute upon the town, she keeps a common bawdy-house; I met with her in St. Catherine's; I agreed with her for seven shillings to sleep with her; I went with her, and slept with her constantly for two months, and from a sickness that she gave me, I was so ill, I could not get off the ground; and the day before I left her, she told me I should not stay any longer in the house; I was going down stairs in the morning, and she desired me to get half a pint of gin; she drank two glasses of gin, and the man in bed with her drank two glasses of gin, and I drank one; then I went down stairs, and wished her a good morning; I never was in the house since; as to the robbery, I am as innocent of it as any gentleman who stands here; the chest of drawers that she says was robbed, stood opposite the bed.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Pugh.) Where is this man now? - A. He is gone up the East country.</p>

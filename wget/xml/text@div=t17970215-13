             sworn. - I live at No. 28, Monmouth-street; on Sunday the 15th of January, about eleven o'clock at night, I went into Drury-lane, and a woman, who was a stranger to me, asked me to give her something to drink; I said I would, and we went and had something; I was rather in liquor; I went with her to her apartment, and there was this Jane Honour and another with her; I made the woman I went with a compliment of half-a-crown, to sleep along with her, and we went to bed together; in the morning I waked about seven o'clock, or eight, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light, or dark? - A. Light; I missed a great coat which I had there over night; I pulled it off and put it on the bed, in the morning when I got up the great coat was missing; I asked the person in bed about the great coat, she said she knew nothing about it; I enquired of a woman who was in bed in the room; when I could not get any recompence, I went home, and stopped three hours before I returned again; I then returned to the same house, and took two of my shopmates with me; I said, which of you have got my great coat? I found the prisoner in bed along with the person I had been with; they said they did not know any thing about the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner denied any knowledge of it, as well as the other? - A. Yes; in the course of time my acquaintance said, you had better let the man have his coat; we had some words, and afterwards the prisoner at the bar pulled a duplicate out of her pocket, and threw it down on the floor; she made a reply that she had pawned the coat and had spent the money, and I might be d - d.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober? - A. No, not when I caught her in the morning; I sent one of my shopmates for an officer, who took her to Bow-street; she was there searched, and 4s. found in her pocket; the pawnbroker has the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. You are perfectly sure that this is the woman that threw down the duplicate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you not say that you had no money in your pocket at half past three in the morning, and pawned the coat to make a recompence for sleeping with us?</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that true? - A. No, it is not; I gave half-a-crown as a compliment for sleeping with her; I had money in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in company? - A. An hour or two before I went home with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly sure, that you were sober enough to know that you never gave the coat to pawn? - A. Never to my knowledge.</p>

             sworn. - I am a pawnbroker; the prisoner pawned this coat with me (producing it) on the 16th of January, between eight and nine o'clock; it was on a Monday, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen that woman before? - A. Yes, frequently, for these three years and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. You know her person? - A. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her a duplicate - A. Yes. (The constable produced the duplicate.)</p>
               <p>Court (to Priest.) Q. Is that the duplicate that she threw on the floor? - A. Yes; it was thrown down, and my acquaintance took it up; the officer took it from her apartment.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Hughes.) Is that your duplicate? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Who were they? - A. The prosecutor and his friends; I have kept it till now; the prosecutor then charged me with the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I gave the ticket to the prosecutor.</p>

About half past three o'clock this gentleman came home with another young woman; I was in bed; I heard a contest at the fire about having no money; he said I have no money, depend upon it; I can raise some in the morning; I got up to let the young woman in; in the morn<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150030"></xptr>ing I said to the man, now if you have a mind to go home you may; no, says he, I will stop and breakfast, if you will take my coat to pawn, and bring six or seven shillings for it; he gave me the coat, I took it to Mr. Hughes, and he gave me six shillings; when I came home the gentleman was got up and gone; when he came he brought three men with him; I said here is the ticket of your coat; says he, I will prosecutor you as far as the law goes; I gave him the ticket; I had his leave to do it, as God knows.</p>

On the 25th of February, about eleven o'clock in the morning, Jones called to see Picton, her niece and as she went out, my suspicions were excited from her manner - I followed her to the Old Bailey, and asked her to step over the way as I wished to speak to her about her niece being intoxicated on the Sunday - when she came over I found something concealed under her cloak; I asked what it was, she said it was nothing particular - it was what her niece Sarah had given her; I found it was about 2lbs. of candles, rolled up in a whole table-cloth, and two halves of another table-cloth. Picton had no permission to give anything away; I gave her in charge of an officer, who took her to my house - Jones never visited her niece but once before, to my knowledge - we had not forbidden her having female visitors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long before had Jones been? A. About a fortnight or three weeks after she came - the prisoner called her aunt in my presence, and asked leave for her aunt to go up stairs; I had not the least suspicion of either of them - Jones said her niece had given her the parcel, and she did not know what was in it; it was wrapped inside her cloak - my suspicion was excited by her bulky appearance.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. I only recollect Jones calling once at our house before this - Picton called her aunt. On the day in question Jones came about ten o'clock and might stop half an hour - we had no other female servant; I saw her leave the house - Mr. Glover went after her: when she was brought back, I identified the table-cloth by the letter G. on it; there is no mark on the two pieces, but I have the fellow piece - it is a large table-cloth, and being worn, was divided into three parts- Jones was left below while the officer went and searched Picton's box - when I came to look at the candles, I missed some; I never allowed Picton to take them out of the place herself; nothing was found in her box; when she found her aunt was in custody, she fell on her knees and voluntarily acknowledge that she had stolen them and given them to her aunt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are sure of the table-cloth? A. It is my own marking; her aunt said, he knew nothing of the contents of the bundle; but I have no recollection of Picton saying her aunt did not know the contents.</p>

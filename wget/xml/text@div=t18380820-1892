I occupy the front room, second-floor, at No. 30, Crown-street—the same house as the prisoners lived in—my room was only parted by a wainscot-between five and six o'clock, on the 1st of August, I was disturbed by their get<lb></lb>ting up—I went to a small hole in the wainscot, and saw the man standing about the middle of the room, opposite the window—he had a sort of composition in his hand, in a wet state—he took it to the fire-place-brought it back, and then scraped it out with a pocket-knife; and then took it to the window to see whether it was level—he put it under some other things, and covered it with a blacking-pot—the female was in bed.</p>

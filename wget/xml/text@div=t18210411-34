We walked together to Liquorpond-street - I called on a coachmaker, a customer, in Lamb's Conduit-street, he waited at the door the while - I knocked at the coachmaker's door, he came out, and we went to a public-house, at the corner of Great Ormond-street, close by - I asked the prisoner to come in with us, and he did - I had some cloves and gin, and paid for all that we had - I then proceeded on with the prisoner, (the person I called on went home,) we went on talking together till we got to Tottenham Court-road - he said he was unfortunate and out of employment, or, as I had treated him, he would treat me, but he had no money. We went into the Black-horse, Tottenham Court-road - I had some cloves and gin, and he had a glass of rum - I paid for it, and we went on - I was going to Clements's New Inn-yard, Tottenham Court-road, to carry a message from Mr. Pointer, (the coach-maker I had called on) to a wheeler in the yard.

When I fell, I called Watch and Stop thief! a young man assisted me up, and said the man was taken - I went to Mr. Fountain's public-house, at the corner of Rathbone-place - I believe it is the Marquis of Granby. I found the prisoner there, he was taken to the watch-house - I saw my watch in the possession of the watch-house keeper.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner the man who came up to you in Hatton Garden, walked on with you, and had hold of your arm when you received the blow - A. Yes; I cannot swear that he gave me the blow, but I am sure he had hold of my arm at the time - he took hold of my arm before I received the blow (in Tottenham Court-road) and had hold of it when I received the blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were walking arm-in-arm, as any two men might be - A. Yes; I had been drinking, and was inebriated, I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not fall down once or twice during your walk - A. Not to my knowledge; I did not fall in Hatton-garden, my foot slipped; he walked with me all the way - I halloed out instantly on receiving the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. You went down Goodge-street into Upper Rathbone-place; if you meant to have gone home through Rathbone-place, you might have gone through Charlotte-street - A. People do not always go the nearest way; Upper Rathbone-place is darker than Charlotte-street; Fountain's is a very few yards from where I received the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say when you saw him, that is not the man that struck me, I am sure - A. Not that I know - I was in liquor. I said I could not believe he was the man who could do it. I received the blow on my right eye, on the edge of the bone - he stood on my right side, his arm being within mine. It was after nine o'clock when I looked at my watch.</p>


               <p>COURT. Q. Can you say he was with you up to the instant you received the blow - A. He was; and when I recovered and rose, he was gone.</p>

            . I was sergeant of the watch, and was stationed in Charles-street, Rathbone-place; I heard a cry of Watch! when I was at the corner of Rathbone-place, and Percy-street, and I went towards the cry - heard a call of Stop thief! and in hardly half a minute I saw the prisoner running by Fountain's, as fast as he could go - a man was close behind him, and tried to stop him - he swung round his arm, and I collared him; a person came out of Fountain's and said he had broken a window - we took him into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182104110020"></xptr>the bar - a young woman went out and brought in a watch, which she put into Fountain's hand - a young man came in, and desired me to detain the prisoner, for he had knocked a man down, and robbed him of his watch; he went out and said he would help the prosecutor in, as he was so much hurt, he was hardly able to come along; he went out, and brought the prosecutor in; directly he came in, he looked at the prisoner, doubled his fist and said,</p>
               <p>"you are the man that knocked me down, and robbed me of my watch." Fountain, at this time, had the watch in the bar - it was not shewn to him till he got to the atch-house - he then claimed it.</p>
               <p>Q. You met him running; before you stopped him, had you met or seen any other person - A. Not a soul; I did not hear the prisoner say any thing - there was a cry of Stop thief! behind him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You crossed diagonally from one pavement to the other - A. Yes; when I came up, the prisoner was half way between Fountain's and Percy coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not another person have been before him, and you not see him - A. The street was quite clear, my face was towards Fountain's, I know nobody passed before him; the young man who tried to lay hold of him was not above two yards from him when I came up. He went to the door of the public-house - whether he went in or not, I cannot say; somebody came out, and said the window was broken before I took him into the house, but the watch was found afterwards.</p>

Muers came in after the watch was brought in - he saw the prisoner, and said, you are the man who knocked me down and robbed me.

I was in my parlour when I heard the window break - I went out immediately, and saw the watchman bringing the prisoner in - the window is in Upper Rathbone-place. It was about thirty feet from me - I am sure the prosecutor said the prisoner was the man, but when he was going to sign the charge at the watch-house, the prisoner said, you are not going to sign a charge against me, I am not the man; he said, I know you are not; he afterwards said he was - he was so intoxicated, he hardly knew what he said.</p>

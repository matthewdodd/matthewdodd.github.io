On Friday, the 3d of December, between four and five o'clock in the evening, (there was another person in the shop as well as myself,) the prisoner came in about a saw which he had pawed the night before; he came up to the counter where the articles were lying; there was no other customer in the shop but him. I had occasion to go out for a few minutes, and left him there. When I returned the prisoner was gone, and the goods likewise; I had been out about five minutes - I have seen the goods at Worship-street; the prisoner was then in custody; I know them to be our goods; the value of the whole might be about 1 l. I am certain of the prisoner's person.</p>

The prisoner came there on Friday, the 3d of December, between five and six o'clock; he asked me to take care of the two whittles, and a child's frock, for a few minutes, which I did, but he did not call again. Vann came to me on the Sunday following, and I gave them to him.</p>

            . I received two whittles and a frock from Mrs. Turnstall on Sunday, the 5th of December; they were afterwards claimed by Attenborough - I took the prisoner at Attenborough's shop, where he had detained him; I found a pair of stockings in his breast-pocket; I also found on him a duplicate of a pair of stays, pawned at Matthews's for 1 s.; he told me where he had left the whittles.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that another person who came out of the shop gave him the property to pawn.</p>

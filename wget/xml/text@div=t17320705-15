The Horse was taken out of my Field; in 3 Days after, the Prisoner (as I heard) offering to sell the Horse to Mr. Paul of Dartford, was taken up on Suspicion, and committed to Deptsord Bride. II. From thence he sent a Letter to his Father in Ickenham Parish, but there being another Man of the same Name, in the same Parish, the Letter by Mistake came to him, and he acquainted me with the Contents, by which I found out the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Paul. A Farrier in Dartford asking me if I would buy a Horse, I went with him to a little Alehouse where I found the Prisoner and the Horse. Says the Prisoner, I value this Horse at 12 Guineas, but as I am going a Journey, I must have some Horse or other, and therefore, if you have any that will serve my Turn I'll rap with you. I shew'd him 2 or 3, and at last he pitch'd upon a little serub Horse. We agreed that he should have this little Horse, and 7 Guineas in exchange for the Horse he had to dispose of. I gave him a Shilling Earnest, and then told him, it was the Custom of our Neighbourhood to require Vouchers, when they bought a Horse of a Stranger. He said, He could bring no Vouchers, because he knew no Body thereabouts. I ask'd him where he liv'd, and how he came by the Horse? He said, He liv'd at Harrow on the Hill, and bought the Horse there; and that he would not now have sold him, but that he was robb'd on Bexley-Heath of 3 Guineas and a half, and had not a Shilling left to bear his Charges. On farther Talk, I found he Shuffled, and was in several Stories; upon which I sent for a Constable. The Prisoner then said, That he knew Mr. Buck in our Neighbourhood, to whom he sold a Horse a Year ago. I remember'd that Mr. Buck about that time, did buy a Horse of a Stranger, who said, He had been robb'd on Bristol-Causeway ; and it afterwards appear'd, that that Horse was stol'n. We carried the Prisoner before the Justice, who having examin'd him, committed him to Deptford-Bridewell.</p>

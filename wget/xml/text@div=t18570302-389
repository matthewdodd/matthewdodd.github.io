On 12th Feb., I was in Albion-road, Stoke Newington; I saw the prisoner carrying a bag, I asked him what he had got in his bag—he said he had nothing—I said, "You must have something"—he threw the bag down, and tried to run away—I caught hold of him, and while I was struggling with him, he put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and I saw something in his hand—he was trying to throw it away—I struck him on the arm and it fell down, I took it up, and he said, "That don't belong to me"—I said, "What don't belong to you?"—he said, "That bad money"—before that I had not made any observation as to the contents of the paper—I took him to the station, and found in the paper two half crowns and one shilling.</p>

I am the prisoner's wife—I was married eleven yean ago last March, and have four children by him living—he left me eleven months ago, and I have been living with my mother at 2, Pipemakers' Alley, St. Martin's—he lives at Castle Lane, Westminster—about 10.30 or 10.45 p.m. on 25th April I went to him with three of my children, my eldest daughter being one—I found my husband in and the woman he is living with—I asked him if he would give me a little money to go to market to support the children—he said "I have some money, and if you will wait till the morning I will give you some"—.I slept in a chair in the room with the woman—she never spoke to me or I to her—I did not sleep, but I kept in the chair—in the morning I asked the prisoner if he intended to give me anything, and he said I accused him of being a returned convict to a woman that lived in the same street—I said "I will go with you to the woman and prove I have not said such a thing"—we both went to the house together, and he knocked at the door—she was not in, and we both went back to his room, and I said to my little girl, "It is no good our waiting; we will go"—with that he gave me a blow in the face with his fist as I was sitting in the chair—I said "Come on, never mind; let us go"—I rose, and he said "Perhaps you will have something to go with," and he made his way to me and kicked me on * * *—I said to my little girl, "I am bleeding, Polly; take me out or else I shall die"—I fell on to the floor, and she got me out, and I lay on the pavement bleeding till a cab came, which the prisoner fetched, and went with me to the hospital—he told me not to say it was him that done it, "for while you lie up I shall be as kind as I can to you"—the other woman was in the room asleep when it happened—I had not been drinking with her that night.</p>

I was house surgeon at Westminster Hospital—I saw the woman on the morning of the 23rd, the morning after her admission—she had been previously treated by the assistant house surgeon—she presented the appearance of a woman who had lost a considerable quantity of blood—she was rather blanched, and had a feeble pulse and the appearance of prostration—the hæmorrhage had been arrested—I found a wound on the internal labia about an inch and a half long, a jagged sort of wound—there was also some bruising externally—such injuries might be inflicted by a kick, or by falling on some blunt surface, not on the floor, such a thing as a poker—they were consistent with having been produced by a kick with a boot on—we kept her in bed quiet, and she remained in the hospital until the 28th—I have not seen her since—I then prescribed a tonic medicine for her—whether she has since attended as an out-patient, and seen any of the other surgeons, I cannot say—a wound of that sort might by attended with serious consequences.</p>

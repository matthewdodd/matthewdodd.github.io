               <p>year, until 26th January, this year, Butler was in their service—he was dis<lb></lb>charged on 26th January, because some ties were found in his pocket—here are seven dozen, and five Windsor scarfs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), they were made up for oar house, and are our own patterns, they were given up to us by the officer—we have missed property of this kind, altogether I should say from 150 to 200 dozen; we generally sell them in half dozens of a pattern and different colouring, they average from 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—Butler was not employed in the department where they were kept, he had access to it—I went to the shop of Mr. Turner, in St. Martin's-le-Grand, I think in February, my atten<lb></lb>tion having been called to some scarfs in his window, of the same kind as these, but different patterns; I went in and bought these three of him; he made some communication to me, in consequence of which I employed the police.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On Friday, 12th March, in conse<lb></lb>quence of directions, and on the 13th, I went to Mr. Turner's shop, in St Martin's-le-Grand—I saw a person named Leachman go in there—I did not see him take anything in—he came out with a bag and a parcel—I followed him into Gresham Street, and stopped him, took him to the station, and found these scarfs in some boxes—I went with him and Mr. Westwood that morning to London Wall, to the Weaver's Arms and Swan public-houses, to try and find Cross, but did not see anything of him that morning—on Monday morning, the 15th, I went again, with Leachman and another officer—a stranger spoke to Leachman in the street—after that I went with Leachman to Cox's public-house, in Carthusian Street, where I found Cross in the back parlour, by himself—Cross opened the door a little way and saw Leachman, and then Leachman went in, and I followed—Leachman said, "That is Cross"—I said to him, "Leachman is in custody for the unlawful possession of a quantity of scarfs, which he says you gave to him, is that so?"—he said, "Yes"—Leachman said to Cross, "Yes, and you knew they were wrong when you gave them to me, and I told you that Hellaby's people were making a noise about their things being sold at the shops under cost price"—Cross said, "Yes"—Leachman said, "And did not you say, 'If there is anything wrong about them, never you mind about that, I will put up with that'"—Cross said, "No"—I then told him that I should take him into custody—Leachman said, "With your permis<lb></lb>sion, I should like to ask Mr. Crow this; did I, at the time when you gave</p>

               <p>me these scarft, know where you got them from?"—Cross said, "No, you did not know"—an officer named Gilbert was present at this conversation—I said? to Cross, "I want? to know where you got? these scarfs from," speaking of those I had found on Leachman—he said, "What shall I do? you know where I got them from"—I said, "I don't, I want? to know"—he said, "I had? them from a man named Palmer"—I said, "Where does Palmer live, or work?"—he said, "I don't know now, but I knew a month ago; I meet him at different public-houses"—I then took him to the station, showed him the boxes of scarfs I had found on Leachman, and asked him if they were the scarfs he had given Leachman—he said, "Yes"—he was then charged—I hare omitted to state that at the public-house I said to him, "I have been looking for you; you hare heard of this affair"—he said, "Yes, I have been in the country, and I have been very ill all night through this affair"—Leachman was subsequently discharged from custody—on 23rd March I went to 9, Russell Street, Whitechapel, the residence of Butler's parents—I found Butler there, and his parents also—I spoke to the father first, and then said to Butler, "I am a police officer, and I have come to see you about some scarfs? that you have stole from Messrs. Hellaby's, during the? time you were in their employ—I want you to tell me the truth; I understand you were discharged because two (or some) scarfs were found in your pocket, is that so?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I know you have had a great many more than those two, you have had a great many from there"—his father begged him to tell the truth—I then asked him if he had taken away a many as a 100 dozen—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you take fifty?"—he said, "No"—he thought he had taken thirty dozen—I said, "What did you do with them?'—he said, "I sold them to a boy named Green"—I said, "How did you come to know Green?"—he said, "I met him one day, at the corner of Aldermanbury, and I was showing him a band, and he bought it, and asked me if I could get him some more things, and I did, scarfs"—I asked him how many at a time he had taken out, or how he took them out—he said, "I took, sometimes, three or four at a time, in my pocket, and I have taken as many as nine, twice a-day"—I asked if he knew where Green lived—he said, "Yes, I can take you to his house"—I then went with Butler to 24, Lamb Street, Spitalfields, and there saw Green—I said, "I am a police officer, and I have come to see you about some scarfs that you have bought of this boy, Butler"—he said, "Scarfs, sir! I only had three or four"—Butler said, "Yes, you did, you had twenty dozen and more"—I then took them both to the station—I showed Butler, in Green's presence, the boxes of scarfs taken from Leachman, and asked if he knew them—Butler said, "Yes"—I said, "How do you know them?"—he said, "They are the ones that I stole from my master, Mr. Hellaby, and gave to Green"—Green said, "I did not have all these, I had that one, and that one," putting his finger upon two; these are the two—he said, "I had some of these, altogether about a dozen"—Butler said he had had more, and Green denied it—Butler said, "I used to meet you, and you once gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for eight, and sometimes you gave me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each; when I used to give them to you, I have been several times with you to a public-house, in London Wall, and you used to go in and meet a man there, and sell them while I waited outside"—Green said, "You only went once with me to the public-house in London Wall"—I asked Butler if he knew the sign of the home he said he thought it was the White Horse, but he was not certain</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186904050091"></xptr>
               <p>—there was a mm with me at these conversations, not an officer, he took no part in it—on 29th March, the day of the committal, Butler called me to him in the cell, and said "I wish to speak to you, sir; this morning, as we were coming away from Newgate, Green said to me, 'Did you tell then anything about the bands?' and I said, Yes, I told them the truth; he said, 'How did they come to find it out?;' I said, 'Through the one you had on'"—he also said "Green said, 'What made you tell them I had so many scarfs?' and he told me, sir, before we were taken, that if ever we were taken, to say that he only had a few"—I gave that evidence at the Mansion House shortly afterwards, and Green interrupted me, and said something which was taken down—I don't remember what it was—I have, in the course of this case, received parcels of Windsor scarfs, from different persons, which I produce; here are eight from Mr. Davey, four dozen from Simpson &amp; Co., three down from Mr. Williams, five from Mr. Rees, and eight from Mr. Tarrant—I do not produce any from Swan &amp; Edgar's.</p>

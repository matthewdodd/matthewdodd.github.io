I am the wife of Charles Essex, and live in Southamp<lb></lb>ton-row, Russell-square—I have a stand in the Pantheon Bazaar, in Ox<lb></lb>ford-street—the prisoner had been between eight and nine yean in my service—it was her duty to account to me for all the things that she sold, and the money she received in the course of the day—if she sold a knife and scissors to Charles Edwards on the 12th of March for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., she only paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of it—if she sold articles on the 14th of March to Eliza<lb></lb>beth Edwards for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she has not accounted for it—she ought to have accounted to me for it—I summoned her to my house and requested Mr. Edwards to come and to pretend to change the articles in her presence, to see what she would say—he called, and she denied having sold them.</p>

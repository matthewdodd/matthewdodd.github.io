                  </hi>. I live at Walthamstow, in Essex. On the 27th of October, in the morning, I saw the two prisoners go by our house between eleven and twelve o'clock—I had a scythe on my shoulder—I followed them down Amber-lane—they seemed to look at me with particular anxiety—they kept turning round—I suspected them, and went on in a different direction—they turned down the lane, to the left—I threw my scythe down, and went into Amber-field, and stood behind a tree—I then got up into the tree, which was shaded with leaves—I had a perfect view of them—they came and surveyed the geese—some lads there were making a noise—they walked on, and joined the lads—I went on about a quarter of a mile—I went on cutting my grass, and in a quarter of an hour, they came back with each a stick, and knocked down a goose, and brought it into the field where I stood, and tucked it into the hedge—I suppose they meant to go and get another, but seeing me, they set off running—I chased them about three quarters of a mile—one hid himself in the brambles—I jumped into the brambles, and secured him—he walked with me till I overtook the other, and put both into the cage—when I came back the goose was dead—I took it up, and carried it to Mr. Robinson, the magistrate of Waltham<lb></lb>stow—it belonged to my father, Adam Charlton—I have the wings of the goose here—I saw them take it from my father's flock of geese.</p>
               <p>(James Manley, of Laytonstone, Essex, gave the prisoner, George Willis, a good character.)</p>

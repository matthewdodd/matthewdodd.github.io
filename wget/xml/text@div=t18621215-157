                  </hi>. I carry on business as t money lender, at 25, Cannon-street—I know the prisoner—in February last he applied to me to borrow some money—he deposited with me this dock order, dated 10th February, for 255 pieces—he wished me to lend him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that order, which I declined doing without some one guaranteed the repayment of the money—he brought some one to guarantee that, and I lent him the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the money was paid off about five weeks after, and I re-transferred the goods back to him—part of it was paid on 10th or 12th March, and the remainder on the 15th, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on each occasion—I took his promissory note for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., charged him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the transaction, and gave him a cheque for 47<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was subject to no other deduction whatever.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Essex—I have known the prisoner for some time—on the 15th March last he applied to me for a loan, and in ac<lb></lb>cordance with his desire, I went with him to the office of Mr. Sharp—on his obtaining from him this transfer order for the timber he deposited it with me, and I paid off the balance of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Sharp—I made a further advance of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner on 17th—he gave me a bill for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the timber remained at the docks to my account, and was sold by my direction.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, carrying on business at 156, Cheap<lb></lb>side—I have lent money to the prisoner—about 21st February he deposited with me some dock order—I never saw the order except when I saw it at Mr. Lewis's office; my young man took it—I have no entry of it—I was in the habit of lending the prisoner money whenever he came to me for it—on 21st February I gave a cheque to meet a bill—I believe the orders were lodged before then; about 17th or 18th, I think—he had 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 20th, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 21st—that was to take up a bill on which he and I were liable—on the 21st he had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lent him a few pounds almost every Saturday—he had 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday before that to pay his</p>

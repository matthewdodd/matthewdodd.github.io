The person who introduced me said to Carey, that was the person of whom he had been speaking. I asked the prisoner when I could have some bobs, meaning bad shillings; he said, he could let me have half a dozen then. I asked him what the price would be, and he said, the old price, half and half. I told him I had no objection, provided they were good ones, meaning good bad ones, and he handed me over half a dozen; I gave him a three-shilling piece, and told him that so small a quantity was no use to me, I wanted a couple of dozen more; he said, he could let me have them by eight o'clock the same evening; this was about three o'clock. I told him I could not wait so long, and asked him if he could not get them quicker; after some consideration, he said he could, and would go home, and set them to work, and would return in half an hour. He went away in about five minutes, and I went into the room where Vaughan and Dickins were, and pulled off my disguise, and followed him; I followed him to Angel-court; I saw him go into a house, which turned out to be No. 2; I waited at the door a few minutes, and when he did not come out, I returned to the public-house, which was about two hundred yards off; I found my brother officers there, and they came back with me; I went up stairs first; the upper room door was fastened; I peeped through the key-hole, and saw Carey rubbing something in his hand. Vaughan and Dickins had followed me; it was in the two pair of stairs. Near Carey was a chair, on which I could distinctly see three pieces, resembling shillings. We bursted the door open afterwards, and then Sloane had a pair of pinchers in his hand, and a file; he was filing something. The other two were sitting on another chair, with a basin between them, rubbing something with their fingers. I did not wait at the door above a minute; the other officers looked after me. We then burst the door open, and I seized the prisoner Carey, who immediately dropped what he had in his hands, into that basin, (points to another basin produced.) I secured him and Sloane, and the other officers secured the other two. Sloane immediately dropped the pinchers, and they fell at my feet, together with a round bit of brass. On searching Carey, this shilling dropped from him; these three were on the chair were he was sitting; this basin was also on the chair were he was sitting, and it had this wash in it, which I put into this bottle. Near Sloane were these five blanks. We secured the prisoners, and brought them away; their hands were all over a white stuff, which Dickins will produce; their hands looked as if they had been handling the peels of wallnuts; there was an empty bottle which was corked, and when the cork was drawn, it made a report; the cork also seemed very much burnt. I asked Carey where the good money was which I had given to him, and he said, he did not know.</p>

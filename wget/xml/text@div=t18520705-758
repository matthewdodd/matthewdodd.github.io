                  </hi>. I did live in Westminster Bridge-road. I have been in the employ of the prisoner Simpson as shopman—he introduced King to me about three years ago—I kept the iron shop—King has been in the habit of coming to the shop—he brought nails to sell in brown paper parcels—the first time he brought me some to sell, I took him into Mr. Simpson—I told him I did not buy them myself, I did not know the price—Simpson came back with him to the shop, and told me to buy the I nails, and any other things that he brought, and told me the prices to pay I tor them—the prices varied from 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per pound to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after that I bought I them of King—I have sometimes bought of him once a day, sometimes twice, or three or four times a day—the parcels he brought were small ones, and varied from 2 to 4 lbs.—there have been 42 lbs. in a day—they were all new nails and done up in packages—I recollect Mr. Green coming to our premises to search—about six weeks previous to 29th March, I had made a communication to Blewitt, and I had made a communication to the police—at the time Mr. Green came, I thought we had about 8 cwt. of these nails left—I remember Mr. Green coming with the police, and some nails being found in two casks—I had those nails from King, they were mixed on the Monday night, 29th March—I went home to tea about 4 o'clock that after<lb></lb>noon, and I saw the officer Hayes, and Mr. Green, and King standing at the corner of Marsh-gate—Hayes stopped me, and told me he had taken King into custody, and he should take me—he asked me if there were any</p>

               <p>nails in Simpson's shop—I said, "Yes"—(King must have heard this)—after I had turned away from Hayes, Mr. Simpson told me to go and mix the nails—I did it with three others, the boy Harry, the man from the marine store shop, and the servant girl Isabella Ward—on that night some papers were burnt in the marine store shop, I cannot say how many—Mrs. Simpson was there, she came in and blew the candle out—it was not usual to have a fire in that shop—there had not been a fire there for years, the papers that were burnt were brown papers similar to these before me—I am sure I cannot say how many were burnt, it continued about 20 minutes—Mr. Simpson told me after emptying the nails to make a fire in the back place, and burn the papers—the first time the policeman came, Mr. Simpson told me to go and empty the nails out of the papers, and he told me to go Lambeth-square way—he did not say that in such a tone that the police<lb></lb>man could hear—he turned round to me and said, "Go through Lambeth<lb></lb>square"—I went round to Mr. Palmer's, a plumber, in Lambeth-square—Mrs. Palmer opened the door, and Mr. Palmer came—I asked him to allow me to go through his place, as we could not get in any other way—we got in, and Mr. Palmer drew up the ladder—I began directly to empty out the nails, Mr. Simpson came in and called the boy Henry and the girl, and sent the man from the other shop to help me—the nails had before been on the shelves, and this was the place where they were found—Simpson came in while they were being emptied, but he did not do anything—I was taken up by Hayes on this charge—I was put in the dock, at Lambeth police-court—King I believe was present, Simpson was not there—I did not tell the policeman on that occasion, that I never bought nails of King—I said, "I know nothing about it"—the policeman said he had taken King, and should take me—I told him he had no occasion to take me, I had given him every information he required—King was present when I spoke to Hayes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just state what you said to Hayes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I told him where the nails were, in the back warehouse, on the left hand—King heard it—he did not say anything—Hayes said he must take me into custody—I said I should tell him all about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You are related to this person whom you accuse of receiving goods? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he married my sister—she is dead—he has two boys—I am their uncle—they are supported by his business, no doubt—it was my own personal safety that induced me to come forward to destroy my brother-in-law and his children—of course my public spirit would have induced me to meddle—I did it because I was in jeopardy myself—Simpson has never made any charge against me at anytime; I swear that—these are the papers I handed to Biewitt—that was about six weeks before I was under charge—I might have been in danger then, if any<lb></lb>thing had been discovered—of course I considered myself in danger—that was the reason I handed these papers—I heard of no charge against me—Mr. Simpson never hinted that I had been robbing him—I gave up these I papers because I felt myself in duty bound to do it—I asked Blewitt's advice—he told me to discontinue buying the nails—of course I felt myself in danger—Blewitt is a respectable man, and keeps a toy warehouse, and is a doll manufacturer in Westminster-road—I was given into custody on the Tuesday, by Mr. Green, I believe—Biewitt was not a witness against me; he was there, and these papers were produced; nothing was said about them—Blewitt employed an attorney to defend me—it was the same attorney who is now conducting this prosecution—no one gave evidence against me when Mr. Roberts appeared for me—I was discharged because there was no charge against me—Mr. Roberts put me in the witness box—Mr. Blewitt paid Mr. Roberts, the attorney, who appeared for me—no one appeared against me—a clerk was sitting in the box—no attorney appeared for the prosecutor—Mr. Green was examined against me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you tell me no witness was examined against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Green was called forward about the nails—these papers might have been produced; I do not know, I cannot say really—I was given into custody because it was said I was the only male person on the premises; one of the officers said that—when I left Mr. Hayes I understood I should be given into custody—he said, "I must take you into custody when I come down"—I said, "If you do, I will give you every information in my power"—I had told him where the nails were previous to that—Blewitt and I had had no conversation about my being given into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came Blewitt to be instructing an attorney to appear for yon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He found I was given into custody; it was through Mr. Downey that he interfered for me—I have been to Holland since this matter—I have been dealing in leeches—I have not given nails for them—I did not sell any nails, nor take any nails there—when I was there I stayed at Mr. Sherman's, in Amsterdam, and at the London Hotel, in Rotterdam—Simpson has not been ill for the last two years; he has been on business every day, or nearly every I day—he was not laid up—I should say he has been in business nearly every day, I cannot say every day—he has not been where I have been perhaps every day for two years—I do not believe that a medical man has been attending him for two years—I do not know that he has attended him on and off—the ironmongery shop is separate from the other shop—I was only shop-man there—of course, I had the principal management when I was there by myself—I should think he managed the other business when he was well enough.</p>

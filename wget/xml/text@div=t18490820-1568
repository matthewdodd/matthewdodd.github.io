                  </hi>. In consequence of missing a large quan<lb></lb>tity of bonnet crowns and buckram on 10th July, I gave Swaine 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him directions, under the direction of the police—in the evening he produced eighteen dozen bonnet crowns to me, some of which I swear to being my own manufacture; and I firmly believe the whole were mine—the others were made at Paisley, and sent to me, and they were such as I had on my premises—Swaine produced a bill to me—I went that evening with Swaine, Morrell, and Zinzan, to the prisoner's house—he keeps a beer and chandler's shop in Nelson-street, Shoreditch Church—Morrell went in first—Morrell beckoned me, and then I went in, leaving Swaine and Zinzan outside—I heard Morrell say to Attle, "Have you sold any crowns to-day"—he said, "None"—Morrell then said, "Do you know Swaine?"—Swaine came for<lb></lb>ward, and he said, "No, I do not"—Swaine said, "You know that, then? "and produced a bill—Attle made no answer—Morrell then said, "I am a police-officer; you have a quantity of property belonging to Mr. Osborne; I must search your place," and proceeded to the back room—he did not make any objection—they looked in the drawers, and Morrell called my attention to eighty-four dozen bonnet crowns—I picked out twenty-eight dozen of them, which I am quite certain are mine, and I firmly believe the greater part of the rest are; they have the same marks as mine, and I have property exactly of that description—Attle was asked where he bought them; he said, "Of Bourne"—he was asked what he gave for them; he said, "Eight shillings a gross"—I said, "What! give eight shillings, and sell them for seven shillings?" he said nothing to that—as I was passing out, I saw Bourne sitting in the shop; that is on the same floor as the room where we band the things—I do not know whether he heard what was said—the wenty-eight dozen are made according to my own blocks; there is no mark on them of their having been sold—we run a red tape through them with a packing-needle when they are sold—if they are sold, they have the mark of the packing-needle—I have never sold any to the prisoner or Bourne.</p>

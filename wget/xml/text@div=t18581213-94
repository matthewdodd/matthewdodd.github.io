                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the employ Messrs. May and Ireland, 31, Bush-lane—Mr. McGregor had offices in the same house in November last, he has not now—in the beginning of November he made some communication to me. On the 10th November I saw the prisoner and a porter standing outside, at the time we were getting a hogshead of sugar into the warehouse, and when we had got it in, the prisoner and the porter came by us and went to the further end of the passage where the corks lay, and the prisoner asked me to give the porter a lift on his back with them—I did so, and asked him if it was all right—he said, "Oh, yes, it is quite right, they belong to me"—I said I did not think it was quite right—he told me he was in partnership with Mr. McGregor, and that they belonged to him as much as to Mr. McGregor—I got him detained while I went and called Mr. McGregor down, and he got a policeman and gave him in custody.</p>

               <p>were a great many persons about—the prisoner went up the stairs with me—Mr. McGregor came down first and told him he should detain him and go and get a constable, and the prisoner walked up into his room, and said he was in partnership with him, and that they belonged to him—the corks were not in Mr. McGregor's room, they were lying on the ground floor in the passage—I never saw anything of Mr. McGregor's there before—they had been lying there three or four days, I think—Mr. McGregor had not told me to watch—he said he thought he had lost a bag or two of corks—he did not tell me to stop the prisoner, because he did not know who it was—I am sure he did not mention the prisoner's name—I cannot tell how long Mr. McGregor had been there—he had been there a good deal too long—I believe he had never paid any rent—he is gone away, and we do not know where he is; I should like to see him and so would the landlord—the prisoner said in his presence that he was in partnership with him; he had said so to me before—he said the corks were as much his as Mr. McGregor's, and he used the word "partnership" also.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at 19, Great Wild-street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. I know the prisoner—I have seen him twice, that is all—I saw him first on 9th November, at the Fox-under-the-hill; he had a sack of corks there—he asked me if I would take them; I said that I would, which I did—I took them into High-street, St. Giles', and he paid me and left them at Mr. Bridges'—he paid me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for carrying them—he said if I came down with him in the city he would give me half-a-crown—we were to meet at the Fox-under-the-hill—we met there next day about half-past 12 o'clock, or from that to 1 o'clock—we came down by the halfpenny boat; we came to 31, Bush-lane, Cannon-street—he went in before me, I stopped outside with my knot—he came out in about three minutes time and and said, "Come on, put your knot on"—I went in and he took me along a back entry, and there was a great sack at the end of the passage—he said, "Put that on your knot"—I said, "I cannot; give me a lift up"—he said, "No I won't"—he called one of the warehousemen, and said, "Give this man a lift up," which he did—as I was coming along, a gentleman came up and said, "Where are you going with that, my man?"—I said, "I do not know"—the prisoner was along with me—the gentleman said, "Who ordered you to take it?"—I said, "That gentleman," the prisoner—the gentleman kept the prisoner there, and told me to take it back to where I found it, which I did; and he sent for a policeman and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

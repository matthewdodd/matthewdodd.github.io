In about a fortnight, I asked him for the sheets, and said I would give him a clean pair - he said they were not dirty, but if I wished for them, he would give them to me in the course of the day; he went away, and did not return. Five days afterwards I opened the door, and found the sheets and pillow gone. I met him two days afterwards in Ratcliff-highway, and asked him what he had done with them; he said he had taken them to his bake-house, as it was too far for him to come home to sleep; but he would bring them to me. I met him a second time and he told me the same. I met him a third time, and he said he would bring them in the course of that day. I asked if he had pawned them, and said, if he would give me the ticket, I would get them out; he went into a passion, and asked what I meant.</p>

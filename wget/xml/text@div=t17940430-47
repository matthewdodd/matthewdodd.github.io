               <p>On the 6th of January 1794, I was in <placeName id="t17940430-47-crimeloc251">Crown-court, Little Poultney-street</placeName>

On twelfth Day at night, between seven and eight, I was coming along the court, there was a large confectioner's shop, and a very great light, and a great crowd of people, which I went to get by, quite close to the wall to avoid them, the prisoner stepped up to me, and with his left arm he struck me against the wall; I gave him a punch of the breast, and said, you villain, what do you mean? and the moment I struck him I turned myself, and I felt my watch drawed out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe particularly how your watch went from you? - I felt it draw out of my fob, my fob was very tight, that made me feel, I put my hand so, and said, my watch is gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body by you, except the prisoner? - Yes, there were three or four by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any motion of the prisoner's other hand? - No farther than his pushing me against the wall, and I see him turn up his other hand under my coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hand? - No. Two boys standing close by me, on my right hand side, when I said, my watch is gone, they said, I know him, that is the man that took your watch, and I turned in that way and manner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300072"></xptr>and followed the prisoner along the court, and the boys followed him; the boys pursued the prisoner, and I followed him to the end of the court and the next street beyond, which, I think, is Brewer-street; they followed him close up all the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner walk along the court? - He did, he never run. When I came into Brewer-street, I made a stop, and I thought myself perhaps there may be a gang of them collected, and so I went no further.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him afterwards? - Yes, I see him go out of the court, into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. After that where did you see him next? - I did not see him till I came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a watch was your's? - It was a silver watch with double cases, a ribbon, and one key.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Bow-street, the prisoner was there? - He came.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him at Bow-street, how long after your watch was lost? - It was four or five days, or more, I had been there some time, he came in, he was brought in, and some men came in with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw the prisoner at the bar there, did you recollect him again? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he the same person that gave you the shove with his elbow? - That he was. I said then, that is the man, I know him particularly, when he struck me against the wall, I looked at him and I said, I knew him, by his eyes particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure now as you was then? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards he was committed? - He was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Pray whereabouts was it your watch was pulled out of your fob? - About the middle of the court, right opposite the pastry cook's shop, rather more towards Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you described it to be under an archway, did not you? - No, it was in the court.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you was robbed in the further end, and under the archway? - No, I never said no such thing; it was right opposite the pastry cook's shop, more towards Compton-street, it was more towards the other end, not the end where the archway is.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you never said you was robbed under that archway? - No, no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You said there was a large crowd, a considerable crowd? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a very dark night? - Yes; but there was a very great light at the confectioner's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have the misfortune to have lost one eye? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you describe it at Bow-street that your hat was pulled over your eye? - There was an offer, but I put my hand up just before I was robbed.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you say that your hat was pulled over your eye? - No, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before you was pushed with the man's elbow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out at all at this? - No, I tried to get by.</p>
               <p>Q. You was at this time in the middle of the crowd? - No, I tried to get through close by the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards do you think you might be from the consectioner's shop? - The court is not very wide.</p>
               <p> Q. There were a good many people between you and the confectioner's shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you was a good deal hid from the confectioner's shop, because there were a good many people between you and the confectioner's shop? - They were so many almost as filled the court.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300073"></xptr>Q. You say that this person whom you describe to be the prisoner, you see him take the watch out of your pocket? - I see his hand go up here, and I felt the watch draw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch in his hand at all? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The man walked off, you say he did not attempt to run? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call out at all? -  I did not, I followed him all along into the next street.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into Brewer-street, was there any crowd there? - I cannot say, there were four or five went after him, and the boys.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was as much as eleven or twelve days before you went to Bow-street? - Not so much as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you the curiosity to follow this man to the end of the street? - No, I did not, I came back, to go home.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came to Bow-street the boy, Mayne, was there; was not he? -  He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mayne standing close by you at the time the prisoner was brought in? - I cannot say; I think when the prisoner was brought in I was sitting down on the bench myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any transaction of his, or expression, such as this, this is the man, or pulling you by the coat? - He did not say any thing to me, he was going to say something, but the prisoner at the bar began, and so he said no more.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the only opportunity you had of seeing the prisoner was when you was pushed, and you listed up your face to him? - Yes, till he came to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you was a good deal alarmed on this occasion? -  When my watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Yes? - No, not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not that give you some alarm his attempting to pull the hat over your eyes? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. My learned friend has asked you something about an arch way, you don't know exactly where this arch way was? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. My learned friend has asked you whether the boy was going to say something, did you hear what he did say? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the boy point the prisoner out to you? - No.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you? - Going of seventeen.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being in Crown-court the twelfth night? - I was just facing the pastry cooks, it was between seven and eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light in the pastry cook's shop? - A good deal.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell the court and jury what you see that night? - The first that I saw of it; A gentlewoman went into the pastry cook's to buy a twelfth cake, and when she came out Loraine and three more of his companions, shoved her and put their hands into her pocket; and Mr. Salts stopped there and he went and shoved him, he gave him a shove so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it with his right or left arm? - I cannot recollect that, then one knocks his hat over his eyes and he takes his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Who takes his watch? - Loraine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the watch in his hand? - Yes, at the time that he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what he did with it? - He took it up with him, and his other companions followed, and then he gave the watch to the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Now what did you do on this? - I followed him all the way he went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300074"></xptr>down, he went through the passage, and them that were with him went into Little Windmill-street, and he went down into Great Windmill-street, and then I ran after him and cried stop thief I and I pursued him and catched hold of the flap of his coat at a passage going into Panton-square, I called out for assistance, and a soldier came up, and we brought him up, and there was a mob gathered together, and they said they were sure he was not the person, and they made me let him go, and then he ran down Windmill-street and I hallooed out stop thief! and I laid hold of him again once or twice, and he twisted himself round so that I could not hold him, and he ran down Coventry-street, and the patroles hearing me hallo stop thief! they took hold of him, and we took him to St. James's watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him from the time he committed the robbery to the time he was taken? - No, I was close to him, and I had seen him before he took the watch. He was about the place a good bit; I am sure he was the same person, and he is the same person that I saw at Bow-street, Jones was with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was apprehended by the patrole did he say any thing? - The patrole said I had better go and seek for the gentleman; I left him when the patrole got him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How broad is this court? - It is broader at one end than it is at the other.</p>
               <p>Q. How broad is it at the pastry cook's shop? - As broad as from here to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this happen at the pastry cook's shop or where? Was not the robbery done under the arch way? - Yes, under the arch way, not the very narrow part where the people were going through so thick, just under the end of the arch way, just against the linen draper's back door.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards do you think that is from the pastry cook's shop window? - About the distance of that desk to me,(the short hand writer's desk.)</p>
               <p>Q. A good many people were between you and the prisoner at this time? - No, I was close to him, because when I saw what he had done to the lady I followed him close.</p>
               <p>Q. It is rather dark under this arch way? - Yes,it is so.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people do you think there were between you and the old gentleman, when he was robbed? - There was nobody between me, there was people passing through.</p>
               <p>Q. You was standing close to the old gentleman's elbow when he took it? - Yes, I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always said so? - I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. You might indeed have stopped him as he was taking the watch out if you had been so inclined? - I could have taken him directly, but I did not know what they were going to do.</p>
               <p>Q. They had got a little way off before you told the old gentleman what they had done? - But I was close to him.</p>

               <p>Q. How happened it? -  I did not mind his hair, I only minded his eye, when I looked at his face, I saw he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300075"></xptr>but one eye, and could not hardly see out of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. I mean the prisoner who committed the robbery, did not he ask you whether the prisoner wore a wig or his own hair? - I don't remember that he did ask me that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he ask you how he was dressed? - Nor how he was drest.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there were some other persons there who took the man, a man of the name of glover? - Yes, there was a man that came up at the same time that said he laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Mr. Bond did not ask you how the prisoner was dressed, and whether he wore a wig or his own hair? - I do not remember that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask what sort of a man he was? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that the prisoner was running when he was secured at last? - Yes, when he was let loose from Catharine Wheel-yard he ran; he was running.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to the old gentleman that was robbed, at the time that the prisoner was produced at Bow-street? I believe you was standing close to the old gentlemen at the time that the prisoner was produced? - I was standing by the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to the old gentleman, when the prisoner was brought in? - I said nothing to the old gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. You was going to speak to him, was not you? - Not at the time that he was brought in, that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect pulling him by the coat? - No, I am sure I did not; when he was in a little while, the old man says, that is him; yes, says I.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say before the old gentleman said any thing about the man? - I said nothing to Mr. Salts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you pull him by the coat? - No, I did not touch his coat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Rose and Crown public-house, in Went<lb></lb>worth Street—on 1st July, between 5.0 and 6.0 in the afternoon, I was sprinkling the bar with water, the weather being warm—a few drops went on the face of a man who was lying on the pavement, just outside the door, on the step—I don't know whether he was asleep; he might be in a fox's sleep—he said, "All right, Mrs. Johnson," and got up and went away—the prisoner came up, and abused me very much—we have a book in which we put down the lodging account, as we keep a lodging-house as well as a public-house; and she said, if she had a knife as long as that, she would rip me open—she threw the book at me, and then she threw some kind of liquid at me; I don't know what it was—I went to a doctor—this is the dress I was wearing at the time (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—when she threw it, I stooped, and it went over my skirt; it burnt that, and my finger—she said the meant to take the color out of my face, for I had been in the house four years, and I still held the same color—the man that I had sprinkled with water came and pulled her out of the place—she had been in the house drinking, about five minutes before.</p>

               <p>have never kept vitriol in that vase—I did not catch hold of the prisoner, she caught hold of me—there was no woman there; there was a man on the other side of the bar, who is here as a witness—I applied to the Magis<lb></lb>trate for a summons next morning, and he granted a warrant—I have not given any one in charge before for an assault; Mr. Johnson has, I have not—I was insulted once, and I did not appear—I can't tell how long ago that was; it might be twelve months—I had my face scratched by a woman, and she got three days, and was fined 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I appeared against her—I know Dunaway, the policeman—I remember his case; a man brought a bottle to the house, and he was given in charge, but I did not appear, as I could not swear to the man; that was the only reason.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Rose and Crown—I was there on Wednesday night, 1st July, standing at the bar—I saw Mrs. Johnson sprinkling water about—this lady (the prisoner) came into the bar and abused Mrs. Johnson; and called her everything she could think of, in very abusive language—Mrs. Johnson said, "What is this for, I don't understand what you mean?"—she said, "Oh, I will let you know what I mean"—she took a vase off the mantlepiece, and threw it at Mrs. Johnson, and after that she took a bottle out of her bosom, and threw it at her—it was a bottle with some sort of burning stuff inside—Mrs. Johnson leant on one side, and through that it escaped her face; the remainder of it went on her dress, and burnt holes in it.</p>

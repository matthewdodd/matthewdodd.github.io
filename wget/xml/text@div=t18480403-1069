                  </hi> I am single, and am in the service of a coffee-shop keeper, at 39, Drury-lane. The prisoner occupied a room there with his son—I had a large box in my room, locked, and a small box inside it, locked, but the key was left in it—I had the key of the large one in my pocket—on the morning of Friday, 3rd March, about half-past nine o'clock, I had 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. safe in the small box, in half-crowns, shillings, sixpences, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece, and some halfpence—it was all the money I had got—about half-past five that evening I went to the box, found it unlocked, the small box open, and the money gone—the doors of the prisoner's room and mine are opposite to each other—if he came out of his room, he could see into mine—my box stood by the door, in view of he landing—when I went it my room in the morning, the door was open—the prisoner was in his bed-room—his door was shut.</p>

                  </hi> My father keeps the coffee-house. On Friday, 3rd March, I was at home about half-past three o'clock, in the second floor, and I heard footsteps in the room on the third floor where Gaffney slept—I went up, and saw the prisoner in her room, by the side of the bed—the box was ket by the door, which is about a yard from the bed-side—he had a brush in his hand—he said he had come in to fetch the brush—he said he would put the brush where he took it from—that was before Gaffney had missed her money—I told her what I had seen, and went up to look—the brush was not kept in her room—it was in his room always.</p>

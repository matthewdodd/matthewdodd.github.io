                  </hi>. I live at No. 16, Wells Street—I am a sailor—about 8.30 on the evening of the 28th March I was in Gable Street, when the prisoner came and struck me in the face, struck off my hat, and ran off with it; a minute after I turned round, and he was in custody—I never saw him before—I had not been playing with him.</p>

About 8.30 on this-evening I was in Cable Street, and saw the prisoner strike the prosecutor in the face, take his cap off his bead, and run away—I' ran after him, and caught him in 50 yards—he became very violent—the prosecutor afterwards came up, and I said I should take him in charge—he said afterwards he had only done it for a lark—the prosecutor and the prisoner were sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was about 10 yards off—another man was in front of me—I watched the prisoner because I suspected him—they were talking together first, then the prisoner struck the prosecutor a blow, which nearly knocked him over, before he ran off with his cap—a crowd' collected after I apprehended the prisoner, but not before—I have known the prisoner for years.</p>

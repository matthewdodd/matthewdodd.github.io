The prisoner was in my employ; I had some suspicion that he had robbed me, and on the 23d of July, I put forty shillings in the till, which I had marked about five o'clock in the afternoon, he was not in the habit of going to the till, it was kept locked. I left home between five and six in the evening. I have a lad in the shop also. I returned between nine and ten and gave my horse to the prisoner and went into the shop. I opened the till, and missed four of the marked shillings; they were all marked with a small cross on the check of the head. I went for a constable; the prisoner was then in the house; I called him, and said, I had a suspicion of his robbing the till, he denied it. I then told the constable to search him - he found 1 s., and a few half pence, but it was not my shilling. I asked him what he had done with the money I had paid him on that afternoon; he said, he had bought some clothes of a neighbour, of the name of Pooley, to the amount of 10 s. 6 d. I went there and we found 3 s., marked as those were in my till.</p>

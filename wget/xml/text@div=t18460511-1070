                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Moulin and Co., stone contractors and wharfingers. We were employed to pave the carriage-way of the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-fields—the prisoners Sealey and Bunce were out carters—On Wednesday, the 29th of April, they were employed in carrying paving-stones from James-street, Covent-garden to St. Martin's-street—we had occasion to take the old stones up in James-street, and to take them to St. Martin's-street—Sealey and Bunce were employed in carrying them—the men have what is called rubbish after the stones are taken up, if permission was obtained from the foreman—we never considered it any perquisite—we never knew anything could be got from it—the stones which were conveyed from James-street to St. Martin's-street could not, by any conception, be mis-taken for rubbish—it was their duty to take the stones from James-street to St. Martin's-street, and nowhere else—they stated that that day seven loads had been taken by them to St. Martin's-street—about seven o'clock that evening I was walking in the neighbourhood of Lisson-grove, and I saw two of my own carts of stones—Sealey and Bunce were with them—it was no part</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184605110079"></xptr>
               <p>of their duty to be there—I followed the carts—they turned into Earl-street, and from there to Little Grove-street—they stopped opposite the prisoner Hales' premises, which are down a street that is open at both ends—they shot the stones out, and I went for a policeman—(they had taken seven loads to St. Martin's-street—this was the eighth load—if they had done their duty they should have deposited that load in St. Martin's-street, and then have returned with their empty carts to have given their account)—I was not gone more than ten minutes for a policeman—when I returned, the stones had been removed from where they had shot them, to just inside the door of Hales' premises, and there appeared to have been some ground shovelled up upon them—Hales' premises are a coach-house, with rooms over—there are large folding doors—I found Hales standing against the door of the coach-house—I saw a boy there with a shovel in his hand shovelling a little loose ground outside—I went up and said to Hales, "Who do these premises belong to?"—he said, "To a person at Vauxhall"—I then called in the policeman and he put the same question to Hales—he at first said they belonged to a person at Vauxhall, and then he said, "If I must tell you, they belong to me"—the policeman put some other questions to Hales, but I took very little notice of them—I recollect Hales said that he bought the stones for rubbish of two carts which had brought them there—the stones were in a damp state at the lower end, as if they had just been taken up in the street—the stones I saw Sealey and Bunce shoot were worth from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton—there were not less than two tons of them certainly—if they had been such stones as are broken up for macadamizing they would have been worth from 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton, but these were better than would be taken for that purpose—they were very good ones—it sometimes happens that stones are not good enough for a place where there is a great traffic, but good enough for a place where there is less traffic.</p>

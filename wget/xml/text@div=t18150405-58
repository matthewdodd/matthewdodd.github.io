I left him in security of a person of the name of Stamford, and when I returned to Stamford, Stamford told me he had told him all about it; the magistrate took down what the prisoner said in writing; it was read over to him before he signed it; this is the paper; the prisoner signed it, and the magistrate signed it also.</p>

We then proposed to go down, which we did; we arrived there at four o'clock; we went to the chapel at Tottenham, where I knew Mr. Elliott was in the habit of going; we saw him there; from there we went to his house; George with a chissel opened his shutters, and entered his house, struck a light, he had a tinder-box with him for the purpose; I told him where the drawer was; he brought me several watches, and old watch cases, and some old silver, a gold seven shilling piece, with which we both came away to London, and at the corner of Widegate-street; we parted. When I went to my room, I took out all the articles he had stolen, and shewed them so Mr. Barnes, a fellow lodger, who was quite astonished, and said James, you have been in bad company; I told him I had been at the other end of the town at a bawdy-house. Barnes called up my landlord; the landlord advised me to take the property to the young fellow, my companion; I took a gold watch to the pawnbrokers by the church in Spitalfields, I offered it for a guinea. I said I had it of a sailor; the young man told me to fetch the sailor; I went out, but did not return, for fear of being stopped; I pawned another watch close to the trunpike in the Commercial-road, a silver hunting watch, with a diamond, made by Miller, at Tottenham; the other watches I gave over to my companion. I and my companion roved about for several days together; he wished to be engaged in other robberies; I said, I would do no more, I was so uneasy in my mind; he said, he would go to France; I do not know where he is;</p>

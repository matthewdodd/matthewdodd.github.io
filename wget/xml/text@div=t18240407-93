The prisoner came to lodge and board with us, on the 12th or 13th of February - she was a stranger before that, She sometimes slept in one room and sometimes in another, she had no particular room. My husband and I sleep in the shop. We keep our property there in a box. On Sunday, the 22d of February, we missed the box, clothes, and all together, just before 10 o'clock in the morning, when we got up. I also missed a band-box, containing my bonnet and feathers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go to bed on Saturday night - A. Yes, she went to bed before us, and slept on the second floor that night - she was in the habit of doing little things for us, and lighting my fire. The box was on the top of my bureau bedstead, and was safe when we went to bed. I heard her come into our room about seven o'clock in the morning - she set about lighting the fire, but I did not hear her go out. I and my husband were in bed, and when we got up at ten o'clock we missed this property, and she had left the house. I had not heard her go out of the room. She had been nine days with us, and had given no warning. I had no reason to suppose that she was going, I am sure that the box was on the top of our bedstead when we went to bed, There was a lamp burning in the room when she was there, We let the house out in lodgings - some of the lodgers are single women.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take them in without a character - A. Yes. I fell asleep while she was in the room, and did not see what she did. I did not awake till near ten o'clock - the trunk was a paper one, it contained the property stated in the indictment, (enumerating it) It was locked and I kept the key. I had opened it on the Saturday, night to put the money into it. The property was worth 9 l. 5 s. altogether. I have since seen my bonnet and feathers, the skirt of a gown, and another gown cut up into aprons, on the 22d of February, when she was taken.</p>

            . I rent this house, and let lodgings to single women. The last witness is my wife. A band-box, with the bonnet and feathers, and another with the clothes, were both on the top of the bedstead, over our heads. The prisoner came into the room about seven o'clock on Sunday morning - she made herself useful about the house - I was half asleep and half awake when she came in - she left the room before I went to sleep. I awoke rather before ten, and found the trunks gone, and went in pursuit of her. She was taken ten or twelve days after. She was brought to our house by a female, and said she came from Brighton, and wanted a lodging; two other females lodged with me at the time, and are there now; they did not go away. I took the prisoner myself, drinking with a gentleman at a public-house in the Old Bailey, with my wife's beaver bonnet, feathers, and gown on. I produce them.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of March, the prisoner was given into my custody - and after she was committed for re-examination, the prosecutor and prosecutrix identified the bonnet, feathers, and gown on her back. I asked where she lived, and at last ascertained that it was at Mrs. Shields's, No. 3, Queen's Gardens, Brompton. I searched her apartment there, and found a hat-box, and some pieces which the prosecutrix says have been cut off her gown, and here is an apron which Mrs. Shields gave me. She appeared in distress.</p>
               <p>RUTH BAMBER. This is my band-box; the apron is<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182404070046"></xptr>made out of my gown, and here is the body of it. My trunk and all were taken.</p>

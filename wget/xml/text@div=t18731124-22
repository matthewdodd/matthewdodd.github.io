                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi> 130). About 8.30 on the morning of 21st October, I was on duty in London Wall with Harding—I saw Moses carrying a bag, and followed him along into Widegate Street, Bishopsgate, where I stopped him—I asked him what was in the bag, he said "Remnants of cloth"—I asked him where he got them from—he said "From a ware house in the City"—I asked where the warehouse was, and he said it was somewhere near H. E. and M. Moses and Sons, clothiers, and the man who gave them to him was Page, and he worked for a Mr. Meyer—he said after wards that Page had called on him that morning at his own residence, Montague. Street, Whitechapel, and told him to come to the warehouse along with him—I took him to the station, searched him, and found 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—he gave his address 1, Old Montague Street, Whitechapel—I found in the bag six pieces of cloth, measuring 12 3/4 yards, three pieces of Italian cloth, and four pieces of lining, and at his lodging I found two yards of tweed, 1 1/2 yards nap cloth, and materials for three coats.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Meyer &amp; Co., 4, Wells Street, Falcon Square, wholesale clothiers—Page has been in their employ twelve or fourteen years—he commenced as errand boy, and afterwards he was cutter and foreman—it was his duty to take in work, and to give out work in my absence, and cut out work—we give the cloth out in cut gar ments; they are cut before they go out—Moses was one of our work-people for about four or five years—he had work for us at the time he was taken into custody—we have goods in stock like these goods which were found in the bag—they are not cut at all, and would not be given out for making boys' trousers—we have goods in stock like these, with the exception of this piece of velveteen—the value of the goods found in the bag is 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I see here 2 yards of tweed materials for three coats, and 1 1/2 yards of nap cloth—I took patterns of them and compared them with our stock—they match exactly—when they were shown to me I knew that they were common goods used throughout the trade, but there was one piece which we had had for five years—the value of those goods is about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the value of the goods found in Page's house, without the velveteen, would be about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have things such as those in stock—Page had no authority to give these goods to Moses—this bag is ours.</p>

I have compared the velveteen since the examination at the Police Court, and I have doubts about its being ours—the other things are worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that includes the little boy's coat—I don't know that Page has got a little boy—his hours were from 8.30 till we had finished work in the evening—we don't make for private customers but for shops—Page has given great satisfaction as a cutter.</p>

This is not a proper bag to take these things about in, because the fluff would come off and spoil some of the light goods—we have not a very large business; we make for all the shops we can—I can hardly say how many garments are made up in the course of the day—we have got stuff like this in stock, and so have a great many other people—Page gave goods out in my absence, but not without entering them in a book—if goods were sent out they would have to be entered in a book, and a ticket given to the person and the counterfoil kept—I have not the counterfoil for the three coats—they have not been entered.</p>

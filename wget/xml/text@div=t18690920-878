I keep the Oxford Arms, Westminster Bridge Board—on Saturday, 7th August, I saw the prisoner, about 5.15—he called at my house in a cab—he remained about twenty minutes—he was neither drunk or sober; he was about half-and-half—there was no one with him—I was called before the Magistrate, and gave evidence there—I have seen this trick before—the prisoner had it when he was at my house.</p>

I am a firework seller, and live at 3, Leigh Place, West-minster Bridge Road—on Saturday, 7th August, I was at the Oxford Arms—I saw the prisoner there, very much intoxicated, at the bar—it was about 5.30, as near as I can recollect—he had a stick under his arm—I can't tell you whether this is the stick—I did not notice it particularly—he was eating a portion of a fried sausage, and had a glass of ale on the counter.</p>

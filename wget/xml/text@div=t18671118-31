                  </hi>. I am the wife of Henry Keene, and am assistant to Michael Myers, a trunkmaker, of 27, Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square—on 27th May the prisoner called in a brougham—I went down to it, and she asked me to let her see some ladies' travelling dress-trunks—I asked her if I should bring them to the carriage—she said yes, as she was such a very great invalid she could not get out—I took some trunks down to her with the porter's assistance, and she selected two, but she required some alterations in them, and the letter "H" painted on them very large, as her Christian name was Harriet—I was to send a receipted bill, as they would be paid for on delivery—she gave her name, Mrs. Frazer, The Cottage, Hampstead, and drove away—on 29th May a tall woman calling herself Mrs. Frazer's maid drove up in the brougham—she had a defect in one of her eyes—she gave me this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with "Mrs. Frazer" on it—she said that Mrs. Frazer sent</p>

               <p>that card, and asked if we would lend her one of our travelling trunks until her own was finished, as she was called out of town unexpectedly—I lent her one, value three guineas—her boxes were to be sent home on the Friday, and this was to be returned—I gave her boxes, with "H" on them, to the porter on the Friday, and the receipted bill—he carried them away and brought them back the same day—I did not see the prisoner again until she was in custody—I heard no tidings of her or of the trunk—I identified a box which was shown to me at Marlborough Street,</p>

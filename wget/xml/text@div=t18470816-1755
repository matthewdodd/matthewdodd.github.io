                  </hi> I am superintendent of the business of Joseph Cole<lb></lb>batch, of Lower Thames-street—on the 7th of July the prisoner was employed as a porter to bring up some spelter from the quay to our warehouse—it was Mr. Colebatch's property—I have seen the spelter produced by the officer—I am quite sure by the mark that it is Mr. Colebatch's property.</p>

                  </hi> I am a lighterman, and live at St. George's-in-the-East—on the 7th of July, a little before twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner place a plate of spelter behind a gate in Beer-lane, which is about 200 yards from Galley-quay—there were two other men standing at the corner of Beer-lane.</p>

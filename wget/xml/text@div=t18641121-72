                  </hi>. I am a printer, and live at 2, Cambridge-cottages, Camberwell—on Saturday, 15th October, between half-past 4 and 5, I was in Poplar-row, Newington-causeway—I was followed by three men—when I got some distance down, they knocked my hat off, and kicked it about the road—the prisoner was one of those men—I can't say which of them knocked my hat off, because that was done behind me—I stopped to pick it up—they knocked it off two or three times, and just before I got into the Kent-road, two of them came before me, and one behind, and pushed me up against a fence—one of them used the expression. "You shan't go any further," and one of them put his arms round my neck—I think the one behind me—im<lb></lb>mediately after that I felt a tug at my waistcoat-pocket, where my watch was; I felt for it, and missed it—my watch was safe before I met these men, because I looked at it to see how long I had to catch the train at the Elephant and Castle station—all three of them ran away in different directions; I and others followed, but we lost sight of them down Lock's-fields—I heard no more of it till the following morning, when I was called to the police-station at Stone's-end to see if I could identify the prisoner—I picked him out from a dozen others, as one of the men—I have not seen my watch since—I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you seen either of the men before that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not before that day—I was excited and alarmed—I gave inform<lb></lb>tion to the police directly after the robbery, and was sent for to go to the station on the following morning—I suppose the people I picked him out from were pri<lb></lb>soners—none of them were policemen in plain clothes that I am aware of—a</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This witness being deaf and dumb, gave his evidence through an interpreter.</hi>) I live at 20, Chatham-place, Walworth—I know the prisoner—on 15th October, about half-past 4, I saw the prosecutor struggling with the prisoner in Poplar-row, and then saw the prisoner run away—another man was with him, who also ran away; a friend was with me—I followed the prisoner as far as Union-row, and there lost sight of him—I had seen the prisoner before in Kent-road.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 244). I received information of the robbery, and a description of the thieves on Saturday night, and went in search of the prisoner, and two others not in custody—on Monday night I was walking along High-street, Borough, and saw the prisoner with another man—I took them both into custody—on the way to the station the prisoner said, "What do you want me for?"—I said "You are wanted, with two others, for stealing a watch in Poplar-row, on Saturday night"—he said, "I know nothing of it"—I took him to the station—the inspector sent a con<lb></lb>stable to the prosecutor's house; he came—the prisoner was put with three other prisoners who were then in the cells, and the prosecutor identified the prisoner as one of the men who had robbed him of his watch.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were either of the three police-constables in plain clothes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I am quite sure of that—they were prisoners who had been brought in there—there were four altogether with the prisoner—there were two about the same height as the prisoner, and one of them shorter; none of them were a head taller; there might have been a little difference in them—when the prosecutor came to the station, I told him that I had one of the men—that was before he picked the prisoner out—the prosecutor said that he had given a description of a short, carrotty-haired man—the prisoner was the only man with red hair amongst the four.</p>

                  </hi>. I wrote this order of 12th Sept. from the prisoner's dictation—(<hi rend="italic">this was an order for a blue shell jacket, with the particulars, for Lieut. Dowse, Royal Artillery, Woolwich.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued.</hi>) This order was executed out of my cloth and material—I do not know who took the jacket away; but shortly after, I received a letter by post from Lieut. Dowse, which I handed to the prisoner, saying, "How it this, Lieut. Dowse writes to say he has not ordered this jacket?"—I do not remember the precise words he used, but I think it was, "I dare say Lieut. Dowse is not aware I am here; I will go down and see about it," and he left for the purpose of going, taking the letter with him—next morning he brought the jacket, and said it was all right, he had tried it on to Lieut. Dowse, and it was rather tight under the arm, and required a little alteration; and it was sent into the workshop for that purpose—I did not see it after that—here is an entry in my delivery-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—a portion of it in my son's writing, and a portion in the prisoner's—the prisoner's writing is, "Delivered to servant, by J. Donegan," and that is written under "Tuesday, 8th Oct., 1850, Lieut. Dowse, Royal Artillery, one blue shell jacket"—I discharged the prisoner in Dec., and he entered the service of Mr. Stovill about 1st Jan.—I believe I afterwards sent for him to come to my place, and requested Mr. Stovill to come with him—I had to apply to him several times—I did not see him myself—I wrote to him, and sent Mr. White and some other of my people—he was at last found in the street, and brought by Mr. White—I called his attention to Lieut. Dowse's account in my ledger, and said, "Is this account of Lieut. Dowse, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., correct?"—I had the ledger open—I do not know whether he saw the account—it is in my clerk's writing, but the prisoner was aware of what it was, because he had put the prices to it him<lb></lb>self—he said, "Yes, it is correct"—I said, "Recollect about this shell jacket"—he said, "Well, that is not delivered"—I asked him whether Lieut. Dowse had had it, and he said, "No"—I asked why, and he said Lieut. Dowse was absent on leave—I said, "Where is it?"—he said it was somewhere, mentioning some name which I forget, and I said, "Then you</p>

               <p>will give me an order for it"—he made these several attempts (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) to write an order, but was too nervous to write, and Mr. Stovill wrote an order, which the prisoner signed—I called his attention to other accounts in the ledger, and afterwards gave him into custody.</p>

Dowse's order for a shooting-jacket, on 22nd Oct.; his reply was, I wrote it down at the time, "Donegan says he has seen the lieu<lb></lb>tenant wear them."</p>

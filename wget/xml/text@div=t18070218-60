On Monday the 26th of January Mr. Ford sent for me to come and see whether my grandmother's property was safe. I came, and on opening the drawer where the box was in, I found it gone. I found it in the third drawer, and there were only two guineas in it; the last time I saw it it contained nine guineas.</p>

             keeps the house, he does not live there himself, he lets out the whole house in lodgings; he lives at the top of the yard in another house. I had suspicion; I sent for her grand daughter to come and see if her grandmother's property was safe I went up to Mrs. Powell's apartment, the prisoner was sitting on her bed; I asked how she could be so cruel after Mrs. Powell had been so kind to take her in, for to take her property from her. I then told her if she had any of it to produce it; I would have a constable and search her if she did not. She then produced nineteen shillings and sixpence farthing, I said to her this is not all you have left out of the seven guineas. She said she did not take seven guineas, she only took four. I heard her confess that the clothes that she had bought was with the money that she took from Mrs. Powell.</p>
               <p>- MILES. I am a constable. I was sent for to take her in custody; when I went there she pointed out the things that she had bought with the old woman's money; I have brought them here; she said she took four guineas from the old woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Miles asked me what money I could make up for the money I had taken. I gave him nineteen shillings and two pence farthing. I told him that was all that I had got. He said it would be a great deal better for me if I would own to it.</p>

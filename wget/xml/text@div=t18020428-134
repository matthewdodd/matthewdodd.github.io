             sworn. - The prisoner first came to our house the latter end of January, and staid seven weeks; he represented himself to be a soldier, belonging to the 27th Light Dragoons; he run up a score of upwards of eight pounds, which I asked him to pay; he pretended to go to the office to get the prize-money he had to receive, and he would pay; on the 24th of March, he took me to Mr. Crosdale's officer, who, he said, was the agent belonging to the regiment; I waited for him just by, and he returned to me, saying, Mr. Crosdale was not at home, but that the clerk said, if he called at five o'clock, he would receive his money; when we went at five o'clock, the officer was shut; he said, he knocked at the door, and spoke to Mr. Crosdale, who told him to be there the next morning at ten o'clock, but then it was past office-hours; I went with him next morning to the same place; he came, and told me, Mr. Crosdale was not at home, but that he was to call at half past twelve, which he did; I was in a public-house, almost opposite; then, he said, he must wait a little longer, the course of half an hour, or so, when he went again, and brought back a loose paper in his hand, and said, I must go to Mr. Davison's, in Millbank-street, Westminster, which I did, at No. 21, and Mr. Davison told me to get a few lines to certify that Mr. Crosdale had drawn the money, and crossed the books; the prisoner was to wait till I went back; on my return to the public-house, he was gone; I did not wait long, but went to Mr. Crosdale's office to enquire after him, when I found he was an impostor; the next day, he was taken; I did not authorize him to go to my sister for money on any account, nor did I pass my word for any sum whatever, or remain at any place as security for any sum.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give you a note to go to Mr. Davison's to receive prize-money, when I was sick - did you not write a note, and I sign it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Were you not convinced at that time I had money coming to me? - A. They told me, if you had a proper certificate from the regiment, they would pay, if you had any money due.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not Mr. Young, the lawyer, go down to Milbank-street, and tell you there was money coming to me? - A.He said, he had been to seek after it, and he understood there was prize-money to receive for the Cape of Good-Hope.</p>
               <p>Q.Did I not give you a note to go to the India-House? - A. Yes, and they said they knew nothing of the note or him who wrote it, but if there was any money due to him, he must get a proper certificate.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not Mr. Young write a letter to get a certificate? - A. He did, and I received an answer from Lieutenant Hughes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had money coming to me, sufficient to pay the debt; I own to the debt, but not to receiving the money under false pretences.</p>

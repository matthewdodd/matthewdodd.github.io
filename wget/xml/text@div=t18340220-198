               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Did not you take him to be a friend? A. I thought at first he was one of my customers - I could not keep my ring on, for he is stronger than I am.</p>

             (police-constable H 51). I was called, and the prosecutor had the prisoner by the collar - he said the prisoner had taken a ring from his finger - there were two women near him - the prosecutor had been drinking, but knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prosecutor collar the prisoner? A. No; he said afterwards, that the prisoner gave the ring to one of the women; it has not been found.</p>

            . On the night of this robbery, I met the prosecutor at Three Coldt-corner - he greatly insulted me, and followed to a house where I was going - I asked him what he meant, and he put his hands in my face- I told him he took great liberties - I could not get into the house, where I was going to sleep, and the prisoner came up, and the prosecutor gave charge of him - he had no ring on when he put his hands in my face.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was any body with you? A. No - I am not married - I am in the workhouse - the prosecutor was very tipsy. <rs id="t18340220-198-verdict1135" type="verdictDescription">

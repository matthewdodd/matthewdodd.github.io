                  </hi>. I am a stationer, at 208, High-street, Shoreditch. On 17th Nov. a person named Price made an application to me, and referred me to Charles Neville, 48, Whiskin-street, Clerkenwell—I went there—it was a moderately respectable house—the prisoner came to the door—I asked him if his name was Neville—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I have come about the amount of money you have offered to become security for, for Price"—he said, "Yes, I know him very well; his wife is about being confined; it will be all right"—I asked him how long he had lived there—he said, "Three years"—I said, "Have you got any receipts I can look at?"—he said, "Yes," and showed me some from a drawer—I did not look at them all, but I saw one for rent due at Michaelmas—Price came in the evening, and had the money—I have only had 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it back—if I had not believed the prisoner was a respectable person, and had paid rent for three years, I should not have let Price have the money—I advanced it on the representation of the prisoner alone—in consequence of what I saw in the newspaper, I found the prisoner in custody—he is the same person.</p>

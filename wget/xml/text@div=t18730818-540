                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Cross, tobacco pipe manufacturer, of 9, Albert Road, Mile End—on 17th June, about 10 a. m., I was at the factory; a portion of the road is up for sewer work; about 7 feet 2 of the road was left between the sewer and the pavement, on the same side as the factory—I saw the little boy, Frederick Rowland Brown, standingly the lamp-post on the opposite side—the bottom part of the lamp-post is flush with the kerb, but the child had his feet in the gutter, and his hands behind him, leaning against the lamp-post—he was standing still—I saw the prisoner coming along Brooksby Walk, driving his greengrocer's cart and a middling sized horse, at the rate of six or seven miles an hour—he called out to the child twice or three times, "Get out of the road"—I did not see the child move—the cart came in contact with him, and he fell over on the kerb—his body was in the gutter and his head on the kerb—the prisoner drove on about 20 yards after the child was killed—he passed me, and I heard him say "Young devil, I told him to get out of the way"—he was then putting the reins over the horse, and going to get cut—he had stopped when he said that—he went towards the child, who was then in a man's arms—I was on the opposite side; I did not see the wheel strike him—this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) represents the locality—I saw Mr. Cross come out at his garden gate—he said to the prisoner "You ought to be able to stop your horse, a child could stop it"—the prisoner said "I suppose you say I <hi rend="italic">done</hi> it for the purpose"—Mr. Cross said "It appears you did"—the prisoner attempted to pull off his coat to fight—he was going at the same pace as he passed the lamp-post as he was when he called out.</p>

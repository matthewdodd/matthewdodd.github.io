I found my wife with another man, and turned her away the next day, and she took all I had got in the world, my bed, and every thing else. I went to Rag-Fair the next day, and bought me a pair of sheets; they cost me five shillings and nine-pence. I came home about half after six, and found the prisoner in my room, with a candle; she came out when she heard my trussel coming in.</p>
               <p>When was this? - The 21st of January.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had not appointed her to come there, had you? - No; I did not. I have a wooden leg; she heard me coming, and came out of the room; this shirt, and this neckcloth (producing them) were under her arm, and she had the sheets in her apron. I seised her; she laid hold of my wooden leg, threw me on my back, and got away. I took the shirt and neckcloth from her at the time.</p>
               <p>How do you know she had the sheets? - I saw a bundle in her apron; she had this in her hand (producing a bit of a poker) which she had opened the door with. I had her taken up, and Justice Clark discharged her. I went to Hicks's-Hall and indicted her. When she found I had indicted her, she got a warrant against me, and Justice Wilmot sent me to Bridewell till my neighbours bailed me out. She swore I beat her.</p>

               <p>I have nothing to say to this man; he hurt me greatly. His wife and I were in partnership in selling greens. He robbed my stall because his wife was with me. I supported his wife nine weeks. The sheets he says I stole were hop sacks his wife gave me to put before me. I never was in his house; he has sworn falsely against me, my lord.</p>

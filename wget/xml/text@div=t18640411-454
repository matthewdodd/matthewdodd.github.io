I am clerk at the Justice-room, at Guildhall—the depositions taken on 24th March are here—two persons named Finch and Powell were brought there in custody—the charge would appear by the charge-sheet at the station-house—there was no charge-sheet signed at the Justice-room—Finch and Powell were examined on oath—the Magistrate or myself always have the charge-sheet on the desk—I do not write down the charge, merely the prisoner's name—I never write down what he is charged with, unless I have some special reason for doing so—I did not in this case, certainly—they were remanded—if I had the depositions before me, I could say to what day—(<hi rend="italic">the depositions were ordered to be sent for</hi>)—there was no warrant in the case of Finch and Powell; they were brought in custody—I have not my original minutes here, but these depositions were copied from them, and I examined them myself, and know them to be a correct copy of my minutes—the entry of remand is in Mr. Davy's, the second clerk's, handwriting—the original minutes are at the Guildhall—I have not seen any attorney for the prosecution in this case; I only received my suboena at 1 o'clock to-day, without telling me what I was to prove or produce, or anything about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and am servant to the prisoner and her husband, who is an engineer in the navy, living at 436, New Cross Road, Deptford—I have been ten months in their service—they had two children, William John Bell, the deceased, aged nine years and seven months, and Mary Ann, aged twenty-five—on Saturday afternoon, 11th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100113"></xptr>
               <p>May, about four o'clock, I let Miss Bell out at the front door, and went down into the kitchen—my mistress was not there—I went into the break<lb></lb>fast-room, which is on the same floor as the kitchen, and saw a stream of blood flowing towards the cupboard—it came from the deceased, who was lying with his head near a packing-case, and his feet on the hearthrug—I went up stairs to my mistress, and asked her what was the matter—she said, "He aggravated me, he aggravated me, he made me do it, I was obliged to do it"—she was then up stairs, near her bedroom door—I left her and came down stairs to call my master from the drawing-room—my mistress appeared very wild, and her eyes appeared to be starting from her head, and she was rolling herself backwards and forwards on the stairs, and wringing her hands—I met my master coming from the drawing-room, and asked him to go down and see what was the matter with Master Willie—he went down, and I was on the stairs when he brought the child in his arms—I went for Dr. Hope—I met him in the Florence Road—I also fetched Mrs. Cofferton, a neighbour—when I returned my master was up stairs holding my mistress in the bedroom—the knife was in the breakfast-room, lying on the table—there was blood on it—it was a large-bladed knife, with a white handle—I had cut the child a piece of bread and butter about three o'clock that afternoon, and left the knife and bread and cheese on the packing-case—that was about twenty-five minutes before I saw him bleeding—he was sitting at the table writing in a copy<lb></lb>book, and his mamma was sitting on the opposite side with her arms folded—that was the last I saw of him alive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That was about an hour before you saw him with his throat cut, was it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; it was about twenty-five minutes to four, and it was about four, or it might have been a little after, that I went down stairs and saw him lying with his throat cut—this is a common bread knife—I had taken it in with the bread and butter a short time before—I had been with Mrs. Bell about ten months—she was always very kind to the little fellow—he was a healthy child—I saw her after this was done—she appeared wild—she was wringing her hands and throwing herself forward—she seemed like a person out of her mind—a few weeks before this I had washed a napkin for her, it was stained, but not much—I had never washed one for her before—I believe she is fifty-six years of age—she was clean in her underlines but she wore the same dress the whole time I was there—she did not change it—she was a very kind mistress to me—she appeared in a very melancholy kind of state—she would sit with her arms folded and not say anything to you—she would just walk up and down, and be in a very melancholy way—she would continue in that state perhaps for an hour or more at a time—she seemed to me to continue the same as usual—I did not notice her getting worse—I have observed this from the first time of going into the service—I cannot say how often I have observed her in this melancholy state—she would often be so, walking about in and out—lat<lb></lb>terly she was very fidgetty, and she would frequently be behind me when I was not aware of it—I would be standing doing something in the kitchen, and when I went to turn round I would see her behind me—I did not kuow that she was there—she would not speak—it would startle me to see her there—she gave no explanation for it—she has looked the same at those times—I did not notice anything particular in her more than usual—I did not say anything to her about it, because I did not take notice of it till this occurrence, and then it occurred to my mind—on the Thurs<lb></lb>day,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186706100114"></xptr>
               <p>as the child was killed on the Saturday, I remarked to Miss Bell how fidgetty her mamma was when we were doing her bedroom—when I had put the blinds up she told me that I had done them wrong; I had done them right, and she would come and ask me why I did the stove in that way—I had brushed it with black-lead; that was the proper thing to do, but she was fidgetty, and says a thing was wrong when it was right—when I showed her how I had put the blinds she was satisfied—I could not have put them any other way because of the cords—it was impossible to have done them as she wanted—she never went out of the house the whole time I was there, not even in the garden—on the same Saturday that the little boy was killed I took some spoons into the room and dropped one, Mrs. Bell was apparently asleep, and my dropping the spoon dis<lb></lb>turbed her, she looked up very wild and asked me why I wanted to drop the spoon and disturb her from her sleep—I had never noticed her speak so crossly to me before—I observed a peculiar wild look about her, and I was glad to get out of the room away from her—that was about half-past three o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As far as the melancholy went, you say that it did not increase when you were there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not notice it—she used to teach the little boy his lessons—she was very kind to him in trying to help him with his lessons that he did not like—she would sit by his side trying to assist him—she used to come about the house, but not to give orders—if this occurrence had not taken place, perhaps I should not have noticed anything, but when this occurred I thought of these things—I have told all that I noticed—I thought it was very singular that she was cross when I dropped the spoon—I have dropped spoons before and she would take no notice, and I have upset the box sometimes and she would take no notice—she was fidgetty with me about the work—when I explained it she ap<lb></lb>peared satisfied, and understood what I said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you about the house between the time of leaving the room and going down and finding the boy dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was up stairs, at the top of the house, in the front bedroom—there are three storeys to the house—I did not hear any noise whatever, or any sound—when I left them in the breakfast-room they were on the best of terms—the little boy went to school at Croome's Hill, he would take his dinner' at school, it was too far for him to come home—he had been ill a little for a week before, nothing serious; but he had been to school that week—my mistress would sometimes take a book in her hand, but very seldom—when she did read, it was the Bible or Prayer Book—I do not think she read other books; I have not noticed it—lately she has not taken any book to read—we very seldom have visitors, and she would not see them if any came, unless it was any very particular friend—she kept to herself very much, and did not care to see any one, Miss Bell always saw the visitors—there was no one that she was in the habit of seeing in particular—we used to have family prayers of an evening, but Mrs. Bell would disturb us while Mr. Bell was reading prayers and tell me to draw the filtered water off, and tell me to take some little thing off the table, and it used to fidget Mr. Bell while we were reading prayers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Hopetown Villa, Wyckham Terrace, Lewisham Road—On 11th May, about ten minutes past four, I was fetched by the last witness to the prisoner's house—I went down to see the boy directly; he was lying on the floor—this was after the father had moved him—a stream of blood had flowed from a wound in the neck from the</p>

               <p>packing-case towards the cupboard—he was quite dead—the wound in the neck was the cause of death—it was a most frightful gash, extending almost from ear to ear in front, right down to the backbone—I saw a knife lying on the table; it was marked with blood; it appeared perfectly fresh; in fact, apportion of it was not congealed—I subsequently examined the body more minutely—in my opinion, attempts had been made to cut off the head after the wound was inflicted—I then went up stairs—I found the prisoner pacing the room and her husband following her, watching her—she was in a very excited state, moving backwards and forwards; she was not crying; the husband appeared also greatly excited, pacing the room in quite an agony—he said, "What are you going to do now? You have killed my child; what are you going to do to yourself?"—she made no answer; I should say she did not appear to understand what was said—she wished to go to a particular drawer—I said to her, "What are you going to do?"—I took hold of her hands to prevent her, and said, "What made you do it"—she replied, "He aggravated me to do it"—she asked for water or tea; I would hot allow her to have it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think I gather from you that the appearance of the prisoner caused the impression upon your mind that at that moment she was out of her mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say she was not responsible—I have heard the evidence given by the servant about the stain on the napkin—I would not go quite so far as to say that indicated a change of life—women in respect of whom there has been a cessation of the menses, and then a sudden slight reappearance, are more subject to morbid action of the brain than at any other time—she had passed the average period, not by a con<lb></lb>siderable period; sometimes it will continue up to fifty-two, and this might be an exceptional case—she had passed the usual period.</p>

I am a general practitioner at Deptford—on Saturday, 11th May, I went to the prisoner's house and saw the dead body of the child—this knife was lying on the table, there was blood upon it, which was fluid at that time—I then went and saw the prisoner—I noticed blood on her dress—there was a wild appearance about the features, but she had then sunk into a sort of melancholy condition—she was not crying—I heard Mr. Hope's opinion as to the cause of death, and concur in it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I think you had this unhappy lady under your surveillance for the next thirty-six hours after she was taken into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I saw her five or six times during those hours—I think it was about a quarter-past five when I first saw her—she then appeared like a person who was suffering from some aberration of mind—taking all the collateral circumstances into consideration, I certainly think she was not a responsible agent for the act she had done—she certainly had the appear<lb></lb>ance of a demented person.</p>

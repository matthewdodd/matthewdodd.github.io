                  </hi>. On the 19th of August, about ten o'clock at night, I was on duty in Great Queen-street—I saw a crowd coming from Lincoln's Inn-fields—I went from there to Bow-street and gave information, and on my return saw a policeman with a prisoner in custody—the crowd were hissing and yelling at the police—the prisoner was pointed out, and the person who pointed said, "That is the man who knocked the policeman down, I shall give him in charge for it, and go and prefer a charge against him"—I had not seen the man down myself—on the charge being given I took hold of him—he resisted, and struck me a violent blot in the mouth, as soon as I took hold of him, I, with assistance, got him to the station, and detained him on a charge of assaulting me in the execution of my duty.</p>

Three weeks—no inquiry was made by the Commissioners as to the conduct of the police on this occasion that I am aware of—my conduct was not in<lb></lb>quired into that I know of—I received a notice that it would be better to resign, that was the reason I did so—I should not have gone just then if I had not received the notice—I refuse to state why I received the notice—it was represented that I had used considerable brutality to my wife, but I never did—the Commissioners did not examine me nor ask me for an ac<lb></lb>count—they sent my notice to the superintendent—I had been before the Commissioners one day, but they did not inquire of me about it—that is the only act of violence I was ever charged with—I was once punished for being drunk.</p>

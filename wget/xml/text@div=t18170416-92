            . I am servant to E. Fleming, pawnbroker. On the 29th of March the prisoner came to my master's shop, and offered to pledge a gold chain - He said it was gold; I tried it in the usual way, and it proved to be gold-(I have been in the trade fifteen years). I offered him 25s. for it; we could not agree about the price, and I returned it to him. He waited in the shop for a few minutes, and then said he would take the money. He gave me a chain, and I lent him the money. I thought it was the same; but on Monday morning, an officer came, and asked me if I had taken such a chain in. I looked at the one he gave me, and observed that it was not gold, but it was of the same pattern. I am positive that the first chain I looked at was gold.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 29th of March, Mr. Sowerby sent for me - He is a pawnbroker, in Chiswell-street - he gave the prisoner into my charge. I found a gold chain in his hat-it was tried, and proved to be gold. Mr. Sowerby charged him with offering a chain of the same pattern as the gold one, as gold-it was of the same pattern as the gold one which I found on him. I also found a duplicate of a chain pledged at Fleming's, on him. I went there, and saw a chain of the same pattern. I produce it.</p>

            . That duplicate I gave to the prisoner. The gold chain has the mark on it where I tried it-the chain left with me is only worth 7s.</p>

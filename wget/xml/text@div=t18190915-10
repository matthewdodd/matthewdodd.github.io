On the 25th of August I made the house quite secure, and went to bed last. I heard a noise about half-past twelve, and at two o'clock in the night, like the creaking of a door, but thought it was at the next house. About half-past five o'clock, I was alarmed, and informed that my door was open - it was light then. I found the iron bar of the area forced off, which would admit a person; they could then get in at the kitchen window, which was shut close down. They forced open my parlour-door, where the property was, and I missed the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth 15 l. together. I have employed the prisoner in the house for many years, and within the last three months. He knew the house very well.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 26th of August, about three o'clock in the morning, I heard a man coming out of Portland-mews - it was dark; it was about five hundred yards from Grayson's house. I went up and took him - it was the prisoner; he had a bundle,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150007"></xptr>also a parcel of halfpence in his coat and trowsers pockets; a shawl and a piece of printed cotton were in his hat, a shift under his waistcoat, and a quantity of tea and sugar in the bundle. He said he had brought them from Calmel-buildings, and was going to take them to Bayswater alms-house.</p>

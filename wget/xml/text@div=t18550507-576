                  </hi>. I keep the Marquis of Granby, in High-street, Woolwich. On Saturday, 7th April, the two prisoners came to my place together—Osmond called for a pot of beer—he tendered a shilling, my wife took it up and turned round, and handed it to me—it was bad—I bit a piece out of it—Osmond then pulled out a lot of halfpence, and was going to pay me, but a witness said, "There is a bad half crown amongst those coppers"—he took it out and handed it to me; I bit a piece out of that—I do not know that Osmond said anything, but some one who was there, said, "Here is another bad shilling"—I turned and saw another bad shilling, and I took and bit a piece out of that—I threw these pieces on the table, and when I found there were three pieces bad, I threw the whole of them into the fire.</p>

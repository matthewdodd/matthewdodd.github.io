                  </hi>. I live with my brother-in-law, Thomas Thorpe, at the Weavers' Arms public-house, Back Church-lane, Whitechapel. The prisoner was his barman for about nine days—on Saturday, the 26th of October, I was in the bar serving—the prisoner was also serving—I noticed some<lb></lb>thing concealed in his hand, and watched him—I set him to serve a pot or two of beer, and after that he was leaving the bar—I collared him, and said, "You have something in your hand"—he said, I have not"—I forced open his hand, and there was the shilling—I took it from him, and said, "You good-for-nothing young man, and put him into the ware-house—I called my brother, marked the shilling, and gave it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pensioner, employed by Colonel Jones The barracks, and guard-rooms, and stables at Plumstead Marsh are the property of his Majesty—there was a great quantity of hay there belonging to his Majesty—on Sunday morning, the 27th of November, I went and found the lock of the stable had been hampered—I missed from ten to fifteen trusses of hay from these stables which are near the barracks—I informed Corporal Ashcroft, and we traced the hay on the ground over the fence, by the stable-door down the manor, from twelve to fifty yards from Bur<lb></lb>leys' house—there are four or five houses, besides Burley's—he is a gar<lb></lb>dener—his house stands on the manor-way in the first row that leads to Plumstead parish—there is a fence round Burley's premises—there is a ditch between his house and the manor, that is, twelve yards from his house one way, and fifty, perhaps, the other—the track of hay ceased at Burley's about fifty yards from his fence—I came back and saw Blagg—he is a gunner, and frequently on duty at the guard-room—Corporal Ashcroft went into the guard-room—I saw Blagg come out—I said, "This is a pretty business"—then he said. "It was I that did it'—(the corporal was not then present)—I had not said any thing about stealing the hay—he said "I have the key"—he did not show me any key—he said nothing more about the key—I said I must make a report, because the property was all littered about the place, from the door—I reported it to Serjeant-Major Bollin—I had been in this stable two days before—we have got two trusses here—I first saw the hay in Burley's shed in the Marsh—I went there on the Monday with the Sergeant-Major—he asked him if he had any hay there, and then we saw some in the shed, part of which is here—it is part of what we missed from the stable—I bound it up myself, and have no doubt of it—I saw it on Friday—I saw about nine trusses at the prisoner's which I had missed form the stable.</p>

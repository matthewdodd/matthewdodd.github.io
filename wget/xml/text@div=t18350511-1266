                  </hi>. I live in Crown-court, Windmill-street, Westminster. On Saturday, the 9th of May, I went from Windsor to London—when I got to Cranfield-bridge, I met the prisoner between one and two o'clock—I took out my handkerchief to wipe the perspiration from my face, and a piece of bread dropped out—the prisoner said "That is mine," and demanded it—I gave it to him—he said that was not all; nor would he be satisfied with it, but he would have more; he would have something else—he put his hand in my pocket two or three times, and then round to another pocket—I called him a blackguard, and told him to go about his business—he still insisted on having something—I called him a thief, and ran into the Berkeley Arms for assistance—he said he would have me, if he waited seventeen hours for me—I came out and sat on the seat—he knocked me down twice on the seat, and tried to knock me down a third time, but I fell down, for I was afraid of him—another person picked me up, and he knocked him down—he ran off towards London—I followed him, and in turning a corner I found myself nearer to him than I was aware of—he ran after me, overtook me, and got me down on the ground—he was standing over me, swearing by the Holy Ghost that he would murder me—I cried, "Murder," and fell down—the Oxford coach came up—five gentlemen got off the coach, and took me up on the coach—he was swearing he would murder me—they got to the horse-patrol, and sent him in search of him—he took nothing out of my pockets—there was nothing in them—he did not appear drunk—he was very violent—he attacked me openly—I had 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my fob, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods on my shoulder—he did not interfere with the goods at all—I had given him no offence at all—he charged me with robbing him of 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. when there were about a dozen spectators round—they appeared to believe him, and I pulled out 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to show them—he saw where I took it from—he had no chance of taking it from me; for whea he was standing round me the Oxford coach came up—when I pulled the money out, he said, "Yes, that is your money, but you are so niggardly of it"—I followed, and endeavoured to have him secured, for having attempted to to me and most violently assaulting me—I was very much alarmed when I overtook him—he called to me to come on, and shook his fist at me—I was afraid, and turned back—he followed me, and swore he would murder me—I cannot say that he struck me then, but it is my firm impression that his fist was on my breast when the Oxford coach turned the corner—I was on the ground then—he ap<lb></lb>peared mad—I cannot say it was from liquor—I got on the coach, and</p>

               <p>went on to the station-house—he was taken into custody by the horse-patrol—I was fifty yards from the Berkeley Arms when I first saw him—at the Berkeley Arms I offered repeatedly to send for a constable, but the people were all afraid to pass him—he was defying the whole of the spec<lb></lb>tators, and the only man who took my part he knocked down—I cannot say I felt any thing on my breast, my senses and sight seemed completely bewildered—he still pressed towards me when they got me on the coach; he was defying the whole passengers—I am certain his hand was in my pocket two or three times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. He had got my 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his pocket. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had not taken 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him—I had not seen any body give him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he did not ask me for charity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I was coming to get a ship at Chatham—I met an old ship-mate, and went with him—we had eleven pots of beer and two-penny<lb></lb>worth of tobacco—he had nothing left but 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, there is a gentleman over the way in a gig, he will give you 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to make up a pot for a round dozen"—I went over to him, and the gentleman knocked my hat off with the whip, as he was getting into the gig, and knocked the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my hat—the prosecutor took it up, put it into his pocket, and said he had only picked up the bread. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I saw a gig, after he had struck me twice, at the Berkeley Arms he complained of my taking 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from him—the gentleman belonging to the gig saw him beat me—I did not see a gentleman beat him off from the gig—I did not see him near a gig till the time I have mentioned—the horse's head was turned towards Windsor—I saw nothing more about it—I saw no 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Bow-street patrol. I apprehended the prisoner about half a mile on this side of Cranfield-bridge—he was lying on the grass by the way-side—he had been drinking—I searched him, but found nothing about him—I told him the charge, and asked him to come quickly with me, as I had heard a very bad character of him, and a charge of attempting to rob—he said he would see me d—d before he would go with me—I said go he should, or I would fetch him dead—I got off my horse and hit him over the side of the head—that made him consent to go—he got on my horse—I strapped him to my stirrup, and then he went—he had no money—he was not what we call staggering drunk—he had no doubt, been drinking freely.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse-keeper, and live at Cranfield. I had seen the prisoner at the White Hart tap before this dispute arose—I saw him in the Berkeley Arms'-yard—a gig stood in the yard; it went away towards Harlington—the prisoner followed it about eighty yards, and the gentleman kept poking his hat with his whip—he had his hat off, begging, and the gentleman kept pushing the whip to keep his hat off; and finding he would not get away, he drove the gig towards him, and drove him up to the foot-path—he would not give him any thing—the prisoner then turned back towards Cranfield—aa he ran by the side of the gig, the prosecutor passed on the other side of the gig—the prisoner ran up to him, but what he said, I cannot say, being sixty yards off—I did not hear him charge the prosecutor with doing any thing—before he got to the house, I saw his hand go into the man's pocket once—when he got nearer, he said, "You shall give me something," and said he was a poor man, and had got nothing for himself—he put his hand into his pocket three times, and the prosecutor <hi rend="italic">"bolted"</hi> into the Berkeley Arms—the prisoner said, "I will sit here and wait for you, if it is seventeen hours"—this was in the presence</p>

               <p>of a great many people—he was close to the public-house when he struck him—the prosecutor was coming towards London, and the prisoner was running with the gig, from London, but turned back—the blow was struck after he had put his hand in the prosecutor's pocket—I cannot say the prisoner was sober—he had drank a few pots of beer in the tap-room, but I was not there all the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the White Hart, at Cranfield.

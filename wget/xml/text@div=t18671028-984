                  </hi> I was lodging at the Bear public-house, St. John Street, Clerkenwell—on the 25th of last month I was walking along that street—I had had a little to drink, but was quite capable of taking care of myself—the prisoners followed me and pushed me from the pavement—there was a man near—I was pushed down—I heard Sharman say, "Pick his pockets"—they then took my watch-keys from my left-hand waist<lb></lb>coat pocket—there was a knife also, and some needles, of which I had broken the points for the purpose of using them in the leather trade—these are the same needles—Sharman then said I had an inside pocket, and they ripped open my waistcoat, and took from it a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and a pound's worth of postage stamps—they ran off—I called "Police! "—I am certain as to the identity of both of the prisoners.</p>

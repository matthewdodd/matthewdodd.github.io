                  </hi>. I am a seaman, employed in different vessels in the merchant service. On 24th Nov., I was a passenger in the <hi rend="italic">Clarence Steamer</hi> from Leith to London—the prisoner was a passenger in her, we were coming to London—we got to Grantham pier two hours before the London boat, and we had to go to get some provision—I met the prisoner on the pier begging—I gave her a shilling—I had two sovereigns and a half sovereign in my register box, which is not very easy to open—I went on board in the evening, and examined my box—it had the two sovereigns and half sovereign in it, and some silver—I went to lie down on the funnel, and while I Was asleep this woman came and took my box, and took the half sovereign out and the silver—when I awoke I missed the money, a shipmate of mine took</p>

I was with the last witness; I saw him sitting near the funnel fast asleep, the prisoner was standing up—I saw she had his box in her hand—this is the box (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I knew it, and knew it belonged to my shipmate directly I saw it—I spoke to her, she told me she could not get the lid on—I told her she had no business with the lid off—I took it out of her hand, and put the lid on—she went away to the fore part of the ship—I put the box in Johnson's inside jacket pocket, and awoke him—he opened the box and found two sovereigns in it, but the half sovereign was missing—he complained of the half sovereign being missed, but he said he would not say anything about it till he got near London, for fear she should make away with it.</p>

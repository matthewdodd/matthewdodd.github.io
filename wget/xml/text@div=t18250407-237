            . I am a constable, and live in New-street, Lambeth. I know Elizabeth Mary Ann Williams, and Myers the officer; I gave directions to Williams to discover persons making counterfeit coin; on the 22d of December I employed her in that way, and on the 23d she came to me again with Myers, at the Bell, public-house, in Falcon-court; I then gave her twelve shillings - they were good. I searched her pocket, and her bonnet to see if she had any more money about her - she had not. On the day before I had gone with her as far as the end of Petticoat-lane, but did not go farther then, as the officers are pretty well known there. On the 23d I saw her and Myers again, between five and six o'clock in the evening, at my house at Lambeth; she gave me two sovereigns, which I marked before her face, and gave to Myers; he wrapped them up in paper, and wrote something upon it; I put my initials upon it, and the date. I think the sovereigns were in the same paper, but folded so as to prevent their rubbing against each other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What parish are you constable of? A. Lambeth; I have been an officer eight or nine years. I never was an officer of Union-street; I have been employed as an extra officer there - I was prevented from being a constable for ten or eleven weeks, because I was arrested upon a trespass, and was forced to take the benefit of the act. I never knew Mrs. Williams by the name of Daly - I never heard of that name - I asked her to do this job for me; there was a woman present when I gave her the money, who goes by the name of Smith, and Myers the officer. I spoke to Mrs. Smith while she was there, about the transaction. I think she is between thirty and forty years of age. I believe we had some beer to drink; I called Mrs. Smith, Smith or Mary - and Williams, I called Betsey. I have heard Smith called Dowling, or Downing; I knew her best by the name of Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a man there of the name of Daly, or Delay? A. I do not know him by name - Myers walked with Williams and me part of the way to Petticoat-lane, but with no other man. I do not know such a man as Delay; I heard there was a man of that name at the King of Prussia, public-house, in Petticoat-lane, but I never saw him.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Why do you call the witness Mrs. Williams? A. I have seen her marriage register; her name before she was married was Richards. I was the person who made Smith and Williams acquainted together.</p>

            . I do not know where he lives - he has left me; I know Goff, and live near him; I saw him on the 22d of December; I saw the prisoner that day at the King of Prussia, in Wentworth-street, and a man of the name of Liepman Liepman; the prisoner said he would look out, and be in Wentworth-street to meet me on the following day, and take me to his house; I met him on the 23d. I had seen Goff and Myers at the Bell, in Falcon-court, between three and four o'clock - Goff gave me 12 s. - before he gave me the money, he searched my bonnet and my pockets. I had no other money about me but what he gave; which was twelve separate shillings. I then went to Wentworth-street, met the prisoner, and went with him to his house in Marlborough-court, which leads from Petticoat-lane to Wentworth-street. Liepman Liepman came there - I had seen them both the day before; the prisoner then asked, what I wanted; I said,</p>
               <p>"Two sovereigns;" and he told Liepman Liepman to go and get them, which he did; I paid 12 s. for them; the prisoner delivered them to me; I took them to Mr. Goff's house and gave them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was your maiden name? A. Elizabeth Mary Ann Smith Richards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go by any other name except Richards or Williams? A. No, not that I remember; I never answer to any other name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring a charge of bigamy against your husband? A. Yes; but the Magistrate dismissed it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you well acquainted with Goff? A. Yes; I know him very well. I had emptied my pocket; I do not think he searched my gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you to have for this? A. I do not know; I have got nothing yet; I expect my expences like another witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not expect and hope to be paid by the gentlemen of the Mint for doing this job? A. I do not know who is to pay me; I have not been promised any thing - I expect they will pay me for my loss of time, either the gentlemen of the Mint or the Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you set about all this trouble, did Goff say to you, or you to him, anything about what you was to get? A. No; he said, I should be paid for my time as a witness, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Goff the only person who told you you was to be paid by the Court as a witness? A. Myers told me I should be paid as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Myers mention no sum? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think will be a proper payment for what you have done? A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never made up your mind as to what you are to get for it? A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever at the office of the Solicitor of the Mint? A. Yes, I have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get any money from Myers on the footing of this transaction? A. Not on this transaction nor on any other. No; I have borrowed a sovereign of Mrs. Myers, which I intend to pay her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that since you were employed in this transaction, or before? A. It is since that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Myers know of it? A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to the Bell on the 23d, who were there? A. Mr. Goff and Mr. Myers.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the Bell was it? A. I do not know what they call it; it was a room that many people go into.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you there? A. Perhaps half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any refreshment? A. I had little porter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Goff and Mr. Myers take any thing? A. I did not watch them; they did take porter out of the same pot with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you on the 23d to Petticoat-lane? A. A woman.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070087"></xptr>Q. Did Myers and Goff go with you on that day? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go with you on the day before the 22d? A. Yes, and a woman, the name she went by was Smith; I never saw her before that day, and they were the only persons, man or woman, who went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her since? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever heard her go by the name of Downing or Dowling? A. No; I have seen Delany; I saw him in Wentworth-street, he was speaking to Mrs. Smith; Goff and Myers were not with me then; I lived at that time at No. 6, Portugal-street, Lambeth; I get my living by my needle, or winding cotton.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. You have known Goff for twelve years; he employed you in this transaction, and he told you you should be paid for your loss of time? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever had any promise from any of the gentlemen of the Mint for what you have done? A. No.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the last witness on the 22d and 23d of December; Goff gave her 12 s.; I was at Goff's house in the evening when she returned; she put down a paper with two counterfeit sovereigns - I marked them, put them into another piece of paper which I also marked, and gave them to Goff, who put his initials on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who introduced you to Williams? A. I have known her five years. I saw Morris Delany and Williams standing outside the door in Fenchurch-street; there was, I believe, one woman with them; I was at some distance and cannot tell whether they were in conversation: I had no conversation with Williams as to what she was to get for this business. I told her Government would pay her, I had no doubt of it: I never gave her any money myself; my wife told me on one occasion, she had given her some, but I do not know what - that is since this business; she gets her living by needle-work: I never heard Goff say any thing to her about what she was to get for it. I never knew of her going to the Solicitor of the Mint but once, when we all went together; she has been employed in other jobs besides this - I think about four - two of them were the same day - about the 21st of February - that was the last time; the job for which we are now trying the prisoner was the first - I have not received any money myself for this business.</p>

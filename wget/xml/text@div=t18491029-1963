                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called in on Sunday, 9th Sept., to attend the deceased—I found him suffering from Asiatic or malig<lb></lb>nant cholera—I saw him first about eleven o'clock in the morning, and after<lb></lb>wards about three in the afternoon; he was still suffering much in the same way—I saw him again about nine in the evening; his symptoms were then in some degree relieved, but I still thought him in very great danger—I found him in a state of collapse; he was in a very critical state all day on Sunday—I gave him medicines, and directions as to treatment—I thought his state one of the greatest possible danger, but not hopeless—I was prepared to go on with the case—on Sunday night, hearing that he had a brother in the profession, and finding him in such extreme danger, I asked to see him, in order that we might consult together on the case; that was entirely my request—I did afterwards see him that evening, but not professionally—I told him I con<lb></lb>sidered his brother in very great danger, told him what had been done, and asked if he had any observation to make upon the case, or any suggestion to offer with regard to his brother's welfare—he then said, "As regards the old system, or the alopathic plan, you have done all you can; but as we both consider the case one of extreme danger, I should like the homoeopathic system tried on him"—I said I knew nothing at all about the doctrines of homoeopathy; and, therefore, he must take the case entirely into his own hands, that I could not act in concert or concurrence with him—he then asked if I had any objection to look in as a friend on the following day, as I could not act professionally with him—I said, certainly not; I had merely given up the case in sympathy with his feelings as a brother, and I had no objec<lb></lb>tion to look in as a friend—I did not ask him whether he was a medical man—I had heard he was in the profession, and thought he was a qualified man—he said he had studied at the University four years—he spoke like a man that had studied medicine—I did not see the deceased after his death.</p>

death—I was vain enough to think that the measures I adopted on the Sunday had their effect on the Monday—I have no reason to suppose that the prisoner's treatment did any harm—a man in a state of collapse could not take solid food—I thought beef-tea and gruel proper for him—I ordered it, and solids when he could take them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am living with Hannah Wilkinson, a cousin of mine, in Bateman's-row. On Tuesday, 4th Jan., about 6 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my cousin's shop for half a quartern of shilling butter—it came to 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he offered me half a crown in payment—I bit it, and looked at it, and gave it to my cousin, Mrs. Wilkinson—when I was going to give it her, the prisoner followed me into the parlour—my cousin asked him when he got the half crown from—he said he had been working at the Docks, and took it from the Docks—my cousin John said, "Let's look at the half crown," and the prisoner took to his heels and ran away—he had to run from the parlour through the shop again into the street—my cousin John ran after him, and I ran after my cousin—the prisoner fell down in the street, about 200 yards from the shop—my cousin took him, and gave him into custody—I saw all the pursuit to the end, and the capture.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cousin of the last witness. On 4th Jan. she brought a half crown to me in my parlour—I said it was bad—the prisoner followed her in—I told him it was bad, and asked where he had taken it—he told me from the Docks—I told him they never gave bad money—my brother John was there—he said, "Let us see that half-crown?"—it was in my hand; I showed it him, and be put it on the table—the prisoner went away very fast, and my brother followed him—he brought him back, I should think, in about five minutes, and he was given in charge—the prisoner said he wanted to speak to me alone, but my brother would not let him—I had taken up the half crown from the table, and had it all the while—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

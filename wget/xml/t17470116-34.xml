               <p>Q. What have you lost, and when?</p>
               <p>Holmes. We have lost several Candles, which she acknowledges, two Brass Cocks, two Heaters, one Pair of Sheets, and one China Saucer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you hear her confess the taking of these Goods?</p>

             . What have you to say upon this Occasion?</p>
               <p>Holmes. We had some Reason to suspect my Servant not to be good, from the Things I missed in the Wash, which I knew could go by no other Hand; I said to her, Nanny , you have been very wicked, I must search my Neighbours Houses, and I shall search your Acquaintance first, and consider what Trouble you will bring this Woman in as well as yourself; she down'd upon her Knees, and wished her Hands might never be clenched, if she knew any thing of it; when she saw I had my Cloak on that I would go, she said to me, Madam, Forgive me, forgive me; she owned the taking of the Candles, she confessed the taking of nothing but the Candles; as to the Brass Cocks and Iron Heaters, and China Saucer, they were found in the Box, which she sent for to a Neighbour's; she confessed the Candles to be mine.</p>
               <p>Sarah Hall. I was at Mrs Holmes's, she sent to me, and said she had a Warrant to search a Neighbour's House; she said, Nanny , you will bring the Woman into Trouble as well as yourself; then she down'd upon her Knees, and said the Candles were her Mistress's.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Box was opened, did Mrs Holmes own the Things that were in her Box?</p>
               <p>Hall. Mrs Holmes owned the Cock and Heaters.</p>

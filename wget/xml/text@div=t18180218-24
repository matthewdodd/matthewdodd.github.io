On the 19th of January my great coat hung in the hall; about six o'clock in the afternoon my servant brought some biscuits up to me; not having ordered any, I was induced to think something was wrong, I ran down stairs and missed my great coat off the nail. The prisoner was in the hall with a basket; I asked him what he had in it - He hesitated; I ordered the green cloth which was at the top of it, to be moved, and found my great coat under it; I had only worn it three weeks-it cost me 7l. 18s. and must have been worth 6l. The prisoner begged for mercy, and said he would not do so again, and that he had a mother to provide for.</p>

Mr. Cradock's female servant fetched me to the house from the watchhouse, which is about 200 yards off; the prisoner stood in the passage by the basket; Mr. Cradock charged him with putting the coat into the basket, I asked him how he came to do it, he said that it tumbled in.

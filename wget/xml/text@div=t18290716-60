               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How long have you known him? A. About two years; I have found him rather silly; the people in the house once or twice had a little fun with him - I never knew them thrust tobacco into his mouth; he pulled off his shirt once in a joke - it was not done to hurt him; I never saw a rope got to pretend to hang him - he left his father's house one night, and my brother told him he had better sleep in my skittle-ground, which is covered over; I believe he slept there once or twice - people used to ask him to sing songs, and collected a few halfpence for him; be was singing in the house the night before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was he made a joke of in the house? A.They did laugh at him; I believe he has been drawn in by others - many people thought him a foolish fellow; I thought nothing of his throwing off his shirt - none of my property was moved.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 17th of June, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I ran and took the prisoner running, and the prosecutor after him; I brought him back to the house - the bar shutter had been forced open inside the house; no housebreaking instruments were found - there was no force used outside the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor of this indictment—I have car<lb></lb>ried on business as a corn-chandler for sixteen or seventeen years, at No. 96, Connaught-terrace. In January, 1839, I took the defendant Munn into my employment—I had been in a very delicate state of health for some years previous to that—I agreed with Munn, that if he came to manage my business, I would give him for his services equal to one-third of the net profits for the first two years, and after that equal to the halfhe came into my employ on those terms—Rouse was also in my employ, as carman, for three or four years, at least a considerable time before Munn came into my employment—he left me in May, 1841, after Munn left, and went to live with Munn—Barton was also my servant—lie was a carman, and made himself generally useful in the corn business—he is Munn's wife's brother—after I had taken Munn into my employ I left the whole of the shop business to him—I left No. 96, Connaught<lb></lb>terrace for him to live in—prior to his coming into my employ he bor<lb></lb>rowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me—he managed my books, and had possession of them—I attended the markets principally, on the Corn Exchange and the Hay<lb></lb>market, and paid bills, and so on—I always paid, at least generally paid—in 1840 I entered into a treaty to dispose of my business in Connaught<lb></lb>terrace, but did not meet with a purchaser—a proposal was made to me by Munn about the premises No. 11, Stanhope-terrace—he had seen those premises, and was very desirous, if possible, of having them, and after some consultation, I agreed, if it was possible, to purchase them for him, and he should go into business for himself, and I would assist him after some negociation with Mr. Webb, the mortgagee in possession, it was ultimately agreed that I should give him 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for these premises, and when the deed was executed, and possession given to me, I immediately gave possession to Munn, the same day, the 21st of April, 1841—I said, in conversation with Munn, "Mind, if I purchase these premises for yon, and you go into business for yourself, I will have nothing to do with it; what rent can you afford?"—he said, "Will you fit up the shop for me, Sir?"—I said, "No, if you have possession, take a lease for it"—he said "Well, if you will purchase the place for me, and grant me a lease, I will give you 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for it"—I said, "Very well, Munn, I won't stand for a hundred or two, if it is possible to get the premises for you"—I should say Stanhope-terrace is half a mile from Connaught-terrace—there was no other corn-dealer in the neighbourhood but myself—there was a good opportunity for establishing another business there—nothing had come near it—there are a great many wealthy houses in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood—after Munn had commenced the alterations, he said one evening, "I shall not be able to do much business the first quarter, Sir, will you be satisfied with the ground-rent?" and I said the first quarter he should have it for the ground-rent, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., after which it was to be 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, according to our agreement—he said, "Very well"—he went into posses<lb></lb>sion, made the alterations, and set up in business—he never came to ac<lb></lb>count with me about the business he managed at No. 96, Connaught<lb></lb>terrace—I frequently pressed him for an account after he left me, a dozen</p>

               <p>times, or more—I requested him to come even as late as the 17th of last November—I met him, and said, "Munn, I have been expecting you to come and settle your accounts"—he said, "I have been so busy I have had no time"—I have sent messages by his own daughter to him—I borrowed 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Fraser, my attorney, to complete the purchase for Munn—I told Mr. Fraser to apply for the rent the November following, and after<lb></lb>wards, finding no rent was paid, I directed an action to be brought, which came on for trial on the 15th of January, this year—on the 14th, the day before that trial, I heard of proceedings in the Court of Chancery, and was served with a subpoena in the Chancery proceedings—I heard that they were going to move for an injunction to stay me from proceeding at law—in the course of January, I believe, I got an order for the production of this agreement—I attended, and saw it produced—the first time I saw it was on the 25th of January, 1842, in the hands of a Mr. Warren, Munn's attorney, at No. 161, London-road—I afterwards saw the affidavits in Chancery, in which Rouse stated he was present when I signed this agree<lb></lb>ment, and Barton also—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the agreement</hi>)—this "James Timewell" is not my handwriting—I never signed this, nor any other written agree<lb></lb>ment, for Munn, in my life, under any circumstances whatever, during the time he was in my employ, or since he has left it—the only thing I signed for him was a bill of exchange for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Which I lent him—it is false that Rouse put his name to that after I signed it—I know nothing of this agreement at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it false that you read it aloud in the presence of Rouse and Barton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I never read it in my life—I believe the body of the instrument to be in Munn's handwriting—I was never in partner<lb></lb>ship with Munn—Barton states in his affidavit that he saw the paper through the desk—my desk is of that description that it would not be pos<lb></lb>sible for him to see through it—this is my handwriting to the assignment of the lease.</p>

Was due to Munn in December, 1841, supposing the account he gave me was correct and according to the books—there was no difficulty in my seeing the books—I did not ask to see them—they were always accessible to me—I looked at the ledger, but did not cheek the account, or go into it; I relied fully on Munn's honesty—these figures are not mine—I never saw them before—the top figures are mine—I be<lb></lb>lieve this paper(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is my handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one marked</hi> A) I do not believe this is my handwriting, nor do I believe this to be mine (B), nor this (C)—I do not believe this is my writing (D), nor this (E)—Munn was always allowed to sign my name to bills—these were not written by me—I believe this is not my handwriting (F)—(<hi rend="italic">These papers were all folded, so that only the signatures were visible.</hi>)</p>

I intended as an in<lb></lb>vestment—I was to allow Mr. Fraser five per cent, for his 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never applied to Munn for the loan of any money—that I swear—I applied to him for money for goods—I never asked him for the loan of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would get the acceptance of a friend of his, named Clark, for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was for goods—he had had between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>between 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wanted to make up some money—he said he had none—I wanted him to let me draw on him for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said no, he would give me no acceptance, but he would get his uncle to do it—Munn was to keep the premises at Stanhope-terrace in repair—they are extensive premises—be has repaired them—I cannot positively say to what amount, perhaps to about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am not accurate—he was to have a lease of the premises for the whole unexpired term.</p>

I said, "Mann is to have these premises at a certain rent, 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year"—there was nothing to prevent his drawing up the agreement at the time—I ought to have had it done before I put him in possession of the property, but I had confidence in him—the first action I brought was for half a year's rent—we demanded the half year's rent, the full amount—I do not know the exact amount I got I was paid the first quarter—I got 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., instead of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe Munn is in possession of the premises in Stanhope-terrace at present—I have not the slightest doubt of it; I know he is, unless he has left—I have not seen the premises for these three or four months—I have no suspicion that be has left—I am carrying on the business in Connaught-terrace—I do not know whether he has got a good deal of custom from me—he got a good many of my old customers—I have not got them back—very likely he has got them now; I cannot say; I have not seen his accounts—I am not very cross about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It would not be at all convenient to get him out of the way, would it, by an indictment for perjury or forgery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly it would—that is my answer—I believe he is married—he is represented so—he has four or five children I believe—they are not all young; some of them are—Munn laid out a good deal of money on the premises in Stanhope-terrace the first year—we did not get together at the end of the first year to see how matters stood—we did not at any time get together, at Stanhope-terrace, to see how the accounts stood, nor in Connaught-terrace—we never settled—there were no accounts made up between us—Munn did not show me that out of the money be bad laid out on the Stanhope-terrace premises there was but 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. left—there was no balancing between us whatever—there was no statement of accounts between us, at Connaught-terrace, by which it appeared that 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Was the balance to be divided, nor did I agree that it was so small that I would not divide it—I never recollect it—I believe it never took place—I will swear positively it never did—that I am quite sure of—Munn never told me how much he had laid out on the premises in Stanhope-terrace, that I recollect—I made the guess of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the contract for the alterations—I do not know what he did besides the fit<lb></lb>tings up and the shop-front that was put in—I am not aware what he did Beyond the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he did that—there might be some other repairs, I can<lb></lb>not tell; I did not see it after it was completed; I only saw it in progress—the shop-front is included in the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he had the house papered—I do not recollect whether there was any painting—I suppose there was—there must have been painting, of course—I did not see it—I saw the shop-front painted—I believe it is a handsome shop-front.</p>

               <p>---- <hi rend="smallCaps">WATSON</hi>. I am a barrister; my chambers are in Lincoln's-inn-fields. On the 14th of October, 1841, I was consulted on the part of Munn—this agreement was laid before me on that occasion—I advised proceedings in Chancery.</p>

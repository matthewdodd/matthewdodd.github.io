On the 6th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, I was going home alone, and was sober; I had three half-crowns in my pocket - the two prisoners came up to me in <placeName id="t18301028-84-crimeloc458">Camomile-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you cry out Watch? A. I could not, I was so terrified - I told them they had robbed me of three half-crowns; Brown said once or twice, "What do you want?" I said she had robbed me of two or three half-crowns - I heard the money jinking, as if passing from her to Field, and Field went off with it; Brown held me round the neck the while, so that I could not get away - my hat fell off; a gentleman on the other side saw the whole transaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not call out to him? A. She held me so tight- she held my head down between her breast and arms; I did not see the gentleman on the other side - I made an alarm a minute or two after she was gone; I called out that I was robbed of three half-crowns - the gentleman came up to me; I could not call Stop thief! I was so terrified from the fright I had - I do not think any body was standing in the way; the witness Pilley, who was on the opposite side, came to me, and asked what was the matter; I said, "For God's sake assist me, for I am robbed of three half-crowns," which were not my own money - they were my employer's; he is an auctioneer, and gave them to me to purchase goods which he wanted for sale; he gave them to me at ten o'clock at night - the auction-shop was open at that time; it is in Ratcliff-highway - they were to be sold by auction next morning; I did not complain to any watchman that night - I did not take notice of any, I was so frightened; Pilley complained to a tall gentleman in Bishopsgate-street, who I believe was an officer - Pilley got the woman himself; he and I went different ways - Field was brought to the watch-house in about a second, and three half-crowns found on her; I described her person - I had not pointed her out, I was in such trouble, but the constable never had her out of sight; I told the constable of it in Camomile-street, when he came to my assistance - Field was not searched in my presence; Brown was brought to the watch-house in about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you related to the boxer? A. I am his nephew - I was frightened at the women; I am a hair-dresser - my master is an auctioneer, but he is not the man I was bound apprentice to; I dress and shave now when I can get any thing to do - I have no shop; I have been six months with the auctioneer; I was to buy razors, scissors, and knives; I left my master's shop at ten o'clock - Camomile-street was not in my way home; it may be two miles out of my way - I went for a walk; I did not stop to drink - I am not in the habit of drinking; I called out "I am robbed of three half-crowns;" I had not been with any women - when she laid hold of my arm I did not know what she was going to do; when she asked me to treat her I said I had no money - I was perfectly collected then; I saw nobody to call to - I, of course, made a bit of a fuss about it; she tucked my head under her arm - I had no power to call out, I was so frightened; I did not describe them to the officer till they were taken, for I could not see them; I told what sort of a dress she had on - I told the constable she was a tall young woman, certainly not shortish; I will not swear that I described her dress - I did not describe Brown at all; I expect 3s. 6d. a day for coming here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How much do you get for attending the auction-room? A. One shilling a day; I have been here two days - my master is Peter McPherson, of No. 86, Ratcliff-highway.</p>

            . I am a saddle-tree maker, and live in Webber-street. I did not know the prosecutor before this; I was in Bishopsgate-street, at the end of Camomile-street, and heard a disturbance - I walked down, and heard the voices of two or three women and a man; I heard Mendoza say, "It won't do," and after that I heard Brown say, "What do you want?" she repeated it three or four times - it did not appear a serious dispute - I saw Field cross, and go up the passage; I had no suspicion at that time of a robbery - I then saw Brown and the prosecutor struggling together for a minute or two; she then pushed him from her, and walked away at rather a quick step into Bishopsgate-street, looking once or twice behind her - Mendoza then picked up his hat, and ran away from her, in a contrary direction, and in a direction from me; I had stopped on the opposite side of the way, facing them - I heard Pilley call to him to know if he had been robbed; he said he had, of three half-crowns - this was not a minute after; there was nothing to prevent his calling Thieves! he appeared agitated - had he spoken in time I could have stopped Brown; she had just turned the corner - I lost sight of them both; Pilley brought Field up - I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183010280038"></xptr>think there was a robbery, but that they belonged to each other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from them when you heard him say "It won't do?" A. I should think two yards, the width of the street; he could easily have seen me - there was nothing to prevent his calling to me; I took a glass of ale with him last night, in St. Paul's church-yard - that is the only house I ever went to with him; I treated him, as he had no money - I was looking attentively at the prisoners, but saw no robbery; the street is lighted, and I believe with gas - I fancy the money had been taken just at the time I got up; I heard him say "It won't do;" it might have been done without my seeing it - she must have tucked his head under her arm before I came up, if that took place; I was not above two minutes looking at them.</p>

            . I am a poulterer at Leadenhall-market - I am now serving in my own right as a constable. On the 6th of October I was on duty, going round the ward, and when I came into Camomile-street my attention was attracted by two women and a man struggling together; the man was making a noise - he said, "Leave me alone," or words to that effect; I might be forty or fifty yards from him then - he spoke in a loud voice: I advanced, and immediately Field crossed the road, hastily. into a court - I called out "Have you lost any thing?" he said three half-crowns - I had then got a full view of Field going up the court; I followed, and took her in Bishopsgate-street, which the court leads into - I told her she had committed a theft on a gentleman; she said, "It was not me - it was the other girl; there she runs up the street;" I brought her back - Payne searched her at the watch-house, and produced three half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you told us all that Mendoza said to you? A. Yes; he said nothing more than that he had been robbed of three half-crowns - he did not describe the women as tall or short, or say a word of the kind - it is as false as God is true.</p>

Field was brought to the watch-house, charged as an accomplice in robbing Mendoza; I searched her in a room by myself, and found three half-crowns and a piece of biscuit - she had no other money; Brown was brought in in about twenty minutes - I found 2s. 10d. on her, and a piece of biscuit.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Brown accounted for her money? A. Yes - Mendoza seemed very much frightened, but perfectly sober; I do not recollect his giving any description of the women - I should consider him very likely to make a mistake.</p>

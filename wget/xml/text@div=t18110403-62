               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the two prisoners. - A. I saw them at the office. On last Wednesday two persons came into my shop to try some shoes on.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are those two persons. - A. I do not know them when I see them. They came in to try some shoes on, and the shoes I shewed them some were too big and some too little, and when they were gone, I missed three pair of shoes directly after they left me. I had seen the shoes a few minutes before they came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe them do any thing that raised your suspicion while they were in the shop. - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body in the shop besides yourself and them. - A. Nobody when they first came in, my mother came in with a light, they got up as soon as she came in and went out.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the men dressed. - A. They had both white aprons on, apparently like carpenters, between nine and ten the same evening, the same shoes were brought to me by

            , near the Nag's Head in Hackney Road, the two prisoners passed us, I thought I knew Goodman, I turned round immediately, I said Goodman, what is it you, what have you got here. Immediately Tubb ran away, Rice followed him and brought him to me immediately, I then asked Goodman what he had got in this apron, he said three pair of shoes that a man met him by Cambridge Street Turnpike, a man he did not know, he was to give him a shilling to carry these shoes to London.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the distance from Cambridge Street Turnpike, to where you saw them. - A. Above a quarter of a mile, I then put them in the watchhouse, and Rice and me went to Hackney to find an owner for the shoes, we went into a number, at last we went to Mr. Morgan's he said he had lost three pair of shoes, I shewed him the shoes he said they were his, these are the shoes.</p>

               <p>On the 18th of January, between twelve and one o'clock, coming from the playhouse, there was another young man and I had been drinking together; he left me, and then I met the prisoners; I went with them to <placeName id="t17880227-82-crimeloc410">Parker's-lane, Drury-lane</placeName>

               <p>Did you undress and go to bed? - Yes, my great coat was on the bed, my handkerchief was on a chair, and my money was in my breeches pocket, there was upwards of 4 s. I left my breeches on the side of the bed.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - I had rather been drinking a little.</p>
               <p>How do you know those young women had them? - I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Did you know them before? - I never saw them before.</p>
               <p>What light had you? - A candle in the room.</p>
               <p>Did you go to bed directly? - We sat two or three hours first.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you go to bed to both of them? - Yes, we had two half pints of gin together among four of us.</p>
               <p>Who were the four? - The prisoners and I, and the other young fellow.</p>
               <p>You said before that he left you? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did positively? - If I did, it was by mistake, he left me in the room with them about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>He went away before you went to bed?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178802270089"></xptr>- Yes, my great coat was found about a fortnight after at a pawnbroker's in Wild-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Are you a man of that prowess that you always have two ladies when you go to bed? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did you not offer them your coat for the honour they did you? - I am very certain I did not.</p>
               <p>Did you direct any overtures to be made to the relations of either of the girls? - No I never did; there had been people after me, to give me money to make it up.</p>
               <p>- GARDINER sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of January, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner Morgan pledged this coat with me for five shillings; she said it was her husband's coat.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen her before? - No, but I am positive the prisoner was the woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. The people that come to your shop stand back in little pigeon-holes, do not they? - Yes, but I had seen her several times before; she used our shop.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you to tell me upon your oath, just now, you had never seen her before? - It was a mistake, I beg your lordship's pardon.</p>

               <p>I am father to the prisoner; on hearing that my daughter was in custody, I went to Bassnet, the constable; he said, I had better make it up, that the prosecutor was ready and willing to do any thing upon earth; Bassnett came to me the next morning, and said, he had spoke to the prosecutor about it; that a guinea would not do, it must be two guineas, but he had come down to a guinea and an half; says I, perhaps you will find the bill, and then it will be thrown away; he said, no, it would not be found, for the prosecutor would not be upon the back of the bill at all; says he, he will be upon his recognizance, but he will never be found, for he is a journeyman baker, in Kent; he said, if I would not agree, he should petitition the Court, to allow him his expences, and that would be as well.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - A carpenter and cabinet-maker; I was a sheriff's officer about two years; I lodge in a back room on the first floor, No. 23, Greek-street, Soho.</p>
               <p>Any family? - Yes; a wife and four children, beside the prisoner, but my wife has left me some time.</p>
               <p>What business do you follow? - I live upon what I got while I was sheriff's officer; I was dismissed from my office, but for what, I do not know, nor I cannot learn; my daughter married one Morgan, a bookbinder, but they did not agree, and parted.</p>
               <p>Bassnett. My Lord, I suppose we had not less than a dozen people came after us, to make overtures to us.</p>

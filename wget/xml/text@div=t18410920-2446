                  </hi>. I live at No. 11, School-house-lane, in the parish of Stepney; it is my dwelling-house; the prisoner worked for me four or five years. On the 26th of August, about eleven o'clock, I went to bed, and shut the house up safe—I got up a few' minutes before eight in the morning—the lodger was up before me—I went up stairs, and saw the mark of a foot without shoe or stocking, close to the box where the money was—it was in the room my lodger slept in—as soon as I saw the foot-mark I said if Ragan was a living man, that was his track—he was in the habit of wearing my shoes—I do not know his footmark, but it was very much like it.</p>

               <p>August twelvemonth. I apprehended the prisoner, and asked if he knew any thing of the robbery—he said he did not—I asked whether he could account for his time since last night at ten o'clock up to the time I took him, which was about eleven—he said he could, that he slept at a coffee-shop at the top of "White Horse-street.</p>

I live in Fitzroy-street, and keep a coal-shed - the prisoner used to buy articles of me - about a week or ten days before she brought these things, she told me she was going to leave her place in a few days, and as she expected some parcels from Scotland, she would be glad if I would let her leave them there - I said she might, and in about ten days she brought one sewed up, which appeared to have come a great way - she then brought a second parcel - and on the 22nd of May, she knocked me up a few minutes before six, and left another parcel - Hunter then came for the parcels, and I gave them to her.</p>

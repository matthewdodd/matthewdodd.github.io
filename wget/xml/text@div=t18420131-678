                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. George Barker, of No. 56, Brompton-square. I know the prisoner—I had seen him at my master's house, about three weeks before the 3rd of January—he came to put a lock on the door—on Monday, the 3rd of January, he came between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and said he wanted to take the mea<lb></lb>sure of the locks on the two parlour doors—I said, "Very well"—he came in and took the measure for two knobs—he did not measure the locks—he stood up and looked round, came up the passage, and asked me to go into the kitchen to ask the cook if she wanted any thing done—I said no, I am sure there is not—he asked me again—I went to the top of the stairs, called, and asked the cook, and she said no', she was sure there was not—I then let him out, and saw no more of him until I saw him in cus<lb></lb>tody at Queen-square.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Mr. Barker. I remember the prisoner coming to my master's house on the 3rd of January, between one and two o'clock in the day—he knocked at the door—I went out into the area, and said, "Master and mistress are both out"—he said, "I am come to repair all the bells"—the nurse let him in, and took him up stairs into several rooms—he then came down to the bottom of the kitchen stairs, and asked for the steps—the nurse gave them to him—he then went up into the back parlour—the nurse went up stairs, and returned in a quarter of an hour, she gave an alarm that the street-door was open, and things missing—I went up and found the street-door open—I went into the back parlour, and saw the steps standing there, and missed the silver candle-sticks off the mantel-piece—both the sideboard cupboards were broken open—one lock was quite off, and the other hanging by one screw—I im<lb></lb>mediately sent for a policeman—I found a few other things gone from the cupboard, I cannot exactly say what—I afterwards missed the coat from the sideboard—no one had been to the house that morning but the pri<lb></lb>soner—I remember Speckman calling down stairs to me in the morning, to ask if there was any thing to do to the locks—I should think the candle<lb></lb>sticks are worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the great coat cost 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

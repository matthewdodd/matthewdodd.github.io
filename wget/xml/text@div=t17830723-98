             sworn.</p>
               <p>I lodge and board with Mr. Litchfield, the house was broke open at half past one o'clock, and this prisoner came up to my apartment, the latch was down but it was not bolted, and he strangled me while I was in bed, I have known him from a child, I cryed out murder.</p>
               <p>What do you mean by strangling? - He put his two thumbs here and strangled me, I was awake when he came in.</p>
               <p>Jury. How was you capable of calling out, when he fastened upon you in that manner? - I cried out as long as I was able, and the people came to assist me.</p>
               <p>Does this boy, the prisoner, lodge in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Where does he lodge? - At his mother's.</p>
               <p>How did he come into the house? - He came in our back yard, and then he came up the ladder, I heard him come up the steps, the back door was open.</p>
               <p>Whose business is it to shut the door of nights? - We forgot to shut the door.</p>
               <p>Court. You have told me that the boy came in at the back door? - I heard him and two men talking in the back yard, and he came up in a quarter of an hour afterwards, the back door was not bolted, it was open.</p>
               <p>How do you know the back door was open, you was not the last man that was in bed? - There was no fastening to the back door.</p>

               <p>I had been at night work, I was not there indeed.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. He says, there was no fastening to the back door, and if so, then there is an end of the indictment, for there must be an actual breaking of an outward door, either to get in or to get out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am traffic manager to the Crystal Palace Company. Edwin Poiney was in their employ, in the stables, as feeder of the horses, and the elder prisoner, Robert, lived in a cottage about half a mile from the Palace—on 25th Sept., in consequence of information, I went with Marsh, an officer, to that cottage, and met the prisoner Robert on the way—I said to him, "Poiney, we are going to search your house; on account of having found some cigar cases in your son's corn bin, we are led to suppose that you have at your house some coats which have been stolen from the Com<lb></lb>pany's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220145"></xptr>
               <p>stable yard"—I asked him how many coats his son had brought home within the last three months—he considered for a few minutes, and said, "I should not like to deceive you; there is only one, a black coat, which you will find hanging on the bed rail"—the said that his son had brought it home, and told him he had bought it for half a crown—I pro<lb></lb>posed that he should accompany me to the house, and he declined—I and Marsh then proceeded to the house, and found these two coats (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) hanging, one over the other, on the rail of the bed, the one he spoke of, and another—the value of the black coat, of which he spoke, is three guineas—on a subsequent occasion we found this nearly new Mackintosh cape (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the value of it is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about two hours afterwards Robert Poiney came to my house, at the stables, and asked me if I had found the coat—I said, "Yes," and that we had found a second coat, at which he appeared much surprised, but made no reply—I told him he must be cautious what he said to me, as it was a very serious matter, and everything, no doubt, would turn op—I asked him if he knew of any other coats, or other things, which his son had brought home—he said, by the bye, there was a second coat which his son had brought home, and gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I told him we had discovered a third coat—he appeared surprised, but made no reply—I took him by the collar, and said, "Poiney, this is the third coat that is on your back"—he took the sleeve, and said, "By the bye, my son did bring this home, about three weeks ago, and say he gave 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is claimed for it.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known him I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eighteen months—he was a policeman, in the employ of the Brighton Railway Company, stationed at the top of the staircase leading into the Palace—his wife, and three or four young children, live in the house—it is in the middle of the wood; it is not a house built by the Company—I do not know in whose bedroom it was that I found the coats—there are two bedrooms in the house—I only went just inside the door of the other bed-room—I cannot tell who slept there—I saw the wife, and asked her to show me the coats her son had brought home within the last three months—the value I have mentioned is the amount claimed of the Company for the coats—I believe Robert Poiney has been an inspector of weights and measures at Brighton—I do not know that he has borne the highest char racter; in fact, I know different—he is not employed by the Company, but by the Brighton Railway—I merely see him by passing up and down to the trains—his son, the younger prisoner, was employed by me to feed the horses put up at the Company's stable—there have been a great many remands in this case, and he has been out on bail.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 33). On 25th Sept, I went with Mr. Bourner, and met the elder prisoner with this coat on, but I did not notice it particularly then—I told him that Mr. Bourner was going to search his house, we having found other property in the corn box—he said, "You are welcome to search without a warrant"—I said, "You had better come back"—Mr. Bourner asked him how many coats his son had brought him within the last three months—he said, "One"—we then went to the house, and found two coats on the bed rail in the right hand room—I should think that that room was occupied by two people—there was a large bed in it—there was also a large bed in the other room—I cannot say which room was occupied by the elder prisoner—about two hours after<lb></lb>wards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185510220146"></xptr>
               <p>Robert Poiney called on me at the station, and said that Mr. Bourner wished to see me—I went there, and Mr. Bourner said, "We have found the third coat," taking hold of the coat on Robert Poiney's back—he said that his wife told him that his son bought it for him of Mr. Richardson, and it was given in lieu of one which he had bought for his son of Mr. Richardson, of Penge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time did you see him first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 11 o'clock—I told him I was going to search his house—he declined to go with me, and I left him at the stable-yard and went straight to his house—I saw him again about two hours afterwards—he might have been home in the mean time; he was not under my surveillance—ho was wearing this coat—I do not remember whether he had any coat over it—I should think that this was a very expensive coat before it was altered.</p>

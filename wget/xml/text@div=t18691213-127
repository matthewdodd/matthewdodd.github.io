               <p>kind of scratching that would be dishonourable, and which would be called, in <hi rend="italic">slang</hi>, "milking"—if that is not done it is quite honourable to with<lb></lb>draw a horse at any time before the race; for instance, a man may have three horses in a handicap; he has a right to elect which of the three he runs; perhaps he would not run them till three or four days before the race, and then he selects one, and scratches the others.</p>

               <p>"Representative Sportsmen. Sir Joseph Scratchawley. Numerous as have been the occasions on which we have pointed a moral or adorned a tale by a reference to some bright example (unhappily rare) of nobility and upright<lb></lb>ness, of honesty, straightforwardness, and sportsmanlike conduct, thank God we have never been invariably betrayed into citing the name of Sir Joseph Scratchawley. Life on the Turf is proverbially one of ups and downs. Its losses, as a rule, for exceed its gains, and if, therefore, little men or needy ones descend occasionally to rascalities, and milk, and rope, and cheat, and lie, and thieve their way to winning a handicap now and then, it is greatly to be deplored, but scarcely to be wondered at. What can then he said for the spoilt darling of the Turf, the Little Jack Horner of the racing world, who has not only put in his thumb and pulled out out plum, but has had a whole grocer's shop full of plums fall to his share, and yet tries all he can to bespatter his ancient name before, in the course of nature, he is compelled to resign his seat in the Jockey Club, and his place</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186912130051"></xptr>
               <p>in the Stewards' Stand, to a better man. Sir Joseph Scratchawley has had the good fortune to win four Derbies, a St Leger, the Guineas, and other races too numerous to mention; but, as we said before, comprising among them all, the prizes that can make a turf life worth living for. He might, if he chose, get drunk every night of the year out of a different cup won by the representatives of his stable, and yet his soul craves for something more. He already loathes the fleshpots of Egypt; the noble ambition of carrying off a coveted prize, or of leading back to the scales the winner of the Blue Riband amid the acclamations of thousands, begins already to pale upon his satiated palate, and he casts a longing eye on the gate-money, milk-cans, and the corpses of the boiled, the stiff, and the dead, that taint the atmosphere of the ring. 'Quem Deus vult perdere dement at.' One cannot but foresee the illustration of the proverb in this instance, and moralists will doubtless ascribe it, as they always do, to the demoralizing effects of equine upon human nature when<lb></lb>ever they are brought into close connection with each other. Among other eccentricities of popular opinion, there is no jacket among the 'silks and satins of the turf' that the public more eagerly support, or for which they more vehemently applaud a victory, than that of Sir Joseph Scratchawley. But the fiat has gone forth, and Sir Joseph has decreed that the confiding public shall no longer be permitted to have its own way—that the reliance they have heretofore placed on having from him a straight and honest run for their money shall be snapped like a bulrush. If they want an idol let them seek one elsewhere—for himself he has tried the square, and, on the whole, prefers the crooked—and, in fine, that he has taken for his motto, 'Emulous et scalptus,' and defies any one to say that it is not appropriate. The school to which the late Lord Glasgow and Lord Derby belonged is unhappily all but extinct, and it is the ambition of Sir Joseph Scratchawley to sever the last links that bind us to the traditions of the past in the new code of turf morals of which he desires to be the exponent. Although Dame Nature cannot he said to have been over prodigal to Sir Joseph in her gifts as regards figure and face—the latter especially being characterised by an exceedingly mean and crafty expression—Dame Fortune has amply made amends in bestowing upon him the possession of some of the noblest specimens of the equine race, alike as regards their beauty and their general superiority to the rest of their species, the exact opposite of their master. Matters prospered well at 'Lame'um Grange,' the breeding establishment of the wealthy baronet Derby winners begat Derby winners. The two-year-olds made havock among the Champagnes, Troys, Criterions, Woodootes, and Middle Parks; and the four-year-olds carried off their full share of cups and other important stakes. Who, therefore, can tell what demon cast his evil eye on the place, and caused Sir Joseph to become <hi rend="italic">ennuyed</hi> with so much success? Yet so it would appear to be, and so everyone judged to be the case who saw his wretched, discontented, scowling face, as he leaned with his chin on his stick in the Stewards' Stand, and almost cursed his good horse, 'Blackleg,' as he cantered home a Derby winner, because, forsooth, he had made a mistake and had backed the stable companions, while he had given the office to lay against the best horse of the present century. It is reserved till the Liverpool Cup to place the coping stone to this edifice of caping proceedings. On the appearance of the weights 'Swind<lb></lb>lerite' is voted the pick of the handicap, and, strong in their belief in the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186912130052"></xptr>
               <p>old formula that Sir Joseph Scratchawley always goes straight and gives a run for your money, the public put down their coin, rush deliberately into the lion's jaws, and pour their money into the laps of those who have been 'put in to lay.' Those who love a good horse, however he may be weighted, back Blackleg at fair prices. Suddenly a suspicion begins to dawn, and the knowing ones get on Sir Joseph Scratchawley's lot, including 'Pickpocket,' and not a day too soon. The pails are full of Swindlerite and Blackleg milk, the market begins to be agitated, Pickpocket comes hot in the betting, and Swindlerite and Blackleg are scratched. Sir Joseph felt such epithets bestowed on him by the sporting press as 'fine sportsman,' 'straight-for<lb></lb>ward.' &amp;c., so totally underserved, that he henceforth took the resolution to prevent, if possible, any such misplaced approbation. Since that time, whenever any of his horses have been fairly handicapped, the public have been allowed to get well on them, and they have been scratched. We are sick of hearing the defenders of the Turf 'diary' tell us that a man can do as he likes with his own. He may do so, but he must take the con<lb></lb>sequences. If Sir Joseph Scratchawley knew that Pickpocket was the best of his lot, he ought to have scratched the others as soon as he arrived at that knowledge, and not have left them in, in order that Messrs. Saltfish and Bloater might operate against them. A man who practises these market movements, as they are termed, is like a man who runs wires throngh his hedges, or sets traps for the foxes. As far as any claim to the title of sportsman is concerned, they are in the same boat, and in that category we place Sir Joseph Scratchawley. The bloody hand on his escut<lb></lb>cheon is emblematic of the victims who have fallen, not in actual strife, but from the stab of the stable commissioner, and it will be many a long year before even the spurious popularity he once enjoyed will be restored to him. Before these lines appear, victory or defeat will once more have been declared for the Cherry and Black. We sincerely hope poetical justice will overtake the stable, and that as this is the culminating point of. Sir Joseph Scratchawley's frauds upon the public, so it may be the 'turn of the tide' of the fortune which has hitherto attended him, and which his grasping policy has converted from a blessing into a curse. Signed, Caustic,"—"Facts and Fancies, by 'The Favourite.' Siderolite's scratching for the Cup was one of the most barefaced cases of picking the public's pocket, that remember for a long time. While I hold that an owner has a right to strike out a horse <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>, if forestalled, he has no right to keep a horse first favourite for a week, and to strike him out after the milk-pails are full Blue Gown's case, Sir Joseph could not run him for the 2000 Guineas, on account of the large sums his commissioners had laid against him. Vagabond, in the City and Suburban, was another case. It is to be hoped the public will in future, see Sir Joeeph in his true colours."—" Racing, Past and Future, by 'Don John' Last week I remarked upon the absurdity of accepting 5 and 4 to 1 about Sir. Joseph Hawley's lot for this race, so long before the day, and my observations have been verified by the fact that 5 or 6 to 1 can at this moment be obtained without difficulty, against the solitary representative of the stable; Siderolite and Blue Gown having been shamelessly milked and scratched, without the slightest regard for the interests of the public"—(<hi rend="italic">The following paragraph, from the paper of</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th December, was also read</hi>: "The Scratchawley Libels. The only authentic report of this <hi rend="italic">cause celebre</hi> will appear in these pages next week, as we only will be able to give copies of all the authentic documents; also the racy cross-examination, which most other journals will suppress.")</p>

He further stated that for some days previous he had been very unwell and unable to attend at the office, even to correct hit own articles; that the article in question was sent by a very clever writer who had written something the week before, of which he (the defendant) approved, and he had encouraged him to write again, but was entirely ignorant that such a scurrilous matter would beat all likely to appear.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a haberdasher, of 44, Beech Street, Barbican—on 12th December, about eleven in the morning, the prisoner came to my place and produced a box of silk and ten reels of cotton, and asked me to buy them—he said he wanted 5½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a reel for the silk, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a reel for the cotton—I paid him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the silk, which was not so much as he asked, and half a crown for the ten reels of cotton; that was what he asked for it—the whole sale value of property of this kind would be 37<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound; this was about a quarter of a pound—when the prisoner left I exa<lb></lb>mined the property and made a communication to Messrs. Carlisle, believing it to be stolen—about two o'clock the same day the prisoner came again with five boxes of silk, and asked me to buy them—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then, and asked him to come for the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at four o'clock—I asked how he became possessed of them—he said some man had employed him to sell them, and he was to have 5 per cent, commission; he came again at four; in the mean<lb></lb>while I had communicated with Cheshire, the officer, and he was concealed where he could see the prisoner—I paid him the 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Cheshire was let out at the side door, and followed him—on 16th December the prisoner came again and brought 1lb. of black silk on ounce reels, and 14oz. of a differ<lb></lb>ent</p>

                  </hi>. On 12th December, in consequence of a commu<lb></lb>nication from Mr. Taylor, I went to his establishment about four o'clock—I was placed where I could not be seen—I saw the prisoner, and when he went away I followed him for several hours, and eventually to 2, George's Row, Chequer Alley, Bunhill Row, a private house—I took him into custody on the 24th at the Green Man public-house, in Featherstone Street—I called him out and asked if his name was St. Ledger—he said yes—I said I was a detective, and should take him into custody for stealing and receiving two boxes of sewing-machine silk on the 16th instant—he said, "Sewing-machine silk? I don't know what you mean; I never had any sewing-machine silk; I don't know what it is; I never saw any"—I said, "Are you a dealer in silk?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Do you mean to say you never had any silk or sold any?"—he said "No, never"—I said, "Are you quite positive?"—he said, "Yes"—I then took him away—after I had got a little distance I said, "Do you know Mr. Taylor, of Beech Street, Barbican?"—he said, "Yes, I do"—I said, "Do you now mean to tell me that you have never had any machine silk or sold any to him?"—he then said, "I have"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "I had it from a man in the public-house where you have just taken me from, but I don't know who he is, what his name is, or where he comes from; I don't ask questions of persons who bring goods to me"—I found that he lived in George's Row, in a little front room, a wretched<lb></lb>looking place, I found no silk there or any property of this description.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a trimming-seller, of 2, Wentworth Street, Whitechapel—I know nothing of the prisoner—I never saw him till he was in custody—the silk produced is mine—I did not miss it till the 16th December—on the 13th I was having some alterations made at my place of business, and had to move this silk—I had 21b. of it sent to my place that day, and on the following Monday I was a pound deficient—I had not sold any of that pound of brown, and the black was taken from the warehouse while the alteration was being made—I can swear to this silk, there is my writing on this box, and my private mark is on these labels—the silk was safe at my place on Friday night, 13th December—I can't say how it was taken.</p>

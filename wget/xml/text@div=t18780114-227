I have at 11, Hardy's Road, Peckham—on Mon<lb></lb>day evening, 24th December, about 10. 20, I was passing along New Cross Road, a little past the Brighton Railway station; I had occasion to turn aside for a moment into some place, and just as I did so Francis tripped me up, knelt on my breast, put his hand in my right side trousers pocket, and took what money I had, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and two or three coppers—I got hold of him directly, we struggled, he tried to get away—I held him, we struggled till we got out into the road—we were up and down, and while I was holding him in the road Head struck me in the forehead, and said "You have made a mistake"—he came from the opposite side of the way—the blow caused a little blackness—when he struck me Francis got away from me, and they went into a public-house together—I called for the police—Constable Barnes came up—I went with him to the public-house—Head came out first—I said "That is one of them, you hold him"—he was taken into custody—I then pointed out Francis, and the constable took him into custody—I had never seen either of them</p>

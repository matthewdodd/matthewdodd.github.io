The prisoner was my errand-boy—it was his duty to receive money on my account—debts for newspapers, which I sent out daily and weekly—I have daily customers—he was to receive of both daily and weekly customers—if he received money he was to give it to me directly he returned—I had a customer of the name of Faulkner.</p>

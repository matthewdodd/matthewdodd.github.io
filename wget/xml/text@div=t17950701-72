A little after nine o'clock at night, Tuesday last, my son and I were left in the shop alone; we are linen drapers, and have a parlour behind, in which is a window that we can see if any body comes into the shop, or passes the door; the candles were lighted on the counter, my son went out of the shop to put on his old clothes, to shut up; I see the two prisoners at the bar (they are two notorious villains) going to and fro before my shop window; I perceived them six or seven times; I suspected their intentions as knowing them very well. I put myself in a position if they entered the shop to take them. The young one he stooped into the shop, and then he looked round, and then he looked forward, and then he stood up; he saw every thing was clear and nobody was in the shop, he turns himself round to the window, and beckons to the other; then he took and turned himself short round, and wheeled himself where a bundle of muslin lay and laid hold of the wrapper; I jumps into the shop and caught him by the collar with my right hand.</p>

Brown was not in the shop, but they were in company together. I pulled them both round into the street, and sent for a constable, and they were taken to the watch-house; on searching them there was an old nail found on them, which they star the windows with, and by which I have been unfortunately hurted. They had no money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them searched? - I did not. I would wish to remark that the tall one, and which I believe the constable will witness, d-mned his eyes, and said I should not live long.</p>

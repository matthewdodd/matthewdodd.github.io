                  </hi>. I live servant with Mr. William Elliott, of Bedford-terrace, Plumstead, Kent—on Saturday evening, 6th August, I shut up the house at half-past 9 o'clock at night—I know that the shutter in the hall was fastened—there was then in the scullery a scrubbing brush, some clothes, and a piece of beef was hanging in the doorway of the scullery—on Sunday morning, about 7 o'clock, I found the beef and the other articles were gone—I went to take down the shutter of the hall window, and it was partly unfastened, and the window was unfastened—it had been fastened on the previous night—I missed a quantity of children's clothes and a brush—these are them—they are the property of my master—I saw the piece of beef at the station on Monday.</p>

I am a labourer in the Royal Arsenal—on Sunday morning, 7th August, I was in the Bloom field-road, Plumstead, about half-past 1 o'clock in the morning, about thirty yards from Mr. Elliott's house—I saw some one over the way—I don't know who it was—I could not swear to the prisoner being the man—he had something like a bag on his shoulder—I spoke to a constable and the man saw us, and he turned back—I told the constable to follow him up—the man threw down the bag and ran away—I took the bag; this is it—it contained a quantity of children's clothes, a scrubbing-brush, and some ribs of beef—I could not swear to the man who threw the bag down; he was too far off—he was in dark clothes.</p>

             sitting at a table, and before them this paper book, and these two cards; it appears on the face of them that they had been casting up some stock or another, where it is mentioned, all that I can explain in them papers, bulls and half bulls are crowns and half crowns, in coiner's language, and a bob is a shilling, flat is metal; but I do not know of my own knowledge, only from informations and confessions.</p>
               <p>Court. By what means have you known that those phrases, such as bull and bob, bear a meaning so very different? - By experience in court, and by a number of people that I have heard so use them; I have heard them from five hundred people.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I submit whether this is admissible?</p>
               <p>Court. There is no way by which a man can acquire the knowledge of language but by information; originally all our knowledge of language must come from the information of others; I do not know that bull signifies a horned beast, otherwise than by information; we have heard the word traps given in evidence a thousand times, and never objected to, and a variety of other cant phrases that are as well understood among a certain set of people, as the common words of the English Language; all language is arbitrary; I think it is admissible evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clark. Supposing a piece of metal is as thick as my two fingers, and we wish to reduce it to the thickness of one of these blanks, it is taken to the flatting-mill.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And flat has nothing of criminality annexed to it, because it may be used for buttons to a coat, or for a variety of other purposes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clark. In about three or four minutes the officers came in, and I saw the prisoner Jones wish to shift something; but first I must tell you, I asked him his name, and he said it was

            ; I asked him where he lived, and he refused to tell me; I saw all the things found, and I can describe them: upon the prisoner Denton, when he was searched, there were found a latch-key, and a key that opened the door of the three pair of stairs, and some good shillings and half crowns; two half crowns, one sixpence and two shillings, appearing to be reduced on one side, nothing else that I recollect on his person; there is a temporary door at the end of the passage, one was the key of that door, which prevented access to any part of the house but the shop.</p>
               <p>Court. Could you go through the back-parlour at any other door? - No; to go up stairs you must come into the shop and into the passage, and open this door; and the other key belong to the three pair of stairs back-room; in that back garret was found a cutting-out press fixed, dies and all fixed; the cutters were withinside ready for work; there was a large quantity of blanks, some only cut out, and some edged; there were these two turn benches, I believe they call them so that use them; one of them was fixed; it is what the watch-makers use also, any thing where nice turning is required.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030065"></xptr>Court. Was there anything fixed in the turn-bench when you found it? - No, I do not recollect there was; there were two of them in the garret, I found an instrument, it is used for two purposes, one for making, and the other for closing the edges of the metal; I do not know the name of this instrument.</p>
               <p>Court. Is this last instrument used in the mint, or is it an instrument new in the mint? - It is the first I ever saw of the kind.</p>
               <p>Then it is not a known instrument? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Mr. Nicholls, Monier of the Mint. It is not an instrument used by us.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Clark. Is there any machinery belonging to it, or does it work by hand? - It works by hand; there was in the garret eight or ten pounds weight of cecil, and some counterfeit dollars, and three half crown pieces; they are counterfeit, but they are plated on both sides, from that it is turned over and put into this tool, that closes it, the other makes the impression on the edge after it is closed; there were some finished half crowns in the garret, but the plate was taken off at the edge, it was in the same state.</p>
               <p>Court. This appears to be broke by some accident? - Here is two of them finished, and one perfect; one is that with the groove in the edge, the other finished but broke in the edge, and the other quite perfect; the one that is quite perfect I think any body would take it; there were a number of little things that are made use of, and there was a boil that they make use of, I believe, but I do not understand it.</p>
               <p>Was the cecil and blanks that were found of the same sort of metal plated on both sides? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Those blanks do not stand in need of the materials for colouring? - No, not all; I found several other little tools, such as gravers, which are used in other businesses, what they hold at the edge for cutting the grooves; the graver is applicable to the turn-bench; there was some blacking, there was no use for it unless it was to make them look old; these things are applicable to the instrument used for making and closing; I think Denton gave the key of the bureau to Carpmeal; I heard Denton say so before the magistrate; the prisoner Denton acknowledged this key to be his before the justice, with a view of discharging his wire, who was in custody; in that bureau I found these dies, and I found these, which are clearly taken down on one side to make the dies from, they are good coin; in order to make the dies, one raising one way, and the other going in the other, the impressions could not come up; if it was wrought work on each side, it would sink this way, as well as the other, so that the impression is made on one side only of the piece.</p>
               <p>Court. And that piece which you suppose the dies has been made from, then, is good coin? - Yes, the impression is totally defaced; on one side quite smooth; I fancy it is turned or smoothed down before they use it.</p>
               <p>Why is it necessary to smooth that down? - It is necessary to make the impression stronger.</p>
               <p>Have you compared these dies with this piece? - Yes I have, but one shilling being struck from a die of the Tower, is so exact that I cannot venture to swear whether that very die was made from that piece of money, it is impossible, but it evidently appears as such.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Look at that, is that die made from that puncheon? - It has every appearance of it; here are some shillings which are finished (counterfeits) which I found in the bureau; I have not examined them with the dies.</p>
               <p>Court. Compare this shilling with that die, and see if you can form any judgment? - I can only say, that they have been struck from such another as this, if not from this; I can carry it no further than your sight; they fit in.</p>
               <p>Court. Look at these two shillings with that die? - I do not think they were struck from that, they have a different appearance; I found nothing else in the bureau; Carpmeal found a great many things upon John<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030066"></xptr>Jones; two or three counterfeit dollars, and some papers of account, like those found on the table; I do not recollect any coin found on him; there were two keys, one a latch key, that opens that temporary door in the passage, and another key and a padlock key, which opened a padlock which was in the cellar; the padlock was on a vault under the court, and that was on the inner cellar door where there was a stamping press fixed, and a pair of dies in for striking shillings, and several more dies which will be produced for shillings and half crowns; some metal that had been struck up with the impression of dollars, and some with the impression of half crowns; there was no counterfeit shillings found in that cellar, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Had the cellar the appearance of being worked in? - Oh dear yes! there is no doubt but they had worked there, the place was all over grease and tallow; but I could not tell when they had been at work there, I should imagine they would be three persons from what has appeared in the court, and what I have seen and known.</p>
               <p>Court. Are two sufficient? - Two may be sufficient, one to feed the press, and the other to pull it round; upon

             I found several counterfeit shillings, to appearance they were struck from the dies that were found in the cellar; I cannot speak certainly to them, I have not examined them; and there was a broken die found upon him; nothing else but a piece of metal that the die seemingly was made from; in the three pair of stairs front room, which was not locked up, there was some of them tools, which are used in the milling instrument, and there was a lathe; there were several blank puncheons made into dies; in the two pair of stairs back room, there were flasks of sand and every thing for casting, and some patterns of puncheons, the flasks and sand had been used to cast the puncheons in; I do not recollect any thing else material in any part of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, one of the Prisoners Counsel. You say this is plated on the outside? - Apparently so.</p>
               <p>You have not taken off the outside plate to assay whether it is plated or not? - No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Nor anybody to your knowledge? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. This metal is plated manifestly, with a metal having the colour of silver; now the blanks found are cut out of a piece so plated, therefore they have at least the colour of silver; therefore, whether they are silver or not is totally immaterial; the cecils themselves have compleatly the colour of silver.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, another of the Prisoners Counsel. If the jury are of that opinion, to be sure there is an end of the objection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You admit that this turn-bench is used in several businesses, particularly in watch-making? - The turn-bench undoubtedly is used in several businesses; but there are some things belonging to that turn-bench, that I never saw in any turn-bench before, and I have seen ten thousand; it is those two centers; turn-benches in general run on centres of their own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Still it is but an improved turn-bench, that is all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. At the time you found the turn-bench, you say there was nothing at all fixed in it? - Not to my knowledge, the turn-bench is screwed into a vice, and whatever is put in, is put between those two pieces of brass, and then it is turned round, the centres are worked between two points in common.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. For the ordinary purposes of a turn-bench; this is an improved turn-bench? - Yes, a watch-maker could not use it in this state; their's is more nice, that may turn round the sixteenth of an inch on one side.</p>
               <p>You found nobody whatever making use of this press? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the door open? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. I think it seems pretty manifest from your account of the situation and manner in which the men were apprehended,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030067"></xptr>and these things found, that they had not been at work just at that time? - Not a doubt of it.</p>

               <p>I went to this house with Mr. Clark and the other officers, and searched William<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030068"></xptr>Jones, and I found upon him this bad shilling, and a piece of metal which is broke, it appears to be part of a broken die; if you look particularly in one part of it, you will find a fleur de luce in one part of it; some good shillings, and two guineas and a half in gold.</p>
               <p>Court to Shallard. What metal do you look upon this to be? - I am no judge of metal.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears to be silver.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to Mr. Clark.)</p>
               <p>What metal do you take that to be? - I suppose it to be silver.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Mr. Clark. Look at that money? - I should suppose them to be good shillings; four of these are counterfeit shillings, one is a blank, and the other has an impression such as they make the dies from; there is every appearance that that shilling is struck from that die; this part is not so visible.</p>
               <p>Can you say with any degree of certainty, whether that shilling appears to be struck from that die? - I rather think it is; it is rather too much to be positive, but it has every appearance of being so, but I think it is too far for any man to swear to.</p>
               <p>Then your evidence is this, that it has every appearance of being struck from this die, but it is going too far to swear positively? - Yes, it is; I would not swear it upon any consideration.</p>
               <p>These are bad shillings, give me the reverse die that was in this press; can you form any judgement with respect to that? - It is almost impossible, as these sort of gentlemen work at their business, and these sort of dies are not so true as they should be; therefore you see one side may come up and the other not, in the shilling you will find one of the sides is not up.</p>
               <p>Court. No, it is perfectly visible on both? - Then I have not seen it; I have compared the head side (looks at it by a glass), there is a singular circumstance in this, that three of the quarters of the arms are rather visible, and one seems to be weaker; these blanks were found in the garret.</p>
               <p>What metal are they made of? - Why Sir, I have not a doubt, though it has been disputed here, but that it is plated on both sides with silver.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think there is much reason to doubt that.</p>
               <p>What are these blank six-pences? - I rather think they are silver.</p>
               <p>Court. I think in the explanation you gave of the cant word bulls; what did that signify? - Crown pieces.</p>
               <p>Bobs you said, signified shillings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I fancy you are not in this case so accurate as to cant language, as to the other parts of the case; let me look at the little book now? - I never looked at it.</p>
               <p>It cannot be as Mr. Clark has understood it to be; it is clear that this part of the evidence can have no effect, unless it is accurately explained; and it is clear that Mr. Clark has misunderstood the language used for bulls, if that has an application of the kind, that it is supposed to have; it cannot mean crowns, but must mean guineas; for here are in both the accounts, the book and the paper; one, bulls 25, and the other, bulls 25 pieces, valued at 26 l. 5 s. then there are bobs which are supposed to be shillings, 970 both in the book and in Jones's paper 970, 28 l. 5 s. 10 d. if they were shillings, it would be 48 l. 10 s. the bobs will not do for any current coin in this kingdom, it will not answer; therefore in whatever sense others have used these words, it is perfectly clear, that these people have not used them in that sense; that takes off the application, it is an account of some business, in which they do not make use of the usual language.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It may smuggled tobacco, and obscene books, or any thing.</p>

            , was there any of the base money that was found in any other part that fitted the dies that were in the standing press? - I do not know that there were; here is a blank that was found on that Jones, that apparently<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178906030069"></xptr>was made and manufactured by the tools that were up stairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. An unfinished blank which might be manufactured from any other tools of the same sort.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clark. This is it.</p>
               <p>Court. How are you able to say that was manufactured from the tools up stairs; - It is impossible for me to say; it is edged the same, and it throws up a ridge, that where ever manufactured, it must have an instrument of that kind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It amounts to this; that it might be manufactured with these tools, or with some other tools of a similar sort.</p>
               <p>Court. Yes, and it appears very clearly to have a double edge; it is clear this blank is plated metal joined at the edges.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Is this counterfeit money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. What metal do you conceive these base metal pieces found in the cellar to be? - I look upon them to be a metal of copper and brass mixed together, but merely for trying the dies; when the dies are not level, one bears on the other, and the impression comes up stronger; therefore they take up a piece of metal to try them.</p>
               <p>Therefore this never could be made into silver coin? - No, not as it appears to me; clearly not, as to anything that appears here.</p>

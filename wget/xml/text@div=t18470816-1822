                  </hi> On the 13th of Aug., I and the prisoner, who is my hus<lb></lb>band, were living at 31, Monkwell-street, near Falcom-square—I remember his coming home between three and four o'clock that afternoon—he was not sober—I told him his dinner was ready—he said he should like to lie down—he did lie down, and told me to rouse him in an hour—I let him lie about an hour and a half—I then awoke him—he came down, and we had tea—we had no quarrel, we were quite comfortable—as I was putting away the tea-things he saw part of his work lying on the table, and said, "Where is the other part?"—I said, "I don't know, you have not left it anywhere, have you?"—he said, "No, I have not," and he then struck me once or twice on my face and back—I got out of the room, and was going down stairs—be<lb></lb>fore I left the room I saw him take a file in his hand, as if to go into the shop to work—he uses a file—when I had got down about three stairs, I found the file in my back—I took it out, and found some blood—I believe I called out, "O Baxter, see here at my back!"—I did not observe where my husband was—I went into Baxter's room, and my back was washed—my husband came into the room while my back was being washed, and struck me again—I went to Mr. Childs, the surgeon—I am not under his care now.</p>

Last Friday evening I was called into the house, and saw Mrs. Smith lying on a bed—her back was bleeding—her husband came in soon afterwards—I said, "How came you to use such violence to your wife?"—he said he was very sorry, he did not do it for the purpose, that he was in the act of striking her with the file in his hand, and the file went into her back—I asked Mrs. Smith if she wished to make any charge against her husband—she said, no, she did not think he did it intentionally—I sent Mrs. Smith to Mr. Lloyd, the nearest medical man, and Mr. Child saw her afterwards.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon. I was sent for to the house, examined Mrs. Smith's back, and found she had received an oblique punctured wound, close on the left border of the shoulder-blade towards the spine—she had lost a considerable quantity of blood—it was a triangular wound, such an instrument as this file would certainly have caused it—I should say it was done with this—I considered it likely to be dangerous; it was over an important artery, if it had not struck against the shoulder-blade it would most likely have entered the lung—the end of the file is not sharp therefore it must have been struck with great force.</p>

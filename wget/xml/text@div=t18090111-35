On the 6th of December, a publican in our neighbourhood, came to my shop and said he had a woman in custody, who was suspected of stealing a piece of velvet; I searched and found a piece missing. I went with him to his house, in Hemlock court, where I saw the prisoner and the velvet; I looked at the velvet, unrolled it and saw a small piece of linen affixed to it, with my mark.</p>

            . I keep the Punch Bowl, Hemlock court. On the 6th of December, about one o'clock in the day, the prisoner came in company with another woman into my private bar, and called for two glasses of gin; we observed her busy stooping down on the floor, as if endeavouring to secrete somethings; upon interrogating her she ran away; we followed her;

            . I am servant to Mr. Lessel. On the 6th of December, between two and three in the afternoon, the prisoner came in with another woman and called for a quartern of gin; she stooped down to pick up something; my mistress asked her what she had there; she opened the door and ran away; I went after her; she throwed the bundle down the cellar; the sweep's boy picked it up and came and gave it into my hands; I am sure it is the same bundle she threw away.</p>

I have one partner, and am a carpenter and builder, and live and carry on business in Theobald's-road—I had premises in Red Lion-place, Cock-lane, West Smithfield—my business had ceased to be carried on there, and we moved to Theobald's-road—within the yard which encloses the premises in Cock-lane there was a tenement inhabited by the prisoner—in con<lb></lb>sequence of receiving information on the 28th of March, I went to Christ's Hos<lb></lb>pital, where I knew the prisoner worked—I said to him, "Clarke, I have had a letter, informing me that you have property belonging to us in your cellar; I don't know whether it is true or not; but if it is not, it will clear your cha<lb></lb>racter from any suspicion in our minds, and we shall be very glad to say that you are an honest man; if there is nothing in the cellar, you will have no ob<lb></lb>jection to let us look"—he said, "I don't know why I should let you look in my cellar; it is a funny thing to want to search a man's house"—I said "Very well; of course I cannot compel you; if you do not, we must proceed in the regular way; I must go and get a search warrant"—he said "Very well; if I must I must"—I said, "Here is an officer, who will go with you"—Death was with me—I and Death then accompanied him to his house—he said, "I have a couple of boxes of yours there"—I said, "Very well; let us have a look at them"—it was dusk—I got a candle; and when I got into the cellar, I found it as full as it could possibly be of wooden laths, boxes, scaffold boards, lengths of scaffold poles, and two or three butlocks—a great many of the scaffold boards had our name on them, and a brand mark, L. and N., our initials, on them—these are them—here is another board with our brand mark on it—I found the boxes he spoke of in an inner cellar—they had been made by me—my gates are generally shut at six o'clock at night, and opened at six in the morning—the hospital is about 300 yards from my premises.</p>

I said Yes - he said, "I think I know who has your money - a man of the name of Joe;" I said, "No, he has not got it" - I took the prisoner to the watch-house the next morning; he gave me three sovereigns first, and then three sovereigns more and the gold ring - he made an attempt to run away; I took him by the collar, and took him and the money to the watch-house - I had never seen him before that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not come up to you that night, after you left the house, and tell you he knew who had your money? A. Yes - I was tired, and a little intoxicated, but not much so; I was sleeping in the public-house - there was a man named Benning sitting beside me, as he informed me, but I believe not next to me - there was a fiddle playing, and several persons were there; I did say that if the prisoner would make my money up within 1l., I would go away; I do not recollect seeing him there at all that night - I said openly that I had been robbed of my money; if he was there he had the opportunity of hearing it; I never said before the Magistrate that if he would admit the money was mine he should be let go - I did not hear that he was the person that night, or I could have taken him; I said to him, "How do you know I have been robbed?" and he replied, "I heard you say so in the public-house" - I do not remember seeing Mr. Benning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He gave you this money and ring the next morning? A. Yes.</p>

            . I went into the public-house, and saw the prosecutor sitting there; I saw the prisoner put his left hand into his right-hand pocket and pull something out, but I saw no money - I tried to awaken the prosecutor but could not - I had other business and left them; I had worked for the prosecutor once, and I knew the prisoner very well; I am quite sure I saw what I have stated.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Of course you told the landlord what you had seen? A. No; the house was quite full-I did not tell any one; I was once tried in the Navy, for shooting a man, but I was innocent.</p>

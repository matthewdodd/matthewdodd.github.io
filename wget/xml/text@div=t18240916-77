            . I live at Knightsbridge. On the 15th of August I met Smith and Harris in Oxford-street, as I was returning from an errand in London, which was the reason of my being out so late; it was about ten minutes past eleven o'clock; they were strangers to me, but I am certain of their persons. They enquired where I was going - I said to Knightsbridge; they said they were going there, and should they walk with me. I agreed, and we went down Park-lane, as far as Hyde Park-corner; they then invited me with them; I went to <placeName id="t18240916-77-crimeloc420">No. 11, Pump-court</placeName>

I put my small-clothes under the pillow with the watch in them. I awoke about five o'clock, and found them both in the room, and charged them with stealing it, which they denied - the door was fastened inside. They then went out of the room, and I said that if they did not give me the watch I would fetch a constable. I got one in about twenty minutes, but the door was then padlocked outside. I saw them at the watch-house, and was certain of them. I had given Smith 2 s. I was perfectly sober - I had had a quartern of gin with them in Oxford-street; that was all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HARRIS. He gave me his watch to keep till morning - Witness. I am positive I did not.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended Harris and Smith in Pump-court, and Yewer in Duck-yard; there is a communication between them. I told them the charge, and they denied it - I found the watch in Yewer's possession; I took them on Sunday, the 15th. The prosecutor said at the watch-house that he did not care about his money if he could get his watch; Harris said,</p>
               <p>"I will tell you where the watch is if you will go with me;" she then went to Yewer's, and said something to her, and Yewer gave me this handkerchief and the watch in it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I met Lloyd at half-past five o'clock on the 15th of August - he said he had been robbed in Pump-court; we went there, and the door was locked. As I was going home I looked into Pump-court, and the prisoners were at home.</p>

               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I know nothing about it, for soon after we got home I went out again, and did not return till morning.</p>

               <p>YEWER'S Defence. Harris brought me this handkerchief to take care of. I did not know what was in it.</p>

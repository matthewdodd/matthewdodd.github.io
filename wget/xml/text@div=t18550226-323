                  </hi>. I am barrack sergeant at Hounslow. On 20th Feb., the prisoner came to deliver some stores—I gave him something to repair</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185502260009"></xptr>
               <p>—I left him to fill up the receipt book—the prisoner had been a general receiver and deliverer—he had to take the things to wash, and bring them back—he was a sort of porter—on this occasion, I gave him a blue serge gown to be repaired—he made it up in a bundle, and walked away—just as he was going out of the door, I said, "How many palliasse have I given you?"—he said, "Eleven"—I said "Eleven! you must be mistaken; twenty-nine I have given you"—he said, "No, eleven, is it not, Mr. Savage?"—I said, "No"—he passed on to the van, and put the bundle in the van; and while he was doing that, I saw a piece of a rug ooze out of the bundle—I took it in my fingers, and drew it out of the bundle—I said, "Halloo, Moore, what is this?"—he said, "That is a rug I brought with me—"For what 1"I said—he said, "To keep me warm"—I said, "Look here, the plaits have not been open yet; it shall not leave my fingers, till I go and count my stock"—I went and counted the pile of rugs which were close by where he had rolled up the blue serge dress, and I found, instead of forty rugs, only thirty-eight—I had counted them two days before, and they were correct—this is the rug that I caught hold of, which he took out of the store—here is the mark of the Board of Ordnance on it—this other rug I did not find till after I had counted the number of rugs—when I missed two rugs, I went to the van and found this other rug—this has the Board of Ordnance mark on it—the prisoner did not bring any rugs into the store—I saw him go out and take this bundle, and out of it came this one rug, and the other rug I found in the van—at all events, he came without two rugs and he went away with two.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, T</hi> 18). I went to the barracks and saw the last witness and the prisoner there—the last witness said that these two rugs had been stolen from a pile that he had in his store, and he had seen Moore wrap this up in a serge gown, and stopped him with one rug, and went again to the van and found another rug—I went and saw the pile of rugs, and they corresponded exactly with these, and these were, in the fold, the same size as the others were.</p>

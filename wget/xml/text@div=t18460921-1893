I am manager to the Thames Plate Glass Company's works—Clark was in the Company's employ—he was excavating some ground for the purpose of a new building, close adjoining the building where the lead supplied by Mr. Ince was being used—I have compared this lead with the works—I took these pieces on the roof where the plumber was engaged that day—I have compared them with the lead, and find them to correspond precisely with that which was put there—the time for leaving work on Satur<lb></lb>day is five o'clock in the afternoon—I did not see Clark leave that day—on the evening of the day on which the prisoners were taken there had been very heavy showers, and I saw marks of Venetian red on these pieces of lead—they had been excavating some ground where a quantity of refuse Venetian red had been shot down, and there were marks of it on the lead—that is an article we use in finishing glass.</p>

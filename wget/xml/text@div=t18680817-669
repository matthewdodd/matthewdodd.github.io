                  </hi>, I am a horse dealer, of Hitchenden Mews—I have resided at Notting Hill nearly 20 years—my wife Catherine Allen was living with me—I have been shown some clothing and articles in possession of the police, worth about 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., most of it was women's wearing apparel—some of Mr. Prince's was with her's, there was a suit of his clothes, and several things, shirts and collars—there were eight or ten silk handkerchiefs of mine and a lot of wearing apparel—the bulk of the wearing apparel was my wife's—the value of that and the bed linen, and one thing or other, was about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—there were table cloths, pillow cases, and several things—they were things which I had been using in my household—I saw some spoons and forks at the station, some knives and a teapot—I believe them to be my property—I don't know how long before 1st July they had been in my house, because I was mostly out in the country at horse fairs—I had had the handkerchiefs in use about a week before—the last time I was at home before 1st July was about 28th June—I then went to Spalding Fair, Lincoln<lb></lb>shire—I left my wife at home and I gave her 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I did not want to take with me, to put with the other money—as far as I know the table cloths and other things were there then—the prisoner was a particular friend of mine, and was often at my place—he was a master butcher at Notting Hill, within 100 yards of my stable, and lived nearly opposite—I had known him nearly three years; he had been a visitor at my house for eighteen months—I have sold him a horse or two, and have had supper over it with him—my wife has been there at the time—after going to Spalding Fair I went to Thorney, in Cambridgeshire, and got back to London on 1st July—I then found my wife gone—I enquired for Prince, but could not find him—I then examined and missed my property; it could not have been taken by one person—three large boxes were afterwards shown to me by the police; two of them belong to me and had been in my house before I went to Spalding—they were filled with things—a woman could not lift them.</p>

               <p>I went on board the <hi rend="italic">City of Cork</hi> steamer, at Cork; she was bound for America—I found the prisoner and Mrs. Allen on board together, with some luggage—I told them what they were charged with—I found their passage ticket for New York upon the woman—I did not read it in their presence—I read the telegram that I had for them—I found no passage ticket on the prisoner—he said he was going to New York with his wife; she was present at the time—I told them to order up the boxes that belonged to them, and that any property that belonged to them they had better take out of the ship—we went down the after hold, and the prisoner picked out three boxes; they are here—they were locked; he had the keys—I opened the boxes in the presence of a police-officer from Scotland Yard—they were afterwards examined by Allen, and all the property, except a few articles, in the three boxes, were identified by him as his property—I can't recollect in which of the boxes the handkerchiefs were—he identified several articles mixed here and there in the three boxes—I brought them to London.</p>

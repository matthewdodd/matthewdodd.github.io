I went out about four o'clock with my family last Sunday to my brother's house, and left nobody at home. When I returned, which was betwixt eight and nine, before I opened my door, I observed my window was open, the glass was broke, and a short curtain was let down; I told my wife I thought my house was robbed. She immediately went over to my neighbour, Mr. Betley: he came, and followed me into the house. As soon as we were in, he said, I'll shut the door, to secure all that are in. I then heard a fort of a struggling behind the door; I was rather farther in the house than he. Mr. Betley mentioned the word thief. I turned round, and saw him struggling with a man. I called out for assistance; a neighbour came; we secured him, and brought him into an inward room. It was the prisoner at the bar. We sent for Mr. Sheene, the constable, who took charge of him. I found a looking-glass was lying under the window, which, at our going out, was hanging up; and a piece of stuff was taken out of a drawer, and laid upon the glass. I went up stairs, and observed another looking-glass, that did stand upon a chest of drawers, was put upon the bed, upon the quilt, and the quilt folded up, much the same as when in the drawer. (The goods produced in court, and deposed to). I am very sure the windows were fast when I went out, and the door double locked. I did not think of staying till dark, so I did not put up the window shutter. I was the last out of the room above stairs, and the last out of the house. The quilt was in the drawer where the glass stood upon when we went out. The constable carried the prisoner to the watch-house; and, on the Monday morning, we took him before Sir

            . Last Sunday night I was sitting by my fire; the woman came and said her house was robbed. I went out. The prosecutor went into his house, and I followed him. I said, I'll shut the door; if there should be any thieves in, I will shut them in. I cried out immediately, A thief! The prisoner was behind the door: he jumped upon me, intending to get off. We had a scuffle for about two minutes. We secured him, and took him to the watch-house. I heard him, both at the watch-house and Sir

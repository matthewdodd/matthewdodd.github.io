               <p>RICHARD TICKTON. I live at Somers-town. I went with the prisoner to her lodgings, between one and two o'clock in the morning, on the 13th of March, and went with her in the morning to the Three Crowns, where there was a dispute about my breaking a glass - I took my watch out, it fell on the ground, and to the best of my knowledge she took it up, and went away; I remained a little time and made my loss known - she did not come back - I am certain I did not give it to her, nor authorize her, or any one, to raise any thing upon it.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from the street you live in? - About the third of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you pushed by force or did you go voluntary? - By force, as near as I can recollect, for I was in liquor, it was about nine o'clock at night. I had been drinking down East Smithfield. I found myself robbed the time that I was being pushed.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you when you got into the house? - I came out again as soon as I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there? - I did not stay any longer than I could help, I was not sober.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house did you miss your watch from? - I cannot recollect nothing but the entry; the girls that shoved me in I suppose robbed me, I did not go further than the entry; I struggled and would not go any farther in.</p>
               <p>Q. Who you saw in that house you cannot tell? - No, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your apron, and your handkerchief, and your money? - In my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them? - I missed them all when I got out.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do? - I got home as fast as I could and got the second evidence to come up with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch, handkerchief, and apron again? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know against the two prisoners at the bar respecting this? - I don't know, but there was the master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300016"></xptr>of the house and I thought I might come to some knowledge of it.</p>

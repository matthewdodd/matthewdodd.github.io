            . I am servant to Mr. Caley. I packed up six cloaks on Saturday, November 17th. On Monday our maid came and informed us, about an hour after we had missed the parcel, that she had seen a woman go into a neighbouring alehouse with a new cloak, which she suspected was one of ours. I went to the alehouse, and stopt the prisoner; she had the cloak on. I asked her how she came by it; she said first, that she had bought it; afterwards, she said her mother gave it her; and at last she said a man had given it to her for a night's lodging.</p>

               <p>I was walking down Lendenhall-street on Sunday night; a young man asked me to drink with him; we went to an alehouse, and he spent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050003"></xptr> 3 s. upon me; then he asked me to go and lie with him; I said I would, if he would make me a present. He said he had spent all his money, but he had got a cloak he had bought for his sweet-heart; that she had affronted him, and he would give it me; which he did, for a night's lodging.</p>

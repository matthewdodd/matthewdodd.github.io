            . I am a solicitor, and live in Alsop's-terrace. On Wednesday eveening, the 31st of October, between five and six o'clock, I was in <placeName id="t18321129-53-crimeloc306">Margaret-street, near Prince's-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. If the driver had driven as he ought, in a cautions manner, could the accident have taken place? A. Certainly not; the lady appeared to be walking very well -I do not think there was any body in the cab.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Are you attorney for this prosecution? A. No; it was nearer six o'clock than five; it was twi-light - there were two gaslights opposite Sir Claude Scott's, which gave a great light - I was near Prince's-street; I saw the cab just at the corner of Cavendish-square - the accident happened fifty or sixty yards from the corner; I do not exactly know when the lady began to cross, but think it must have been when the cab was coming round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Would there not be abundant time for her to cross before it came that distance? A. Not at the rate he was coming; he was gallopping, not trotting - I do not know how far across the lady had got; I was looking at the cab more than her, as I thought she must be run over - I did not call out to her; I did not think it would have any effect; the accident happened near Sir Claude Scott's, on the left-hand side coming from Cavendish-square; I was further from the square - the road may be seven or eight yards wide, or more; he was driving most furiously - it entirely happened from the manner he was driving; she might have seen the cab, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had seen it coming at this furious rate, she must have put herself in the way of it? A. She tried certainly to run to the pavement to get out of the way.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you walking along the pavement? A. Yes; I heard no cry of warning from the driver to her - when I first saw the horse it was gallopping - the driver whipped it after that; and after the accident, he whipped it again to get out of the way.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the lady on the side that the driver was sitting? A. Yes, she must have been - I do not know whether he came round the corner or not, but just at the corner he was gallopping; he was on the proper side of the road - the lady came from the right side, and the off shaft struck her.</p>

            . I am a journeyman fishmonger, and live in Wigmore-street, Cavendish-square. On the evening in question I was at the end of Prince's-street, before the cab - I saw the cab four or five yards before the accident happened; I was about ten yards from where it happened; I saw it four or five yards before it came to the lady; it was being driven violently - the horse was gallopping, and the driver was whipping it; I do not think there was any fare in the cab - I saw Lady Barham cross towards Sir

            's; the shaft on the off side caught her, and knocked her down - I did not hear the driver call to her to get out of the way; I was near enough to hear if he had - the cab went over the lady, over some part of her body; I think it was near her breast - she laid on the ground insensible; the wheel jolted in going over her; the driver must have been conscious of it; he did not stop to give any assistance - I called to him to stop - he was near enough to hear me; the road in Prince's-street is paved, but in Margaret-street it is Macadamized; I saw the number of the cab was 897; I ran after it four or five yards to stop him - I think he gallopped faster; I think he was frightened; I came back to the lady - she seemed much hurt; two persons assisted in getting her up, and put her on the steps of the banking-house; I there left her in the hands of her friends -I recognized her ladyship as Lady Caroline Barham; I had known her some time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. This was about the time the gas is lighted? A. Yes; it was between light and dark - I did not notice any dizziness - the gas was just lighted; I think it would be more difficult to see a person at that time than at any other; I was standing at the right-hand corner of Prince's-street, furthest from Cavendish-square - the cab was on the other side - I was about ten yards from it when the wheel went over her; if the driver had called out at all, I think I must have heard him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said you thought this happened accidentally? A. Yes, by negligence; I received 5s. for helping her ladyship - I had a deal of trouble in fetching a coach from Oxford-street, and complained that it was not sufficient, and got a friend to write to say I was not satisfied, as one of the young ladies said I should be handsomely rewarded - and after I had given my evidence at the office I received 20s. more for the trouble I had in picking her ladyship up - it was left at a shop for me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you sure her ladyship was not moving out of the way to avoid another carriage at the time? A. No, I saw no other carriage there.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see or converse with any body about the 20s.? A. No, I was ten yards from the cab - her ladyship was crossing; the cab-driver could have seen her as well as I could, I saw her plainly - I did not notice whether she mended her pace as the cab came along.</p>

            ; I was called in that evening - she was sitting on a sofa in the front dining-room, with Mr. Jones, and a number of people round her: she had great difficulty of breathing, and complained of pain - she put her hand to her breast, and on the right side of the thorax, there was a mark of contusion; five ribs were broken, and the radius of the left arm was broken near the wrist - the radius is the large bone of the arm; her being run over would occasion the injury - the two ribs behind might be broken by the shaft, and the other three by the wheel; she lived till Saturday afternoon, the 3rd: the body was opened in my presence - I have not a doubt these injuries caused her death.</p>

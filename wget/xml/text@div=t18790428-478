                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at the Neptune Coffee House, Shadwell—the evening of 14th April the prisoner followed me into the Gun Boat public-house, St. George's Street, and asked me for a glass of beer—I told her to work for her beer, the same as I did, but afterwards gave her a glass—I paid for that with silver, but I had 171 sovereigns in a bag, which I had out on the counter one or two times, and the landlord said that it was rather foolish of me, but I did not take the money out of the bag, and I had my hand on it all the time—the prisoner followed me out, and I went to her house—a man was there who she said was her husband—I had a glass of drink there and went to sleep very soon, and was aroused by their taking my money out of my pocket—a great portion of it fell on the ground as the bag was pulled out—I made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at it, but it fell—they both assaulted and overpowered me; I got a portion of the money, but they got it away from me, and kicked and bruised me and tore my clothes, so that the suit was only valued at 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at a store afterwards—they got me down on the ground and I struggled—when I got up I fell asleep again, and when I awoke my money was all gone—some of it was Sydney sovereigns and some English—I brought them from Swan River, and drew them out of the South Australian Bank before I sailed—I have not the slightest doubt the prisoner is the woman—they were both gone when I awoke, and I got away—I was stupid and senseless the best part of the night—I have not seen a sovereign since, or the bag.</p>

I keep the Gun Boat, St. George's Street—on 14th April, about 6.15, Harrisson came in—the prisoner came in too, and they drank together—Harrisson pulled out a bag and put it on the counter—he did not tell me what it was, but I felt it, and said that if it was all gold it was a pity, because it would be a temptation, and advised him to go home—he left the house with the prisoner—he had had something, but he was not tipsy.</p>

I looked in, and saw the prosecutor and two women, Mrs. Andrews and Mrs. Madden. I could get them here next Session. It is very hard for me to suffer for other people's doings. I do not know whether Mr. Cole, the landlord of the While Fox, is here. I changed the first sovereign there.</p>

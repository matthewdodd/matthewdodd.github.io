I live at 374, Essex Road, Islington—about 1 o'clock on the morning of 31st March I was called, and went down stairs—I found my shop broken open, and missed several things, such as purses, and rings, and chains—Tidmarsh has been in my service—it was his duty to keep the shop clean, and shut it up—it was shut up about 9.30 on the night of the 30th—the next morning I went next door, where Tidmarsh is also employed—I saw him there, and took him to my shop—he was asked what he knew about the place being broken into—first he denied knowing anything about it, but afterwards be admitted that he let in the other boy while he was shutting up, and that the other boy took the things.</p>

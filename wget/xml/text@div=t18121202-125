               <p>WILLIAM RUMBALL. I am shopman to Mr. Saunders, slop-seller, New Road. St. George's in the East. My master's shop is opposite of the prosecutor's house. On the 20th of November, about three in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner go inside of the prosecutor's door, in the habit of a chimney-sweeper. I saw a young fellow standing about the door; after the prisoner had gone in, he went past the door. He was a suspicious character in my eye. He went up and down by the door, while the prisoner was inside; immediately the prisoner came out of the prosecutor's door, he said to the other, come along.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in the house - A. About two or three minutes. I crossed over to the house immediately. Mrs. Blair was sitting in the back room; she said she had lost some spoons. I went in pursuit of the prisoner. I overtook the prisoner in Church-street, Whitechapel. I took the prisoner by the collar; the other man ran away. I asked him what he had done with the spoons; he said, what spoons. I took him to a public-house in Lambeth-street. The officer, on searching him, found five silver tea-spoons in the lining of his breeches, and a pair of sugar-tongs. They were afterwards claimed by Mrs. Blair.</p>

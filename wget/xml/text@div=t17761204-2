             sworn.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A cabinet and chair-maker by trade.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Hart-street, Covent-garden.</p>
               <p>What do you know of the prisoner? - I saw him guilty of a very dirty action.</p>
               <p>Begin regularly? - Last Wednesday I was at the Harlequin in Drury-lane, and had a pint of beer; the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>At what time? - About eight o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No, only coming up time after time bothering after me; he asked me to drink many a time.</p>
               <p>Then you knew him personally? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He came in about eight o'clock? - Yes; I was in the public tap-room at the Harlequin; he asked me to drink.</p>
               <p>Was there any body there? - Yes, there were people there; but I don't know who they were rightly; I did drink part of a pint of beer with him; then he sent for a quartern of gin; then he asked me if I would go home and eat part of a piece of turkey and a piece of goose he had got; he said, I should be welcome to eat part of it; I went home with him.</p>
               <p>Where? - In Nag's Head-court, Drury-lane; a gentleman that was there, that keeps his carriage sent for a couple of bottles of wine; there were five gentlemen there besides him.</p>
               <p>What all to sup with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - He washes and irons and cooks, and that for these sodomites; and picks up young fellows for them.</p>
               <p>Is he of no particular trade? - No; after the two bottles of wine were drank out, I went home about my business; they did not act any indecency then with me; the next day they came and enquired after me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Come to the time that you know any thing against the prisoner? - It was Thursday night that I saw the action; he came after me to my quarters in Exeter-street, he wanted to speak to me; I had not been in above ten minutes before I saw him; he said, a gentleman would be glad to speak to me concerning some business out of the country; accordingly I went along with him to his house; they took me up stairs; there were, I believe, about fourteen of them in all, gentlemen and gentlemen's servants together; by and by there was a rug hung up taken from a bed in the room; there was a fire-place and every thing; the rug was put up in one corner of the room; Brooks, who is a <rs id="t17761204-2-viclabel10" type="occupation">gentleman's servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17761204-2-victim65 t17761204-2-viclabel10"></join>, and the prisoner, went behind it; Brooks is not yet taken; and there they had connections together.</p>
               <p>How do you know that? - I saw it; after they saw that I was for going, and they would not let me; they took the key out of the door.</p>
               <p>Did the rug continue hanging down? - One might see at one corner; and I sat against the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Was the rug quite close to the wainscoat? - No, not one side; there was an opening that one might see; it was hung over a line at one corner of the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. You must be very particular in describing what you saw? - I saw Brooks leaning his head against the wall: they had both their breeches down; he pulled out his - and put it into Brooks's - .</p>
               <p>How long had they been behind this rug before you saw this? - Not above three minutes.</p>
               <p>How long did they continue behind the rug? - Not above ten minutes, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>How far was you from them? - Not farther than from that gentleman (about three yards).</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing else? - I saw the nastiness about the room that came out of Burrows.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in the room? - At the corner where they were, just behind Brooks.</p>
               <p>Afterwards they sat down and began kissing and slavering over me, and wanted to do the same with me; they began kissing me, and used me very ill; a gentleman offered me three guineas if I would go and lie with him at an inn; and afterwards he offered to make it up ten.</p>
               <p>How many were there in the room at this time? - Fourteen.</p>
               <p>Did you sit there all the time? - They would not let me go out; they said, you will be locked out; you had better, said a gentleman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177612040005"></xptr> lie along with me; after seeing so much clandestineness, I insisted upon going home.</p>
               <p>At what time was this, the day or night? - This was about nine o'clock at night; they kept me till between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Can you positively undertake to swear that this man's - was in Brooks's - ? - Yes, I am positive of it, because Burrows pulled off his coat.</p>
               <p>What became of their shirts? - They tucked them up.</p>
               <p>Where you sat you say you saw them behind the rug, and they were doing this for ten minutes? - In the course of ten minutes from the beginning to the end, as nigh as I could guess.</p>
               <p>Did you sit quietly upon your chair during the time? - Yes; and did not seem to see any thing; that transaction made me sick, I wanted to go, but they took the key out of the door.</p>
               <p>What position were they in to you? - I looked at them side-ways.</p>

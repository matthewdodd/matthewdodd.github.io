                  </hi>. I am shopwoman to Mrs. Hamilton, who keeps a tobacconist's shop in Holborn. On Wednesday, 19th April, I was in the shop—the prisoner came in at near 1 o'clock, I served him with 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco—he gave me a sixpence, I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I put the six-pence in a cigar box, by itself—the sixpence looked a very old one—I thought it was good, but I put it alone—the prisoner left, and in about ten minutes he came again for another 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco—I served him and he gave me a sixpenny piece, I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—a man was coming in at the time, and in the hurry I put the sixpence in the till—there was very little other money there—but that sixpence that J put in the till was never found—the prisoner left—he came again the next day and had another 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco, and he changed another sixpence, I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—and knowing him I looked in the box, and found the other sixpence had not been taken out, and I put this one with it—before I put it in I tried it—the prisoner went out of the shop, I bent it and put it in—I gave those two sixpences to Mrs. Hamilton on Thursday evening, the 20th—no one serves in the shop, but Mrs. Hamilton and I—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

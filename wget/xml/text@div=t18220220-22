I went to bed on the 17th of January, about twelve o'clock; my brother was the last person up, but when I went to bed, the outer doors were secured. I had 292 lbs. of black tea, and 114 lbs. of green tea in the stock, at three o'clock in the afternoon, it was in the shop - my silver watch and key hung over the fire place at supper time, I left them there at night. The tea was worth 126 l., and the watch 50 s. - I had 4 l. or 5 l., in loose copper money in the till, I got up a little before seven o'clock in the morning, it was daylight - I had heard no noise in the night, I was the first person that came down. I found the shop door wide open, and a mat against it; no force had been applied, it must have been done with a picklock - the tea was in five chests, three black and two green. On going into the shop, I found the cannisters in disorder, and one of them empty, which was half full when I went to bed. I found the yard door, at the back of the house, had been opened from within, and on going into the yard, I found the yard door, which leads into Three Fox-court, broken open by a crow-bar. I had had it nailed up ever since I had been in the house, it had the marks of a crowbar. I found some person had got over the wall and down on a dust hole, and from there, crept through the iron rails, into my back kitchen window - they could then open the back door of the house, and the shop door. On going into the house again, I found the back parlour had been entered, and from 8 l. to 9 l., in 5 s. papers of copper taken from a desk, which was generally open, the watch also was taken from the same parlour. The prisoner is a strange to me. On going down Three Fox-court, I met a carman, who gave me the till which had been stolen that night, and on going further down the court, I met Okell. The same morning, about eight o'clock, I saw my watch in the possession of Forbes. I saw three bags of tea, of a similar quality to what I lost, and two of the bags are like those in my house, but the tea was not in them in my house; one is a rice bag, and rice was strewed about my shop, and on emptying that bag, I found rice mixed with the tea at the bottom of it - I cannot say whether the kitchen window was secure.</p>

            . I am brother of the last witness. I went to bed about half an hour after him, and was the last person up. The back parlour and the shop door were secure, I locked the back parlour door myself; the watch was then safe, the clock struck one, as I got into bed, and I thought I heard the back door go; I listened, a quarter of an hour, heard no more, and went to sleep; my brother awoke me at seven o'clock, and I found the things as he has described.</p>

            . I am a constable. The prosecutor's house is in the city. About a quarter before one o'clock in the morning, of the 18th, or the night of the 17th of January, I was at the watch-house, in Cow-cross-street; Okell, the patrol, came to the door with another person, with three bags of tea, which Mr. Gardiner afterwards claimed. I went out with two patrols, without their coats, and on entering the pig-market, I saw the prisoner apparently rising up from one of the pens; I went up and seized him, he made a very strong resistance, and said he would not be taken, for he had done nothing - we took him to the watch-house, as we went, I saw him put his left hand towards his pocket; I told Okell to secure his left hand and I laid hold of his right, we confined both his hands, and took him to the watch-house - upon searching him, we found a watch in his left side breast pocket, which Mr. Gardiner claimed, the glass was broken, but the watch was going - I asked him how he came to carry his watch in that pocket, he made no answer, but said it was his own; I asked the maker's name and number, he said he did not know, and that he had no mark on it - he said there was a person who could describe it, and knew it to be his; he did not name the person, nor produce any such person. In his other pocket, I found a drop latch, a common small box key, and a letter addressed to Mr. C. Marshall, No. 10, Lower Hart-street, Covent Garden. I went to that place the next day, and found the latch key opened the door. I locked him up, and between seven and eight o'clock, saw Mr. Gardiner, and asked him to describe the watch, which he did before I produced it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the pig-market from the prosecutor's - A. Within one hundred yards - he was up three or four pens.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was going my rounds between three and four o'clock, in Three Fox-court, and saw a carman cleaning his horses, and as he took his horses to water, he perceived three bags in his stable, and told me. I took two, and he brought the other to the watch-house with me; my two weighed above 70 lbs.; they contained tea, which Mr. Gardiner claimed in the morning; the other weighed 29 lbs. In the morning, Mr. Gardiner shewed me his premises, the door leading to Three Fox-court, was forced open; that appeared to be the way they had got in. I went with Forbes to the pens in Smithfield, and saw the prisoner there - Forbes's account is correct. I saw the watch taken from his left hand inside coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was the tea found from the pens - A. Near two hundred yards. The stable is not above twenty yards from Gardiner's.</p>

I had been drinking in Brick-lane, was returning home, up Sun-street, came across Finsbury-square, along Long-lane, and was taken ill in my bowels; I crossed the pig market, and got into the pens; I found something laying there, picked it carefully up, and saw it was a watch - I put it in my coat pocket, remained there a few minutes, and was buttoning my clothes up, when Forbes came and secured me; all the resistance I made was saying I had done nothing, I did not see why I should go to the watch-house; they took me to the watch-house, and being flurried and agitated, I said the watch was mine. I believe Forbes has stated right.</p>

             re-examined. The watch was in the same state it is now - it was a dry morning; he appeared perfectly sober. I went and examined the pens with a lantern, there was nothing to induce me to suppose he had been there for a necessary occasion; I saw him getting up apparently as if looking round. There was nobody else there.</p>

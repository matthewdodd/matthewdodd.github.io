About six o'clock in the morning of the 18th of May, 1831, I lost a black mare off the green - I had seen it safe the night before; I found it in Monk's possession on the 26th.</p>
               <p>CHARLES RICH. I bought that black horse about ten o'clock on the morning of the 18th of May, of Godwin.</p>
               <p>JAMES FARREN. I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 18th of May, about five o'clock, I saw the prisoner go up to Beck's black horse; he took hold of it, and drove it away - he was with Godwin; they drove it away together; but the prisoner being in the neighbourhood, and having seen him working in the garden a few days before, I thought Beck had sold it to Godwin, and had no suspicion.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STAPLES. On the 18th of May, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the two horses go by; one was black and the other roan - one man was behind them, and the other by the side; I cannot be positive whether the prisoner was one.</p>
               <p>ROBERT WHITE. I was going up Barrow-lane, and met the prisoner and another following Mr. Beck's horse down; they were about one hundred and fifty yards from where I had seen Farren - I am certain of the prisoner, as I knew him before; he lived at Turnham-green - I had no suspicion of him, supposing the other had bought the horse of Beck.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.How far were you from me? A. Not five yards - I asked if you had seen my pony; you said it was down the lane, and I found it there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is not feasible I should steal a horse where the people knew me so well.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mariner of the <hi rend="italic">Adelaide</hi> transport, belong<lb></lb>ing to Joseph Soames—the prisoner was at work on that ship. On the 30th of March he came into the cabin, where I was making out accounts—I saw him go out with a large bundle of canvass—it appeared to me as though it contained something—I watched him, and saw him go into the cabin—he afterwards went on the other side of the deck—I went into</p>

No, Sir; I said that was him; I did not say he had a flannel jacket on - I said so on the second examination; I had spoken to the officer between the two examination; I said he had a mark on his face; the magistrate told me to look in his face, and I saw the mark down his right cheek; I did not say he looked like a monkey; it was the other boy said that; I forgot that the prisoner had a flannel jacket on, when I was first before the magistrate; I heard the other persons say he had a flannel jacket on, and I said so the second time.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any doubt about who the man was, who took the basket out of the cart? A. It was the prisoner; I know him by the bump on his back - I saw the bump when he was running - I saw his face too, and saw the cut on it; I am sure he had a bump on his back; I did not forget it when I was before the justice, but he did not ask me about it, if he had, I should have told him; I am sure he is the man.</p>

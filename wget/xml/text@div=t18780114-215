                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter, and live at Adelaide Place, Peckham—I went out on Boxing Day at 6 p. m., leaving my father and mother at home, both in drink—I returned at 9 or 10 o'clock—my mother was in bed with her forehead plastered up with sticking-plaster—she made no complaint—she was asleep—my father came in after—he made no remark—next day, Friday, my father and mother went out together, and on Saturday she became ill at 10 o'clock—she woke my father and asked him to give her some water—she became worse, and died at 10 minutes to 10 that night.</p>

I am 16 or 17 years old—my father and mother usually lived on good terms, but when mother was drunk she quarrelled with father—she often got too much drink—I never saw him strike her unless she struck him first—she often took up the poker and hit him, but he only returned it with his hand, he never struck her with anything else, and that lightly—she had been ailing before this, and went to Mr. Howell a month before Christmas—she had been suffering from erysipelas in her head, but she had not taken medicine—she said she did not want medicine for that, besides it was never much—she did not con<lb></lb>sult a doctor about that, she consulted him for her nerves—she only suf<lb></lb>fered from erysipelas the week before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a student at the Providence Dispensary—on 29th December, at 4 p.m., I was fetched to Adelaide Place, and saw the deceased in bed—she was suffering from erysipelas in the face, and had a contused wound on the scalp, of two or three days' standing—it had been strapped up—I prescribed a lotion for her and called next day and found she was dead—I was present at the post-mortem examination—the cause of death was extravasation of blood on the brain; caused by a blow or a fall</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Eye Lane, Peckham—I made a post-mortem examination of the deceased on January 2, and found a contused wound, about half an inch long, which went through the scalp; it may have been a quarter of an inch deep—in my opinion the cause of death was extravasation of blood and rupture of a blood<lb></lb>vessel on the <hi rend="italic">meninges</hi> of the brain, from a blow or a fall—it could not have been done with a fist, but it might have been done by falling against a mantelpiece or a fender—I saw symptoms of erysipelas, and being a very unhealthy subject that was a secondary matter—there was nothing to induce me to think that erysipelas had existed before the blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I am coroner's officer for Camberwell—on Sunday, 30th December, the prisoner came to my house—I asked him what he came about, and he made a statement, which I took down in writing—he said "We were at home; we had been drinking all the week and had some words together, and I struck her and inflicted the wound on her forehead; she went out and got it dressed and came home again; late in the evening she laid herself down with her clothes on; she got up again on the morning of Friday, 28th December, about 1 or 2; we went out together again into a public-house, and about 6 or 7 we returned home and had some tea and went to bed together. About 10 o'clock she woke me up saying that she wanted some water to bathe her head with; I gave her some and she used it; I then got up and sat with her till half-past 5 in the morning. I then went to work and called my daughter up, Elizabeth Moore, and left her in her charge. At 9. 30 the same morning I told my daughter to fetch Mr. Vine, the doctor. She went, but he did not come till 4 o'clock, and when he came he prescribed for her, and she died at 10 minutes to 10 on Saturday night. She was a great drunkard and a quarrelsome woman."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I said nothing to induce him to make that statement—he seemed strange, but I suppose it was as much from intoxication as anything else—I had not known her at all.</p>

A fall or a blow while in a state of intoxication would not produce more serious results than in a healthy subject—when a person is intoxicated the vessels of the head are congested very much, and a blow at that time would be more likely to produce serious consequences than at any other time. <hi rend="smallCaps">

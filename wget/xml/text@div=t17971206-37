             sworn. - The last witness is my servant: Last Saturday week, the last witness said there was somebody robbing Mr. Field's warehouses; I went to the counting-house door, and saw a man with a bag upon his back, moving very quick; Thomas said, that is the man, I first saw him about twenty-five yards from Mr. Field's warehouses; as soon as I saw him, I cried, stop thief; the man immediately dropped the bag; I did not see his face, he had a blue wrapping great coat on; I cannot swear to the man; he ran along the middle of the street, and I after him, crying, stop thief; he turned up Fish-street-hill, I then lost fight of him; when he made the angle, I followed him as fast I could, and saw the same man in the middle of the street on Fish-street-hill, running as fast as he could; I then repeated the cry of stop thief; when he had nearly got opposite the Monument, he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man that was stopped the same man that you saw near your own house? - A. I cannot say that, he had very much the same external appearance; the patrol stopped him, his name is Cork, and we brought him back; we searched Mr. Field's warehouses all over, to see if there was any body else concealed; we saw another bag packed in the same way as this close to the door on the inside, ready to be taken away, and at the upper end of the warehouses, two other bags packed.</p>

             sworn. - About a fortnight before the robbery, I purchased two ton weight of wax of Messrs. Field; I had an opportunity of having the range of all Messrs. Field's warehouses, I verily believe this to be the property of Messrs. Field.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Owen.) In the course of a fortnight, had you any new wax come into your warehouse? - A. No, none since that was seen by Mr. Figgins.</p>

I was going upon the Quays to look for work, I was obligated to be in the barracks by nine o'clock, and as I came to the foot of London-bridge, I heard a cry of stop thief, I instantly stopped and saw a parcel of people running up Fish-street-hill; the patrol met me in the middle of the street, and said, I was his prisoner; I told him I was running after the thief; he took me into Thames-street, down an alley where I never was in my life before.</p>

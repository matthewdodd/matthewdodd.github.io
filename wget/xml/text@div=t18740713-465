                  </hi>. I am an usber at Worship Street Police Court—on Saturday night, 20th June, about 11.15, I was at the arrival platform at the Moorgate Street Station, leaving a train that had just arrived—the prisoner and two others got out of the same train, and passed out at the wicket gate before me, leaving some three persons between me and them—they immediately turned round to the left of the wicket gate, which was bolted halfway—the prosecutor was leaning with his arm on the gate, smoking his pipe—they all three surrounded him—I tried to get through to secure the three, but I was not able to do it—the prisoner took a watch from the prosecutor's left waistcoat pocket, and passed it to one of the other two men, who immediately tried to make his way behind the pro<lb></lb>secutor—the prosecutor turned sharp round, and seized him with his right hand, and as I rushed up <hi rend="italic">to size</hi> him on the left, he threw the watch between my legs on to the platform, among the people's feet—I called out for someone to pick it up, which they did, and gave it to one of the railway officials—I still kept hold of the man, and assisted the prosecutor and a constable with him to the station—at the station I gave a description of the prisoner—on 8th July I was sent for to the station, and saw the prisoner in the yard there, amongst eleven others, and I picked him out—he had the same coat on, and the same coat over his arm, but instead of a hat he had on a French peaked cap—I have not the slightest doubt of him; I would have picked him out of a thousand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I did not hear any argument going on before I saw the watch taken—you went straight up to the prosecutor, snatched his watch, and passed it to the other man—his name was Cook, and he has been convicted and sentenced to six months—there were three of you together—the third man was stopped on the third stair, and brought back by the policeman, but he was let go, as I did not see him take the watch—you were let go as well.</p>

                  </hi>, I am a sub-warder at the House of Correction, Cler<lb></lb>kenwell—on this Saturday night I was on the platform at the Moorgate Street Railway Station—I was surrounded by three or four men, and robbed of my watch from my left-hand waistcoat pocket—the bow of the watch was twisted off, and the chain fell down—I seized the man who was standing on my left side, and he had the watch in his possession—he threw it down on the platform—it was picked up and given to the policeman, and I have had it back—I held the man, and gave him into custody—I cannot speak to the prisoner—I kept my eye on the man that had the watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was standing close to the barrier that led on to the arrival platform—there was an argument taking place there concerning a man who had not paid his fare—I. stood listening to it—there was a second man taken, he was let go at the top of the stairs leading into the street.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner in his defence commented on the evidence, which he urged showed that it was more probable that the man Cook took the watch, and en<lb></lb>titled him to the benefit of the doubt.</hi>

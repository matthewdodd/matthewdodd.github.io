On Tuesday morning, 23rd July, at a quarter past six o'clock, I went to Werneck's house, and made an examina<lb></lb>tion of the premises—No. 9 is on the second landing—the stair-case com<lb></lb>mences from the passage at the street-door—if you wanted to go to Kirby's rooms, on entering the house you must proceed through the passage, but instead of turning up the stairs that go to Nos. 6 and 9, you must bear to the left through the long room, which used to be a police-court, and through Homann's room, which is the back parlour, up some small stairs in that room, and Kirby's room opens upon the top of those stairs—to go from the lower part of the house to Kirby's room you must pass through Homann's room— that is the way I went that morning—I got out of the window of that room, and by walking round the parapet I got to the window of No. 6, which is at the back part of the house—there were about five or six iron bars to the window, and I found two had been taken away, and one partially removed from the wood-work—just under the window there was a looking-glass, and other bed-chamber articles, just outside, as if they had been placed there in a hurry—the aperture was large enough for any one to get in at—I returned back through the servant's room, and went to the room on the inside—I examined the trunk where the gold had been—the clasp had been wrenched open, and these pincers, which are instruments just adapted for that, were lying on the table, about two feet off—a key was given me by Suetta, which did not fit No. 6, but it turned the first bolt of the lock of No. 9, so that it could readily be forced open by applying a knife, or anything as thin—I had to go up-stairs to No. 9; it is immediately over No. 6—a box was pointed out to me in No. 9, and this hasp (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) had been broken off it.</p>

On Tuesday morning, 23rd July, about nine o'clock, when my husband was out, Tonnes came and asked if my two lodgers were up—(they were Host and Steffan)—I said, "No," and he went up to their room—he came down in a quarter of an hour, and told me, in case they wanted anything, I was to furnish it for them, and he was to pay for it—he came again about four o'clock, and asked me if the young men were still up-stairs—I said, "Yes," and he went up again—on his return, he asked me if they had had any dinner, and I said, "Yes."</p>

                  </hi>. I am the daughter of Mrs. Lines. I let Steffan in when he came with Kessler, he remained eight days—Kessler used to come; I have seen him there twice in one day—I do not know whether he came every day, he came frequently; sometimes he rang the bell, and sometimes opened the door—the door was kept shut—I did not see a key in his hand—it is usual in our house for each lodger to have a key—I do not know of any other way of Kessler having a key except from Steffan—the only time Steffan went out was the next evening to the one he came, at a little after nine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 7). I apprehended Steffan—I asked him if he could speak English—he said "A little"—I told him the charge against him was stealing gold-dust at the other end of the town—he said he did not have the gold-dust; it was Homann had it—I took him to the station, went to Kessler's and found him there—I asked him if he knew any<lb></lb>thing about Steffan; he said no, he did not—I asked him if he knew anything about the gold-dust robbery that had taken place at the east-end of the town—he said no—I said, "You must know something about Steffan; you recommended him to a lodging, and I am a sergeant of police, and have now got him in custody for the robbery"—he said he recollected recommending a person to a lodging, as he did at other times when he was full—I took no further trouble about it—I thought it very feasable, as they do that at that end at the town—I called the following morning and requested him to attend at the police-court, as I thought he would be wanted.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with a warrant and took up Hales, and brought her to East-street, Marylebone. The prosecutrix and her sister searched her and produced a piece of lace. I then went to the prisoner's house, and told her I had come to search, as some property had been found on Hales, who said she had it from her; she said she should turn the tables on her - I said I must search; she then opened a drawer, and gave me a petticoat, which she said had come from the wash; she produced a cap, a collar, and some ribbon, which she said was given to her by her servant Nancy - I went into the kitchen, and searched the girl's boxes in the prisoner's presence, and found the rest of the lace, the scissars, shuttle, and sheath; I asked how it got there - Ellen Brown said, "I must tell the truth; she wants me to say that I gave it to her, but I did not" - the prisoner then wanted to make it up, but I took her to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did she not say she took them for her rent? A. No; she said the girls took her clothes, and when she found any of theirs, she took them - it is a house of ill-fame.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's sister, and lodged at this house. I saw some of the things found, some in the prisoner's room, and some in the kitchen - the prisoner said, "For God's sake, burn them, and I will give you 5l.;" she then said, "Say you gave them to me;" I said, "I will do no such thing."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your name? A. Brown: I have gone by the name of Lee; I was never married - my sister's name is Brown; I never knew her go by the name of Parker. The prisoner once lent me a tablecloth; I took it with me by mistake; when we moved, I gave it to Mrs. Judd, for her girl to take it back on the day of the search. When my sister left the house, she did not ask the prisoner for the things.</p>
               <p>BRITANNIA BROWN re-examined. I told the prisoner of my loss; she said she knew nothing about it - I did not suspect her, but Hales.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you ordered any goods from Ludgate-hill while you lodged there? A. No, nor had my sister: some goods came which Curry would not take in, because she had no money to pay - I did not order them: if my sister did, I was not present - I was ill at the time. I was never here before: I was a witness at Guildhall about having our clothes cut at the fair; I gave the name of Brown there; I never went by the name of Lee.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner mean by turning the tables on you? A. She said I had pawned the table-cloth - my sister took our present lodging by the name of Lee; I have only been eleven weeks in town; I came from Lincolnshire.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They went away in my debt, and what I found in the house I took as security.</p>
               <p>- JUDD. These young women now lodge with me; one goes by the name of Bearpark, and the other Parker: Ellen gave me a table-cloth to send back to Curry.</p>

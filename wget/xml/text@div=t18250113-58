            . On the 3d of December I was sitting in this house, and heard a noise, and saw this man's foot come through the ceiling - I knew him before. I then went out, and saw him get off the trap-door; I asked what he was doing there; he said, playing at hoop - and he said he would mend the ceiling which he had broken: he came afterwards, and brought some laths to mend the ceiling, but could not; and he then said he would send some person to mend it.</p>

            ; he gave me one guinea and two shillings on Tuesday, the 13th of July; I expended one shilling in supper; and Mrs. M'Clane came down, and the prisoner followed her into my parlour and bed room: I had a guinea and a shilling in my pocket: the prisoner lodged in my house: the prisoner sent for half a pint of gin, but he had no money to pay for it; the prisoner boarded with Mrs. M'Clane, and he asked her to lend him a shilling, and she had none, and they both went up stairs again: I sat on a chair, and undid my clothes, and left my pockets on; I did not pull them off; and I leaned my hand on the table, and went into a doze two or three minutes; my bed is in the same room; I awaked, and the light was put out, and I felt Swinney without his shoes; I said to my little boy somebody is in the parlour; and he said, it was only Swinney; and I saw him very plain by the fan light over the door; Swinney was near me; I touched him with my hand; I had not forgot myself three minutes when I felt him down stairs; my money was in my left hand side, and I felt him draw my pockets entirely off, and took them a yard and an half from me; but not out of the room; then I cried out, I was robbed: I went up stairs, and found Swinney laying on the bed, with his breeches and stockings on; the door was on a jar; I said he had robbed me; and I went and got the watchman, and the prisoner was secured; and in his waistcoat I saw the guinea and shilling found by the beadle; there was no other money; I can safely say the shilling is mine; there is a little kind of a small dent in it; the guinea is of the present king, but an old coin: the beadle has the guinea and shilling.</p>

               <p>As far as I have to say I shall speak the truth, if God gives me leave.

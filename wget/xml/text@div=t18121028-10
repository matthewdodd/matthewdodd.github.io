               <p>Q. When did you lose this cheese - A. Last Saturday evening, about six o'clock, the prisoner came into our shop with intent as we supposed to buy a piece of cheese, and after picking and disfiguring as many pieces of cheese as he thought proper, he took the opportunity of putting this piece of cheese under the left side of his coat. I had nearly twenty customers in the shop at the time. I left the customers at the counter, and ran after him; he had gone about an hundred yards from Mr. Wood's house. I took him by the arm, and brought him back again; I then took the cheese from him, and sent for an officer; we should not have prosecuted him, but we have been obliged to turn him out of the shop so many times. This is the cheese, I can swear to the cheese by the marks that I made.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was hungry. I had had nothing to eat from the Friday night to the Saturday.</p>

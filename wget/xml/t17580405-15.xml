            . The prisoner lodged with me, in Turnmill-street, Clerkenwell, he came in a Friday about a quarter after eight at night, with a steel in his hand, all over muddy, and said he had found it in Smithfield; there was no swivel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175804050008"></xptr> on it; he offered it me for six-pence, he left it for three half-pence for his lodging, as I would not buy it. The Monday following I was told the prisoner was gone to Newgate for stealing a steel. I found out the prosecutor, and carried it to him; his wife asked me if I knew of any more. The Friday following, we have a little hog, he had ruttled some old rags out of a hole, and amongst it another steel; the hog had done his occasion on it; I took and wiped it, and carried it to the prosecutor.</p>

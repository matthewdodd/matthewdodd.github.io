            . I am a butcher in Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Westbrooke. - A. No further than seeing him with the sheep upon his back upon the 28th of January, he was running up Rose-street, with the carcase of mutton upon his shoulder, about twenty minutes past nine, I followed him through the market and Ivy-lane, he crossed Newgate-street, he went down Butcher-hall-lane, I stopped him at the corner of St. Ann's-Lane, I asked him what he was going to do with it, he said, a lad had given it him to carry, and he was going to follow him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any lad. - A. No, he said, take the carcase do not take me; I told him he should take it back from where he took it: I met an officer in Butcher-hall-lane, I then gave charge of him; it was claimed by a young man in the employ of Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from Mr. Smith's shop when you first saw him with this carcase. - A. Mr. Smith's shop is in Cloth-fair, but he had taken it out of a truck in <placeName id="t18120219-11-crimeloc66">Newgate-street</placeName>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. This was twenty minutes past nine. - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. So this man was publicly travelling with this sheep all through Newgate market. - A. Yes, he was, to Ivy-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. But he went through a great part of the market. - A. He turned round by Mr. Fisher's.</p>
               <p>Q. The sheep we know, eight stone is a considerable weight for a man. - A. We think it nothing in our business.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Smith's house. - A. In cloth fair, but his cart was in Newgate-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked him how he came by the sheep, he said a lad had given it him to carry: was he employed as a porter to carry sheep. - A No, I have seen him lurking about the carts and waggons when I watched him before.</p>

            , my master purchased four carcases, they were in Newgate market, I was left with my fellow servant to get them in the truck, we got two of them in, and went to fetch the other two and missed one.</p>
               <p>Q. Now how long do you think you were gone. - A. I might be gone five minutes, and I sent my fellow servant in search of my master, to know if he had taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you saw the prisoner in custody. - A. It might be ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour, I knew nothing of him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave him no authority to take it, did you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the carcase you saw, the same carcase as was in your master's truck. - A. Exactly, I have every reason to think so.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of it. - A. Two pound.</p>

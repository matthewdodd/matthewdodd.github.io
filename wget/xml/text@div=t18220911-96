On Sunday the 28th of July, about twelve o'clock, I left my house with nobody in it. I double locked the door - there is a bar which falls down beside the lock. I returned at half-past eight o'clock the same evening; it was daylight then. I found the door on the single lock, and the bar lying down on the floor - all the glass cases were open, and all the watches gone, and the cases emptied of all their contents, except trifling things. None of the gilt or steel things were taken; but all the gold. I missed about two hundred watches. I cannot say how many of the seals were taken, as my wife managed the jewellery - there were more than ten seals, and a great number of gold pins, and several silver things; also a great many gold earrings, silver thimbles, spoons, and pencil cases. All the articles taken were either gold or silver, and coral ear rings and necklaces. I missed six soverigns, a 10 l. note, and 3 l. in silver; the sovereigns were left in my till - I had marked them on Saturday night, so as to know them again, and am sure they were in my possession on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Was your wife out with you - A. Yes; I have found some pins, but none of the watches or seals - Reading was taken somewhere by Marlborough-street, on Monday afternoon, and on Tuesday, I went to the House of Correction with an order from the Magistrate to search him. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have a 10 l. note of mine, turn out all the papers you have;" he had a paper in his hand, but would not give it up, but was obliged - he had a watch in his fob, I did not claim that - it was shewn to me before the Magistrate - his name was on the dial - I said, it was possible that name might be put on since the Sunday, and tried to see if it was burnt in, as many of those I lost belonged to other people, and I did not know them - I found it was burnt in; I advertised my loss, but did not state the sovereigns in the advertisement, as the officer said I was to be quiet about the note, and stop it at the bank - I did not think it necessary to advertise the sovereigns - I generally mark all my sovereigns, but the two in question I could pick out from ten thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sent many sovereigns into the world with the same mark - A. Not with the same mark, they were marked in a particular way - I took them in the dusk of the evening, and had not an opportunity of looking at them by daylight till Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was searched at the House of Correction, were not the six sovereigns taken from him produced - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110054"></xptr>Only five were produced - they were not returned to him to my knowledge - they were produced before the Magistrate on the Thursday. My wife had gone to Deptford on Saturday night, and I went to her on Sunday, and left the house securely fastened. I have no servant, as the house is too small to keep one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do not you keep any servant - A. Yes; in the day time, my wife managed the jewellery business entirely. I marked the sovereigns as I have marked others, nearly ever since sovereigns have been in circulation; but lately I have marked them different, as I have been told there must be no gold taken off; I mark them on the edge with a pen-knife, and bruise it down again so that none is taken off.</p>
               <p>MR. PLATT. Q. Was Reading asked to give up the paper in the gaol - A. Yes; he refused, and Mr. Isaacs, his solicitor, told him not to give it up. Hassel has it; five sovereigns were taken from him at the House of Correction, six had been found on him, but he had changed one before he got there. Prince's-street is a great thoroughfare.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What do you mark your sovereigns for - A. To try if they are gold.</p>

            . At the time of this robbery I lived at No. 2, Richmond-street, nearly opposite the prosecutor's house. I have known Reading from a lad, he was a play-fellow of mine - I knew him well, and cannot be mistaken in him. On Sunday the 28th of July I saw him at the corner of Upper Rupert-street, in company with four or five other men, at a few minutes after one o'clock; they were not more than fifty yards from Westwood's house - I was going home at the time, and went home, and from my window saw him in company with one of the four men - I saw them loitering about there from one o'clock till half-past four o'clock, first on one side, and then on the other, they were not all four together all the time - the last time I saw Reading he was by himself, leaning on a post. When I saw him with one of them, the other two were on the opposite side. Reading had on a brown coat and blue trowsers. I am sure of his person.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Ann's, Soho, in the liberty of Westminster. About twelve o'clock on Monday the 29th of July, I took Reading in custody - he had a watch, and a seal apparently gold attached to it; I am positive that he had a seal. I took him to St. Ann's watch-house, and sent for Westwood and the constable, who examined him in my presence, and found on him six sovereigns and 2 s. and a silver watch - the seal was gone then. I said nothing to him about it. I am positive he had a seal, for he played with it all the way he went - it was on his ring when he entered the watch-house; and while I was speaking to one of the Watch Committee, he must have made away with it - I could not find it. We returned the sovereigns back to him; the prosecutor was not there then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The Magistrate was sitting when you took him; why not take him to the office - A. I waited for Westwood, to know whether he was the man. The watch-house is in Dean-street, a good way from Marlborough-street. Westwood came to the office in the evening, but was not at the watch-house. Bidgood was with me when I took him. We searched the watch-house, but found no seal. I did not hear the prosecutor claim the watch found on him. He said the dialplate might be altered in a few hours. The sovereigns were returned to him at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the sovereigns produced to Westwood in your presence - A. Yes, at Marlborough-street he pointed out a mark on them; they were not returned to the prisoner after that.</p>

            . I am an officer. I first saw the prisoner at St. Ann's watch-house, on Monday morning about twelve o'clock. I found he had no seal on his watch, only a key; I cannot say whether the ribbon went through the key, or whether there was a ring. I asked him where the seal was gone; he said he never had any on. I searched him minutely, but found none. I found six sovereigns and 2 s. on him; I returned the sovereigns to him, and he changed one in the watch-house.</p>

            . I am clerk at the House of Correction; the prosecutor brought down an order for Reading to be searched - and he was searched in my presence; five sovereigns and a watch were found on him. Westwood said the sovereigns were his - he said they had a private mark on them; he did not explain it; he was rather agitated. I was before the Magistrate on the Thursday following, and had kept the sovereigns all the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not the Magistrate ask what the mark was - and did he not ask to see them before he showed it - A. Yes; he claimed the whole five at the House of Correction, but was much agitated at the time, as he thought to find a 10 l. note as well. Before the prisoner was searched, he said he expected to find a 10 l. note, and some sovereigns; I do not recollect that he said how many. He pointed out two of the sovereigns at Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did he say at the prison that there was a mark on them - A. He said he marked all his sovereigns - but what his wife took, she did not mark; he had them in his hand when he pointed out the mark to the Magistrate. I produce them; I marked them all myself on the King's neck.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Have you any paper which you took from Reading - A. Yes; he put his hand in his pocket and took it out. I asked for it - he would not give it me for some time. I said,</p>

            , (looking at two of the sovereigns.) Under the dragon in the milling is a small notch, more like a bruise. I can swear these are the sovereigns I marked on Saturday night, and saw safe on Sunday morning. I had marked other sovereigns, but know I had these on Saturday night after dark - and not being able to look at them well then, I looked at them on Sunday morning; they are marked in a particular place. I did not mark the others in any particular place.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you, as a conscientious man, undertake to swear they are the sovereigns you had on Saturday night - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You marked them before you lost them - A. Yes, I did not put another mark on them at the office - but Hassell did. I dare say I have passed hundreds, but not marked in this way, because it is only lately that I bruised them down again; if you mix them with a thousand I will pick them out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. For the last six months you have marked sovereigns in this way - A. Yes; I do not always mark them on a particular side; these are marked under the dragon, and under the head. I will not say I have not marked others in the same place.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. Your general habit of marking is by raising the gold with a penknife, and putting it down again - A. Yes; I looked at them on Sunday morning, and recollect the very place I marked them, and find the marks there; my reason for cutting them was to ascertain whether they were good gold - not in order to know them again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you cut the others - A. I think my wife took the others; she weighs them instead of cutting them.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Now, my Lord, we will produce our evidence against the receiver.</p>

            . In August last I saw seven pins in the shop window of Mr. Green, of Oxford-street, jeweller, and knew them to be my manufacture - and what I sold to Mrs. Westwood, at two or three different times, some nine or ten months ago - and others three or five months ago - and two black ones among them. I had sold her fourteen months ago; I informed her of it, and have since seen four of them; they were on four separate cards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you keep any books - A. Yes; but in this case I took no account of the purchase, as I owed him money, and gave him a bill for 10 l., which is due on the 4th of October. I do not know what date it was drawn at; he brought the pins to me in my shop - there were eight or nine of them. I gave him 2 s. each. I have dealt with him some years; he deals in furniture and jewellery - and buys goods at sales; and lives in Duke's-place, Hounsditch, but has no shop. I am a jeweller and clothes salesman; my bill book is at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are they worth each - A. I sell some at 2 s. 6 d., 3 s. 3 d., and 3 s. 6 d.; the trade price is 2 s. each,</p>

            . I sold some pins to Mr. Green six or seven weeks ago. I had them from the prisoner Solomon about twenty-four hours before. I bought between two and three dozen of him. I cannot tell what I gave for them, it is so long past. I recollect giving him a sovereign and some silver. I cannot say how much silver, or whether it was 20 s. or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What did you do with them - A. I went to sell them immediately. Green says he bought some of me. I know I sold him pins, but cannot say they were the same I bought of Solomon. It is impossible to swear to pins.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you mix what you bought of him with others - A. Not with other pins; I had no others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sell Green the pins you had from Solomon - A. Yes. I sold the rest to different pawnbrokers; some to Parker of Holborn - nearly two dozen. I do not recollect what Green gave me, for he owed me something, and I took a bill of him. I have paid it away, I cannot exactly recollect who to. I have not got my book, and cannot tell the date or amount without it.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, did you happen to be taken up as a receiver of these stolen goods - A. Yes; and at the second examination I stated that Solomon was the man I bought them of. I could not recollect at the first time. The Justice did not tell me I must produce my books.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember seeing me there - A. Yes. The Justice asked if I had any books which contained an entry on this subject; I told him I did not keep an account of what I sold or bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not ask you for your books, and you said the only book you kept was in Hebrew - A. I do not recollect it. I said I kept a bill-book; some entries are in Hebrew, and some in English.</p>

               <p>"Well, and what of them?" He was then taken to the Mansion-house, public-house, which is opposite the Mansion-house. He walked about the room there, and appeared agitated. I said,</p>

He then sent a man to Winfield-street. I asked who he had sent for; he said, for a person who might recollect. His solicitor afterwards came and conversed with him; he then said he knew nothing of the pins.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix: On the 18th of December I was in the kitchen, about ten or eleven at night: a piece of fresh salmon lay upon a board: I saw the glimpse of somebody, and ran out into the shop, and saw the salmon was gone: I ran out into the street, with a candle in my hand, and saw the salmon in the prisoner's hand; he was in Water-lane, about twenty yards from our shop: I called, Stop thief; he dropt the salmon and ran away: I followed him, and saw Mr. Cheshire take him. The salmon weighed about fifteen pounds and a half; it was the head part, we had the tail in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the salmon was in the shop when you went into the kitchen?</p>
               <p>A. Manlove. I am sure it was; and I was not in the kitchen above three minutes.</p>

            . I keep the Seven-Stars, Water-lane, Tower-street: about half an hour after ten o'clock that night I heard the cry Stop thief, just opposite the Hamborough Coffee-house: I saw the prisoner opposite to me, and no other person did I see in the lane but him; I stopped him; the last witness was just at his heels; she said he had stole her mistress's salmon: he said he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was coming from work, and had no thoughts of the salmon; the young woman came out with a candle; I was on the other side the way; there were three young fellows, that had been drinking with me; they ran up Thames-street: I had a pair of mittens on my hands; when I was taken to the watch-house, they were pulled off, and the people smelt at my hands; they all said they did not smell of salmon.</p>
               <p>Q. to A. Manlove. Did you smell at the prisoner's hands?</p>
               <p>A. Manlove. I did; they did not smell of salmon; but I saw him drop the salmon, and I picked it up, and carried it back afterwards; he had it in his left hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner out of your sight 'till taken?</p>
               <p>A. Manlove. He was not; he was walking; and when he let the salmon fall, 'then he ran.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any turning?</p>
               <p>A. Manlove. There was not, 'till he got to the top of the lane.</p>

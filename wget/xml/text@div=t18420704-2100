                  </hi>. I am a seaman. I met the prisoner Fejari last Monday week, the day I was paid off, by St. Katharine's Dock, by the Brown Bear—she came up to me, took me in <hi rend="italic">tow,</hi> and ordered me to go into a friend's of hers, Mrs. Burke, to have something to drink—I went, and she asked if I was going to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> any thing—Mrs. Burke said she could not drink any spirits—Fejari then took me home to her own lodging, and told Mrs. Burke to come there—it was in East Smithfield—when. I got there I saw the other two prisoners—one is the servant—I knew Fe<lb></lb>jari before, and she knew me, having been in the neighbourhood some yon—she lived about a hundred yards from me—she asked what I was going to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi>—I said, any thing they thought proper—we had a drop of gin and some beer—I gave Fejari a half-sovereign to get it—she went out, brought me back the change, and gave it into my hands—she then said I must have a better pair of shoes than I had, they were too shabby for me, the would <hi rend="italic">go</hi> and change them—I gave her the remainder of the change of the half-sovereign—she went out, came back again in about two hours, and took the shoes down stairs with her—she had brought me in a pair of shoes the first time when she brought the liquor, "but they were too small—she said she could change them for a larger pair—she said she had not silver enough—I took my handkerchief out of my pocket, took a sovereign out of the corner of it, folded the handkerchief again, and put it into my pocket—I said, "If you spend 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I will make it good to you"—I had put the sovereign no the bed, and when I went to take it up I found it had <hi rend="italic">fled</hi>—I had not turned my back at all—how it went I cannot say—I am quite certain I put it on the bed, and did not take it up again—the three prisoners were close against the bedside—I directly kicked up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> about it—they got up in arms against me, and said it was impossible, that it must be in my pocket—I said, if so, that was all I should want—they said, "Let me search"—"Yes," said I, and Dale searched my pocket well—I had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note when I went into the house—I had broken two or three stitches in my waistcoat, and forced it down to the corner—it could not have come out—Gray put her hand into all my pockets—she could not find the sovereign—after watching me Fejari and Gray started out—Dale remained—they said they were going out to change my shoes—I was not exactly sober at the time—Dale went out in ten or twenty minutes to look for Mrs. Fejari—she re<lb></lb>turned again, and I asked her if she had seen Mrs. Fejari—she said she had not, she wished to God Almighty she had—I had missed my note at that time, and charged her with stealing it—she was up in arms worse than before, and wished to God Almighty Mrs. Fejari was in to let her know</p>

               <p>of it—the first policeman I came across I gave information to—he took charge of the house, and the prisoners were all taken into custody there afterwards—I am quite certain I had the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note when I went into the house, and that I put the sovereign down on the bed—while I put the handkerchief into my pocket it fled—while Dale searched me the other two were present—I did not notice what they were doing at the time—they were both standing up—I had had the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note safe about a quarter of an hour before—Dale came back first before I spoke to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable, H</hi> 141.) I went to Fejari's house in Glasshouse-street, East Smithfield, at half-past eight o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, and found all the three prisoners there—the prosecutor was sitting down with them—he gave Fejari and Gray into custody for robbing him of a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and a sovereign—Fejari said she had only been out of the house ten minutes—Gray said to Fejari, "See what trouble I have got into through coming to see you"—Dale followed us to the station and was then given into custody—the prosecutor had been drinking, but knew perfectly well what he was saying—he charged Dale at the door of the station—he said he had put the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in his pocket, that Dale searched his pockets, and a few minutes after he missed the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note out of his pocket—he showed me his waistcoat pocket and I observed part of it torn.</p>

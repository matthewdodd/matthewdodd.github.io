                  </hi>. I live at Lee, in Kent—I am a farmer's man—on Sunday, 17th October, between 1 and 2 in the morning, I was in Albert-street, Deptford—while I was walking along I overtook two men; the prisoner is one of them—the one that is not in custody asked me the time: I pulled out my watch to tell them, and he snatched it from me and passed it from his hand to the prisoner's—I saw the watch in the prisoner's hand—I said to the prisoner, "You have got the watch;" he said, "No, I have not; you can feel if you like"—he let me feel the outside of his trousers' pocket; I felt the watch—I said, "You have got the watch"—he then passed it back to the one that is not in custody—he stepped up to me and caught me by the throat, and the other ran away—the prisoner said, "I will give you a punch on the head if you do not let my brother go"—he put his fingers in between my shirt collar and my neck—I cried, "Policeman"—after that the policeman came up—I was sober—I knew nothing of the prisoner before.</p>

On Sunday, 17th October, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Dock-street, Deptford—I did not go into Albert-street—the prisoner was followed into Dock-street—I heard the cry of "Police," and went up and saw the prose<lb></lb>cutor holding the prisoner, and he said he should give him in charge as he had lost his watch—the other one had taken his watch—the prisoner caught hold of him by the collar and said he would punch him if he said a word—I asked the prisoner what he had to say—he said, "I have not got the watch, it is my mate"—that was all he said—he was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an East India and Colonial Broker, and carry on business at 11, Great Tower Street—in November last I was em<lb></lb>ployed for the sale of twenty-four bags of cochineal—I produce two delivery orders, one is for seven bags from Mr. Beazley, Spicer Street, to deliver to Messrs. Cavage &amp; Co.; the other is written by one of our clerks, to deliver to Hartley's van, seven bags of cochineal, signed by myself, and countersigned by Storey, as having received it—I know a good deal about cochineal—I have a sample I have got from Pressey's, and also from Beazley—I received a sample from the constable Forster, and I say it is a mixture of Pressey's and Beazley's—there were 17 bags, with the mark "P. B." and seven marked "T. B."—when the sample was first shown to me I saw it was a mixture, and I took seven parts of one, and seventeen of the other, mixed it together, and found it exactly the same as the sample I received from Forster.</p>

               <p>ELIZABETH POINT. I live with my father, who deals in glass and earthenware, at No. 5, Gray's Inn-passage. The prisoner came to his shop on Wednesday, the 21st of October, and bought two cups, which came to 3d. - she gave me a shilling, and I gave her 9d. change; I threw the shilling into the till, and afterwards discovered there was a bad shilling there; on the 26th of October the prisoner came again, about three o'clock in the afternoon - she bought two plates, which came to 6d., and gave me a shilling, which I thought was a bad one; I did not serve her, but sent for a Police-constable, who took her - I kept the shilling separate till I gave it to the constable; I also gave him the other bad shilling, but I am not certain I had that from her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many shillings were there in the till on the first occasion? A. I cannot say - perhaps about 1l. worth of silver.</p>

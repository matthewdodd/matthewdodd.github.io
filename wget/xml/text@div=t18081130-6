            . I am an officer belonging to Worship street office. On the 18th of this month, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the Commercial Road; I saw the prisoner with a knot on his head, with a cask and a sack upon the knot; he was leaning back; resting it on the rail that parts the road from the field; I asked him what he had got there carrying; he said painter's oil, you may see by my coat that I am a painter; he said he brought it from an oil shop farther down the road, and he was going to carry it to his master, a painter, in the Borough; I asked him if he had brought an order from his master for it, or whether he had a bill of parcels; he said, neither; I told him he must go with me to the next public house, which was the half way house, that I might see what it was; we took him in there, took it off his head and set it on the floor; it began to work;

             was with me, and two more. I told him it was beer, not oil; he said then it was ale, he got it from a brewhouse farther down; he had it from a man in the brewhouse yard, that wore a dark coat and a white apron, but he did not know his name; I asked him if he had paid for it; he said no; he was to pay a pound note for it; and he had some once or twice before; he paid for it all at once when it suited him; sometimes in a week or a fortnight afterward. We saw Mr. Whiffing's name on the cask, and on the sack; we sent down to the brewhouse. Since then I have been sent down to take charge of Mr. Whiffing's man; the prisoner's brother worked for Mr. Whiffing; he acknowledged to me that he had taken it for his child's christening; on the Saturday following he was going to have his child christened at St. George's church. Mr. Whiffing promised to forgive the man if he would tell the magistrate; the magistrate thought it not right, and sent him here. The prisoner said afterwards he found it outside of the brewhouse wall.</p>

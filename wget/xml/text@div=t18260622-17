            . I live in Lombard-court, Seven-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182606220014"></xptr>dials. The prisoner and I lived in the same room - we are unfortunate girl; we had a dispute on Whit Sunday, about my mother asking me to dinner and not her - she struck me twice, but we made it up, and slept together. - On Monday, the 15th, we fetched my brothers, (we were good friends) and while we were at dinner she said some angry words about my brothers - I said, "Betsey, hold your tongue - don't quarrel;" she said if I did not hold my tongue she would scoop my eyes out with a fork - after dinner she was clearing the table - I was putting my bonnet on by the glass; she struck me in the face with her open hand, and then immediately struck me in the face with a knife - it was done in a moment; a great deal of blood came from me. Hailstone (who was in the room) took her away - I was taken to the Hospital; I had not lifted my hand to her; she had five knives and forks in her hand at the time - she had taken them off the table; she drew this from the rest and struck me; I had a cut in my cheek, and another in my forehead.</p>

            . I was in the room. A young woman was dining with us; Nash called her Mrs. Chipps - words arose, and after dinner Chipps took down the glass, to put her bonnet on - she had a plate to keep the glass up; Nash wanted the plate - Chipps would not let her have it; Nash said if she did not hold her tongue she would scoop her eye out with the fork; one snatched the plate from the other, then Nash struck her in the face, and soon after Nash took up the plates in one hand and the knives in the other - she struck her once or twice on the head, and I took Nash out of the room; she never lifted her hand against her - they were both in a passion, no doubt.</p>

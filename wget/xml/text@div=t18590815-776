                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Since you became connected with the parish, is the constitution of it entirely changed by Act of Parliament? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; during the time I have been there, I have known the defendant to act as collector—I know the mode which is pursued by the collectors—it was for myself to hand to him official receipts in print—they were bound in books—and the notice or application papers with them, applying for the rates; and, having these materials, it was his duty to go and collect the money—the receipts are all written and filled in, in my writing for him, before they are given to him—this is one of the application papers—this is filled up by the collector himself—on collecting the money, it was his duty to give one of the official receipts, signed for the amount he received, and pay the money into the Union Bank of London, every Saturday; the whole amount received up to Friday night—an account of what he receives is rendered to me every Saturday morning—he is to give me the weekly return of all money received—he does not give any paper from the bank—here is a book furnished him by the parish—the amounts on these papers ought to tally with the weekly returns—giving a receipt on the application paper is not in the regular course of business; it is a very great departure from it—the collectors are directed, when they receive money to give an official receipt; and on the receipt itself the vestry request that only a printed receipt stamped with their common seal be taken—at the end of about three months it is customary for the collectors to make out their balance sheet; the quarterly account—I have the quarterly balance sheet for the Christmas quarter; it is in the defendant's writing—I have the three receipts of Baber and Harvey and Tamer—I have an account of the defaulters, which was rendered to me on 16th May, this year—I produce the book of receipts which was handed to the prisoner by me as to the Christmas collection—these are the identical receipts which were handed to the prisoner in the book for the purpose of being given to the rate payers, on payment of the money—the defendant brought them back to me on 16th May with this account of the payments and defaulters—it is the practice that he hands me a book of the names of persons who have not paid, and returns the receipts—those three persons are returned by the prisoner in his writing as defaulters—No. 203 is Susannah: Baber's; that refers to the number in the rate-book, and that shows that that person is a defaulter—the document of the money he pays into the bank is kept by the bankers—it was discovered that these sums were not paid in by the collecting being put into the hands of a subsequent collector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do the collectors receive receipt-books to collect all their rates by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—these are given quarterly, and having collected or made efforts to collect them at the quarter, they make up their quarterly account—in the first instance the defendant is debited with all the receipts, and he must give an account that the houses are empty, and that the person has left without paying; or that the person is excused; and in this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185908150080"></xptr>
               <p>other column that they have not paid—he had to go through the accounts—there are, probably, two or three thousand receipts in all, at the beginning of the quarter, and he has to make a recapitulation, and abstract of all the receipts in books; Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on—he copies the receipts on separate documents—when he has a receipt in the book, that will be an un<lb></lb>cancelled receipt—when he has not the receipt he has the counterpart, but that does not show what has become of it—it shows that that person has paid the money—when he goes through the book he has to go through the receipts—I think he has not to go through the counterparts because he has paid those receipts in—the collector should make a copy of this book in figures; but supposing he does not do it, it would be necessary for him to refer to the counterparts—he must go through all the receipts and counterparts in making up his quarterly returns—I think it would take him from Friday night to Monday morning to do it—after the account is closed it would be improper for him to give any formal receipts out of the book—I believe there are no positive directions; it would be improper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Suppose a rate-payer comes to him with the money, when the account is closed; is he to refuse the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I never knew a rate-collector refuse the money—he cannot give an official receipt, because he hands them to me—I do not think I was present in May, when the defendant was asked about the Judge's order—the vestry clerk would know: he is here—I know that besides this account there is a separate list of de<lb></lb>faulters—he has not made such a list here—that is a list of defaulters for the Magistrate—I do not know whether these would be returned as defaulters till the prisoner returned these names in his lists as defaulters—this is returned, and in about three weeks afterwards the list is made out for the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the list of defaulters be made up about three weeks after this list is sent in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, about three weeks or a month—before he made out that list, he was suspended on 23d May—so long as he had not made out the list for the Magistrate, the persons would not be summoned—the time he closed his account would be Friday night—he would not return the book of receipts on Friday, he would keep them, and only return the account—he would not dispossess himself of the receipts—all the time from Christmas till 16th May he had the receipts in his possession to give to the rate payers—he has never accounted for these three amounts.</p>

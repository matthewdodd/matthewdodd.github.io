                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Samuel Benthall, who keeps a stall in the Thames-tunnel. On the afternoon of the 22nd of Aug., Williams came to the stall, and asked me if I had a view of the Thames-tunnel (that is, a small model of it in a magnifying-glass)—I showed her one—the price was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—She purchased it, and asked if I had change for a sovereign—I said I had not, but I would get it her—I left the stall and went to the Tunnel-toll, which was not very far—the stall is close at the end—I only had to go up the steps—she asked me to get her half-a-sovereign—I changed the sovereign, and got a half-sovereign and silver—I took her the change down, and laid it on the stall, and she gave me the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from it—there were three or four ladies on the other side of the stall, who asked the price of some things—I turned to them for two or three minutes, and when I turned back, Williams said she did not think the half-sovereign was a good one—I showed it to Mr. Benthall—he said it was not good, and told me to take it to the person I had it from—I took it to Mr. Charles Lack—I then went back to Williams, and asked her to give me the other silver, and she did so—I then took the silver to Mr. Lack, and he gave me the sovereign again—I went to another place, and got change for it—Mr. Lack told me it was not the half-sovereign he gave me, but he would give me the sovereign again to get the half-sovereign he gave me—when I had got the change, I went to Williams, gave her the full change, and said I was sorry to keep her so long—she gave me the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and went away—in the change I gave her the second time, there was a half-sovereign—the constable, Ceely, took the half-sovereign that Williams gave me back—Mr. Lack did not take it of me, but he gave me the sovereign back—I was to give him back his good half-sovereign again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am toll-keeper at the Thames-tunnel. On the 22nd of Aug. Elliott came to me for change for a sovereign—she wished parti<lb></lb>cularly for a half-sovereign—I gave her a half-sovereign and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had weighed that half-sovereign about an hour before, in scales which we have for the purpose, and found it was weight—we do not take them without weighing—I had only that half-sovereign by me at the time—Elliott came back in two or three minutes to say that the female feared it was a bad half-sovereign—I said, "This is not the one I gave you, this is a light one"—the one I gave her was a deep yellow, and the one she brought back was lighter and duller—I did not weigh it, but 1 bent it on the counter—I gave her the sovereign back again that she should bring the good half-sovereign to me, which I had given her—I was satisfied the half-sovereign she brought me back was not the one I gave her—I never had the slightest doubt about it.</p>

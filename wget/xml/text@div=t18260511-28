My cellar communicates with the house, and has a flap opening into the street; before I went to bed I looked all over the house; the flap was secure, and was bolted inside all secure. I was alarmed by the watchman about one o'clock; I threw up the window, and the watchman called to me; I went down stairs, and found the cellar flap wrenched off its hinges; I went up and dressed myself. The watchman produced a crowbar, which tallies with the marks; I missed nothing. The cellar was full of different things. The prisoners are strangers to me.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Bow-street pa<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110021"></xptr>trol. I was on duty in Mile-end-road on the 25th of April, about twelve o'clock; I had just got to the corner of Dog-row, which is about fifty yards from the prosecutor's house. I stood up at a door-way, out of the rain, as it poured hard - I could not be seen. I stood there about five minutes, when the three prisoners came down Whitechapel-road, and passed close by me, in company, talking together; Archdeacon's house is on the left-hand side, on which side I was. When they got to his house, in a minute, I heard something give a tremendous crack, which attracted my attention - I looked, and watched them; I could see every thing by the gas lamp, which shone against the house - I heard another crack in a few minutes - they then walked away, down the road; I could see them all three at the house; whenever any body passed, which was three or four times, they went away, and returned again to the house; I then saw them stooping towards the cellar flap, and missed one of them; he must have got down the flap into the cellar, for I saw him occasionally up and down, and have no doubt but he was in the cellar; I saw his head go down and up. I watched them in this way for three quarters of an hour; whenever any body passed all three went away; the one was not long in the cellar, and then he came up again; it was then getting towards one o'clock, and I went down towards them - at that time two of the patrol were coming up the road, meeting me - they all three walked away, as they had done before when any one passed; I saw collins put his arm over the railing of an empty house, about fifty yards from Archdeacon's, and heard something drop, which sounded like iron - I afterwards picked up a crow-bar in that place, by the assistance of the watchman; I secured them, and they stood by while I found it. When I saw collins drop this iron I caught hold of Francis, who had a fustian jacket on; the two patrol came up - I called to them, and they secured the other two. I then got over the rails, and found the crow-bar; they were never out of my sight. I searched them at the watch-house; Francis has a phosphorus-box and matches up the sleeve of his jacket, and a piece of candle, rolled up in paper, up the other sleeve; I found some duplicates on the other prisoners. I went back to the prosecutor's, and found the watchman had alarmed him. I went all over his place, and found the door of the cellar flap wrenched open. I fitted the crowbar to the marks - it was broken in teeth, and fitted the place exactly. I have no doubt it had been broken open by that crow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. CHESWELL. Q. Are you quite positive that Cormack was in company with them? A. Quite.</p>
               <p>Prisoner COLLINS. Q. Did you not get over three or four places before you found the crow? A. Yes; there were three or four railings, and I got over them till I found it, by the assistance of the watchman's light.</p>

            . On the day I quarrelled with my husband these bracelets were on the mantel-piece; the prisoner came up between two and three o'clock- I heard my husband say to her, "What have you in your hand?" she said, "What do you mean, I don't understand you?" he said, two or three times, "Give me my wife's bracelets, which you have in your hand;" she said,"What do you mean, what do you say?" and then doubled up a small carpet, shook it three or four times, and let the bracelets fall - I picked them up, and took them; she thought they were diamond bracelets - Mrs Satchell saw them in her hand.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When the officer came, did you say, "She has robbed me of my bracelets? A. No - I made no complaint of it - I staid there nine days - I did not wish to do anything - I did not mention this to the Magistrate.</p>

            . I was present, but did not see the bracelets taken - I saw them in the prisoner's hand; she would not own that she had them in her hand; but as she stooped to take up the rug, which had been folded up, I saw them in her hand; she took hold of the rug, and shook them out - I heard nothing said about her stealing them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did it not appear to you, that she had picked them up? A. No - she sent for the officers herself on the 20th; nobody charged her with stealing the bracelets. <rs id="t18271206-41-verdict201" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I keep the Old English Gentleman beerhouse at Cheshunt—on 28th August I saw the prisoner coming from an aperture in the cellar—I had given him permission to sleep in the stable the previous night, but not on that night—I saw him coming out at about 10 minutes to 6—the hole was between the stable and the cellar—it was not there before the prisoner made it—I followed him—he pushed the staple back—I ran out of the back door, and caught him in the road—I struggled with him—ultimately we both fell over the hedge into the barley field—he got away—I went back, and I found the till standing in the tap-room, and the contents, the change for the morning, gone—there was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the till as near as I can guess—on going into the stable I found a box standing against the hole which the prisoner had made into the cellar—it is a partition of lath and boards—I next saw the prisoner on the 10th or 11th December</p>

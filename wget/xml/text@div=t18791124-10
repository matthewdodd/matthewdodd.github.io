I am barmaid at the Marquis of Granby, Drury Lane—on 14th October, a little after 11 a.m., the prisoner came in with a man and woman for a pot of ale—he tendered a shilling—I tried it in the tester—it was bad—I gave it back to him—he gave me another, which I tested, and that was bad—he then put 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. down, and also gave me a florin and said "Wait a minute, take it out of this"—I took up the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and tested the florin he put down and it was bad—I said "How many more have you got like this?"—he made no answer; I called Mr. Snellgrove—the man and woman drank some of the ale—the prisoner went out and came in a second time, and we gave him in charge—I gave the shilling and florin to Tozer—I gave the first shilling back to the prisoner, and he said thai he dropped it down a grating.</p>

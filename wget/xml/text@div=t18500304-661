On Saturday night, a few minutes past ten o'clock, I left the plate in this basket, and went up to prayers in the back parlour—every door was locked—the kitchen-door was closed, but not shut—the win<lb></lb>dow was fastened with shutters—there was no outer door—the front-door was closed—it opens with a handle outside, but the outer gate was locked—after prayers I missed the basket of plate, and gave information—I saw the Policeman find the basket under a tree—we traced footsteps 700 or 800</p>

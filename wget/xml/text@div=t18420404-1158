                  </hi>. I am in the service of Charles Hook, a linen<lb></lb>draper, in St. John-street. About eleven o'clock in the morning of the 2nd of March the prisoner came to my shop—I asked what he wanted—he said the servant who had just gone in was his aunt—I turned my back, supposing they were going to talk together—I had got a few steps away, when I heard him call "Mary" at the door—I missed a shawl from the counter, which I had seen a few minutes previous)—he ran—I followed, and saw him fifty or sixty yards off, in company with another boy and a girl—I took him, and asked him for the shawl he had taken away from our shop—he said he had not taken, or not got any thing—I asked what the girl bad got in her basket—he said some butter, that she had been to the cheesemongers's—I opened it, and there was some butter—the third party ran away—I have not found the shawl—I did not see the prisoner with it—It was there at the time he came in, and when he went out it was gone—no one had been in in the mean time—the servant who came in at the same time he did was no relation of his at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Deptford. On Thursday night, 1st July, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was going home from Greenwich; I was the worse for drink—I got into the station house—when I came to I missed my watch, which was in my pocket at 11 o'clock, and also my hat, which had</p>

On Saturday morning, 3rd July, at half past 10 o'clock, I went on board a barge lying in Deptford Creek, and found this hat in the cabin—the prosecutor identified it—I stayed there till past 12 o'clock, when I saw the prisoner and the captain of the barge coming towards it—I stopped the prisoner in the road, and asked him how he accounted for the hat being in his barge—he said he had picked it up in the road, and taken it there—I took him to the station, and asked him if he knew anything of a watch, which the prosecutor had lost at the same time as the hat—he said he knew nothing of it—I searched him, and in his trowsers pocket found the watch, key, and ring, which the prosecutor has identified, and this guard (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was round the prosecutor's neck broken.</p>

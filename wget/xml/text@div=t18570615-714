                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. James Spencely, of No. 24, Goodge Street. On the morning of 18th May I was knocked up about a quarter past 1 o'clock by Mr. Spencely; he went down to open the door—I followed him with merely my trowsers on—I then went up to finish dressing myself—I was not present when the policemen were admitted—the last witness was at the bottom of the stairs—while I was dressing myself, Mr. Spencely called, "Bring a light with you"—I brought a light down, and as I got to the landing of the first floor I saw Williams standing close to the door—I said, "What do you do here?"—he said, "I came in with the police"—I said, "Come down, and we will see about that"—he came down, and I said to the policeman, "Do you know anything about this man?"—he said, "No, I don't"—the policeman took him.</p>

I said, "There are some burglars in the house, I came in with the officers;" I went down, and saw the officer; he said, "What do you do here?" I said, "I came in with the officer;" he said, "You said just now that you belonged to the house;" I said, "No;" Mr. Spencely came and said, "Where do you come from?"

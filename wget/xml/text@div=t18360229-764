                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 178.) On the morning of the 11th of February I went to the premises of the prisoner Bryant, in Charles-palce, Ratoliffe—I have known him, six or seven years—he deals in coke—I asked him if he had bought any sacks of a man called Fish of Gahagan—he said, "No"—I asked if he had bought any of any body else—he said, "No, I have not, Mr. Murray"—I then asked him where the sacks were which he worked with—he said he had got but three, and they were at the was factory—I asked him to go there with me—he said he would go up and put on his boots and go with me—it was about half-past six or a quarter to seven o'clock in the morning—when he went up stairs I heard a scuffling over my lead, and called out to him, "Halloo, Bryant, that won't do"—he then came down stairs with two sacks in his hand, and said then he had got six—I asked him where he got them from—he said he bought them in Rose<lb></lb>mary-lane, of a man, eight or nine mouths ago, and gave 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a piece for than; and that the man kept a green-grocer's shop—I asked him if he had got any more up-stairs—he said, "No"—I then went up-stairs myself and hand one sack lying alongside of his wife, who was lying there very ill, and complained of having three broken ribs—I came down stairs and went into the yard, and in the privy I found one sack with a dog lying on it—I came in and found another in a dark corner of the front room, which I had been in before—I asked him to go with me to the gas factory, which he did—he gets his coke from there—he picked up three sacks there, and gave to me, making eight altogether—I then took him to the station-house—he was taken before the Justice, and remanded till the 15th—he gave the Ma<lb></lb>gisrtrate a description of the person he said he bought them of, and in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he said I took Cutlin into custody on the 20th—I brought less out of the cell into Bryant's presence, and said, "Is that the man you bought the sacks of?"—Bryant said, "It is all right; that is the man"—Galdin said, "Certainly, I did sell him four sacks"—Bryant picked out four sock's in Catlin's presence, before the Magistrate—I think what he said was takes down.</p>

               <p>I looked at him, waited a moment, and he said, "That is true"—I went on with the further statement made by Bryant—I turned to him in the same way, and he said, "That is true"—after it had been read, they were asked whether they would sign it, and declined—I did not ask if it was true, but looked at them, and they both said it was true—I forget their words, but they distinctly admitted the truth, saying "It is true," or "That is right," or words to that effect—I will not undertake to say what particular phrase they used I rather think it was confined to one or two words.</p>

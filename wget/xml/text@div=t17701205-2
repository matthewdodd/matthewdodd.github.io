On October 20, in the evening, about seven o'clock, I was going on board the Eagle, at Union Stairs. I called in at the City of Bristol, a public house. I had a porter with me, with a bundle, containing the things mentioned in the indictment. Mr. Hay the prisoner came into the house. I ordered my man to take the cloaths away. Mr. Hay said he should not take them away, for he would have them; there was a scuffle between my man and him; Mr. Hay took the goods, and bid a man lock them up in his room for his use. There was a press-gang came to my man with their clubs.</p>
               <p>Q. How many people were by at this time?</p>
               <p>Smith. There was a press-gang that belonged to the prisoner; there might be an hundred people there, for aught I know.</p>
               <p>Cross Examinations.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you was to tell the whole story.</p>
               <p>Do you know one Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Smith. He was second mate of the Eagle. I bought the goods for him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had received some money of him, I believe.</p>
               <p>Smith. He owed me money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you received no money from him?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor no order?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was your debtor for the goods; was he?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; he owed me money before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then these goods would have increased the debt?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; and the captain of the Eagle would have given me a draft upon his owners for all the money due to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drop into this house by accident?</p>
               <p>Smith. I went in to drink.</p>

               <p>Smith. I don't know what you are raising.</p>

               <p>Smith. No; he was in the house before me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he press'd before you came?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; and he was in another room.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it can't be true, that when you came into the house you pointed to Kennedy, and said that is the man?</p>
               <p>Smith. I deny that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to press Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Smith. How do I know?</p>
               <p>Q. Who told them that Kennedy was a sailor?</p>
               <p>Smith. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Kennedy did not say to you, How could you use me so ill as to betray me?</p>
               <p>Smith. I don't know but he did next day; he did not that day; I was on board the tender that day. - It was not Kennedy said so; it was one of the press-gang, that lent a hand off with my cloaths. I don't remember Kennedy said any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. When the cloaths were taken up, did Kennedy own them or not?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050004"></xptr>Smith. I never heard him own them in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. What pretence did Mr. Hay make for taking these things?</p>

               <p>Smith. None at all in the world, but insisted upon it that they should be lock'd up in his room for his own use.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give no reason why he took them?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all - I told Mr. Hay, if he took the cloaths from my man, I would swear a robbery against him. I told him they were my property.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Court. Upon your oath, do you think that the prisoner took the cloaths from you with a felonious intention - with an intention to steal them, in the presence of all these people?</p>
               <p>Smith. I do from my soul believe he did?</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. You do believe he did?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say Kennedy did not own them?</p>
               <p>Smith. He did not own them in my hearing.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently you don't know that he said to whilst you was in the house?</p>
               <p>Smith. I don't.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear any body else say they were Kennedy's?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; never.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any talk of your having bought them for Kennedy whilst you was there?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all; they came up with their great clubs, and the man was obliged to deliver the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no talk of your having bought them for Kennedy?</p>
               <p>Smith. No; none at all; there was nothing said.</p>

            . I am a porter. I went with Mr. Smith to the City of Bristol, a public house, on the 20th of October. I carried a bundle of cloaths for him: I put the bundle down upon the bench, and put my elbow upon it. Soon after the press-gang came up. Mr. Smith bid me carry the things back to where I brought them from. Mr. Hay took hold of one end, and I the other. He got the bundle away from me, he gave it to one of his gang, and said, Take this to my room, and lock it up for my use. My master said, that is not right, they are my property. Mr. Hay said, If you say much, I will send you on board the tender. They came up to me with their clubs; I was glad to get out of the house; I was afraid of being murdered.</p>

            . I am a foremast man, and belong to the St. Antonio, Lieutenant Hay had a press gang at the City of Bristol public house. I belonged to the gang.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any message to go to Smith's house to search for men?</p>
               <p>Williams. Smith himself came down between 6 and 7 in the evening, and asked if any of the gang were in the house. I was called out of the kitchen to him. Smith told me that there was a mate of a vessel at his house that had got no protection, and he asked me to go and press him. He did not tell me the man's name. I went with three of our gang to Smith's house; the man was not there. He sent for us a second time; we thought he was playing tricks with us, and we would not go. About an hour afterwards, Smith and Kennedy, and a porter with a bundle, came to the house, Smith sat down in the kitchen in an arm-chair; he looked round to us, and said, pointing to 
               <persName id="t17701205-2-person51">

               <p>"That is your men." Upon that I asked him if he had got a protection; he said, No. I said, Pray what ship do you belong to? I think he said the Eagle, and was bound to the bay of Bandorus. I told him I must stop him till my officer came in. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050005"></xptr> looked immediately upon Smith; he called him a villain, and asked him how he could behave in such a manner, to bring him to a press gang? The porter put the bundle of cloaths upon the table. Kennedy took them up, and put them upon a copper; then he gave them to me, and said, As I am your prisoner, I beg you will take care of my cloaths. In two or three minutes lieutenant Hay came in; he said, Williams, what is the matter? I told him what we had been doing of. Mr. Hay said, My friend, have you any protection? He said, No, none at all. He begged Mr. Hay would take care of his cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. When Kennedy said the cloaths were his, what did Smith say?</p>
               <p>Williams. He said they were not his, for he had bought them, and was not paid for them. Kennedy said he was not scoundrel, and asked our liberty to lick him. He said, Smith, do you owe me some money, or do you not? Smith said, No. He asked him the second time; upon which Smith said, Yes, the sum of 4 l. 4 s. and the third time he asked him, he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he owed the money for?</p>
               <p>Williams. That was not mentioned; this was before Mr. Hay came in: When he came in, I acquainted him with what had passed, as I said before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any struggle about the cloaths between the porter and Mr. Hay?</p>
               <p>Williams. Not to the best of my remembrance. When Kennedy said he had no protection, Mr. Hay said he must go on board the tender. He said to Smith, My lad, if you will come on Monday morning, the right owner shall have the cloaths. I carried them up to Mr. Hay's room, and after that I took them on board the tender, with Kennedy's name to them, and took a receipt from him. On Monday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, our lieutenant went on board to regulate the men. Smith came on board at the same time, and brought a bill of what he had paid the shopkeeper for them. I said, Are you not a pretty man to use the man thus? He said, his reason was, he was coming down to the rendezvous, in order to see him safe on board the ship; that he did not chuse to go, but insisted upon picking up a whore.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of the cloaths being carried to the Regulating Office?</p>

             and a porter, Smith pointed to Kennedy, and said to Williams. That is your man, Williams; then asked him if he had a protection: he said, No. He told him he must detain him. Then Kennedy took his bundle, and laid it upon a copper. Smith said they belonged to him, he would take the money for them. Kennedy said they did not, and that Smith owed him 4 l. 4 s. Smith said he did not. Kennedy mentioned it a second time, then Smith said he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Hay present then?</p>
               <p>Barton. No, he was not come in then.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no occasion to go any further; there is not the least foundation for charging this man with a felony upon the evidence of the prosecutor himself, unless we can suppose the lieutenant could be thought to commit a robbery in the presence of all these people. Now the thing comes out, these two people give another evidence contradicting the prosecutor in every particular of his evidence. To charge a man of reputation in this manner with a felony is an abominable thing.</p>

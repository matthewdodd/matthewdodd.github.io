                  </hi>. I have lived for fifteen years at 13, King's Head-court, Westminster, and am a retired umbrella maker—Ann Farrell was my wife—she was seventy-five or seventy-eight years of age—she was returned as seventy-eight—she was ailing two years before this, but had recovered her<lb></lb>self remarkably—her sight and bearing were good, and she was an active, good, soldier's wife—I was a soldier for twenty-two years in the Cameronians—on Tuesday, 29th July, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I heard a noise, and went to the door—the prisoner rushed into my parlour and took a seat—she used very bad expressions, which I did not like, and I turned her out by great force, being an old man—she appeared to be drunk—I pushed her out in the street from my door—I then went into my parlour, and left my wife standing at the door—I was sober: I have never tasted a drop of intoxicating drink for twenty years—I then saw the prisoner rush at my wife, and get hold of her hair, and bring her down on to the pavement with great force—</p>

               <p>there was not a bone from her ankle upwards that was not broken—I got a cab and took her to the hospital—she was a healthy woman and might have lived a considerable time—I am eighty-two, and am a strong healthy man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Michael Condor—I was sitting on the step of my door, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, which is opposite Farrell's, and saw the prisoner come up just as if she was drunk—she walked up and shook hands with Mr. Farrell, who said that he did not know her—she said that she had known him many a long year, and did not know anything bad of him—she turned into his place and he went in also—the prisoner having had a drop of drink did not want to come out, but Mr. Farrell <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> her out and she fell on the kerb-stone—when she recovered, she went and caught the old lady by the waist, lifted her up, and slipped her down on the stones—she did not fall on her.</p>

I reside in King's Head-court—on 29th July I saw the prisoner in Mr. Farrell's parlour—Mrs. Farrell was up stairs lying down—the prisoner made use of very coarse language both to him and to me, and he pushed her out—Mrs. Farrell then came down and went into the parlour—she afterwards rose from the seat and went to the street-door—the prisoner took her by the arm and shoulder and threw her violently out on to the kerb—she was picked up and appeared perfectly lame: she could not use her legs at all.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

             (Police-constable S 50). I met the prosecutor on the 1st of August, and went with him to the house in Chapel-street, No. 55; I found both the prisoners in a little back parlour at the rag-shop - I told them he had complained of losing a scarf and two handkerchief pins; they said they had not seen any thing of the kind -I staid some time, and they gave me leave to search the house; the prisoner Tewkesbury said to the landlady,"You know right well that neither of us went out of the house;" she said, "Yes, you did go out for ten minutes for some tea;" she pushed her arm, and said Hush! I sent them to the watch-house, and then asked the landlady again if they had been sent out - she said Yes, and told me the way; I went that way, and found a pawnbroker's, where the articles were pledged.</p>

            . I am apprentice to a pawnbroker in Clarendon-square. On the 31st of July, at five o'clock, both the prisoners came to our shop - Stiffin pawned the scarf for 3s., in the name of Ann Smith, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060062"></xptr>lodger, No. 19, Ossulton-street; she asked me 8s. for it; I offered her 3s. - Tewkesbury handed it to her, and said,"That won't do, will it;" she said, "Can't you make it 4s.?" I said No - she said, "Then give me 3s.;" I asked Stiffin if it was hers - she said Yes; she had two pins - she asked me if they were worth more than 1s.; I said No - she then said to Tewkesbury, "He wants half a crown for them;" they were two gold pins, with coral heads.</p>
               <p>Tewkesbury. I said the property was mine; Stiffin said nothing, but asked the value of the pins. Witness. I asked Stiffin if it was hers, and she said Yes, and gave me the address.</p>

            . These are my property.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were there, did Stiffin go out for a short time and come back? A. No; I will swear they were both in the room the whole time, except when Tewkesbury went out to pawn something to pay me the 3s., but while she was out, I did not say or do any thing to the other.</p>
               <p>Tewkesbury. Whilst Stiffin went out with a friend he took improper liberties with me - I told him I would call a Policeman; he said, "Don't do that, I will give you this scarf, and two pins."</p>
               <p>GABRIEL SOUZA re-examined. Q. Upon your solemn oath, did you take any liberties with Tewkesbury? A. No, I did not touch her, upon my oath - I did nothing of the kind; she did not complain of any thing - I always fetch beer for ladies where I go to sell goods; the door was open, and the mistress was in the shop - she was not out at all; I swear the mistress remained in the house all the time - I opened my bundle and showed my finery, but I did not show this scarf; my bundle was done up when I went for the beer, and when I took it away I did not notice that it was altered - I swear I did nothing improper to either of them; I had not seen them before that day; I was quite sober; we only had that beer between the four of us, the mistress of the house, the two prisoners, and I; as I passed the door to go into the parlour I gave the mistress some beer; I had only had a cup of coffee and some bread for dinner, and no meat, beer, nor spirits.</p>
               <p>Tewkesbury. While he was there the mistress went out with another woman, and then he took liberties with me, and solicited me to meet him in Lancaster-street, and promised the next day to give me a gold chain. Witness. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Stiffin. I was sitting at work in the back parlour when he came; the person of the shop was not at home; he asked leave to wait for her, and he waited half an hour. Witness. It was not a quarter of an hour - Tewkesbury staid with me, not Stiffins - she was behind the counter and I in front; the mistress then came and said, "Gabriel, show your goods to this young lady."</p>
               <p>Stiffin's Defence. A female friend, who had left her situation, came and asked me to go out - I went, and was gone nearly an hour - when I came back the prosecutor was sitting on the sofa with Tewkesbury; the mistress was out, and the door was shut and locked - I asked Tewkesbury what was the matter; she made no reply, and when the prosecutor was gone, she asked me to go with her to the pawnbroker's.</p>

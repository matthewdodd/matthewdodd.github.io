On the 29th of April, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the evening, I fastened all the windows and double locked the door; I slept there every night; but was going up to another house of mine at Edgware. Between five and six o'clock that evening the prisoner had rang at the bell, and asked if one Mr. Gurney did not lodge there; I referred him a few doors further on. While I was at Edgware, between half-past eight and nine o'clock, I was sent for - I got back to the house before it struck nine; it had been dark about an hour. I found the door shut, but a crowd of people round it - I applied the key, and found it on the single lock. I am positive that I double locked it; I went in, and found the back door, which I had double bolted and barred, wide open, and a pair of steps moved from where I had put them, and set against the party wall. I found somebody had scratched the wall leading to the mews with his feet, in endeavouring to get over. I went down stairs to get a light, and found the matches disturbed, which I had left on the tinder box. Upon going up stairs, I found a glass moved from the table by the window, and the trap door leading to the loft open, but not the trap door above the loft, so that a person could not get on the roof. I found about an inch of wax candle, which had been lighted, in the back area. There was a fire in the back kitchen, by which the matches must have been lighted. I am certain the prisoner is the person who rang at the bell - I did not know him before.</p>

            . I live in Horse Shoe-yard, Lower Brook-street. About a quarter past eight o'clock on the evening in question, I was in Upper Berkley-street; it was duskish; all the lamps were lighted - I could not distinguish a man's features to know him a short distance off. I was passing down on the opposite side of the street with my wife, (the prosecutor is my brother-in-law) - my wife said,</p>
               <p>"There is somebody gone into Mr. Well's house;" I said,</p>
               <p>"Well, I thought so" - we crossed over and went up to the door, and found it closed. I had been there about an hour and a half before with Wells. We hesitated for some time, and presently I saw a light come up as if from the kitchen - I gave a very loud double knock at the door, and the light disappeared. I crossed to the other side of the way. There was a tall man walking up and down; he gave two or three very loud Halloes! and while I crossed over, he crossed to the same side as the house, and walked up and down. My wife stood at the door, and rang the bell; I told her she had better go to Portland-place, and fetch Mr. Wells; she went, and I guarded the door. The man passed me two or three times, and so did the watchman. I stood with my back against the iron railing, about two feet from the door. About forty minutes past eight o'clock, the prisoner opened the door, and came out - I stepped up, and collared him, and asked what business he had there; he said he found the door open - I called the watchman. A mob collected, and wanted me to let him go. His coat and trowsers were all covered with lime white, as if he had attempted to get over the wall - I gave him in charge. I went to the back of the premises, and found the whitewash all scratched off the wall leading to the mews, and three or four of the bricks pushed into the gutter. I think it must have been about twenty minutes past eight o'clock when we saw him go in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182305140011"></xptr>- it was a quarter to nine when we took him to the watch-house; it was too dark to discern a person's countenance.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Upper Berkley-street. I saw Hart by Wells's house twice; when I called eight o'clock and half-past eight - when I was calling half-past, I was fetched, and took the prisoner from Hart to the watch-house; he kept knocking the white off his clothes all the way as he went along. I found upon him a latch key, a small bag with two halfpence, and a small piece of wax candle, and a large bundle handkerchief.</p>

I lost some plants on the 31st of May; they were in pots, in a frame near my house - the lights had been lifted off. I lost about forty or fifty double camellias, and a number of single ones - I had seen them safe at nine o'clock the night before, in the nursery-ground - there are trees growing there, and I call the place a nursery-ground; they were all in pots - I know nothing of the prisoner. I went to Highgate, and found my plants at Mr. McPhersons, on the 1st of June - they opened the stable-door, and a barrow full of these plants were brought out. I could swear to all of them; the pots were not taken away - they are standing in the same place now. Before I saw the plants I said, "If they are mine, there are two myrtle heap camellias;" they were nearly all found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know the plants? A. By the working of them. I swore to three of them at the office - they were in frames in the nursery-ground; they are very delicate plants - they are always kept in the pots.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the pots plunged? A. No; here is one of them - it is grafted here; I had sold none of them - I know them by the working of them, which I do myself.</p>

            . I am a nurseryman, and live at Highgate. Higgins came to my house and inquired for some camellias. I showed him a barrow-load, which had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120041"></xptr>two or three hundred single ones and about fifty double ones. About eight o'clock in the morning, on the 31st of May, the prisoner brought them to my house, at Highgate; he first inquired for employ, and said he had come from Mr. Jones, of Wandsworth. I told him we did not want any hands - he then said, Mr. Jones told him to ask if I wanted any camellias, and that he had brought some with him - they were then brought into the yard in a barrow; another man was with him, who appeared intoxicated. I cannot say which brought them in. I looked at them, and asked the prisoner how they came in that state, as they were out of pots; it was a very hot morning, and there was nothing over them but a flannel jacket; they appeared more like laurel cuttings than anything else - the prisoner said Jones had an execution on his premises, and was glad to get them out any how. I asked how they got broken so, as some were literally smashed; he said the man who assisted him in wheeling them had fallen over them - I asked what Jones wished me to do; he said he wished me to send him 2l. for them. I said that was nothing like the value - he said, I could settle it with Jones when I saw him; I said, "Jones must come himself to me;" he said he could not, for he was ill in bed. I looked over the plants, and thought proper to detain them; I gave the prisoner 1l., and told him to call next morning; he begged hard for more, as Jones was much distressed - I gave him 5s. more; he asked for a pint of beer, which I gave - his name he said was Steel. I asked Jones' direction; he said, "No. 3, Church-lane, Wandsworth." I made inquiry, and Higgins came to me next morning - the prisoner also came next morning, and I detained him; I delivered him to an officer - another man was with him, who ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know what a conservatory is? A. Yes; plants in a conservatory are turned out of pots; but in green or hot-houses they are in pots, and stand on frames generally.</p>

            . The glasses were all secure then, and the blinds up. I put my horses up then, I locked the door up and went to the public-house. I took the key with me. I returned about one to the coach house. The watchman was going the hour of one when I returned. The first thing that I missed was the horse-cloth. I missed it from the box where I left it. The coach-house door, I put the key in, it went round easy. It appeared to me that the lock had been turned. I went in and observed that the horse's cloth was not there, on the box of the lantelet. I searched the coach-house. The watchman was going by, I asked for a light. I went into the stable, and then I went into the coach-house. I perceived my horsecloth under another carriage, it was laying on the ground spread open; and as I was stooping down to my cloth I observed my own carriage door open, and the prisoner was getting out of my carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the other carriage at the same time - A. Yes. I observed the other carriage door open, and the blinds let down, and the steps down. I had also left the door of that other carriage shut. I asked the prisoner what brought him there; he told me the coachman of the other carriage let him in. He said he was shut out of his lodging. I asked him what clothes the other coachman wore; he told me that he had a drab coat on with a green collar. I then seized him, and called the watchman, and gave him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What was found upon him - A. Nothing but a clasp knife. I then looked into my master's carriage. I observed the glasses upon the seat of the carriage.</p>
               <p>Q. How many glasses - A. Two, and the frames of the glasses were broke. They were not in the state I left them. I left them perfectly secure. The glasses were given to

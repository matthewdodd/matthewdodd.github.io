I have been living with the prisoner as his wife—my husband has deserted me—I became acquainted with the prisoner in the workhouse, and afterwards went to live with him—on 11th August, the day before this <hi rend="italic">occurrence</hi>, we had some words—he showed me a knife—I asked him what he had sharpened it for—he told me to cut his finger-nails with—he shut it up—he held it up to me in a threatening manner, and I went away—I saw him next on Sunday morning, between 1 and 2 o'clock, when I came home—he was in bed—I asked him what he was going to do with the lodger, down stairs, and he said nothing; if I was not out of the room he would let me see what he would do to me—I told him I should not go out as it was my own home—on that he jumped out of bed, and took the knife from under his pillow—It was a penknife like that I had seen the day before—he rushed to the door where I was standing, caught hold of my hair with his left-hand, and with his right-hand drew the knife across my throat—I screamed out murder, I was overcome with the loss of blood, and recollect no more—I have been under the care of a surgeon since—my throat was cut—this is the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I never knew him sleep with &amp; knife under his pillow before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at 1, Duke-street, Mint-street, Southwark, the same house as the prosecutrix—about half-past 1 on this Sunday morning, I heard her screaming murder—I ran up stairs to the prisoner's room, and there saw him having hold of the prosecutrix by the hair of her head with his left-hand, dragging her along the boards, and an open knife in his right hand—the prosecutrix was bleeding from the neck—I got hold of him and got him down, and after some difficulty got the knife from him—I sent for a policeman and a surgeon.</p>

I live in the same house—the day before this took place the prisoner came to my window and sharpened a penknife for about ten minutes—this is the knife—the prosecutrix was in my room talking to me and Conolly—the prisoner pointed the knife at her, as much as to say she should have the contents of it, and the look he gave her was enough to cut any one through.</p>

I am a surgeon, at 159, High-street, Southwark—I was called in to attend the prosecutrix—I found her lying on a bed insensible, bleeding from a wound in the upper part of the throat, about two inches long—it might have been inflicted with a penknife—it would not have proved fatal as it was, if it had gone deeper it might—it was not a deep wound—it would not require much force to inflict such a wound with such an instrument—if much force had been used it would have been deeper.</p>

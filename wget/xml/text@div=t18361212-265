Molyneux-street, Marylebone—the prisoner was not at home—I found these three chessmen, two cups, one saucer, and two parcels of tobacco—I and another officer went that same day to Edgeware—we made inquiries where the prisoner's mother lived, and found the prisoner, and brought her to town—we told her we had searched her lodgings—she said she had to town—we told her we had searched her lodgings—she said she had nothing she was afraid of—we told her of these things, and she said James Adams had given them to her.</p>

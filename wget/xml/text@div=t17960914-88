             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable: On Sunday the 10th of July, I stopped the prisoner with a ham in Woolpack-alley, Hounsditch, between the hours of eleven and twelve; I asked him what he had got there, he said he had got a ham; I asked him where he was going with it, he told me to Whitechapel; I asked him how he came by it, he told me he bought it in the Borough; I had my suspicions, and being Sunday, I stopped him and took him to the Compter; the ham was in the bag in the state it is now; I found out that he lived with Mr. Smith. (Produces the ham and bag).</p>
               <p>Q. (To Smith). Can you identify that ham to be your's? - A. Yes; by the string put through the skin, which is a very uncommon method; this bag is also mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Are all your hams, served so? - A. No; I have six more that are so, being the finest in the parcel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come from the country in that way? - A. No; I ordered them to be strung to be hung up.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all that are hung up in your shop are strung that way? - A. No; they are not.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Monday did you miss any ham? - A. Yes; I missed one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any mark upon the sack? - A. No; it was kept in the warehouse with a saddle in it, which was taken out by my son on the Sunday morning; the prisoner was my servant at the time; he was what we call a <rs id="t17960914-88-deflabel491" type="occupation">warehouseman</rs>

               <p>Q. Had you missed any other property at any time? - A. I had missed property, but nothing that I could bring home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Did I understand you rightly, that you swear to that ham because it was strung? - A. I swear to that, because I had seven of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to the ham by the string? - A. I have no doubt it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to the ham by the string? - A. By that alone I will not swear.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us any other mark? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not common to string hams in that way? - A. No; they are generally tied round.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to the bag; about that there is no mark whatever? - A. No; but I know the bag to be mine.</p>
               <p>Q. This man has lived with you a great while? - A. About fourteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. That bag is of no great value, I believe? - A. I value it at 6d.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you think it an unpardonable crime for a servant to borrow one of your bags to carry any thing home? - A. Supposing he came honestly by it.</p>
               <p>Q. A man might very honestly borrow a bag of that sort to carry any thing he might want to carry? - A. He might think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else in the shop? - A. Two men to serve in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those two men here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you talk of one ham being missing, how can you swear, you being away, that a ham was not sold the preceding day? - A. I cannot swear what was done in my absence.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Who had the charge of the business after you were gone out on Saturday? - A. My son.</p>
               <p>Q. You had two other servants besides him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all three at home on the Saturday? - A. On the Saturday they were all three at home.(The prisoner did not say any thing in his defence, but called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

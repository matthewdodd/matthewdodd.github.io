               <p>Q. Did you see what the prisoner had on him? - They were wrestling together when I ran after him and the party he was darted from him almost, and I said stop my friend, you are not gone yet. By bringing him along towards the shop he dropped the flannel waistcoat from under his coat, a brown coat which he had on, I see him drop it, rather a loosish coat, he dropped the waistcoat and I picked it up and brought it into the shop, I left it there upon the counter.</p>

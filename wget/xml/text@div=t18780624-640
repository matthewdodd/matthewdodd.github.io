I am a druggist's sundryman, of 45, St. Paul's Church-yard—I have a warehouse there on the ground floor—I left it at 7 o'clock on Thursday night, 9th May—I closed the outer door—when I came next morning I found the detectives in charge—I found the place overturned, and missed Ave gross of locket cases, four dozen lockets, a cheque out of a drawer, and about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver, and an umbrella—the lockets are manufactured by us, they are patent galvanic lockets, called the Electric Star, and contain a battery inside—they are sold by chemists—they all have our name on them—the value of the property I missed is about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a drawer in the table was forced—the warehouse door was forced.</p>

On the morning of 18th May I went to 31, Parsonage Walk, Newington Butts, about 8.45, and saw the two prisoners in the first-floor backroom—two other detectives were with me—I told Read I should take him into custody for receiving stolen property—he said "I know nothing at all about it"—the other officers searched the room—I showed Read this locket, and asked how he accounted for its possession—he made no reply—I took him to the station, and told him the charge—he made no answer to me.</p>

I went with Puttock and the other officers to 31, Parsonage Walk, and saw the prisoners there—I searched the room in their presence—I found these two boxes containing 53 lockets, 7 pawn tickets, 5 skeleton keys, a file, and a jemmy, under the pillow of the bed—I asked the prisoners how they accounted for the possession of the lockets—Read said he knew nothing about them—Josephs made no reply—on the way to the station she said "He is not guilty of all of it"—nothing was found on her—I saw this umbrella in the room, but did not take it at that time, not thinking it of any importance—the handle was in one part of the room, and the umbrella part in another.</p>

               <p>I live at Newington, Surry. On the 11th of September last, as I was returning from the city home, a young man was in the chaise with me, and a young woman, it was a one horse chaise, with the head half down; about eight in the evening, going along the street, my young man had his arm in the head of the chaise, and he felt something, and out he jumps directly out of the chaise, and seizes the prisoner; I understand that he was not jumped down from the chaise, he seized him before he got down from the chaise; then I observed the chaise head all cut through, and my young man found that he was taking out a parcel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, I know no more about it than you.</p>
               <p>Court. Was he immediately seized? - I see no other with him, I stopped my chaise as soon as I could.</p>

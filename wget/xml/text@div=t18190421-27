On Thursday the 4th of March, I went to bed about twelve o'clock - the doors and windows were all fast. I was awoke about three o'clock in the morning, before daylight, and found the cellar-door forced open; there were the marks of an instrument by the bolt, which was wrenched up - it was not so the night before. I found the counting-house had been entered by a pane of glass being taken out, and the lock of the counting-house-door picked withinside. The pane of glass was large enough for a man to get through; every thing was safe the night before. The prisoner was apprehended two days after; he had formerly lived with me as errand-boy, but did not sleep in the house.</p>

            . I am constable of Bread-street. On the 4th of March I was on duty as night constable; between three and four o'clock, the patrol informed me that the prosecutor's cellar-door was open. I went and found it so; anybody could then enter the house. We alarmed the house, and went into the cellar to look for the thief, but could find nobody there. I found a pen and ink and a bayonet in the cellar, and on the privy I found a piece of candle, which appeared lately to have been put out. I lit it, and searched further, and by the door of the wine cellar I found a chisel; this door had been attempted, and the marks matched the chisel. I went up to the counting-house, and found a pane of glass broken, sufficient for a man's body to enter; there was an iron chest in the cupboard, which appeared to have been attempted, and by it I found a hammer, which had been broken, and a punch. A screw was forced out of the door of the chest, and driven in; a person must have been a long time about it - it was quite dark when I went in. Two drawers in the counting-house were also broken open, and a door, which enclosed a nest of small drawers. Mr. Blakesley missed some silver, and some halfpence; he could not say how much; he missed a silk umbrella, and a deal box, containing two soldiers jackets. On Saturday, the 6th of March, I apprehended the prisoner in Dover-street, Blackfriars-road, about seven o'clock in the evening. He asked me what I took him for? I said Mr. Blakesley wanted to speak to him; I took a silk umbrella out of his hand, which Blakesley claimed. I found 2 s. on him, seventeen scutcheons, and a hook, which were also claimed.</p>
               <p>CHRISTMAS WINTER. I am a watchman; the prosecutor's house is in my beat. I came on duty about nine o'clock, and examined the doors and shutters of all the premises; every thing was then safe. I examined every thing again at two o'clock, and all were safe - I left my beat at four. About a quarter after three, the prisoner came to me in Friday-street, and asked me if I could tell him where to get a coach. A coachman had put down a fare at the Saracen's Head at the time. It was about 100 yards from the prosecutor's door; I told him there was one, and called the coachman. He asked where it was to go to? the prisoner told him to turn, and go to the bottom of Little Friday-street, and he would go and get his box - I never saw him before but I noticed him particularly; his back was very white, as if he had been against a wall. I suspected him, and thought I would get my lanthorn, and see where he got the box from. While I was getting my lanthorn I lost sight of him, but I had taken the number of the coach - it was 377. I went down Little Friday-street with the coach; the driver asked where the man was who wanted the coach? while I was talking to him, the prisoner came from behind me; I had my back towards the prosecutor's house - he came out of there. He said to the coachman</p>
               <p>"it is not this corner of Friday-street, it is the other, which is next to Bread-street." He went away with the coach - St. Paul's clock struck half-past three. I went and called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210014"></xptr>the hour, and examined all the doors, but not the lower shutters. I came back to the corner of Watling-street, and saw the cellar-door wide open. It must have been broken open before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come out of the prosecutor's door - A. No, but he came from the door. I gave the alarm at the watch-house, as I found the cellar-door forced - Jerwood came down; they had entered by forcing the cellar open. There was a little narrow passage by the wine-cellar, which would have whitened a man's coat, if he had been there. I found the premises as Jerwood has stated. I described the prisoner to Mr. Blakesley, and searched for him on the Saturday morning. I found the coachman, and he told me where he drove him to, and went with me and Tulley to look for him. Tulley told me if he spoke to a man, and called him</p>
               <p>"Danny," I was to notice if he was the man. We met the prisoner in Dover-street; Tully called him</p>
               <p>"Danny," I was positive he was the man that I saw - he was secured. I went up to him, and asked him if he knew me? he said,</p>
               <p>"Who are you?" I said</p>
               <p>"don't you recollect seeing me yesterday morning, between three and four o'clock, in Friday-street?" he made no answer - he had an umbrella in his hand. I saw the things found on him.</p>
               <p>HENRY EAST. I am a coachman, and drive No. 377. On Friday morning, I was in Friday-street, and saw the last witness; he looked at my number. I heard a man asking him if he could get a coach. The man ordered me to follow him down the street, which I did, to the end of Little Friday-street. I waited there about five minutes, and then he said it was the other end - the prisoner is the man, I am confident. He went away, and came again presently with a box on his shoulder; I noticed that the back of his coat was dusty and white, as if he had been rubbing against a wall. He directed me to Francis-street, Westminster-road, by the Bridge and the Obelisk. As we were going along the Blackfriars-road, he pulled the string, and told me to set him down at the next turning beyond Dover-street; he got out there, and I saw him go through a passage into Dover-street - he left the box in the coach. He returned, and asked me what I would take him to Peckham for? we could not agree about it, and he ordered me to Francis-street again. In going along he ordered me to drive to the Coburg Theatre; he got out at the corner of the Theatre, walked some distance, and called me to follow him with the coach; he took the box out, and left me near the Theatre - I had a good opportunity of observing him. He afterwards came back, and rode on the box with me to Dover-street; I had a full view of his person - I cannot be mistaken. Next day I showed the constable the different places I drove him to.</p>

            . I work for the prosecutor, and know the prisoner. He was discharged about three years ago. I heard of the burglary the next morning, and the description of the man, and went after the prisoner; we found him in Dover-street - Winter saw him, and remembered him. I spoke to him, and Winter said he was the man that he saw in Friday-street; I gave him in charge, and told him that my master wanted to speak to him. When we got out of Dover-street, I told him he was suspected of breaking the house open - he said nothing to the charge. He asked me to let him have some drink; we went into a house in Fleet-market, and he had some rum and water; I did not see any thing drop from him. I went away, and on my return was told he had dropped a pocket-book.</p>

            . On Saturday evening, about a quarter after eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner in custody at the Artichoke, in Fleet-market - he passed me as he was going out; the constable had hold of him at the time. He put his head close to mine, and asked me to pick up a pocketbook, which he had dropped - it was just behind him - the persons who held him, could not hear him, I should think. I picked it up as soon as he was gone out, and kept it until Sunday evening, I then heard of the charge, and delivered it to Mr. Blakesley. He described every thing that it contained, before he saw it; I then delivered it to him.</p>
               <p>MR. BLAKESLEY re-examined. I am certain the umbrella is mine, I saw it safe in the counting-house the day of the robbery. There are seventeen scutcheons and the brass hook, the same pattern as those I lost, but I will not swear to them; they are the same pattern as those which are left behind. They were in the nest of drawers in the counting-house, which has a door to cover them, and which was broken open. The pocket-book is mine, and was taken out of a drawer under the desk, which was forced. Harmer brought it to me on Sunday. I know it by the contents, which are a map, papers, and other things, which are mine. There are papers in it which are not mine - they have writing upon them which appear to be the prisoner's hand-writing, as far as I can judge, and a discharge from the army, in the prisoner's name. I have heard he was in the army.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

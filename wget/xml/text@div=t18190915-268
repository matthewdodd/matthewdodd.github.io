On Sunday morning, the 18th of July, about ten minutes after twelve o'clock, there was a violent knocking at the door - the house was closed. I knew Fairbrother's voice, and told her it was shut up for the night. About ten minutes after I heard my shutters being forced, and on going out, I found her forcing them; the moment I went out, she seized me, and in less than a minute afterward Cook came and seized me - he is the patrol; while he held me the woman got her hand into my pocket. I told him to take her into custody. He said,</p>
               <p>"No, I will take you to the watch-house." I said,</p>
               <p>"She is robbing me, and you are holding me the while." He said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, you have nothing to lose," and immediately struck me across the lip with his stick. She dropped the money, and stooped down to pick it up - Cook had seized me by the throat, and almost strangled me. A person, named Emmet, came up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why are you treating the man so ill?" Cook laid hold of him, and said, I shall take you likewise to the watch-house, which I believe he did. I went in, and shut the door at the request of the other watchman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you give charge of them to that watchman - A. He was on the other side of the way; I mentioned it to him, and told him that I had been robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give them in charge - A. No, I was beaten so much, that I hardly knew what I was about. There was a great mob about the place.</p>

               <p>Q. Why not give them in charge - A. The watchman did not pay attention to me - they did not give me in charge. On Monday, Emmet called upon me to go before the magistrate, which I did, and told him that I had been robbed. The man swore that I knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he indict you for it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you prefered this indictment - A. This indictment was prefered before.</p>
               <p>Q. When - A. On the first day.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150083"></xptr>Q. Was this after you was indicted yourself - A. I do not know what I was indicted for. The magistrate discharged him, and bound me over. I was bailed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. 
               <persName id="t18190915-268-person2265">Q. </persName>
            Name any one of the persons who came to you for money - A. I do not know his name - that is the man (pointing to Jessee Williams, who was in Court). I have kept the house ever since last January. I married the widow, who held the licence.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not known Cook as the parish patrol ever since you lived there - A. I suppose I have known him as a patrol about five months.</p>
               <p>Q. When he attacked you, was he dressed like a watchman - A. I do not know, he came upon me suddenly - he told me he was a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Cook that night make a charge against you for assaulting him - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, when you were before the Magistrate next day, was not the only charge made by the prisoners against you for assaulting them - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say one word about the robbery - A. I did; it was at Marlborough-street Office.</p>
               <p>Q. You were committed for the assault - A. I was ordered to find bail.</p>
               <p>Q. When you presented the charge of robbery, did the Magistrate attend to you - A. He did not enter into it; he told me to find bail, and would not allow me to speak. I preferred a bill on the second day.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it returned true - A. On the last day. I do not know when the bill was found against me for the assault.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you hear your name called over, as having a true bill found against you - A. No, I did not stay.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath did you not know a true bill was found against you for the assault by the prisoners, before you preferred this bill for the robbery - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you appeared to that indictment - A. Yes; it has not been tried yet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you appear last Sessions to take your trial - A. Not knowing any thing about the method of taking out the thing for the robbery, I went to the Magistrate, and he gave me a paper representing that I was indicted.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you name any other persons who came to you for money - A. Several; I do not know their names.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the man been in your house that night - A. Not to my knowledge; they had been forbid the house, as he and she had committed a robbery in the house before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Fairbrother come and say, why did you keep my husband so late at your house - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the child with her - A. No, she put it down by the cellar-window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the man get a bloody head that night - A. Not to my knowledge; I did not break his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the watchman to whom you did call, and say you was robbed - A. Dyall.</p>

            . I live with the prosecutor as bar-maid at the time. About twenty minutes after twelve o'clock the house was shut up, and all quiet - there came a great rapping and knocking at the door, as if the shutters were being torn down. My master went to the door, opened it, and a woman took hold of him; it was the prisoner Fairbrother - she had been at the house three or four times before, but she was always turned out, as she always came drunk and kicked up a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came out what happened - A. She was pulling him, and calling him but everything. At that moment the patrol came and collared him - it was Cook. I never saw him before, but I know his face.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know he was a patrol - A. He said he was, and he had a large stick in his hand. He collared him, and the woman had got tight hold of him at the time. He said to the patrol,</p>
               <p>"The woman has got her hand in my pocket, and is robbing me!"</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you looked at your master's pocket to see if it was so - A. No, I did not; it was dark. I might have just cast my eye down. The patrol made use of very bad expressions, and said he had nothing to be robbed of. At that moment the woman fell, and I heard money fall on the stones - whether she picked it up or not I cannot say. The patrol held him while the woman tore the sleeves out of his shirt. At that instant the watchman came across the way, and came to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master stood by the door - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the watchman did not remain on the other side of the road, but came over to the door - A. Yes; his name was Doyle, I think.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you gave charge to the watchman, did you not - A. No, nor my master; no charge was given at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of the parties go to the watch-house - A. Yes, but not me or my master.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they go for - A. Doyle said to the patrol,</p>
               <p>"Let the man alone, and let him go into his house." Then a man named Emmet and the watchman pushed him in; I laid hold of his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the watchman they had been robbing your master - A. No; the door was instantly shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps they charged your master with assaulting them at the time - A. He was not taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not prevaricate. Did they make a charge against your master that night, and at that time - A. I beg your pardon. The patrol said he would mark him, and my master said,</p>
               <p>"I will mark you."</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did not either of the prisoners charge him with assaulting them - A. Yes, they did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is your name - A. I am married.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not your name Thompson - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Harris and Clements too - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you pass by the name of Thompson - A. Yes, that is my maiden name.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you married or single - A. If I speak the truth, I am not married.</p>

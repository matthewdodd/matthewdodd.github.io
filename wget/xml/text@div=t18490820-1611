                  </hi>. I live in St. John's-wood, in the service of Mr. Price. I was living at 16, North-street—the prisoner took apartments for me as my brother—I was living with him—he promised to marry me in a fortnight—he came to me on 14th June, and said he had got a watch in pawn—he asked me to lend him five sovereigns to get it out—I went and got the purse from my box—there were twenty-eight sovereigns in it—he took the purse from my hand and counted them, and said, "Is this paltry sum all you have got? I want your bank book"—I said, "I have no bank book"—he made no reply—he put the money into his pocket—it was about eight o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing—he did not go anywhere that evening, we went to bed—he went out the next morning, and brought home a gold watch, a gold eye-glass, and a ring—he said he had pawned them because he had lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the races—I did not give him these sovereigns, nor authorize him to take them in any respect—he asked me to give him five, and he took the purse and all from me.</p>

Gibson and Gisborne: I lodge in Dyot-street, at the Black-horse. I was robbed on Tuesday, the 6th of April, about two in the morning; I was going home: I was coming from St. James's; I had been spending the evening with an acquaintance; I was alone.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you been drinking much? - I was as sober as I am now. I was going along <placeName id="t17900424-41-crimeloc228">Holborn, opposite the French Horn gateway</placeName>

               <p>How came you to go into Holborn? - I lost my way.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in London? - Four years. I do not know my direct road in the night.</p>
               <p>What happened to you then? - The night was cold; I had my hands in my breeches pocket: I saw the prisoners about six poles off me, and a woman in company; I could distinguish them by the light of the lamps; seeing them stand I took my hands out of my pockets, and buttoned them up, and walked up towards them; as I passed, I gave them the wall; I walked along the curb; as I was passing, Buchanan came with all his force, and shoved me off the curb; he did not push me down; but at the same time, he followed me, and took my hat off, and threw it into a passage just by, and struck me, and knocked me down, after he had taken my hat: Bathurst came to his assistance, and the woman, at the time they knocked me down: I called the watch, and got hold of them both, and strove to hold them; Bathurst clapped his foot upon my breast, and broke away from me; I was down at that time; I endeavoured to keep Buchanan; the patrol came up, and the patrol took hold of him: Bathurst stepped to the gateway; Wright, the patrol came up; I asked him if he was a watchman? he said, yes: I kept Buchanan; they took Bathurst; in the scuffle I lost my money; my pockets were turned inside-out.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you lose the money? - When I was upon the ground, I believe.</p>
               <p>Was you stunned by the blow? - No: my hat was picked up by the watchman; and he has it here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You have mentioned all you have lost? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>You are certain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You lost nothing else? - Yes, some papers.</p>
               <p>What were they? - Duplicates of things I had in pledge.</p>
               <p>How long had you lodged in Dyot-street? - Five or six weeks.</p>
               <p>A private house? - No, a public house.</p>
               <p>What sort of a house? - I looked upon it to be a good house.</p>
               <p>Will you swear it? - No.</p>
               <p>So you had lost your way? - I had.</p>
               <p>How soon did you find yourself lost? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>How far had you got before you found you had overshot Dyot-street? - Into Lincolns-inn-fields.</p>
               <p>What did the woman do? - She secured me by the hair of my head.</p>
               <p>What became of the woman? - She made her escape.</p>
               <p>Did not these men give charge of you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What was it? - I do not know what the charge was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179002240159"></xptr>What became of you? - I was sent to prison with them, and continued till the next morning.</p>
               <p>Where was it you offered, if they would give you one pound six and three-pence, they might go about their business? - I never said so.</p>
               <p>You will swear that? - I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you, or not? - I might make an offer of that kind.</p>
               <p>Mr Garrow. Will you swear it did not happen? - I do not recollect; they were searched.</p>
               <p>Was your money or duplicates found: was any copper, silver, or gold found upon them? - I do not know what.</p>
               <p>Was not there four shillings found on each of them? - I do not know it.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard there is a reward of forty pounds, for the apprehension of a foot-pad robber? - I cannot answer it.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did you not? - I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Tell me, yes or no?</p>
               <p>Court. That is a plain question; you must give an answer? - For foot-pads I never did; for out-laws, and the like, I have.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you or did you not hear of it? - For out-laws, and the like, not for foot-pads.</p>
               <p>You was sober, and the prisoners were? - I heard the constable say they were a little infatuate with liquor.</p>
               <p>Did he not say you were all drunk? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>How long had you been with your friend? - I had been in Rosemary-lane; and went with him to St. James's; and from thence I got into Lincoln's-inn-fields.</p>
               <p>Where had you been at in Rosemary-lane? - A public house; the Crooked-billet.</p>
               <p>I dare say you have a precious acquaintance; you live in Dyot-street, and visit in Rosemary-lane: how came you to live in Dyot-street? - A young man who works with me, lives there.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. Sollum, a japanner? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never say they molested a woman you was with? - I never said they molested a woman I was in company with.</p>
               <p>How long have you worked with Gibson and Gisborne? - Six weeks: when I came to London, I could not get employment in my own business; I trafficked in the country, from Lydd in Kent.</p>
               <p>What did you deal in, moon-shine and tobacco? - No.</p>
               <p>You was a smuggler? - No; I was employed by a man.</p>
               <p>What trafficking, upon your oath? - In smuggling, if I must tell you.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, it is one of the great blessings of the constitution of this country, that no man can be put upon a trial for his life, without evidence, and the party being produced who gives that evidence: these men are upon trial for their lives; and one is sorry to hear a man give this sort of evidence on such an occasion: upon my word, I think it affronting to you, and every man, to hear such evidence as this: if you think it proper these men should stand in jeopardy of their lives any longer, I am willing to go on.</p>

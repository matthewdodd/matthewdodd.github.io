               <p>Is your house in a street at Hammersmith? - No, it stands by itself in the center of a lane.</p>
               <p>How far is the coach-house and stable from your dwelling-house? - About twice the length of this court; one end of the brick work of the stable communicates to the garden, but not to the dwelling-house; there is a garden between the dwelling-house and stable.</p>

               <p>Then it might be broke open the day before for what you know? - No; it could not, I came down that day with my carriage, and the harness of the carriage was taken away.</p>

               <p>I am a Jew, and live in Adam's Court, near Aldgate; I deal in old cloaths; I know the prisoner Graves; I have seen Colley once with Graves on last Tuesday was a fortnight.</p>
               <p>That was the 26th of August I believe? - I believe it was, I can't tell; I bought this coat of Graves in a parlour at a public house in Goodman's-lane; he left the coat at the King's Head in Holborn, just by; he sent me to the King's Head for it, and I bought it of him for half a crown; the other prisoner Colley was in the yard playing at skittles with two or three more; after I paid Graves the money he called the other in, and said to me, I will give him his share of the money while you are here, or he will think I had more of you; before we parted we had a pint of beer; then both of them said, if I would meet them on the morrow, they would bring a saddle, a pair of harness, and three glasses; they told me I should meet them the same night at eleven o'clock at Grave's room; he shewed me his room; I was there once before; it was in a court just by.</p>
               <p>Did you go that night? - No, we have a society near where I live from seven to nine, where our people learn the law; Graves came to me next morning before I was up (when they sold me the coat they said they had buried the things in two places, that if they lost one, they might have the other); Graves called next morning before I was up, and left word for me to come to his lodging at ten o'clock; I went between ten and eleven, there were two hampers; Graves only was there; he opened the hampers; I said here is but two glasses? he said he broke one in burying it; he took-all the things that are here out of the hampers; he said I need not be afraid to sell them, they came from Hammersmith; I agreed to give him twenty-eight shillings for them; he would not let me go without giving him some money; I gave him half a guinea; I bought them with a view for the owner to have them again; I was told by one Lewis in Crutched-friars a week before, that there had been some harness stole, and he bid me stop it if I met with it; I had a bag with me, in which we put the hammer cloth and some of the things; I told him I would go and fetch the rest of the money; I went across Holborn that he might not suspect me, and then went to justice Welch's in Litchfield-street, there I met with M'Donald; I asked him to go with me to stop the men; we went directly and took Graves and carried him and all the things to justice Welch's.</p>
               <p>Was you there when Mr. Morris and the coachman came? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long was that after you carried the goods to justice Welch's? - I believe the same day.</p>
               <p>Were the things you bought of Graves seen by Mr. Morris and the coachman? - Yes, the same things.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of Addington? - I have seen her with Graves.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she had any of these goods? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What is your profession? - I deal in coach<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100009"></xptr> glasses, and cloaths, and every thing that is honest.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Graves? - Not three months.</p>
               <p>Is this the first transaction you had had together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you bought the coat, how came you not to apply to the constable immediately without waiting till next day? - When I bought the coat I brought it home; my wife asked when I was going to the fair, why I did not take it; I am a poor man, what I buy in the morning I sell in the afternoon at Rag-fair; I said it was not mine, I had a reason for it.</p>
               <p>When Graves sold you the great coat he told you he had other things to sell? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had no suspicion that he got the coat improperly? - I knew the coat was stole.</p>
               <p>Why did not you give information of the coat without staying till next day? - Because if I had given information of the coat, we should have lost all the property that was buried.</p>
               <p>What did you agree to give to him for the property that was buried? - Twenty-eight shillings.</p>
               <p>It was worth 28 l. I believe? - That is the reason I bought it.</p>
               <p>[The goods were produced in Court, and Steptoe deposed that they were the property of Mr. Morris.]</p>

               <p>When did you apprehend Colley? - Hyde took Colley; I suspected Colley because I had seen him with Graves, and bid Hyde take him.</p>
               <p>You had no reason to suspect Colley only you had seen him in company with him? - No, only Symonds told me Graves sold him a great coat and they shared the money at a public house; he told me that the same day that I took Graves.</p>
               <p>Who is Hyde? - He attends the office at times.</p>

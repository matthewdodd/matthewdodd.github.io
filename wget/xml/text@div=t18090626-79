On Monday the 26th of June, about half past eight in the evening, the prisoner came in the shop, and requested me to show her some men's broad ribbed cotton stockings; I reached about five or six pair of of the window, which I shewed her; a gentleman came in for a pair of dressed gloves, I left the prisoner to attend the gentleman; after the gentleman was gone, I went to the prisoner. I thought there was a deficiency in the number, though I did not know positively the number, whether it was five or six. She requested me to put up one pair in a piece of paper, as she was going to call at a shoe maker's shop, she would call for them as she came back; I told her that we were about to close the shop, and she had better take them with her; she said she should not be long, and if she did not call for them in the evening, she would send a little girl for them in the morning. I I went round to the window to replace the stockings, she dropped her pocket handkerchief on the ground; it appeared very large; she took it up and put it into her pocket; she went out of the shop; the porter came in just at the time. I went out immediately after the prisoner; instead of her going into a shoe maker's shop, she went into a public house in a court in Shoe-lane; when the prisoner came out of the public house, she asked me whether I suspected her guilty of stealing stockings; I hesitated, and said her conduct seemed strange; she left me, I followed her into New-street-square; I then told her I should be glad if she would go back with me to the shop; we went immediately back to the shop. I told her I suspected her of stealing stockings; she pulled a handkerchief out of her pocket, then another handkerchief, and then she took the stockings out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them to be your master's - A. I could not swear to them, there was no private mark; they corresponded with the pattern of the stockings that I had shewn her, and she offered to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty, that there was a pair of stockings missing - A, I cannot say that there was a pair of stockings missing.</p>

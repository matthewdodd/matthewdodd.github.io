I then let him go and stop the cart - he returned in about a minute, and asked where the note was - I said at Mr. Jackson's, if he would return with me he could get it; we each took hold of the basket, and went to Jackson's - he said his name was

            . I live at the corner of the Hay-market. Hayes brought me a note, which I at first thought was good, but afterwards said it was bad; he afterwards returned with the prisoner: I had kept the note in my hand, unmixed with any other; I asked his name; he said."Samuel Panton, No. 6, James-street, Kensington;" I said, "Are you quite certain you live in James-street?" he said, "Yes, that is my address;" he afterwards said Jennings'-buildings; I wrote both addresses on the note - this is it (looking at it); he said he took it from a butcher at Kingston, named Bourton, for the sale of a horse - I have written on it, "Of Mr. Bourton, Kingston." I sent for Herring, and he was secured. I gave Herring the note.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain he did not say he lived in Jennings'-buildings? A. He at first said he lived in James-street, but afterwards said Jennings'-buildings - my impression was that Jennings'-buildings were in James-street; I believe he said he was employed to sell the horse.</p>

            . I am inspector of the patrol, and took the prisoner in charge; he said he took the note at Barnet fair, in payment for a horse - he at first said he lived in James-street, and then in Jennings'-buildings; I asked who knew that he had the horse - he said it was not his own, but a gentleman in St. Paul's-church-yard, named Smith, gave it him to sell; I said, "Well, we will go there;" he said, "No, he is in the country." I found three persons in St. Paul's-church-yard of the name of Smith.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure he did not say that Smith lived in Holborn? A. Yes - but when I was telling the Magistrate that he said St. Paul's-church-yard, he said, "No, I could not say that, for nobody lives there," and then said something about Holborn.</p>

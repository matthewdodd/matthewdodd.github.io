On the 23d of January, about half after one, I was sitting in my counting-house behind my shop; the prisoner came into the shop; she put her bundle on the counter and took it up again, and with it this piece of calicoe. We were all at dinner at the time. I shewed her a handkerchief, and asked her half a crown; she bid me 1 s. 6 d. that strengthened my suspicion of her having stole something. I let her go out of the shop; then I went after her and brought her back; and throwing back her cloak, I took from under her arm this calicoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bundle under the same arm?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I don't know; I am not cert ain whether she had the bundle afterwards, because another person was with her; she cried, and begged I would not prosecute her. I told her, I had so many things of the kind lately, that I could not forgive it.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe particularly the manner in which she took it.</p>
               <p>Lewis. She had a bundle in her hand, which she laid down upon a great many goods which were upon the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe where she put her bundle upon it?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I could not see exactly. She did it but bunglingly; and as she stood I could see it under her cloak, as she held her cloak on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her bundle then?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I believe under her other arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to it?</p>
               <p>Lewis. There is no mark upon it; I believe it to be mine.</p>

               <p>I laid my bundle upon the counter. I know no more of the calicoe than the child unborn. I lived at home with my mother in Fair-street, Horsly-down.</p>

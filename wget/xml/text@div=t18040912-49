             sworn. - I had an information against the prisoner for carrying away a great quantity of linen; I went to Birmingham and took her at her father's house; I did not know whose property this gown was; the prisoner owned the gown to be part of the property; she gave it up with a great quantity of linen, which belonged to Mr. Reynolds; I took her up at Birmingham on the 3d of August last; she acknowledged to part of a basket of linen which she had made away with; she had the gown on when I apprehended her, and at the watch-house I made her take it off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. (The prisoner handed a paper to the Court, which was read as follows:)</p>
               <p>"My Lord and gentlemen, I am exceeding sorry for having acted wrong; my character was always good till this transaction; I unfortunately over-staid my time with a woman of the name of Mary Griffiths; I was persuaded to pledge the articles; after having done so, I was abandoned by my companion, whom I have never seen since, nor heard of; I have nothing to say more, only throwing myself upon the lenity of this honourable Court, hoping this, my first offence, will excite you to be merciful to me; so shall my future conduct be ever grateful, and that, by keeping in mind your lenity, I may tread in the paths of virtue, and leading a life of honesty, endeavour to repay the humanity shewn to the unfortunate prisoner,</p>

               <p>Court. Are there any rooms over your work-shop? - None at all, nor any communication to the house: on Thursday morning I went out, and I locked up the shop, the inner door, with a padlock, hasp and staple, and the outside door upon the spring lock; I came home about twenty minutes after eight, as near as possible, in the evening, and I found the box staple wrenched back, I went in and felt in the dark, and I missed my vice, and then another; I got a candle out of Mr. Scandret's house, and the prisoner came out of the house, and came into the shop to me, and he says, God d - n you, this is the third time your shop has been robbed; I said, I know it has; he said, why did not you take your vices and lock them at Mr. Scandret's, as you did the second time you was robbed; then I came into the public house, and he brought me a pot of beer, and says, God d - n you, here, drink, you will find it out in time; I went down into the vine vaults, and I received information that the prisoner was the man that robbed me, I went to the neighbouring pawnbroker's, and I found the vice at Mr. Ferris's; I am sure of the vice; I found it within ten minutes, and I found the other that is here at an old iron shop in Shoe-lane, at one Mr. Kent's; one vice is broke in the spring belonging to the flower, and the other is broke in the second turning in the worm in the box; there are not, I suppose, two such vices in the kingdom; I came back again to Mr. Scandret's house, and there the prisoner sat drinking; I took him out of the house, and got assistance; I took him to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140177"></xptr> the corner of Stone Cutters-street, and there he began to cry, and begged for mercy, and acknowledged he had robbed me; he said he would give me my property again.</p>

               <p>Did you make him any promise? - None at all; he wanted to go into a public house, and I took him out of the same house, and there he said he had not made away with much of the money; he said he had pawned one for five shillings and six-pence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg to ask the witness whether he was not tried capitally at this bar; another thing, I have it not in my power to employ a council, and I hope you will look over that bit of paper before my trial goes on; I hope your Lordship will have the kindness to do me justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Has the witness been ever convicted so as to disqualify him? - I was tried in this court, doubtless, but it is many years back; I was not called on my defence, I was honourably acquitted.</p>

               <p>On the fifteenth instant, about seven o'clock, I was drinking with Mr. Davis, who is one of the witnesses against me, and I having occasion to go to the door, when I was at the door I was accost by a man who came up to me, and telling me that he was a stranger, he would take it as a favour if I would inform him where there was a pawnbroker, and I not thinking of the consequence that might attend a thing of the kind, I took the things which he had, and went and pawn'd them for him, and brought him the money; and by obliging, he asked me to drink, but I return'd him thanks, and told him that I was engag'd at the house he saw me come out of, therefore I wished him good night, and return'd back, and in the space of about half an hour the prosecutor came in and said his shop had been robbed, and on his mentioning these words he went out, when the witness Davis went out after him, and they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140178"></xptr> both return'd in the space of fifteen minutes, and said they had a suspicion that I had robb'd the prosecutor's shop, as they had found the things was pawn'd by me, I told them I knew nothing of it, but was willing to go any where with them, and accordingly they took me to the Compter, and I was taken the next day before the Alderman, who committed me for trial, and as I am intirely innocent of what is laid to my charge, I hope your Lordship will extend your goodness so far as to inspect into my prosecutor's character, as he has been tried in this court twice for his life; and I am well convinced this is done out of spite, because I worked for him some time ago, and not liking his proceedings, I left him; and he keeps an infamous house in George Yard, Field-lane; therefore your Lordship may judge what sort of a person he is, and as I have an undeniable character, and was never before in a primeary of the kind, I hope your Lordship will inspect into my unhappy case, and I, as in duty bound, shall ever pray;</p>

            , was driving some cattle along the road, I saw him put his hand in his pocket to pay the turnpike. As his cattle turned short to go to Black Mary's-hole, one of them turned into the field, I do not know whose field it was, there was no gate, it was quite an open place; he ran through that field and into the road again at the top of the field. In the mean time that bullock was gone, the others got into the field that was open; the deceased was leaning with his body on a post, he went from the post and went towards the bullocks, going to drive them out into the road to the other bullock. The prisoner, as I thought, came out of a smith's shop, and asked the deceased where he was going to drive the cattle. He answered he was going to get them into the New Road to the others. The deceased went up to the head of the cattle, in order to get them through that place, and in a minute the prisoner struck him a blow.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you at that time?</p>
               <p>Vicar. I was about 100 yards distance, that was the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any thing in his hand?</p>
               <p>Vicar. No, he had not. The blow was just above his nose, and he fell directly down on his face. I saw but that blow: I was standing by the side of the rails. I got over directly, and said you have murdered the man; seeing him black in the face, I unbuttoned his collar. As soon as the prisoner had turned the cattle, he went to his shop again. I called after him several times, and said the man was killed. He came back again; I said you have murdered him: he said, God forbid! The man expired in about four minutes after he received the blow. My master came, I said Sir, here is a man murdered: he took a lancet out of his pocket and opened a vein, but before that he said he thought he was a dead man, (my master is a surgeon) the deceased bled but a trifle.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176601160015"></xptr>Q. Can you tell whether the prisoner had any concern in that field?</p>
               <p>Vicar. I asked him what authority he had to stop the man with his cattle; he said he had authority from his master; and that the drovers made it a practice to go through those fields to baulk the turnpike.</p>

            . I am an apothecary. I was sent for by the deceased's mother the day after he was dead. On examining the part I found a bruise on the nose, and on the side of the right ear there was a confusion, and a large quantity of extravasated blood. I examined the skull, but found nothing amiss, there was a small blood vessel broke.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you form some judgment what might be the occasion of his death?</p>
               <p>Hearn. I take it to be the breaking of that small vein. There was very near three quarters of a pint of coagulated blood.</p>

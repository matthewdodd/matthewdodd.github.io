                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Townsend, an auctioneer, at Green<lb></lb>wich. On 15th July, the prisoner's father had had a house let to him, in Nelson-street, Greenwich—I do not know who was in possession then—the house belonged to Mr. Martyr; I know that from what Mr. Martyr has told me—on 15th July, I went there with the officer of the County-court, to point out the fixtures, as I heard there was a process out from the County-court—I saw the prisoner—I did not see his father—I went through the house, and pointed out to the officer, in the prisoner's presence, a number of house-fixtures—I missed three brass rods from Mr. Townsend's inventory, which was signed by the prisoner's father—I said to the prisoner, "There are three brass rods missing"—he said, "Oh no; they are quite right, they are under the counter"—I went, and saw them under the counter—I told the prisoner and the officer all the fixtures were the property of Mr. Martyr—the rods were worth 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

On 20th July, I went to a house in Nelson-street, and there found the prisoner, and bought an old bedstead, and some blankets of him—when I came down, these brass rods were lying in the shop, and I said, "I see brass rods here; I want three brass rods like that; will you sell them?"—he said he did not care about selling them—I said I would give him a crown for them—he said, "No, I will not sell them; I am going to let the shop with the fixtures, and I will let them with it"—I said, "I think that will suit you a good deal better, and fetch a good deal better price as fixtures"—I then left—about nine in the evening, he came to my house, and said, "Well, what about these brass rods"—I said the price would not suit me—I afterwards bought them of him for 6s.—these are them(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they weigh 18lbs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Well Street, Hackney—about 12 o'clock p.m. on the 10th December, I was passing by the end of Full wood's Rents, Holborn, when I was <hi rend="italic">rounded on</hi> by nine or ten men and a woman—I was hustled down this court, and thrown on my back; the bundle I had in my hand</p>

               <p>was taken away, and my hands were trodden upon, some one held my feet, and several were round me searching my pockets—I do not know whether it was a man or woman—there were two sovereigns in my left trousers pocket, and in the right pocket there was a half-sovereign, a florin, a shilling, sixpence, and perhaps two or three halfpence—there was also a pocket-knife, dupli<lb></lb>cates, and several other things in my pocket, which were all taken away—some one had hold of my chin, keeping it up—I did not see Craddock or Williams there—the other four I did see, or else I am very much mistaken—I identify Burton, Mullins, Barnes and Painter—you must understand, when I got off the ground I was terrified—before I was knocked down I had a very good chance of seeing them—they were right under a lamp—I have a doubt about Mullins now—I fancy the man was stouter—after they had looked me over pretty well, a policeman came up, and they all ran away except one, who was taken into custody—I never saw Williams until I saw her at the Police Court.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E R</hi> 23). On the 10th December, I was on duty in Holborn—about 12 p.m. I heard a disturbance in Fullwood's Rents—I went down, and saw the prosecutor on his back, and all the prisoners, with two others, round him; some were searching him and some holding him down—Craddock was holding his legs, Mullins his left arm, and Burton was holding his handover his mouth, and feeling in his pocket—Barnes and Painter were on his legs, holding him down—Williams was on his left side, and had her hand in his trousers pocket—when they saw me they jumped up and all ran into "the kitchen," except Williams and Burton—I took Burton into custody, and Williams said "Don't take him, he has not got anything"—I said to the prosecutor "Do you intend to charge this man with robbing you?"—he said "Yes," and I took him to the station—I am quite positive about the identity of the middle lot—I have no doubt about Williams, I have known her for years—I had also known the other four—I am quite sure they are the four—there were two others that got away I have not seen since—after I had taken Burton to the station, I returned to the kitchen, with assistance, and found the other four prisoners there—when I took Burton, he said he had nothing to do with it—when I took the other four in the kitchen, Craddock said "I suppose it is that case of old Cox you want us for?" and he sung out "Bill, am I to go?"</p>

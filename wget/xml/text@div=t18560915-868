                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Cheeseman; I keep a fancy repository at Paddington. On 12th Aug. the prisoner came, about half past 12 o'clock—she looked at several toys, and then asked for a penny doll—I gave her one—she threw down a sixpence on the counter—I did not take it up at the time, but the moment she turned her hack I took it I up, and it was bad—I kept it in my hand, and went to the door to look for her, but she was gone—I wrapped the sixpence in a paper, and put on it, "Given to me the 12th of August"—I put it away, and no person knew that it was there, nor that I had taken it—on 28th Aug. the prisoner came again—she wanted a penny doll, and gave me another sixpence—I observed it was bad when she gave it me, and I told my niece to go for change, but she went for a constable, in consequence of what I had before said to her—the constable came, and took the prisoner—I gave him the two sixpences.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was not in the shop on 12th Aug.; it is not likely I should have waited above half an hour before the officer came. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> She did wait—when she was at the station she said she had given the doll which she bought on 12th Aug. to a child in the house—I recognized her on her entering the shop—I pretended to give the sixpence to my niece, but I did not; I kept it in my hand till the officer came—there were others of her party outside, from whom I had taken bad money before.</p>

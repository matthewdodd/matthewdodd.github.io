I am a messenger at 9, Mincing-lane—on the evening of 13th March I was at St. Dunstan's-hill—I saw the defendant Ernest there—he asked me to take a parcel to 20<hi rend="smallCaps">A</hi>, Pudding-lane, and be would pay me well if I took it—he said, "If anybody asks you where you came from, say from William Barber and Co., 14, Piccadilly"—I was to receive 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the parcel—he gave me a bill—this is the parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a box directed to "J. Williams, Bertolini and Co., 20A, Pudding-lane"—I took the parcel there and saw Mrs. Garton and Mr. Prentice—they offered me the money, but I would not take it—Mr. Prentice came with me to the Cow and Calf where Ernest had told me to meet him with the money—I did not find him there—I went up to my office, and on coming down St. Dunstan's-hill I saw Ernest again—he asked me if I had got the money—I said I had to go again in the evening for it—he told me to meet him again in half an hour in Mark-lane—I then went back again to Mr. Prentice—I afterwards went to Mark-lane und saw Ernest there—I said if he liked to come with me to Pudding-lane, I would get him the money—he said he did not like to go as he did not like to see his landlord—I then gave information to the police—I saw Plentz walking up and down Tower-street, opposite the Cow and Calf; he did not speak to me.</p>

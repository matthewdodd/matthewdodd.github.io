                  </hi>. I have a shoe manufactory in Crosby Row, Walworth, and a warehouse in the rear.

                  </hi>. On 12th Dec. I lived with my wife in a cottage in Old Bell Yard, "Westminster. The prisoner kept a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> there—he shared it with a man named Banbury—the Old Bell was at that time unoccupied—on 12th Dec., about 7 o'clock in the evening, Johnson came into the yard, and asked me to help harness his horse, as he was called up to go and do a job, and he must take his cart if the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> did not come—(Banbury had the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> out at that time)—I helped to harness the horse, and just as we had done, the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came in, and Johnson went away with it—he returned in about an hour, or an hour and a half, at, I should think, about half past 8 o'clock—I saw him come back—he had two sacks and a bundle on the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I gave him a light—he pushed the sacks off the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and put them into an empty room in one of the cottages, and fastened the door up with nails, and went away—I did not handle the bags then—about twenty minutes after, the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came in—I saw Watts and Hyde in the yard; they took the sacks out of the room, and put them into the Old Bell—I had the key of the Old Bell in my room, and Mr. Watts applied for it—Watts and Hyde went into the Old Bell, and came out, and locked the door—they took the key away, and asked me to take a bundle to Watts's house—about half an hour afterward I received a bundle from Watts, in a kind of old rag of a dirtyish colour, almost like a woman's shawl—I did not look inside it, but was able to tell from the feel that it contained boots or shoes—I took them to Mrs. Watts's—there was a hole in one of the bags which was removed by Watts and Hyde, through which I saw the sole of a new boot or shoe—the Bell is about twenty yards from the cottage—on the same evening I found these two pairs of boots (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) about three yards from where the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> unloaded—in carrying the boots from the cottage to the Bell they passed over that spot—it was a very dark night—I was convicted of a trifle about twelve or thirteen years ago; it was for a bit of pewter, a pewter pot, stealing it—no charge has been made against me since that—Banbury drove the <hi rend="italic">cabby</hi> day, and Johnson by night.</p>

Q.</hi> Do not you make a mistake when yon say that you have never been charged with anything since this affair of the pot? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not till I was stopped with these boots—I was nine weeks in prison on suspicion of stealing them—I told the truth before the Magistrate, and from the beginning—I told your friend that I had been convicted once of pot stealing—I was convicted of it twice; you knew that before, you asked me the last time—I was three months in prison each time—when I was living in this cottage I had been out of employment about eight weeks, but am not so now—I did not know who these boots belonged to, but when I found them I had a strong suspicion that there were boots in the bag—I told the pawnbroker at first that I bought them—he said that there were a lot of boots and shoes lost, and he suspected they were part of the property, and detained me—I was taken up on suspicion of stealing them—Hyde was tried here the Session before last, and another man, named Thompson; I do not know him—I was examined as a witness—I made the same state<lb></lb>ment that I have to-day, and the Jury acquitted Thompson and Hyde.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. We usually kept the key of the Old Bell—Croft came and got it on Friday night, 12th Dec., and brought it back on the Saturday night—in the course of the evening Johnson came to my door, and asked me for a light; I gave him one; he asked if my husband was at home—he was in the back yard, not in the cottage—it was between 6 and 7 o'clock—I heard the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> come back about half past 8 o'clock I think, but did not look out—after Johnson asked for a light, I did not see him again; I saw him next day and every day for a week following—Mr. Watts also came for a light on that night; there was some one with him, who I could not see—Watts went with the other person, and took the things from the empty cottage opposite, and I saw a person carrying a sack across into the Old Bell—next morning, about 10 o'clock, Watts and Hyde came down; Watts had a yellow handkerchief under his arm, and I saw the impression of a boot in it—they had to go a little below our door, and were 6 or 7 yards from me—they came again between 12 and 1 o'clock the same day, but they did not have anything—neither of them came to our cottage that day—on the Friday night I saw Watts give my husband a bundle—on the next Saturday I saw some persons in the yard, who I afterwards ascertained were police, and from that time I never saw Johnson in the yard till a week or two ago.</p>

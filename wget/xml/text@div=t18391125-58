                  </hi>. I am the wife of Alexander Mackay, a piano-forte<lb></lb>maker—he lives in Little Drummond-street, Euston-square—I got into an omnibus, to go to the Bank, between two and three o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon, on the 4th of November—when I got in I sat on the right-hand side, going down the New-road—I sat two from the door—the prisoner was in the omnibus when I got in—he made room for me to sit by his side—he sat the third on my right hand, on the same side—I wore my pocket on the side next to him—I had a shawl over my gown—after I had been in about two minutes I felt a touch at my pocket—I had some keys in my pocket—I felt them pressed against me—I was putting my hand to my pocket, when I felt a second touch, and the prisoner directly said to the conductor that he wanted to get out, and told him to stop—I found that my pocket had been picked, and I said "You have robbed me"—my money had been in a purse—the money was taken out, and the purse put back, and it was the putting it back that I felt—I had known it was safe not one minute before I got in—I have sometimes found the snap of the purse loose—there was in it one half-crown, six shillings, and one six-pence—I lost it all—I gave the prisoner into custody—when I detained him, another man with a cloak on, who had been sitting opposite the prisoner, left the omnibus—I was the last person that got in—I said I had lost 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at first, but when I counted it up, I had the odd halfpence of the sixpence in my pocket—I had 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. exactly, I am sure, when I got in—I had this money about me before I got in, and I had 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—one of the shillings I had was a new shilling—the prisoner was searched by an officer directly he was taken to the station-house, and the exact sum that I had in my purse was found in his waistcoat-pocket—one sixpence, one half-crown, and six shillings—the prisoner said, when I accused him of robbing me, he would rather give me all the money he had on him than be exposed—he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he had it—this is the money—I believe it to be the money I had—the bright shilling is among them.</p>

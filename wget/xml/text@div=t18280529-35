            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Bow-common-lane. Last Friday, in consequence of information from Holcroft's sister; I found the prisoner at Holcroft's - she desired me to apprehend him; I asked how he came by these sashes; he said he was ordered by a person to drive them in a horse and cart from the corner of Union-street to Holcroft's - that he drove them there, and returned to the man, and was to call next day at Holcroft's for half a crown, and he had come for it then; he said he did not know the man who had employed him, nor where he lived.</p>

            . I live at No. 27, Liverpool-street, Bishopsgate, at Holcroft's. Late on Thursday night the prisoner knocked at the door, and asked if Holcroft was at home - I said he would not be in till late, but he could see him at eight o'clock in the morning, or from eleven till two; I heard a cart driving, but did not see it- he came again on Friday, after one o'clock, and asked for Holcroft; the officer took him before he saw Holcroft; Mrs. Holcroft said."This is the man who came to our house last night with the sashes;" when he came at night he asked if I would give him leave to leave the sashes, and he did so.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday, between one and two o'clock, I went to Holcroft's with Duggan, and waited till the prisoner came; I asked if he had brought these sashes there; he said he had - that he was employed by a man the night before, at the end of Union-street, which is about four hundred yards from Holcroft's house; he said he did not know the man's name; I asked what he had come there for then - he then denied having brought the sashes; I found seventeen sashes there, which Duggan claimed as Jackson's.</p>

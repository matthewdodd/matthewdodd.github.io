             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Mr. Yates of Birmingham, as a clerk. I remember the defendant coming, in September, 1780, with a letter; it was about six in the evening: he enquired for Mr. Yates, who was not then in the way: he said, he wanted to see him in particular. Mr. Yates was sent for, and after a few minutes came. The defendant then delivered the letter to Mr. Yates himself. Mr. Yates took it into a room, and read it. When he returned again, the defendant requested an answer. Mr. Yates said he would give none; he had received similar letters before. Then the defendant pressed a second time for an answer. Mr. Yates then asked his name, which he declined telling; said it was of no signification; that he came to Birmingham, and had been desired to deliver that letter to him: he said Mr. Ford had particularly desired him to get an answer in writing. Mr. Yates said he would give no other answer than he had given before, which was none. He then went to the door with the defendant, and I followed them. I was as near to the defendant, when the conversation passed in the warehouse, as him now the door at which they went out, was not farther from me than the door of the Sessions-house is now. I passed them on the landing, and went down the stairs before them; but they were not more than three steps after me. When we came to the bottom of the stairs, the defendant turned to the right-hand, and I to the left: he appeared going away; but I saw no more of him, nor of my master. What I have related, was the whole of the conversation that passed between Mr. Yates and the defendant. I did not hear him speak any such words as Stanton swore he did, nor any words to that effect: if he had, I must have heard it, in the situation in which I was. I met Mr. Whitworth at the bottom of the stairs: I returned again to the warehouse in about five minutes. I never saw the defendant at my master's since. Timmings and Hamper were present at the time of this conversation.</p>
               <p>Upon his cross-examination, he said, That when the defendant came, he was writing at the desk: he said that the warehouse was not quite so long as the court; that when Mr. Yates came in, he (the witness) resumed his business at the desk; that the conversation was so loud, he could not help hearing it; and that he heard, he believed, every syllable that passed; that there was nothing said in the passage by either of them; that he did not recollect any thing passing between Mr. Whitworth and him about the letter; that Mr. Whitworth and Mr. Yates were reading the letter together when he came into the warehouse; that he listened, because the defendant mentioned the name of Ford; and that, knowing the dispute that subsisted between his master and Mr. Ford, he quitted his business to listen. At first, the witness said he did not recollect what he went down stairs for: afterwards he said he went about the business he was engaged in at the desk, which he could not do till he knew whether the things were finished they were at work upon; that he did not know which of the shops that work was carrying on in.</p>
               <p>- TIMMINGS sworn.</p>
               <p>I remember the defendant bringing a letter. I was not in the warehouse when he first came in. I came in before Mr. Yates came in. The defendant gave Mr. Yates the letter. Mr. Yates went into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178205150043"></xptr> room, and read it. When Mr. Yates came back, he told the defendant, that he had received, before, two or three letters similar, and should give the same answer, which was none at all. The defendant desired he would give an answer in writing. Mr. Yates asked his name: the defendant said it was of no signification; and Mr. Yates said, a second time, he should give no answer. Then the defendant left the warehouse. I was about four yards from the place where they stood conversing together. I did not hear the words charged in the indictment: if they had passed, I must have heard them.</p>
               <p>Were Richards and Stanton conversing about the letter when you came in? - I cannot tell. As soon as Mr. Yates said he would give no answer, the defendant Stanton went out; and Mr. Yates went out about two or three minutes after him, and followed him close: he was not a yard distance from him.</p>
               <p>You said Mr. Yates went out two or three minutes after the defendant, and that he was not a yard distance from him. How do you account for it, that the going of a yard could take up two or three minutes? - I was mistaken as to the time; he went out immediately after him, one directly after the other. Mr. Yates followed him out of my sight: I cannot tell where he went when he went out. What passed, or whether any thing passed, between Stanton and Mr. Yates, when they went out, I do not know. Mr. Yates was out about two or three minutes: then Mr. Whitworth and Mr. Yates came in together. Richards and the other clerk were employed at the desk. I did not continue long in the warehouse; I believe Richards went out before me. When I returned, Mr. Yates, Mr. Whitworth, Richards and Hamper, were in the warehouse. Mr. Whitworth had a letter in his hand. I do not remember taking notice of any words that passed then; I was about four or five yards off.</p>

No such words passed as those mentioned in the indictment; if there had, I should have heard them. When Mr. Whitworth and Mr. Yates came back, the letter was read. Stanton's first address was to me. Richards went down, and staid while the letter was reading. The subject matter of the dispute between Mr. Yates and Mr. Ford was concerning some bills and cash which had been sent to London. It was supposed by Mr. Yates, that Mr. Ford had received them, and refused to acknowledge the receipt. There was the name

               <p>I live at Birmingham. About the 10th or 12th of September, 1780, I went to Mr. Yates with a letter from Mr. Ford. Mr. Yates said, he did not believe the contents of the letter; but I really don't recollect what else he said.</p>
               <p>(Upon his cross-examination the witness said, that some time previous to this application to Mr. Yates, Mr. Ford had entertained a suspicion that some person or persons then in Newgate had stolen Mr. Yates's box with its contents.)</p>

               <p>Did he come to the door also? - No, he was withinside the house, and when we stood at the door, Mrs. Angus, and her sister, Mr. Davis presented the piece and pulled the trigger, he presented it strait across.</p>
               <p>Court. Then if it had been fired at that time, it must have taken a direction over your heads? - I do not think it would have touched us.</p>
               <p>Did the gun go off when he pulled the trigger? - It did not, he pulled the trigger twice, then he dropped the gun down on the floor by the side of him.</p>
               <p>You being on the ground floor, and he in the one pair of stairs room, can you say what he did? - I saw him very plain, he then went to the other side of the room, and picked up another gun.</p>

               <p>Then that gun was presented in a different direction than the first? - I cannot say it was pointed the same as the first, it was pointed straight, but it came so quick, that I could not tell whether it was a pistol or a gun.</p>
               <p>What did you observe next? - While we stood at the door, the gentlewoman of the house was frightened, and at the same time, Mr. Thomas came up to us, and spoke to us, he is the beadle of the night, and Mrs. Angus said to him, there is nobody here but this young man, and my lodgers.</p>
               <p>What did the beadle say? - He spoke to Mrs. Angus, and she said there is nobody here but those that belong to the house, as soon as Mr. Thomas went away, Mr. Davis fetched up the piece that he had had in his hand before, and that did not go off, and then I said to Mrs. Angus, Mr. Davis has got another piece in his hand, and before I could speak the words out of my mouth, he presented the piece, and point-it to the persons at the door.</p>
               <p>Was that piece presented the same as the former? - It was presented in a line to me, when he presented the piece to me, it was not cocked, and while he was cocking the piece, I took one motion, a platoon exercise, to my left hand, then the gun went off, and this

               <p>(The shot shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>You attended the deceased? - I did; when I went to see him, it was about a quarter before twelve, he was then laying on the floor about a yard from the door, I desired them to raise him up, and I examined the body; the prisoner Mr. Davis stood at my left hand, and observed to me, that there was no charge in the gun, to which I remarked, there appeared to have been some, for on removing his cloaths there were nothing but shot holes about his breast, the body was perfectly cold at that time, there was no pulsation in his heart, I ordered my assistant to endeavour to draw some blood from him, but he would not bleed; I had not the least idea of his bleeding, but merely for form sake more than from any expectation of his bleeding; I endeavoured to put some brandy down his threat, in order to stimulate the constitution, but there was no swallowing, there was not the least sensibility remaining, he was dead to all intents and purposes, he barely breathed and continued so to do, till six in the morning, I staid with him an hour; upon removing the breast bone, I observed the shot had penetrated the heart in several places, in diagonal lines, a great quantity of blood having extravasated the cavity of the breast, in short they passed right through the heart, and lodged somewhere in the back, the shot I have produced in Court, were the shot I took from about the heart and lungs, and there is not a doubt, I believe, remaining, but they were the cause of his death.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Upon the prisoner's telling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220068"></xptr> you there was no charge in the gun, I do not know whether you went over to his room and found that the charge had been drawn? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Had any number of robberies been committed in that neighbourhood, that required guns to be charged and kept in readiness in case of attacks? - On the Saturday morning before the murder on the 28th, the house was robbed where this murder was done.</p>
               <p>So that the keeping a number of guns charged for preservation against thieves, was a necessary precaution? - Not to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>I was present at the time of this accident, I stood at my own door.</p>

               <p>Had you made any observations about the prisoner or his house before that accident? - I had seen him at the window, I saw him with either a gun or a pistol, I really am not sure which.</p>
               <p>When you stood at the door, who was in your company? - The deceased was on the left side of me, and Clifton was there, he had bid me a good night.</p>
               <p>Was your sister with you? - I cannot say, she says she was, but there was another woman on the other side, that I have not seen since the next day, she went away, her name is

            ; I was in the middle, and this woman was on the off side, and the deceased was on the left side.</p>
               <p>Was it before the report of that gun, that the man was killed, or the former? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Was you present at the time, that the man received the wound? - I did not see him fall, I was close alongside of him, I might as well have been killed, and the woman and the gentleman that is at the door now.</p>
               <p>Was there any quarrel or enmity subsisting between you and the prisoner? - No, Sir, none.</p>
               <p>You lived in harmony and friendship? - Always, Sir, I immediately called out, and said, O dear! what have you done, you have killed a man, and he immediately came over to my house.</p>
               <p>When he came there what was his behaviour? - He took up the man's head, and said O dear! what have I done! I have killed a man that never gave me any offence; O what would I give, a hundred pounds, two hundred pounds, nay a thousand pounds; O dear, fetch a doctor, spare no expences; Mr. Thomas, the beadle of the parish, he came and fetched the doctor, it was not altogether above a minute and an half from the beginning of the accident, then they put me into my own back room, and the deceased was put on a chair, he lived many hours after, I went to lay down being satigued, the prisoner attended the deceased all night, and was very melancholy, and was sorry for what he had done, and said, he could not give that back which he had taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The prisoner did not seem to be a man that had an intention to take away the life of this man? - No, Sir, I saw him in the morning about eleven, at a house that he uses, and I believe, he was not out of his shop all day, besides I never saw him ill treat any person, I did not know of any ill will between him and Clifton.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted you was so taken up with the accident that you did not go over to Davis's house, to see if he had drawn out the shot of the piece? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived opposite to Davis? - I have been in the house nine years, I am a tenant to him, he is a most harmless inoffensive man, bore no enmity to any body, very ready to serve, and very backward to do unkindness; my house had been lately robbed, that called me to the door, to talk to Mr. Thomas, my house had been broke open, and they had stripped me of all they could find, the neighbours have kept firing every night since Mr. Davis has been in trouble, for we are not safe in our beds.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether this poor man had his shoes on when he came, or was in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220069"></xptr> a state preparing to go to bed? - I did not observe, he came over directly when he was called.</p>

               <p>Had he any fire arms in his hands? - I cannot say, I saw he had something, but I did not know what it was, I returned to the fire place, and directly I heard the report of a gun.</p>

               <p>After this did you see the prisoner? - He came over in his stocking feet, and took hold of the deceased, and lifted him up from the ground.</p>

               <p>About half after eleven, I heard the report of a gun, I saw the flash, I and the officer of the night were going by, I saw Mrs. Angus at the door, and some other persons with her, I cannot tell who, I spoke to her, I said it is almost time for you to go in doors and shut up your house, and she replied directly that she had been robbed the Saturday before, I asked her of what, and she said some brass candlesticks, and different things what they could catch off the mantle piece, and I told her I was sorry for it, and then I wished her a good night; a little time after, when I got about twelve or fifteen yards from the house, I heard the report of a gun or a pistol, I did not return immediately upon hearing the report, I went a few steps further, and then I heard a cry out Thomas, Thomas, murder, murder! that brought me back to the house, and there I saw the deceased laying on the floor; in the interim of time, Mr. Davis came in, and he exclaimed and lifted up his hands and said, what have I done? and he desired somebody to go for a doctor; and I asked him if I should go, and he said yes, and I said where shall I go, and he said go to Dr. Glouster, and there were two women knocked at the door, and I knocked, and he looked out of the window, and I told him to come directly, for there was a murder done in the lane, and he said he would not come; I then went to Mr. Horsefall, and he came directly, I came back with Mr. Horsefall, and he looked at the man and told us to lift him up on a chair, and I stood alongside of the man and he tried to draw blood, the prisoner was walking about the room all the time and wringing his hands, and expressed great concern.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing further? - Only the doctor gave him what relief he thought proper, he poured some brandy down his throat, then I carried him to bed, after I had put the man to bed, I said Davis, how came you to do such a thing, says he, God knows Thomas, I thought I had drawn the charge, the charge lays over the way now, if you will come and see it; and I spoke to the officer of the night, and I said is it not better to take Davis into custody, and he said gentlemen I am here do any thing with me you please, I will go with you any where; and he offered to surrender himself directly, so we went our rounds and returned again, and he said he would surrender in the morning, and I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You had no idea he would run away? - No, I had not, if I had thought so I would have taken him.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220070"></xptr>Do you know whether he had his shoes on? - I did not go over about the charge, Elby was not there, Stratford was there, he is in a dying state, and his wife and child; there are plenty of thieves and whores too in Gravel Lane, there had lately been a robbery in the prisoner's own house, he told me they had taken some lead, he told me that night he was going to have a private watch; I have been a beadle for three years, I never knew any harm of the prisoner in my life.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, I beg leave to quote a case as similar to this, which Mr. Justice Foster recites, fol. 263, and is reported by Keeling,</p>
               <p>"which, (he says) I</p>
               <p>"think an extreme hard case and of very</p>
               <p>"extensive influence; a man found a pistol</p>
               <p>"in the street, which he had reason to believe</p>
               <p>"was not loaded, having tried it with</p>
               <p>"the rammer; he carried it home, and</p>
               <p>"shewed it to his wife, and she sitting by</p>
               <p>"him, he pulled up the cock, and touched</p>
               <p>"the trigger, the pistol went off, and killed</p>
               <p>"the woman; this was ruled manslaughter.</p>
               <p>"It appeared that the learned editor was</p>
               <p>"not satisfied with the judgment; it is one</p>
               <p>"of the points he in the preface to the report</p>
               <p>"recommends to further consideration;</p>
               <p>"admitting that the judgment was strictly</p>
               <p>"legal, it was to say no better of it summum</p>
               <p>"jus. I cannot help saying, that the rule</p>
               <p>"of law I have been considering in this</p>
               <p>"place touching the consequences of taking</p>
               <p>"or not taking due precaution, does not</p>
               <p>"seem to be sufficiently tempered with</p>
               <p>"mercy; manslaughter was formerly a capital</p>
               <p>"offence, as I shall hereafter shew,</p>
               <p>"and even the forseiture of goods and chattels</p>
               <p>"upon the foot of the present law is a</p>
               <p>"heavy stroke upon a man, guilty 'tis true</p>
               <p>"of heedless incautious conduct, but in</p>
               <p>"other respects perfectly innocent; therefore</p>
               <p>"where the rigor of law bordereth</p>
               <p>"upon injustice, mercy should, if possible,</p>
               <p>"interpose in the administration. It is</p>
               <p>"not the part of Judges to be perpetually</p>
               <p>"hunting after forfeitures, where the heart</p>
               <p>"is free from guilt; they are ministers appointed</p>
               <p>"by the Crown for the ends of</p>
               <p>"public justice, and should have written</p>
               <p>"upon their hearts that solemn engagement</p>
               <p>"his Majesty is under, to cause law and</p>
               <p>"justice in mercy to be executed in all his</p>
               <p>"judgments. This I have said upon a</p>
               <p>"supposition that the judgment reported</p>
               <p>"by Keeling was strictly legal; I think it</p>
               <p>"was not, for the law in these cases does</p>
               <p>"not require the utmost caution that can</p>
               <p>"be used; it is sufficient that a reasonable</p>
               <p>"precaution, what is usual and ordinary in</p>
               <p>"the like cases, be taken: the man in the</p>
               <p>"case under consideration examined the</p>
               <p>"pistol in the common way, perhaps the</p>
               <p>"rammer which he had before tried was</p>
               <p>"too short, and deceived him, but having</p>
               <p>"used the ordinary caution found to have</p>
               <p>"been effectual in the like cases, he ought</p>
               <p>"to have been excused. I have been the</p>
               <p>"longer on this case, because accidents of</p>
               <p>"the most lamentable kind may be the case</p>
               <p>"of the wisest and the best of mankind,</p>
               <p>"and most commonly fall amongst the</p>
               <p>"nearest friends and relations; and in such</p>
               <p>"a case, the forfeiture of goods rigorously</p>
               <p>"exacted, would be heaping affliction upon</p>
               <p>"the head of the afflicted, and galling a</p>
               <p>"heart already wounded past cure; it would</p>
               <p>"even aggravate the loss of a brother, a</p>
               <p>"parent, a child, or wife, if such a loss under</p>
               <p>"such circumstances is capable of aggravation.</p>
               <p>"I once upon the circuit tried</p>
               <p>"a man for the death of his wife by the</p>
               <p>"like accident: Upon Sunday morning,</p>
               <p>"the man and his wife went a mile or two</p>
               <p>"from home with some neighbours to take</p>
               <p>"a dinner at the house of their common</p>
               <p>"friend; he carried his gun with him,</p>
               <p>"hoping to meet with some diversion by</p>
               <p>"the way, but before he went to dinner,</p>
               <p>"he discharged it, and set it up in a private</p>
               <p>"place in his friend's house; after</p>
               <p>"dinner he went to church, and in the</p>
               <p>"evening returned home with his wife and</p>
               <p>"neighbours, bringing his gun with him.</p>
               <p>"which was carried into the room where</p>
               <p>"his wife was, she having brought it part<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220071"></xptr> " of the way; he taking it up, touched</p>
               <p>"the trigger, and the gun went off and</p>
               <p>"killed his wife, whom he dearly loved.</p>
               <p>"It came out in evidence, that whilst the</p>
               <p>"man was at church, a person belonging</p>
               <p>"to the family privately took the gun,</p>
               <p>"charged it, and went after some game,</p>
               <p>"but before the service at church was ended,</p>
               <p>"returned it loaded to the place from</p>
               <p>"whence he took it, and where the defendant,</p>
               <p>"who was ignorant of all that</p>
               <p>"passed, found it to all appearance as he</p>
               <p>"left it. I did not enquire whether the</p>
               <p>"poor man had examined the gun before</p>
               <p>"he carried it home, but being of opinion</p>
               <p>"upon the whole evidence, that he had</p>
               <p>"reasonable grounds to believe that it was</p>
               <p>"not loaded, I directed the jury that if</p>
               <p>"they were of the same opinion, they should</p>
               <p>"acquit him, and he was acquitted."</p>
               <p>Court. If the jury are of opinion upon this evidence that the prisoner had an enmity to Clifton, and meant to kill Clifton, whereas he killed the other, I have no doubt but it is murder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. If you observe, he tries the gun twice, and then lays the gun down, and fetches the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. This was the gun that would not go off the first time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I am on the same side with my learned friend Mr. Silvester, and I hope you will forgive my saying a few words in addition to what he has said: I do not conceive that my duty necessarily calls upon me to say a word, because I am sure I should do injury to the impression which the discourse of the learned judge which he has just read must necessarily make on the minds of the jury. I conceive the argument goes the full length of asking the Court for an acquittal; I had not the smallest conception that there was any thing in this case that could in any view of it in which it could be put, put the prisoner into the peril of being convicted of murder. I know if there was a strong and conscientious doubt whether the prisoner, intending to commit one illegal act, committed another, which was not in his contemplation, that that in the eye of the law would be murder; but is that at all like this, or rather is not this exactly like the case stated in Keeling: it is manifest that the prisoner's object was not to attack the peaceful subjects of the kingdom, but to give notice to those that had already assaulted his peaceful dwelling, and it is in evidence by the beadle of the parish, that he had been driven to the necessity of appointing a private watch, and in the interim this man becomes his own watchman, which he had authority to do, in the doing of which he was committing no crime, he was committing no offence against the peace of the kingdom, and he discharges his firelock, either to try it, or to give notice to those that were lurking thereabouts; this it appears was the prisoner's intention; and that his first piece was discharged without any thing that could do mischief is manifest on the face of the evidence; for Clifton has told you, that the piece was fired off from a window of Davis's against the window opposite, and no accident happened; but then it may be said, he afterwards tried another. My Lord, if it is lawful to have one instrument, God knows the miserable state of society would very well justify him in having another to Mr. Davis discharged one piece, which he found sit for his purpose, and he attempts to discharge another; it does not go off; he then tries a second piece which had once missed fire, he discharged it in the same situation, then this melancholy accident happened; and what is the conduct of Mr. Davis as soon as it did happen? is it the conduct of a guilty man? Is it the conduct of a man that meant to shoot Mr. Clifton? Is it like the conduct of a man that meant to commit an offence against any moral duty? Why, he goes over with as much anxiety as any of your Lordships would have felt to rescue a man, who by accident in the sport of the field you had been the occasion of killing; he stays at the house all night; he offers to surrender himself to public justice; those to whom he surrendered, did not refuse to take his word, they were the jurors on the occasion; they came to him in the distance of three hours, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220072"></xptr> they again refuse his solicitation to be taken into custody; he continues there still till all the world are awake, and then he goes and surrenders himself into the hands of public justice. My Lord, take it upon the evidence of Clifton himself, this man had had a little quarrel with him; why, he is the best judge whether it was almalice of such an extent as might provoke the very worst man in society to follow it up with a murder; Clifton says it was a trifling quarrel about half a pot of beer: your Lordship asked him,</p>
               <p>"Whether the quarrel was of</p>
               <p>"such a nature, or had proceeded to such</p>
               <p>"a heighth, that you had any reason to apprehend</p>
               <p>"that he sought your life?" - He says,</p>
               <p>"No, I cannot say I had."</p>
               <p>"Had</p>
               <p>"he made use of any expressions indicating</p>
               <p>"malice towards you?" your Lordship also asked, to which he replied,</p>
               <p>"No, not in</p>
               <p>"the least." Then, my Lord, let us see whether this is not precisely in point with the case in Keeling; in that case an accident happened, not with small sparrow shot like this, which pierces the heart and breaks some of the blood vessels, otherwise there is not another part of the human body in which it could possibly have produced death; this man draws the charge, he shakes out the shot in order to discharge his piece to give the alarm; some few shot still continue in the piece, without his knowledge. You may say, by his neglect death has ensued; I lament it, and so does the prisoner: All I ask is, that neither his life nor liberty shall be in jeopardy. I know that English Judges and juries do feel the force of the maxim, that judgment should be tempered with mercy; I know that juries rather prefer to find a man innocent than guilty, then I am sure they will very gladly coincide with Mr. Justice Foster, that it is a very hard law, because a man has not examined his piece with that scrupulousness which he ought, that therefore he is to be put in peril of being convicted of murder, and that at least he must be convicted of manslaughter. Your Lordships may have heard of a case at the proof of cannon at Woolwich; a man was found dead, he was at a great distance from the proof, upon examination of the body a pin's head was found to have entered into the heart of the man, a pin's head which had been in the cartridge; now would any body say, that if by accident a pin's head had found its way into this piece, which he had charged only with gunpowder, and that pin had found its way into the heart of the deceased, and therefore because he had not examined that charge, with that scrupulous nicety, that he should be put in peril of his life, or that any Jury should convict him even of manslaughter? My Lords, for these reasons which I have had the honour of submitting to your Lordships; I take the liberty with great deference to your Lordships, but with great confidence in the case, to submit that he ought not to be put in peril, but if there is any doubt on the case, thank God, we are prepared with that sort of proof, that will amply convince the Jury of the innocence of the prisoner at the bar!</p>
               <p>Court. Then I desire you will enter into that proof, for I am sure there is no proof of it yet: let either Clifton or Mrs. Angus stand up.</p>
               <p>Court to Clifton. What is the distance between the prisoner's one pair of stairs window, and the door of the house where you stood? - Twelve yards.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live almost opposite to this house.</p>
               <p>Is it usual to fire off their pieces in the evening? - It is, I have been robbed myself, in July last, and I discharge my piece twice or three times frequently in the course of a week: in the evening of the day after this accident, there was a mob collected round the door in the evening, and nobody there but a young person in the shop, a woman, I went over to desire the shop might be shut up to keep the mob out, then one of the officers from Shadwell came in, I went up with him, and took the candle, and a little girl went up with me, and I desired her to pick up the shot, which she did, and it is here; she picked up as much, I believe, as half the bowl of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220073"></xptr> a tobacco pipe would contain, and there were two black marks which appeared to be circular, as if by the muzzle of the piece against the floor in order as I thought to knock out the shot.</p>

               <p>What sort of shot were they? - Four, I believe,</p>
               <p>They were not twos, were they? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did you make any observation about any thing else? - No, when my house was broke open and robbed, I sent to Davis, I was without fire arms, and desired him to lend me one of those pieces, which he did, I charged it to defend my property, when I came to draw it, there was no screw to the ram rod, I got a screw made to it, and afterwards when Mr. Davis wanted a gun I sent it home with the new ram rod to it, and the new ram rod was much shorter than the old one.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Davis? - These four years.</p>
               <p>What is his character for humanity and temper? - I look upon him to be a jocose sociable man, I have rather seen him put up with insults rather than return them.</p>
               <p>Jury to Allen. How many guns were fired that night did it appear? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. How many guns did you see in the room of the prisoner, at the time you went up? - No more than one, and that gun the officer took away from Mr. Davis's room that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Gould. The surgeon says, he saw a good many shot holes, and he says he reckons there might be about thirty, now you see across this street the shot cannot spread much, now supposing these thirty might remain: I suppose the whole charge of such small shot as that would contain at least two hundred.</p>
               <p>Foreman of the Jury. Aye, four or five hundred of this shot, I am sure there must be in a moderate charge.</p>

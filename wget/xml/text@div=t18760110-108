                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi>). On 8th December, about 4.15, I saw the prisoner in Lombard Street—I watched and followed him—I saw him go through Pope's Head Court, up Cornhill, into St. Michaels' Alley—he remained there about twenty minutes looking at different shop windows—he then went into Cornhill again and went into Mr. Thorburn's—I watched him through the window—I saw him speak to the assistant, who turned and went to the other end of the shop—the prisoner then put his right hand into the tray on the counter, took something and put it into his right-hand trousers' pocket—the assistant brought some paper to him; he took up a sheet of it, passed some remark, and walked out—he did not buy anything—I followed him up Cornhill and several streets, he went into a hosier's in Fenchurch Street and looked at some black kid gloves—when he came out I said to him "I am going to take you into custody for stealing something from the shop in Cornhill"—he said "All right"—I took him to the station—in going along Rood Lane he got his right hand into his trousers pocket—I caught hold of his arm; he drew his hand from his pocket; I clenched his fist and wished him to open it; he refused—with the assistance of another officer I forced him into No. 3, Rood Lane, and by wringing his wrist this pencil case dropped from his hand—I searched him—I found no money on him, only a knife, two postage stamps, and this alluminium gold chain—I went to Mr. Thorburn's, and on the counter just where prisoner stood I saw a tray containing alluminium pencil cases similar to this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Ralph Thorburn, of 33, Cornhill, a bookseller and stationer—on the evening of 8th December the prisoner came in and asked for some cartridge paper—I went to get it from the end of the shop—there was a tray on the counter containing alluminium pencils—when I came back with the paper he took hold of it and said it was very thin, like tissue paper that he wanted—I told him where he might get it—he apologised for the trouble he had given me and went out—about half an hour after Inward came in with the pencil case; it is similar to those we had in the tray and is worth about 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

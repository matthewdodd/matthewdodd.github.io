                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. William Nicholls, a pawnbroker, of Gray's-inn-lane. On the 27th of August, at half-past eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner came there—he asked to look at a plough and plane-irons—he purchased nothing—I observed him take them away, but I did not know that they were not his, as they had been shown him by another young man—there is my master's private mark on them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I saw this plough hanging up—I asked Henry the price—he told me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he reached it down—I said I would call on Saturday—when I had got my wages I called in to see if the plough was gone—I looked at it, and tried to buy it for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he could not let me have it for that—I took out three half-crowns, and put them on the counter—whether Henry took them up, or any body else, I cannot tell—I live within three doors of the place, and pass every time to my meals. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I can swear there was no money produced for the plane—I had a full view of the shop from the parlour, where I stood—the plough man is not here.</p>

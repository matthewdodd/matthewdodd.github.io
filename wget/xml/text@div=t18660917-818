                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, of 89, Nape Street, Bethnal Green—on 15th August, nigh one o'clock, I was going home through Fins-bury Square—I met the female prisoner—she asked me to treat her, and I refused—she said, "Will you give me a glass of ale?"—I put my hand to my pocket and pulled out a penny—she refused it and said, "Will yon give me sixpence?"—whilst putting my hand to my pocket again I was seized by a man behind—he put his hand across my shoulder and almost strangled me—in the meantime the female prisoner tore my trousers and my pockets, and took all my money, about 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., among which was a halfpenny, which I recognise—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am quite sure the prisoner is the person—I had an opportunity of seeing her by the gas-light—a second man came up in front of me and tore my waistcoat open and my shirt—he found nothing, and then punched me in the face and cut my hand—at that time I was losing consciousness, and one of the men, who has since died, said, "Now let him have it," and the one behind threw me on my head and cut it—for a short time I was insensible, and when I got up I saw the prisoner and a man along the road—I picked up my hat and a bag of pigeons which I had, and went after them—I met two constables, told them what occurred, and pointed some people out to them—I was sober at the time.</p>

The prosecutor came up to me in Finsbury Market, with his hat in his hand, his coat torn, and his waistcoat open, and bleeding from the head—he said he had lost sight of the people who had attacked him, but they were coming in that direction—I said, "Silence"—we stood still for a moment, and out a man came from the passage—I said, "Is that one?"—he had scarcely time to speak before out came the other one with a hat on, and the woman with a white hat on—I took the man Simmons, who afterwards died—I knew him by the name of <hi rend="italic">Cockney Bill</hi>—directly he saw the woman taken into custody by the other constable he appeared to get very shaky, and he died directly he got to the station—the prosecutor identified them both then.</p>

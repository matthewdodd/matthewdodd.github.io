                  </hi>. I am barman at the Queen Catherine public-house—on Thursday, 18th October, the prisoners came in together—Dooley called for a pot of beer, and Leary paid me with a bad shilling—I gave it her back, and Dooley then paid with a good sixpence; I gave her twopence change—they remained a few minutes and drank the beer, and shortly after Leary called for another pot, and she gave me another shilling or the same one I can't tell which—it was bad—I said, "It is no good trying to get rid of I them here"—I kept possession of that shilling, and Leary paid for the beer with coppers—I saw something pass from Dooley to Leary, and I saw Leary I pull a small tin box from her bosom, and take the lid off and shake the box—I could see there were some shillings in it, and I heard Dooley say to Leary, "Go and try to ged rid of them at some other shop"—Leary put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a spoon, and said, "How do you like this; will I this do"—Dooley said, "Go on, not so much of your Irish <hi rend="italic">blarney</hi>"—Leary said, "Go on, what am I to do, have I not got rid of so many to-day," and I heard the word thirty-five—this conversation took place in the bar—I was wiping the counter, but I heard what they said—Leary went outside—I went out and saw a constable and spoke to him, and from what he said I went back to the bar, and while I was there another constable came in; Dooley was still at the bar, and the constable asked me in her presence if there had been anybody in the house trying to pass bad money—I told him, yes, there had; and he said, "Who are they?—I pointed to Dooley, who was standing there, as one, and I said the other was outside—I gave the second shilling to the constable, and then I went outside after Leary, and the first con<lb></lb>stable I had spoken to, took Leary in custody—both the prisoners were taken to the station, and on the way two shillings dropped from Leary and a piece of paper—the shillings rolled on the pavement and they were picked up by Harris.</p>

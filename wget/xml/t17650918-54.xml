             said, we were not company for sweeps (the prisoner is a chimney-sweeper); she turn'd him out of the box: he went out of the house for about ten minutes, and brought in one Armstrong: I said to Armstrong, Are you come here to see my husband kill'd and murder'd? his answer was, he would not see his brother hurt. Bradley was coming into the box where my husband was; I ran against him, and said, What have you to do with my husband? he said, You whore, what have you to do with me? then I gave him a blow on the side of his face, and pu t him up against the chimney: he struck me on the eye, and after that several blows; I screamed out; my husband said, Will I see the mother of my child or my wife murder'd, without taking her part? he came to Bradley, and ask'd him what right he had to strike the woman Bradley said he would strike him; they both struck one another in the house; then they both went out into the street; there Bradley said several times, Clear the way; here goes new to break his neck; they had several blows; my husband fell in the kennel several times; Bradley had no falls; he is a fighting man; he fights for money. My husband's head was shaved afterwards; his head had three cuts on the left side, and one of his ribs was broke under his right breast: he walked home, and two days after he went to the Infirmary; they ask'd him there how he came by his hurt; he said he fell down, fearing they would not take him in if he said he got it by fighting: I saw him on the Friday before he died.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any other disorder upon him?</p>
               <p>M. Bradley. No, he had not: he had a fever in the hospital, as they told me: it is my opinion the blows were the occasion of his death.</p>
               <p>Catharine Welch gave the same evidence with the prosecutrix of what passed in the public house.

               <p>Patrick Welch, husband to Catharine, confirmed the account the prosecutrix and his wife had given of what happened within the house; but said, what happened without, he could not tell: he never saw Barry afterwards.</p>
               <p>Mr. Goldwyre. I am house-surgeon in the Middlesex hospital: I believe the deceased came to the hospital the 20th of August, on a Tuesday; I did not see him that day; I first saw his wounds on the Wednesday; the wounds were so trifling, he was not thought an object to be taken into the house; he had a large cut on his head, which I imagined might be by a fall against the stones; he complained of nothing else then: he concealed the true cause of his wound; he said he had a fall from a scaffold three story high: I never saw but one wound, and did not observe that to be dangerous in the least; he was taken in after he came to be dress'd two or three times. At first the wound went on very well; but after three or four days, it had not so good an appearance; then we thought proper to take him into the hospital. After he was in, the wound mended again, and he grew better, and walked about in the ward with other patients, and was in a very good way: there was a change about four or five days before his death; he had contracted a fever in the house, which is a very common case, which may be by the foulness of the air in the house: his wound at that time had not a bad appearance: he died in the hospital, but I have no reason to believe his death was occasioned by the wound. Two or three days before his death, he complained of an uneasiness in his breast; there was discovered to be a broken rib; but that I do not believe to be the occasion of his death: we impute his death to the fever; we did not believe there was any material injury.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body opened afterwards?</p>
               <p>Goldwyre. No, it was not.</p>

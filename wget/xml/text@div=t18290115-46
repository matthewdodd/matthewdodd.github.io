On the 4th of October last, the prisoner, and a man named Samuel Lee, came to my house - two neighbours brought them into my yard, and asked me if I had any pigs to part with; I agreed to sell them seven pigs for 16l. 12s. 6d. - they were to be paid for and delivered the same day; I was to receive the money, when they were delivered, at White's place, in Leather-lane, Holborn - the prisoner and Lee agreed to pay for them on delivery in Leather-lane; I, and my boy took them in a cart the same day - we put them up a gateway just below White's door - I left the boy with the cart, to take care of them, while I went to receive the money; I saw both White and Lee in the house - it was a very wet day; I sat down some time, and had some refreshment - some time passed, and Lee went out with White's son; we had some bread and cheese and porter - Lee went out, with White's son; my boy, Mack, came to me, and told me, in the prisoner's presence, that Lee had told him the pigs were settled for - they had not offered me a farthing in payment; I stopped there till Lee came in, which was in about half an hour - he did not say what had become of the pigs; Lee said, in the prisoner's presence, "I have got nothing but a 50l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182901150022"></xptr>cheque (putting his hand into his left-hand pocket), if you can give me change?" White went over to the public-house to see if he could get change, as he said, but he did not take it with him - Lee did not give it to him; he came in again, and said he could not get change; White sat down and said, "We must draw up a bill," and sent his eldest daughter out for a stamp, and drew out the bill: I did not at that time know the pigs were gone - my only reason for selling the pigs was to settle with my landlord for my quarter's rent; I told him so, that money I must have, and I could not go out of the house without it.</p>

               <p>Q. Then when your boy came in, he did not tell you the pigs were gone? A. No, not till after the bill was drawn; the officer has got it - this is it (looking at it); White wrote it - Lee could not write, but put his mark to it, and made me put my mark to it.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you received that bill. tell us what took place? A. My only object was to receive the money for my rent; I objected to take the note, for I wanted money, but at last took it, as I thought I had better take it, as I could get no money; I was to have been paid by one o'clock on Monday - I did not know the pigs were gone till Lee came in and began talking about payment; I then knew they were gone - the bill was not paid; I have not received a farthing: the pigs were worth what I sold them for; after I knew they were gone Lee gave me a sovereign as a deposit, and said that was all he had - I could not see the cart the pigs were in, in the room I sat; it was just beyond the gateway - Lee left the prisoner in the room when he went out; he was talking to me about one thing or another - I was not willing to part with my pigs without ready money, for they were my whole dependence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had you known Lee? A. I never saw either of them before - the bargain was made openly in my yard; I have seen Lee since: I never supped with him off a fowl in my life- Lee and White are partners; the cart was mine - Lee lent me the horse to bring the pigs up; White's son came the same night, and fetched the horse home; I knew the pigs were gone when I took the deposit and the note, because I had nothing else to take: I took the note, expecting to receive the money; I cannot say whether the note was read over to me - they told me I was to receive my money on Monday at one o'clock: I do not think the note was read; I have not employed Lee since to buy me some pigs at Romford-market: when the note became due I went to their house. and saw them both in White's house, where the bill was drawn - I went there full twenty times after it was due, and saw them sometimes; they had not got the money to pay me - I saw White in Smithfield-market acting as a pig-jobber, and asked if he meant to pay me; he said he could not stop, but would meet me at a public-house; I staid there two hours, but he never came: he moved from his house, and was taken on another charge on the 26th of December.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutrix. I went in the cart with the pigs to White's house; I waited with the cart while mistress went into the house: I was about half a dozen yards from the door - I staid there about half an hour; Lee and the prisoner's son came out; be gave me a drop of beer and a bit of biscuit, and then went in doors again - he came out again in about half an hour, and told me the pigs were settled for; he took the horse and cart away with the pigs: I went into mistress and told her the pigs were gone - I sat down and had a drop of beer before I told her, for I thought she knew it; I told her in the prisoner's presence what Lee had said - the prisoner said nothing to that; I staid there till Lee returned, which was about an hour; the prisoner was present - he told mistress he had no money for her, except she could give him change for a 50l. cheque; she said she could not, she had not got a farthing in her pocket - White then said he must draw up a bill; he sent his daughter out for a stamp, and drew the bill; mistress said a bill was of no use to her without the money - she came away with the bill after a bit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Who gave the bill to your mistress? A.White - Lee signed it; she took it after I had told her the pigs were gone, as she found she could get nothing else; they brought the cart and horse home the same night, and the horse was taken away: the bill was not read at all; mistress did not ask to have it read - she has sent me four or five times since to see White; I sometimes saw them, and sometimes nobody; mistress has not had a pig since.</p>
               <p>The bill being read, was drawn at four days after date, and signed

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to SARAH COLWIN. Q. Did you not agree to go to Romford with Lee, to buy some pigs? A. No, I had some porter with Lee at a public-house the day the pigs were agreed for; it was before they were taken away- they endeavoured to buy them on the Wednesday, but on Saturday I took them home; I met Lee in Smithfield one day and asked him for the money - I never met him by appointment at Lambeth-marsh.</p>

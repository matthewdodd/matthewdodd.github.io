               <p>Did they make use of any violence or threats? - No, my Lord, nor we made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Do you know the persons of any of the men? - I think I recollect the persons of two of the three; I think I should know them if I saw them; I am of opinion that the prisoners are two of the persons; I think I know both of them; I think they are the two that attacked me, I should not chuse to swear positively to them, it could not be called dusk, and the moon was full out, and it was very light, light enough to observe any person whatever; they were a very short time with us, they had no disguise at all, I think they had all three round hats, I suppose he whole did not take up more than three minutes, I had not so good an opportunity of observing them as Mrs. Darlow had, for she did not seem so much surprised as I was; for the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178707110034"></xptr>one being engaged in taking out my buckles, I could not see so plainly his face, and the other held his head down while he was rifling my pockets; I believe them to be the men, but would not chuse to swear positively to them; I never saw my buckles since, I do not know that they were found; Romain was taken the next day, and I saw him the day after he was taken.</p>
               <p>When you first saw Romain at the Justice's, did you immediately recollect him? - I thought it was the same person.</p>
               <p>Had you then the same degree of diffidence that you have now? - Much the same.</p>
               <p>Was he dressed in the same way at the Justice's, as when he robbed you? - Much the same; I think he had the same coat on, when I described him in the information; it was a light coloured surtout coat; Romain was the man that I think took my buckles; Gilbertson was taken about a week afterwards; my recollection of him was much the same as of the other.</p>
               <p>Had any of them any arms? - One of them had a cutlass, the other had something in his hand, but I could not justly make out what it was.</p>

               <p>I was with Mr. Reeves at the time of this robbery; as we were going along the fields, three men followed us, and walked behind us a considerable length in the fields, then they turned round some time after, and stopped us and robbed us; the one took my cloak, and the other took Mr. Reeves's buckles and money; there are only two of them taken; one threw down my cloak, and the other took it up, and took it away; I recollect the persons of both the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Do you mean to swear to your belief, or with certainty? - I speak with certainty; I took particular notice of them both; I am sure to them both; I had them in my eye before the robbery for some time; I am quite certain of them both, and I picked them out from a great many when I saw them; I swear to them both.</p>
               <p>Then I understand you as speaking with certainty, not with any doubt? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was your cloak ever found again? - Never.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Romain. You was three yards off.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Darlow. I was not flurried at all.</p>
               <p>Then you think you are equally certain to both? - I am.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting Mrs. Branegan the day you was examined before the Coroner - A. No, I did not see her that day. My father did not tell me what to say.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Pocock, of St. Bride's wharf. On the 12th of November, I was in Old-street, and saw the prisoner there - I knew him by sight before. I saw him riding furiously along, full gallop, without a saddle - he had a bridle I believe. I first saw him about forty yards from the turnpike; he passed through the turnpike at the same rate, without stopping to pay - I was about two hundred yards from him at first. The last witness who was just examined, was crossing, and had just passed the locked gate with the infant in her arms. The prisoner's horse struck the little girl, and forced the infant out of her arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the horse struck it - A. Yes. I called to the prisoner several times to stop, before he passed me - he would not stop; I called to him after, he had looked round, and must have seen the child, lying there. He saw himself pursued and called to, but still rode on, but an alarm being given, and seeing that he must be stopped, he at last pulled up. I went up, and laid hold of his bridle - another person came up, and joined me. I said it was a pity there was not an officer at hand to give him in charge. The person said he was an officer, and I gave him in charge - he got off his horse, and I told him he had rode over a child. He treated it with the greatest indifference, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't make a fuss, it can't be helped" - he was very much intoxicated; I left him in charge. The child was taken into a doctor's.</p>
               <p>Q. When first you saw him, was the horse gallopping - A. It was. I swear the horse struck against the child; the road being wide, I could see what happened four hundred yards off; the horse struck the girl, which caused her to drop it. If a waggon had been passing he must have dashed the horse to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was a restive horse, might it not have run away with him - A. Certainly, but he had an opportunity of stopping it, for finding he was pursued, and that it would be useless to ride any farther, he pulled the horse in momentarily.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you see the horse ride away with him - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he passed you did he appear to be trying to stop, or encouraging the horse to go on - A. Encouraging the horse to go on.</p>

On Friday, the 12th of November, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came gallopping through the gate - he had paid the toll that morning; I knew him - he passed through with speed.

               <p>Q. Could he see them - A. Yes, there was nothing to prevent his seeing them - there was no building in the way. When he was near to them, he cried out,</p>
               <p>"Halloo!" He saw them within a yard of him - the face of the horse knocked the little one out of the girl's arms. I did not perceive what part of the horse struck her.</p>

On Friday, the 12th of November, about two o'clock, in the afternoon, the little boy was brought to my house in a state of insensibility. I examined him. There was extravasated blood, and a bruise over the right eye, on the side of the temple; I attended him till he died. From the time it was brought into my shop it remained in that insensibility. On the Monday its right side became completely paralysed, and the next day it died. I attended it at the father's house, Silver-street, Bridgewater-gardens.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010024"></xptr>The body was opened, and there was an extensive inflamation on the surface of the brain, and a portion of matter.</p>

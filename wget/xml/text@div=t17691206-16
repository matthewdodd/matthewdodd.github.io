About the hour of one in the morning, on the 18th of November, I was awaked by the barking of a large dog that I keep, and heard a crying out among my geese which I had to kill as I had occasion for my own use, and which were in a lumber room in my dwelling-house. There were six of them. I got out of bed, put my waistcoat on, and came into the gallery, when I saw my outward door stood wide open, and my windows and door open into the gallery. The geese were in a room next to the room under my room where I lay. (It is an inn-yard.) It was the bottom door, that leads to the stairs, that I saw open, which leads to some workshops that I have. (I am a file-cutter and grinder.) I have the whole inn and yard upon lease, and I reserve these apartments to myself. Great part of it I lett to a hackneyman, and keep stabling for my own horses. This lumber room is under the roof of my dwelling-house, and a part of it. As soon as I came into the gallery, I heard voices, and thought I knew one, which called my bitch by her name. I heard them catch a goose, and heard her flutter very much. They killed her. Then I cried out - Stop thieves! having nobody to assist me. The moon shone very bright. There came out a man with a great deal of composure, and asked me what was the matter. He saw me in the gallery. I made use of an oath, and said he was a thief. They were stealing my geese; but I knew one of them. He called me a thief, and said, if I did not go in, he would shoot me; but before the words were well out of his mouth, I heard something snap. I saw his hands together. I made use of another oath, and bid him shoot away. I drew back, but did not go in. Then I saw two more men come out of the same door. There is a little ride that shaded that, so I could not see them; but I heard them go down the yard. It was a very cold night, and being almost naked, I went to bed again. I had only two little boys in the house: I called to them to get a candle, and to go and look among the geese, for I thought some of them were killed. The boy went, and came and said there were three missing. When I got up, which was between seven and eight, I missed only two. I went to Justice Welch, and got a warrant against the evidence,

               <p>Q. Was that outward door fast at your going to bed?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. I locked it myself. In the morning I observed no marks of violence upon the door, but found it unlocked on the inside. On the Sunday week after, I had intelligence he was at a chandler's shop. I went to take him; but he ran when he saw me. I having boots and a great coat on, he outran me. I called - Stop thief! and he was stopped at the corner of Lincoln's Inn-Fields. I brought him home, and desired the people to keep him till I got a constable; but when I returned, I found they had permitted him to go up into his room. I was told, if I would go to him, he would tell me every thing about it. I went up, and he told me. He is here to be examined, and will give the account himself. I never found my geese again. Then I got a warrant on his information against the prisoner. I cannot say I ever saw him till I saw him at Mr. Welch's office. I heard him examined there. He confessed that he, the evidence, and one Houghton, met at the One Tun, at the corner of Field-Lane, went down the Fleet-Market, and so into Fleet-Street. I think he said he either primed a pistol or loaded it, and then they were determined to come and rob me of these geese. He acknowledged how the fact was done. He said, the evidence got over the coach-houses, then into the gallery, and so came down, and let himself and Houghton in; and that Simms called my bull-bitch by her name, and clapped her. The justice asked him if he heard Houghton and I have words; he said he was backwards, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060014"></xptr> did not hear it. He said they carried the geese to Blackboy-Alley, to a house there.</p>

               <p>Q. How much of his time has Simms served?</p>
               <p>Kendrick. I think he came apprentice to me in February 1762. He is a parish apprentice from Dorsetshire.</p>

            . I had known the prisoner about seven weeks, when he and Houghton persuaded me several times to go and rob my master. He, I and Houghton were together that night, at the One Tun, at the corner of Field-Lane. We went from thence down Fleet-Market, into Fleet-Street, intending to stop somebody. When we came into Fleet-Street, the prisoner pulled a pistol out of his pocket, and put some gunpowder into the pan. We then went through Clare-Market, and so came to my master's about one in the morning. Then I got over my master's gallery rails into the gallery: Houghton lifted me up. I went down and unlocked the bottom door; the key was in it; and then the bull-bitch began to bark. I called her by her name, and kept her quiet. The prisoner and Houghton then came in. I catched two of the geese, gave them to Houghton, and he killed them. They made such a noise, they disturbed master, and he came out. Houghton went out to the door, and had some words with master: he bade master go in, or he would absolutely shoot him. Then we all went out of the yard into Holborn, and staid there about ten minutes. The outward door of the inn yard was open. We all of us returned into the inn yard again. The two geese lay behind the door; I took them up, and gave Houghton one, and

            . On the 26th of November I was sent for to Mr. Welch's, where were warrants against Randall and Houghton, and I was desired to see if I could apprehend them. I took the evidence with me, and apprehended Randall in Field-Lane. I took him before Justice Welch. When he came there, he confessed every thing. He and the evidence did not differ in the least in the account they gave of going from the One Tun to Fleet-Market, from thence into Fleet-Street, and in assisting to lift the evidence over to let them in, killing the geese, one taking one, the other the other, to Blackboy-Alley, to one Mrs. Hall's. He made a free and voluntary confession, with only being asked what he had to say for himself. He confessed immediately.</p>

               <p>The evidence has taken a great many false oaths. I was at the One Tun, and they desired me to go. I was very fuddled. Houghton and he had made an agreement to go before, and desired me to go; at last I agreed. We went up Fleet-Street. I do not know whether he had a pistol or not. I stood at the lower part, and Houghton lifted the evidence up; he then opened the door, and went in. I never was in the room. We went from thence into Holborn, and staid about ten minutes; then we came again, and the evidence then fetched the two geese out, when Houghton took them, put them into his apron, and took them to Mrs. Hall's, in Blackboy-Alley.</p>

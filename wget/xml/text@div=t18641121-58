                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employ of Cook and others, of St. Paul's Churchyard, warehousemen—on 17th November, about half-past 2 o'clock, the prisoner came in with an empty fish-basket in his hand—he told me he wanted to go to the wholesale woollen department—there is a lift to carry people and goods up and down, and I was working it at the time—we both went up together—the prisoner stopped on the first floor, but I went up to the top, leaving him there—that is where the woollen goods are kept—I came down afterwards by the lift, and the prisoner came down with me to the basement—he had not the basket with him—he bad left that on the ground floor—he went up a second time with me—he did not take the basket then—I left him on the second floor, and went higher—I afterwards came down with him, and he had this piece of woollen (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) wrapped up as it is now—I saw him put it into his basket—he then inquired for a man named Wood in the haberdashery department—I went and inquired, but there was no such name there—I left the prisoner against the door, and when I returned, I saw him outside—I told him there was no such name there—he said that a man had sent him in—I asked him to show me the man—we went to a public-house, and he stood against the door, said something to the barmaid that I did not catch, and came out—I asked him to come back with me—he said, "No, the man is round the other side of the bar"—I asked him to come round, with me, and show me the man, but he would not—I asked him to come back again, he said, No, he was not going to wait about there for a lousy fourpence—I asked him who sent him in, he said, "A man named Wood"—I said, "You came and inquired for a man named Wood"—he then made a rush at me, and tried to knock me down—he ran a few yards—I went after him into Sermon-lane, and he tried to knock me down again—he had left the basket and goods at the warehouse—he ran away, but I caught him in Old Change, and a man helped me to take him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief salesman in Messrs. Cook's woollen department on the first floor—there are eleven others—on 17th November about half-past 2 o'clock I was there, but did not see the prisoner—he never came to me—I did not sell him this piece of goods—it is more than I dare do, because we are wholesale—I identify it as Messrs. Cook's property—it was on top of a heap of goods about three and a half yards from the lift—I do not identify the wrapper, but it had our name on it when it was given to the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going home from Billingsgate-market, and a gentleman got out of a chaise and asked me if I would carry a parcel from Cook's in St. Paul's Churchyard, and he would give me fourpence. I said, "I do not mind, as I am wet through" I went with him, and he put this parcel in my basket wrapped in a newspaper. He said, "Go up to the first floor, and ask them to look out the wholesale woollens" I came down and saw nothing of him, but he came to me again from the front of the warehouse; he did not come down by the lift, though he went up by it. He went out, and I went up by the lift, and presently he came with two parcels in slate-coloured paper; one was not quite so big as this. He told me to go down and give it to the gentleman in the cart. I was to ask for Mr. Wood, who would give something else. I could not see the gentleman or the cart, so I asked a gentleman it he knew where I could find Mr. Wood. He said that he did not know. While the first witness went to inquire, I went outside to see. if I could see the gentleman or the pony and cart, but could not The witness came up and said, "I want you." I said, "What for?" He said "You know all about what for; about that piece of cloth" I said, "I was sent in for it; the gentleman is in here" I went into the public-house but could not find him. He said, "If you do not come back, I shall make you," upon which I gave him a shove, but did not attempt to knock him down. He still followed me, and I ran away; he came up, and I thought he was going to hit me, so I made an attempt to strike him, but did not. He put his foot against me as I ran and threw me on my face, held me, and gave me in charge. I put my basket down, and as I got the cloth given me, I put it in the basket, and there I left it.</p>

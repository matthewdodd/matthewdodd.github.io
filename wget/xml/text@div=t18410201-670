                  </hi>. I am living on my own property. On the 12th of January I was at a party in Verulam-buildings, Gray's Inn, at Mr. Richard Hare's chambers—I missed my pocket handkerchief, and we found it in the prisoner's pocket—he was a temporary waiter there—the property stated in the indictment was likewise found—he said he was extremely sorry for what he had done.</p>

                  </hi>. I have chambers in Verulam-buildings. On the night of the 11th of January I had a party, and on the morning of the 12th the property was found—I hired the prisoner as an occasional waiter from the Thatched House—this handkerchief was missed an hour or two previous to its being found on the prisoner—he said he was very sorry, and began crying—there were also found on him some tea and cakes and other things, and some cards—the handkerchief was the last thing found—heseemed to have nothing else, but what he had taken from the different tables—I had no doubt they were my property—the tea was in a paper with the name of my grocer on it—I lost some spoons, which have not been found—it is possible somebody else might have taken them.</p>

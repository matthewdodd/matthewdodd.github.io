                  </hi>. My husband keeps the Red Lion public house, in Clarges-street. On 20th Jan. the prisoner came, and asked for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rum—I served her; she gave me a half crown; I gave her change—as soon as she was gone I examined the half crown, and discovered it was bad—I locked it up apart from other money—on 1st. Feb. the prisoner came again, about the same time in the evening—she asked for half a quartern of gin; she tendered me a shilling—I knew her as the person who had been there before—I rather objected to the shilling—she said it was a good one—I took it, and gave her change—I afterwards found it was bad, and put it with the half crown—on 10th Feb. the prisoner came again, about the same time in the evening; she asked for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of rum—she tendered me in payment a shilling—I gave her change for it, and the moment she left the bar I perceived it was bad—I sent my potman after her; he brought her back—I charged her with having uttered bad money to me—she said she had not; and after a time she said she gave a shilling, but she did not know it was bad; and she had got a penny, which she would leave me for the rum.</p>

"—I said, "Just a little further"—I took her to the house, and she was given in charge.</p>

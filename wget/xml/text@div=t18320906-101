               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had not the outside of the Spanish vessel been newly painted? A. I cannot tell; the top of my fender laid against his paint work, but I did not observe its being wet; my fender was made of wood - I do not recollect the prisoner puting out a canvas one; when his men came on board, I said they had no right to remove the fender, but I cannot tell what their intention was; if the fender did him any damage, I should have wished him to have put another on - he made the blow at me about a minute after he struck at the lashing; I had said nothing to provoke him, nor made any action or geature: my head was about three feet from the lashing - he made the second blow at my head; it could not be made at the lashing - I was below him, and stooped with my head downwards to get it from the blow; I received the blow on the back part of the top of my head; the surgeon ordered me to keep still, but I was about my duty as usual - I went to Mr. Barry's counting-house an hour after it occurred: that was about a mile, and I went before the Justice directly; I charged him with cutting my head with the hatchet, and the officer had a warrant when I went to Mr. Barry's; I did not state there that it was only a scratch, and if I had 40s., I did not wish to go further with it - I have not brought my hat here; the mate was on board and saw the transaction - I have not brought him here; I had three men in the ship.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You was close to the side of the vessel when the blow was made? A. Yes, I stooped to get out of the way of it: my head was then over the rail of the fender.</p>

            . I was on board the Deborah. I put the fender down by Palmer's order; my master pushed the Spanish vessel off with a handspike, to make way for the fender, and then it was put down - the prisoner came in a minute or two, and saw the fender laying there; he spoke to some of his people - I could not understand what he said, and they came on board our vessel; he spoke to somebody - they fetched an axe or hatchet from the cabin; the prisoner took it, and made a blow at the fender-lashing, or the fender; master prevented that blow with a handspike - the prisoner then rose the axe with both hands, and cut him on the back of his head; I cannot say how long this was after he cut at the lashing; it was a very short time -I stood alongside Palmer, and saw that he aimed the blow at his head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Did your master's ship go up to the Spanish ship? A. The Spanish vessel was moored, and ours came up, to her; I did not see the prisoner wave his hand for us to move the fender - the bulwarks of his ship were over ours; she laid higher in the water, being lighter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Should you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060054"></xptr>think so slight a wound could be given by a blow with a hatchet, struck with both hands? A. I do not think that it could be given with great force.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man was raising his head, and so touched the hatchet, could it have made such a wound? A. Yes, if he had no hat on.</p>

             (through an interpreter). I was mate on board the prisoner's ship. I remember a wooden fender being put out by Palmer; the prisoner's vessel was newly painted - the paint was still wet; the fender would have injured it if left - the prisoner said the fender was too high, and requested him to lower it, as it would damage our bulwarks; he spoke in broken English, and by signs - Palmer did not remove it, and the prisoner called for an axe to cut the lashings of the fender; he was in the act of cutting at the lashing when the prosecutor stepped over, and the prisoner withdrew the axe, and rested it on the bulwarks - the prosecutor remained in that position for a little while, then lifted up his head, and must then have cut his head against the axe; the prisoner remained on board, without any alteration in his conduct.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near were you to the prisoner? A. Close to him; he did not strike any blow at the fender at all, nor at Palmer - when Palmer stooped over his vessel, he took his hat off; it was not on when his head came in contact with the axe - the prisoner did not aim a blow at any body, or any thing; he held the axe up, and told Palmer he would cut the lashing off, if he did not move it - he did not strike at all.</p>

            . I was on board the prisoner's vessel; the prisoner complained of the fender, and tried to induce Palmer to remove it two or three times - he did not; the prisoner sent for an axe to cut the lashing - I did not see Palmer use the handspike; the prisoner was holding the axe in this position, pointing at the fender - I afterwards saw it resting on the bulwarks; I saw Palmer raise his head, but cannot say that any thing happened then - I did not see the prisoner raise the axe with both hands, and strike at Palmer's head; if he had I must have seen it - I was standing three or four feet from Palmer.</p>

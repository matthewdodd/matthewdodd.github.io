                  </hi>. I am a widow, and lodge with my daughter at Islington. On the 5th of October, I missed two spoons—the prisoner was servant to my daughter—this spoon was brought back by the broker, with the pri<lb></lb>soner—it is mine—it is broken in two.</p>

                  </hi>. I was standing at the corner of Southampton-street, Pentonville, and the prisoner asked if I knew where a silversmith lived—I said, "There is no silversmith near here, but there is a pawnbroker's at the foot of the hill"—I asked if she had any thing to sell—she said her mis<lb></lb>tress had sent her with this spoon to sell—I looked at it—directly I had it in my hand, I said, "Who is your mistress?"—she said, "It don't matter to you"—I said, "No one will buy it unless they know your mistress"—I then saw a policeman, and gave him the spoon—I followed with the police<lb></lb>man, and we found where her mistress lived.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I was on duty in South<lb></lb>ampton-street. I saw Abrahams beckon to me—he said the prisoner bad offered him, the spoon for sale—I asked if it was hers—she said, "No," her mistress sent her out to sell it—I asked where her mistress lived—she said she was not bound to tell me—I said she must tell me, or I would take her to the station-house—I went a few paces, and found she lived at Edward-terrace.</p>

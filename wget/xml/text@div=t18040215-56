            , coming into your shop? - A. On Saturday, the 21st of January, about one o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she come for? - A. To purchase two muslin handkerchiefs; she tendered a 2 l. note, and, from its general appearance, I had a suspicion it was a forged one; I communicated my suspicions to a fellow shopman, and desired that he would take the note for inspection, his name is John Shaw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform the prisoner that you should take it to the Bank? - A. I did; I told her that I had suspicion that it was a bad one, and that I should send to the Bank; she objected to that, and said, if you will give it me again, I know where I had it, and I will get it changed; I then delivered it to John Shaw, and he went to the Bank with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the woman? - A. She said she would go along with him; she went out of the shop with him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again? - A. Near eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she come alone? - A. She came in company with the other prisoner, Palmer.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that note you delivered to Shaw was the note she gave you? - A. Yes; about eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150040"></xptr>o'clock the same evening, the two prisoners came, and the prisoner Palmer said, this woman has been here to-day, and offered a 2 l. note, which you have stopped; he asked the reason why we stopped it; he said it was his note; he must either have it or the change; we said the note had been sent to the Bank, and, in consequence of that, we could not return it; he repeatedly insisted on having the note or the change, saying that it was his; in the interim I sent for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he got the note from? - A. He did not say where he got it from; but he knew where he got it from; he said that it was a d - d piece of business that he must be at the loss of the note; they were taken into custody immediately; on going out of the door, Hudson said, you must be at the loss of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. It was in the morning you saw the woman that came and tendered that note? - A. It was about one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. She returned in the evening? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her that you would send to the Bank? - A. I communicated my intention to her.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not have known where to find her, if she had not come? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had refused to take it, she said to Palmer, then you must be at the loss of it? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Giles. Q. Where do you live? - A. I live with Sir Thomas Week, as a servant, in the Fleet; he pays me so much a week, during the time he is there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoners at the bar? - A. I have known them both about ten months.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you become acquainted with Palmer? - A. At the Rose, in the Old Bailey.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what time in January you saw him? - A. On Thursday, the 19th of January, I saw him with a man of the name of Hughes; I am perfectly sure that Hughes, Palmer, and me, were at the public-house; Mr. Hughes came from the country, and wished to make some purchase, and wished me to go with him; Palmer said he would be of service to me, and put some money in my pocket; I went out with Palmer, and we found Hughes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Palmer again on that day? - A. No; on Friday morning he asked what passed during the evening between me and Hughes; I told him that Hughes offered me a note that was forged; Hughes told me that it was forged, but it was as good as a real one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what Hughes wished you to do with that note? - A. I told him that Hughes had made a proposal of some forged notes; I refused it; Palmer said, you are a fool, I have got some myself; I told him Hughes said I should have half, if I would make use of them, for I was just the man that would do for it; Palmer told me that I was a fool; and shewed me a 5 l. note, a 2 l. note, and a 1 l. note; I understood they were forged notes, and that he had a quantity, which he had from Hughes; after that, I saw Hughes; he came into the Rose the same day, Friday, the 19th of January, and Palmer was there.</p>
               <p>Q. He shewed you three notes; where did he take them from? - A. He took them out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he shew you any more? - A. No; not at that time, Hughes came into the Rose the same day again, and Hughes and Palmer said I was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150041"></xptr>coward, that I had refused the notes, and told me I was a d - d, fool, and abused me intolerably; then Hughes made a second proposal for me to take some notes, and pulled them out of his pocket, and laid them on the table; he took a good one-pound note, and laid it on the table on the side of the bad one, and compared them together, and said, d - n me, look at this, and see if you can see any difference. To all this I declined; then I was repeatedly abused by them; I begged them to let me alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Palmer tell you where he kept them? - A. The box was in a dark sitting-box at the Rose; the table is in the room where the box was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Palmer go up to the box? - A. He went up to the box, and took something out, and put something in, but what I could not plainly see, the place was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Palmer live at the Rose? - A. He slept there frequently, but not constantly, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Palmer again on Saturday - what said he to you then? - A. I don't know that any thing passed very particular then; Hughes then came in, and made another offer for me to take some notes; he again pulled out some notes, and wanted me to write my name, or any other, upon them; I asked him if he would wish me to write my own death-warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing the prisoner Hudson there on Saturday? - A. Palmer sent for Hudson to make a purchase.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Hudson in the morning? - A. No, I was not near her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she, when Palmer sent for her? - A. Out, in the Old-bailey; Palmer went out, and I saw her speaking to him; I heard at a distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear all they said? - A. No, not then; Palmer came in afterwards, and said, he had sent that girl out with a two-pound note, to make a purchase of something.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when she came back? - A. No, I was not present; she sent for him out to a next house, and then he went out of the Rose; I was there when he came back; he then said, he had sent the girl out with a note, and she paid it away. There, says he, you see I have got some money, and I will not be long without some more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Hudson and Palmer again on that evening? - A. I saw Hughes and Palmer that same Saturday again, and I understood that they were going to the sight, and it was repeated that they would pay some of the notes away, for he would be d - d if he had not ten pounds by that night; I saw

             together at the Blue Last, in Cock-court, Ludgate-hill, that same Saturday evening at another time.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between them there? - A. I was drinking part of a glass of rum and water; Palmer abused the girl for not bringing money enough, and he abused me too.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he abuse you for? - A. Because I would have nothing to do with them, and she cried terribly, because he abused me.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect what passed about what she had done with the notes? - A. She said, you know I have given you the change; I asked him to pay for the sixpenny-worth of rum and water; he said afterwards to her, G - d b - st you, go and get change for a note, you have plenty of money and notes about you.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he state any note? - A. He said she had got a two-pound note of his, and he said she had some more notes; I did not hear any more of them; he paid for the rum and water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say what she had done with the note? - A. No, she did not, they went out both together; I went out a little while before; I was alarmed by his going on in that way; I saw them both together in the court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are a servant to a gentleman in the Rules of the Fleet? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What capacity have you been in? - A. I have been a servant all my life-time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner Palmer? - A. Not particularly so; I have not been in his company above ten or a dozen times.</p>
               <p>Q. And that mostly a public-house acquaintance - where did you generally meet? - A. We met at several places; he was engaged at a public-house for the Army of Reserve.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the woman? - A. Near the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. You never met her so often - not above five or six times? - A. More than that; about a dozen times.</p>
               <p>Q. Were your visits long? - A. No, not long, we met several times together.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not keep much company? - A. No; I have been in company with

            , and dined with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You recollect that you said this moment that you had not been in his company above ten or a dozen times? - A. It might be more.</p>
               <p>Q. Sometimes you had dined with him, but in general it was a more general meeting to drink a glass of beer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With a man of that character? - A. I never saw any harm of him before this transaction of the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never heard him say any thing of Banknotes before the 19th of January? - A. No, not till that time; I was in company with him three times before he was apprehended, when he mentioned the notes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150042"></xptr>Q. This conversation took place at the Rose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There were one or two in company at that time? - A. There was no more present when he mentioned the notes; there might be one or two going backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any impeachment of your character? - A. I might have a little folly of going with a girl of the town, as well as any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been told by Hughes that they had a box to put these notes in at the Rose? - A. I was told by Palmer that he had the notes in a box in the parlour, under one of the seats on which the customers sat; that was on Friday, on the early part of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the servants of the house had access to it when they came to sweep the place? - - A. Certainly they must.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you went directly and told the landlord what this man said? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink with him after? - A. No, I was very uncomfortable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Bank, or to the Lord-Mayor, and tell them the circumstance? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate to any individual what you have told to-day? - A. I told a party I was determined to get all the information I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate it to any individual before the prisoner was taken up? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom? - A. I did not know the prisoner was taken up; on Sunday, I communicated it to Mr. Austin.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, you did not know they were apprehended on Sunday? - A. I did not till the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never tell any person before Sunday evening, when you learned that they were in custody for forged notes - did you never communicate it to any one single witness? - A. I did to a person that is not present; she is a woman that lives at the other end of the town; I have known her a little while, her name is Mary Glover; she lives at No. 63, King-street, Golden-square.</p>
               <p>Q. And that before Sunday evening; when was it communicated to her? - A. On Friday evening, about ten, or half past ten, at night.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life has she been in? - A. A milliner and mantua-maker; she is a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q.Your master, being confined in the Fleet-prison, always dines at home? - A. Yes; he always has an old woman to attend him; I attend him always when he wants me.</p>
               <p>Q. You never have occasion to attend him at dinner? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, on Friday evening, you went up to the other end of the town - where do you lodge? - A. I have lodged at No. 63, King-street, for two years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has Mary Glover lodged there? - A. I do not know how long justly, more than a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by that expression, you had known her a little time? - A. I said I had known her some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell where these notes were concealed? - A. I told it to Mr. Austin and Sir Thomas Weeks; I told Mr. Austin on Sunday, before I knew the prisoners were apprehended; I told him the notes were concealed in a little box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any search made for the notes? - A. On Monday there was.</p>
               <p>Q. On Monday then, there was searching for a box, and no box could be found - do not you know, that if you had given an earlier discovery of the notes, they would have been likely to have been found? - A. I did not know rightly how to make a search.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go and drink with this man, after he had made a proposal to you to part with these notes? - A. I have been in company with him two or three times since that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Giles. Q. Did you understand, or did you not, that he said, in the presence of the woman, that he had received the money for that two-pound note he had sent out? - A. He certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he had sent her off again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it the conversation took place respecting that note? - A.Early in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hours after the conversation, that he said he had sent Hudson out again with another two-pound note? - A. About half an hour; I do not know whether it was received.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him say any thing of receiving any money but for the first two-pound note? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you have stated all that passed between them? - A. To the best of my knowledge; I was abused by them several times.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Is Hughes forth-coming? - A. I should like to see him in the situation of Palmer and Hudson.</p>
               <p>Q. You hope to give information against Hughes? - A. I hope so; I believe that he first seduced Palmer.</p>

             sworn. - On Sunday morning, I saw the prisoner Hudson at the Compter; the first question I asked her was, how she came by the note; she said, she received it from a gentleman in a hackney-coach; I asked her whether she would know the gentleman again; she said, she thought she might. I then asked her how she had been employed; she said, she got her livelihood by taking in needle-work of any one. I asked her nothing farther, and then I sent for Palmer. I asked him how he came to go with Hudson to Mr. Shaw's shop, on Saturday evening; he said, as he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180402150043"></xptr>stood at the Rose public-house door, the prisoner Hudson came by; he asked her where she was going; she said, she had been stopped with a two-pound note at Mr. Shaw's; the prisoner, he said, was an old acquaintance of his, and he went with her. I asked him whether the note he went after, with Hudson, that evening, was his property; he said, it was not.</p>
               <p>Palmer's defence. I never saw the note, before I saw it at Guildhall. Is it to be supposed, that if I knew this note to be a forged note, I would have gone with her? The woman told me that it was stopped, and that she did not like to go with the gentlemen to the Bank, as she was so dirty. I told her I would go with her; I thought the shopmen might wish to cheat her out of the note; that is the sole reason I went with her.</p>
               <p>Hudson's defence. This man never had the note at all; I never saw the man before I had this note from; I was never in his company till then; he took me in a coach from the 'Change to Charing-cross.</p>

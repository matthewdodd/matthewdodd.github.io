            . I had this property in a basket, in my bed-room, at the prisoner's; I put the half-sovereign into the pocket-book at seven o'clock on Saturday, the 7th of August - I went out and came home in an hour or two, and went to get a razor out of the basket; I missed the coat and other articles - I asked for them, but got no answer; I made a great bustle about it, and as I was going out, about ten o'clock, they said they had pawned the coat; I then asked for the other things, and they said I should not have a halfpenny worth of them till I paid them a little balance which I owed them of 11s. 6d.; they did not say what they had done with the things in the pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you owe them 1l. 1s. 6d.? A. No; there is no such lodger as

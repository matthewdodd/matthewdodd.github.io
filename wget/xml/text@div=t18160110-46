            . I am a constable. On the 28th of December last, I saw the prisoner in St. Martin's-le-Grand, at about three o'clock in the afternoon; he had a basket, which he was carrying in his right hand. In consequence of information which I had received, I followed the prisoner, and caught hold of him. I took hold of the basket, and asked him where he had got that? he told me, it was given me by a woman. I asked him, who that woman was? and he said, she was a shipmate's wife. I asked him, where she was? he said, he could not tell. I took him to a public-house, and searched him; I found nothing about him but two farthings.

             was with me; he and I searched the basket, and we found it to contain thirty-three bad sixpences, five shillings and nine pence three farthings in copper money, consisting of halfpence and farthings, three shillings and five pence in penny pieces, one red herring, one slice of cheese, two biscuits, a yard of ribbon, two papers of tobacco, each containing about half an ounce, and one ball of cotton. I then took him to the Compter. I asked him where he lived; he told me, at No. 3, Kent-street, on the left hand side of the Borough. I asked him, in what part of the house he lived? and he said, in the front part.</p>

I had a pocket-apron, that I wore; I had nine shillings and sixpence in one side, and two shillings and sixpence, in halfpence, in the other; I had just before told it. There was nobody in the house but she and me; she lodged in the house for about three weeks. I went to take a nap, about twelve o'clock, on the bed; she covered me over; I had my pocket-apron on; I laid down upon it; I went to sleep; I was awoke by my husband; the prisoner was gone; the pocket-apron was cut at the bottom of each side, and all the money gone; there was only one farthing left. Last Thursday was se'nnight she was found by my husband; she was found in bed at her mother's room; she went away in triumph; she did not come back again. I gave her her bed for three weeks, because she said she was in distress. I never got my money again. She took away this bed-gown with her: it lay under the bolster, at my head; I found it on her bed, at her mother's; she was in bed.</p>

               <p>I am husband to the last witness. I came home on the 15th of October, between two and three. The door was looked; I knocked at the door; and nobody coming, I looked through the window, and saw my wife's cloathes turned up over her middle; then I knocked again, and she got up, and let me in; it is a spring-lock; and what things she had in her pocket were tumbled about the floor; her pockets were cut. When I went out, I left nobody in the house but my wife and the prisoner. The prisoner had a room in the house, and paid three-pence a night. We never got the money again. I went out about two, as near as I can guess, before she laid down. We found the prisoner with my wife's bed-gown on.</p>

               <p>The house was a disorderly house. I thought I would leave it, and go home to my mother; I was afterwards, found in bed at my mother's. I never took the money; I know nothing of it. I used to do the houshold and needle-work for Mrs. Digman; the bed-gown she lent me.</p>
               <p>Court. Is your mother here? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you really go home to her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury to Digman. What time did you go out? - I came home between two and three; I had been out about one hour.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Digman. Can you tell, with any certainty, what time you went to sleep? - It was just twelve. My husband went out immediately as soon as ever they had done breakfast. I took away the table, and counted my money, and then I went to lay down; I said, how proud I was I had all my rent but two shillings. I fell into a very heavy sleep.</p>

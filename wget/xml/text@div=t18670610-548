                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep the King's Arms, at 123, Shoreditch—I know the prisoner as a frequenter of my house—on Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 8th May, I had some friends at my house, and did not go to bed till, ten minutes to three in the morning—I left the house perfectly safe, as usual—about five minutes after five I was awoke by the bell being rung—in consequence of what was said to me, I sent my barman down with the keys to open the door—I went down afterwards and missed 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I had left on the bar table when I went to bed.</p>

I am the wife of James Abbott—he has stables in the King's Arms Yard, joining the prosccutrix's house—on Wednesday morning, the 8th May, between half-past four and five, I was up, and saw the prisoner come from the King's Arms—I knew him by using the house—he came out of the back door into the yard opposite my office door, and went out at the wicket gate and turned down Old Street—I went to see whether he had been let out or not—I found the door open leading into the bar, but the street door was fast—I knocked and sent one of our men to ring the bell and give an alarm.</p>

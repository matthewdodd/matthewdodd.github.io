I took him back to the shop, and he there offered to pay for it - I then took him to the watch-house; he was very obstinate, and his hat fell off - a piece of beef was found in it. He had 15s. in his pocket.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Anthony Benson. The officer brought back the prisoner on the evening of the 5th of November, with this bacon which I knew to be my master's - it had been laying in the window. - He said at first that he had bought and paid for it; and then he wanted to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought two pieces of beef, 11/2lb. of mutton, and 11/2lb. of bacon. and as I had no basket I I put one in my hat, and another in my pocket; when I went into this man's house I was tipsy - I asked what it was a pound - he said 6d.; I did, upon my soul, pay for it, and the officer then took me.</p>

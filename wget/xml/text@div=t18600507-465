I saw this man drop the bag and run away, and Knight follow him—I received injuries on 12th October, the second occasion—from information I got, I went with Knight and Legg to Hare-street, Bethnal green, and found the prisoner nursing a child on his knee—Knight and I went in—I said, "Taylor, we are come to apprehend you for being con<lb></lb>cerned with Angus in that burglary in King-street"—he said that he knew nothing about it—I said," You must consider yourself in our custody, so you had better get up and put your clothes on"—I thought he was going to do so, instead of that, he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the child to his wife, and began pitching into me; he threw me on the table, the table broke, and we fell on the floor; we also broke several panes of glass in the scuffle—the women got hold of a very large pair of shears, and hit us on the hats; then one of the women said, "George, knife the b—"—I then saw that the prisoner had a knife in his hand—I took hold of a jug, threw it through the window and called "Police"—Knight was then lying on his back; Taylor was on the top of him, and Knight had his arms folded round Taylor—I saw the</p>

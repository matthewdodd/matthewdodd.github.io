               <p>Prisoner. I was opposite a shop, and told you I had picked it up, and was going to put it on the board. Witness. It is false - you were past Bonsor's shop, and said you were going to put it on Bonsor's board - there was no straw there at all - I was in the shop when you passed, and was coming out of the shop door when you took it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. This under shelf was outside the shop, I suppose? A. Yes; I was coming out of the door with a joint of meat, and saw him actually remove it from there, and he went five or six yards with it - I am certain it had not fallen - it was a wet morning, and must have been soiled if it had.</p>

            . I am an officer - I was called on about seven o'clock on the 11th of January to take the prisoner into custody - I saw the beef; it was quite clean, and could not have fallen - it was a very wet morning, and if it had fallen, it must have been in a very soiled state.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he found the beef lying on the pavement, and on taking it up was apprehended.)</p>

On Wednesday, the 28th of March, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop, and desired to see a gold watch, which was taken from the window and shown to him; that was not exactly what he wanted, and another was shown to him; and in all eight were shown him, one after the other; he did not bargain for either of them, but wished then to see some watch-chains; three were shown him; he very quickly decided that one would suit him, and then wished to see some seals. and Barnes, our shopman, took a tray out of the window and before he could lay the tray down on the counter, the prisoner, in a very hurried manner, said, "I will just step over to the India-house and fetch my father, who will select one for me; he had not looked at the seals; the shopman stepped to the door and watched him; he never returned, either alone or with his father; in the space of a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes we missed a gold watch; no other customer had been into the shop at all, from the time the prisoner was there till the watch was missed; I had been in the shop all that twenty minutes; nobody could have come in and taken it without my perceiving it; I had put the watches in a place of safety. I did not see him again till a month or five weeks afterwards, when he was at Hatton-garden. I did not know him before he came to the shop, but was quite sure he was the person who had bargained for the goods; he was ten minutes or a quarter of an hour<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310017"></xptr>within my observation, with only the counter between us; he did not pay for any thing, nor fix on a watch; I saw the watch at the office, and am quite certain it is ours, by a private mark - I should charge 20l. for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had never seen him before? A. No; I was not showing him the goods, but merely looking on; he had a hat on; Mr. Dobson has no other Christian name; I have known him thirty years; the watch is worth 20l. at an under value; the price of it is 24l.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. On the 28th of March I saw the prisoner in the shop, and am quite certain of his person; he was there fifteen or twenty minutes; he came in and asked to look at a gold watch; I shewed him one - he looked at several in succession, but agreed for none of them - they were put on the counter before him - he then asked to look at some watch-chains - three were shown him - he chose one almost directly - it was not paid for - I do not recollect the price - he then asked to look at some seals - I took a tray from the window, and before I had put it on the counter, he said he would step over to the India-house, to fetch his father to make choice of a seal for him - he left the shop, without paying for any thing, and never returned - I saw him go under the portico of the India-house, but could not observe whether he went in - we missed the watch in fifteen or twenty minutes - I had not delivered him either watch, chain, or seal - if he took either away it was without my knowledge or consent - he was a perfect stranger before - I never saw him again till he was in custody, about a month afterwards, at Hatton-garden - I saw the watch there, and have no doubt of it - the selling price is twenty-four guineas ready money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you live in the house? A. Yes; Mr. Baker is the third partner - they all three sleep in the house.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Andrew, Holborn. On the 25th of April the prisoner was given into my charge for stealing a gold watch - I searched him, and found in his breeches pocket a gold watch, which I produce - it had a chain and seal to it - I took him to Hatton-garden - Mr. Glover and Barnes both claimed the watch there - I have had it ever since - the prisoner gave no account of it.</p>
               <p>MR. GLOVER. This is the watch - it has our private mark, which is a number and figures in a private character; I can tell that the number is 1878, but cannot tell the private number without looking at it - I put that down on a piece of paper, but not as soon as I missed the watch - there is a private mark on it, made by my young man, besides the number - I observed the private mark before it was stolen; it is still on it; my stock-book corroborates the mark; I have not got the book itself, but a copy of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you look at the private mark when you stood up here? A. Yes; but I could not carry it in my mind; I saw the private number at the office, but did not take it down there; I copied this number from my stockbook to-day; I can swear to the hand-writing on the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been asked at the office what the number on the watch was, could you have told without looking at it? A. Yes; I had advertized it in a bill as No. 1878 before that, but that is the manufacturer's number, not my private one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. After seeing the number at the office, did you know it to be yours? A. Yes; I knew it from its general appearance as well, and am certain of it - the private mark is scratched on it by my shopman - I enter in my shop-book the manufacturer's number and my private number against it - my shopman can also swear to it.</p>
               <p>

             re-examined. To the best of my recollection the private number is 104(looking at the watch), that is on it - it is a private mark made by myself - I have not the slightest doubt of its being the watch, both from the private mark and its general appearance; we have never sold No. 104, nor one with the manufacturer's No. 1878 - we always mark them off when they are sold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What paper did I see you give your master? A. The ticket which was in the window, specifying the price of the watch; I told the magistrate the private mark on the watch before I saw it - I have looked at the watch-paper since I have been here to refresh my memory; both the paper and the number on the watch are my hand-writing; we have two letters of the alphabet as private marks, each answering to one number - the first two letters are either F. B. or B. N. - there must be two of those letters on the watch, but I do not name them as coupled, and I think the selling price underneath is either E. N. or I. R. two of those four letters; I have put no figures on it besides 104 myself; if 6 is on it, it has been added since - I have been two years and a quarter in the shop, and do not recollect selling any of this particular description of watch; my master has no more of that make and fashion, though it is not peculiar.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was the bill printed about the watch? A. The next morning; that only stated the No. 1878; No. 104 on the watch is in my hand-writing; I never marked any other gold watch with that number; I have not the slightest doubt of this being the watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent.</p>

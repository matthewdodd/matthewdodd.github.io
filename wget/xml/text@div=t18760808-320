                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Jones, of 34, Clarendon Street, Harrow Road, we occupy the parlour—the prisoner and the deceased, Mary Ann Ebelthrift, occupied the two kitchens under us—I knew nothing of her before she came to the house, or whether she had been a widow, but she had a little girl between eleven and twelve, whose name was Hancock, and two sons, who are older—I was at home on Saturday evening, 24th June, when the prisoner and his wife came home between 7 and 8 o'clock—I saw them come home; they were both the worse for drink—a Mrs. Juskin and, her two children were with her—they went into the kitchen together—they seemed very happy together—that state of things lasted for a few minutes, and I saw the prisoner go out shortly afterwards—he came back and Mrs. Juskin went out afterwards—I walked with her; she went to the Closet, and I saw the prisoner go out after her without his shoes or coat, or anything—I saw him open the closet door and try to get in, and Mrs. Juskin who was inside at the time called "Annie, Annie"—that was to the little girl—the little girl came to the yard door, and Mrs. Juskin came out and came into the passage and went out—the prisoner then went into the closet—the deceased was then in the front kitchen—she could not see the closet from there—she did not come upstairs at all—I did not see him come out of the closet, but I heard him—he was there for a minute or two, and when he came out he went straight into the kitchen to his wife abusing her and calling her a b——something, and a b——whore—he said that he would do for her, and would cut her b——c——out that night; describ<lb></lb>ing a part of her person—I did not see him—he was swearing very dread<lb></lb>fully and accusing her—that kind of language went on for about ten minutes—Mrs. Juskin had then gone—I was afterwards in my room at the top of the stairs and heard the deceased cry "Oh," I then heard a scuffle and a scream from the woman—I felt very frightened and put on my bonnet and went round to the landlord who lives at 46, Amberley Road—he did not come back with me, but he came directly afterwards—when I got back it was all quiet—it was then 9.5 or 9.10—the landlord came in directly afterwards and went to the back kitchen and tried the door—he went down with a notice to the prisoner and told him to leave on the following Saturday—he then spoke in the kitchen far a minute or so and went away—after he had gone I heard the prisoner trying to get into the back-room; he had the handle in his hand and was pushing with his knee—I</p>

               <p>could not make out what he said, but he was speaking all the time in a low swearing way—that was about 9.30—he did not get in at the door, he went out—I then went out marketing with my husband, it being quiet below—it was a usual thing for the deceased to shut herself in when she had had words with him—when we came home it was quiet down below—we were having our supper about 10.30, and the girl Annie came in at the street door crying—she did not come into our room, she stood at the top of the stairs, and I asked her what was the matter—I saw her go down, her mother opened the door and I went into the room and found the deceased standing with a candle in her hand holding the door open for me to go in—she spoke to me—I did not look at her clothes or her condition—there were some spots of blood about, and she had a dark dress on which was wet—this was about 10.30—the little girl was in the room, but she came out with me and the deceased locked herself in again—the prisoner came back within a few minutes and tried the door—he seemed only just to try it by the handle, he did not succeed in getting in and he went out—I then went down and fastened the door into the area so as to bar him out—I then knocked at the door and received an answer from the deceased, but she did not open the door nor did she afterwards do so—that was the second time I went, as she called out—I then went upstairs thinking she would follow me up, but she did not, and I ran down again and knocked, but could get no answer, and the door was still fastened; I turned the handle and pushed hard, but got no answer; I heard a slight movement in the room—I next went to the back window which looks into their room and tried to get an answer—there was no light in the room and the blind was down—I rushed upstairs and spoke to my husband—her two sons then came in, one of whom is sixteen, and the other fourteen—they rushed down and called "Mother, mother," and <hi rend="italic">ray</hi> husband too—they attempted to get into the room by the window, but failed; my husband then broke the window and unbolted it and threw the window up, and she was lying with her head on the bed and her hands on an arm chair—her sons tried to arouse her first by calling "Mother," and catching hold of her, and with that she made as if she would rise and fell backwards on the floor—I was there when the surgeon came, but I came out—when the constable came there was a light, he came almost directly; he was at the street door—when he came in and we had the light I observed that the floor was very much splashed about with blood—the poor woman was dead but warm when the constable came—I could not see whether she had any severe injuries, but her clothes were very wet—I was very much alarmed—I have told you all I know about the matter.</p>

I have not said before to-day that he threatened to cut her person out or anything of the kind—it is not the fact that I was so alarmed and agitated that I am not certain what was said—I will swear exactly what he said in spite of my alarm and agitation—the lan<lb></lb>guage was so dreadful that I did not like to repeat it when the circumstance was fresh in my recollection before the Magistrate—I was in a dreadful state of excitement, alarm, and agitation—I have talked the matter over with my husband since—he was not there when those words were used—the deceased woman drank a good deal—when she was drunk she was not very violent unless she was very much upset—she quarrelled with her husband very frequently and I have heard her use threatening language to him—I did not hear her say she wished she had thrown a flower pot at his head; it was I</p>

               <p>who said that when I looked out of the window and saw him in the yard—I said that I had a great mind to throw a flower pot at his head—I have never beard her use threatening language—I have never seen her throw knives at him, or pieces of crockery—I have heard the crockery flying about, but don't know who did it—I have seen pieces of broken crockery about the room several times—the prisoner could not see woman go into the closet—after he went to the door and tried it the woman came out and he went into the closet himself—it was after I heard the row that was going on that he said he tried to go into the closet to the woman—she appeared to be very indignant and very jealous at that—it was immediately after the row that that was said, about 10.30—they appeared in good humour when they came home, but they had been on bad terms all the week—I have heard her say that she should either do for him or he for her—she was rather quorrelsome, I don't know about violent, I should not describe her as that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The deceased would go out washing when she had the work to do—she was not of a very violent nature, but when she got drunk she was quarrelsome—the prisoner was very quarrelsome when he was drunk—she was very stout and rather tall—nothing took place until after the woman went to the water-closet—it was then the language I have spoken of began—I was very much alarmed and agitated and went out—I have not the slightest doubt about the words being uttered which I have told you.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 34, Clarendon Street, Harrow Road, and occupy the parlour—I am a warehouseman—on Saturday night, 24th June, I went home about 9 o'clock, as near as I can tell—I went out soon after—I did not see anything of the prisoner, but I heard him from the top of the kitchen stairs about 11 o'clock, as near as I can tell—I heard him kicking at the back kitchen door, which was locked, and making use of most—beastly ex<lb></lb>pressions—he said "You b——old wh——, you b——rotten old cow, I will do for you to-night"—he did not get into the room—he left the house when he found he could not get into the room—some time afterwards" I went downstairs—my wife went downstairs first with the little girl, Annie—I tried to break open the door as I was certain something was wrong—every<lb></lb>thing was quiet—I went upstairs again and took the first thing I could get hold of to break the back kitchen window—I broke the bottom square in the bottom sash and unbolted the window and rose the bottom sash up—I pulled the blind on one side, and as I did so the woman fell on her back with her head slightly underneath the foot of the bedstead—she was rather on her right side—when I opened the window she appeared to me to have one hand on an old arm-chair and the other on the bedstead—I ran upstairs and met a police-constable at the door who got in at the window first and me afterwards in the presence of her two sons—the constable had his lantern and went up to the woman—she was quite dead. but very limp—we raised her and put a pillow under her head—her eyes were closed—she was quite warm—I found I was up to. my soles in a pool of blood—I had not got very thick soles on, but it touched the upper leather—she was dressed in all her clothes, including shoes and stockings—the constable opened the door and I left the room to fetch a doctor—the doctor ripped the skirt off her, and I saw then that the under skirt was saturated with blood, and I then left the room, as I did not think it was my duty to stop there—I left the doctor and the constable there—I was never in the closet with the deceased—I never spoke a dozen words to her in my life.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 25, Johnson's Place, Paddington—on the night of 24th June I was sent for to 34, Clarendon Street, where I arrived at 12.10—I found the woman lying in the back kitchen on the floor—her head was then on a pillow; she was quite dead—her body was warm—I formed the opinion at the time that she had been dead thirty or forty-five minutes—she was lying with her lower parts in a pool of blood—her clothes and underclothing were saturated with blood—I examined her to see what was the matter—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I found a wound on the right side of the private part 2 1/2 inches in length, which could be inflicted by some moderately sharp instrument—a knife like the one produced would be likely to produce the wound—it was about a quarter of an inch deep in one part, and in one part about half an inch—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187608080039"></xptr>
               <p>it was just on the side of the <hi rend="italic">labia</hi>—I also found an incised wound about 1 1/4 or 1 1/2 inches in length, and not quite so deep, on the left of the <hi rend="italic">labia</hi>—it had been cut by a moderately sharp instrument—this knife would pro<lb></lb>duce it—it was about as near to the private part as the other—I found another cut on the right side of the <hi rend="italic">anus;</hi> that is the back passage—that was a wound 2 inches deep, rending very nearly the front passage into the back passage; from the <hi rend="italic">rectum</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi>—the <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi> was cut; that would be against the <hi rend="italic">anus</hi>—it was like the operation for lithotomy—it was a cut that might be produced by this knife—the cuts, whether the person was lying or standing, were from below upwards—there was a very large quantity of blood from the wounds—the clothes were not cut—she had no drawers on then—she was wearing her clothes, ordinary petticoats and a lindsey dress I think they call it—I should say she was about forty or fifty—there was a large bruise on the inner part of the right thigh, high up, of recent date, as big as my fist, caused by a violent blow; a kick perhaps—there was a slight abrasion on the brow, which I thought was caused by her sliding off the bedstead on to the floor—I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> exam<lb></lb>ination on the Monday—I found the breast-bone fractured; that could have been done by the knee—the cause of death was hoemorrhage in cones<lb></lb>sequence of the wounds inflicted and fracture of the breast-bone or steruum—that would help to produce death by causing a pressure on the lung and the large vessel that leads from the heart—the knife produced was shown to me on the Monday—I examined it and found a portion of hair which had been broken off in the top of the haft, I think they call it the hinge, and there were a few broken portions of hair in addition to the portion I have already spoken of—it was; human hair, not from the head, but from some part of the body—I was also shown a shirt and a pair of trousers—I examined the shirt and found the right wrist band stained with blood—I examined the trousers and found marks'of blood down the front part of the legs—they were handed to me by the inspector.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was impossible for the lacerated wounds to be caused by broken china—a lacerated wound is net exactly jagged, but it is not such a clean cut as would be made by a very sharp instrument—it was as if the instrument had been moderately sharpened—there are other instruments besides this knife that might have caused such wounds—such a wound would not be caused by the body coming into contact with such an instrument as I have described, I am sure—I have told your learned friend that the cuts were from below upwards—if the body had come against a rather blunt instrument, the edges of the wound would be turned inwards, but the wounds inflicted by drawing an instrument would be very different—I have been called upon to judge of hair for years with the microscope—it is human hair—I did not examine the prisoner.</p>

               <p>this knife in his left-hand trousers pocket, which I showed to the doctor, with the clothing—the prisoner was charged with causing the death of his wife—he said to the witness Jones "That is the man who was in the closet with my wife"—when the marks of blood were discovered, he said that he had been working on ballast, that is, burning ballast—when in the dock, he muttered something about the blood; that his wife was in a peculiar condition which might cause the blood; but they were incoherent words, and no sense—he said she was "You know?"—I said "What is it you mean, man I speak out, and say what it is you mean"—he said "Well, she was in a peculiar state"—I said "Do you mean she was suffering from menses?"—he said "Yes, that is all"—on discovering a spot of blood on the hinder part of his trousers, he said that his nose had been bleeding.</p>

About 12.15, on the morning of 25th June, I was in Johnson's place, and the prisoner was pointed out to me with another officer—I told him I should take him into custody for causing the death of his wife—he said "All right"—on the way to the station, he said "You don't know what I have had to put up with, a short time ago, I came home and found my wife in the closet with another man; God will stand by me in this; let my brother at Acton know"—that is all he said—I should say he was sober—I cannot say if he had been drinking—he walked with me to the station, where the inspector, the last witness, saw him.</p>

On the 4th of this instant I lost a silver tankard, I advertised it, and it was found in consequence of that. (A parcel of plate seemingly the contents of a tankard cut in pieces produced in court. She takes up the lid, which was only doubled together) This I can swear to, here is my mark plain to be seen on it, I have great reason to believe the rest to belong to it.</p>

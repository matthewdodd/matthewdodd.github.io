                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Tottenham Court. Between six and seven o'clock in the evening, on the 8th of Febru<lb></lb>ary, the prisoner came to the hop, and asked the price of some handker<lb></lb>chiefs which were hanging up on the wall—I told her—she annoyed me by repeated questions, and I requested her to leave—just before she left, she stooped down, and, I thought, was concealing something under her clothes—she then went out at the door—I went round and took her—she was stooping—I thought she had been stealing some handkerchiefs—I brought her in, and my young man came from tea—I told him to look outside, and he went and brought in this cloak, which had my private mark on it—I said to the prisoner, "This will convict you"—she took the mark off, put it into her mouth, and chewed and swallowed it—I had seen the cloak in the shop while she was there—there was another person there, but she never left the counter.</p>

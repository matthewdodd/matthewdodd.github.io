            . I am a publican. I keep the Crown public-house. On Thursday morning, the prosecutrix came to me and said she had lost a cheese, and she suspected some foreigners had stolen it which used my house. She went backwards into the room. She came in the evening again. She saw the tall prisoner, I took him over to her house. I charged him with stealing the cheese. He said he knew nothing about it, and finding nothing on him I let him go. The next day the prosecutrix came into my house and saw the short one. She told me that was another of them. I took him over to her house, and accused him of it. He denied it. An officer was sent for, and he was taken in custody, and the same afternoon the other prisoner was apprehended.</p>

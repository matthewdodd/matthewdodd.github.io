I keep the Brunswick Arms, Hackney Road—on 31st January, about half-past seven in the evening, my wife called me and said something, upon which the prisoners, who were there, drank up their beer and left—I followed them, and, in consequence of something a neigh<lb></lb>bour told me, I overtook them, and said to Potts, "I accuse you of attempt<lb></lb>ing to pass bad money on my wife, knowing it to be bad"—he said, "You must be quite mistaken, Mr. Haggard, for I am a respectable working man"—I said, "Perhaps you will come back and satisfy my wife of that"—he said that he had no money about him—they went back with me, and said that Mrs. Haggard was quite mistaken, and I had better draw them a pint of half-and-half and say no more about it—I gave them in charge, and told them that my wife recognised them directly they came in as having passed a bad shilling there before.</p>

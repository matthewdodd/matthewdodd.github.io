                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Staplin, the livery stable-keeper—I supplied Kembell with a horse and gig on the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th October—I did not supply him on 17th; my man did—it was not brought back on 17th—I saw it some days afterwards in the custody of the police at Greenwich—that was my master's horse and gig—I gave some informa<lb></lb>tion to the police, and went to a stable in the Kingsland-road, on 5th No<lb></lb>vember, about five minutes past 1—the prisoner Kembell came in there, and I told the two detectives that he was the man who had had the horse and chaise from my master.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 194). On 13th October, I took Horn into custody in Paul-street—he came out of a workshop into the street—I asked him if he had not sold a ticket and watch to Grout, who was in my company at the time—he said, "I did, I sold it to him for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it myself"—he said he bought it from a man on the Saturday night, at a beershop in Willow-walk—I asked if he knew the man—he said he did not—I asked him if he knew his name and where he lived—he said he did not, it was of a man who had got a long black beard and moustache (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner Simpson answered that description</hi>)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240161"></xptr>
               <p>—I took him towards the station—on the way Grout said, "This man gave me the ticket into the bargain for a gold guard," and Horn said, "I sold you them both for the same money"—he afterwards said he would not suffer for other people, he would tell me the truth, and take me from place to place to point out the party he got the ticket of—he did so, and was leading me about for some hours—I went into different houses to look for the man—he said, "It is no use my misleading you, it was a man named Charley or George"—he told me he himself was lodging at Mr. Yates's, 24, Wheeler-street, and he said that Charley and George were living at a coffee-shop—he mentioned two men Charley, and George—he said one lived in the Kingsland-road, at a coffee-shop, and the other close by, at another coffee-shop, where he had taken me—he said the man with the black beard and moustache had from twenty-five to thirty tickets for sale; he did not mean that he was Charley or George; he was a third man—about 8 o'clock on the night of 21st October, I took Simpson at a public-house in Baker's-row—I told him I should take him in custody for pledging jewellery, which had been stolen at different robberies; for pledging a gold watch that was stolen on the 10th, and which he pledged on 10th, and a gold chain which was pledged in Worship-street—he said, "You are perfectly correct, I did pledge them"—he mentioned that he pawned one in Shoreditch, and the other in Worship-street, at the corner of Paul-street—he said it was a man of the name of John Yates who had given him the articles to pledge, and Yates went with him to Russell's in Shoreditch, and to Worship-street, to a pawnbroker, named Johnson, and that Yates lived at 24, Wheeler-street—we have never been able to find Yates—he stated that Yates gave him the articles to pledge, and when he pledged them he brought the ticket and the money out to him—he afterwards made a statement to Sergeant Harris—I did not hear all of it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, H</hi> 7). I was with Kenwood when he apprehended Simpson on this charge—he told me he had known Yates about six weeks, and that he had had victuals from Yates, and had received a half-sovereign from him, but he was to repay him again—he said he was starving, and had not had anything to eat that day but a few greens that were boiled—on the Monday he said he had seen Yates, and went to his house, and Yates told him he was to keep out of the way, as the police were looking for them, there was something wrong, and he said, "I knew nothing was wrong until that day"—I cautioned him after he had told me about the watch and chain, and said, "Have you pawned any other things anywhere else?"—he said, "Yes, I have; I will tell you everything I can think of"—he told me he had pawned the things in the name of Henry Seymour; and, from what he told me besides, we have recovered a great deal of property.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoners statements before the Magistrate were here read as follws:—Horn says:</hi>"I bought the two tickets of the watch and the chain of Mr. Yates, for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

I pawned them for John Yates, who went with me, and handed me the goods,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186211240162"></xptr>
               <p>and told me what to ask, and I gave him the money when I came out.' <hi rend="italic">Kembell says:</hi>"All I have to say is, I'm guilty." <hi rend="italic">Austin says:</hi>"I am innocent."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Horn's Defence.</hi> When I bought these things of Mr. Yates I did not know they were stolen, and I told the policeman I did not know they were stolen, and I took them round to Yates directly they told me they were stolen. We stood outside the door watting to see if they could catch him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Simpson's Defence.</hi> I received those goods, but I did not know they were stolen. I went there on 13th October, and Mr. Yates told me not to come there any more. I said, "Why?" He said, "The police are after you about those things you have pledged; there is something wrong, so go and hide yourself up, and keep out of the way." I said, "I have no means of hiding myself up; if I do, how am I to live?" He then went away. I never hid myself up, and when the officer took me I told him all about it; that I received them of Yates, and all that. He asked me if I had pledged any other things. I said, "Yes," I had. I have been instrumental in all the goods being recovered that have been recovered. I should not have gone and pledged these goods if I had known anything was wrong, without some remuneration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Austin's Defence.</hi> On Friday, 17th October, I was in the Kent-road, and saw this man driving a horse and trap. He asked me where I was going. I said, "To Walworth." He said, "I am going to Blackheath, and you can go with me." I rode with him, and when we got on to the heath he stopped and said, "Oh, I wish to go to a friend of mine, for a few minutes." He went into a house and left me with the horse—I did not understand the horse. I then saw a policeman, and thought he was noticing my awkward<lb></lb>ness. I walked away, and when I came back I could not see this man. I asked the man who was sweeping the crossing, to mind the horse and chaise for a few moments, and gave him twopence. I then went and got some re<lb></lb>freshment; this man told me his name, and I inquired for it at one of the houses, I saw the two policemen when I went round, one was the same as I met on the heath. I went up to the horse and chaise, and he asked me if it was mine. I said, "No; why?" He said, "Whom does it belong to." I said, "A gentleman." He said, "Do you know him?" I said I had a slight acquaintance with him; he had left me on the heath. He then said, "You must consider yourself in my custody." I said, "What for?" He said, "Loitering with intent to commit a felony." I was charged and taken to the station. Next morning I was called up, and two females said they thought I was the man who committed a robbery some weeks ago. If this is the last hour I live, I am innocent of it, and I have a witness here to prove that I have been under an engagement with him for the last year, all the time these robberies were being committed.</p>

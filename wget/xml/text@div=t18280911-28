I took the prisoner on Friday, the 15th, and told him the charge; he said he knew nothing about it: I asked where he had been the two nights before - he said he was at his mother's on the Wednesday; I went to Walker's, in Beaufort-street, Strand, and found a pair of bracelets, and some other things at his mother's, which I produced before the Magistrate; he said the prosecutor had given them to him.</p>

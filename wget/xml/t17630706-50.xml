               <p>William Wall.

               <p>Wall. She was mentioned before the sitting Alderman; I went directly home, and five or six of our people came along with me to St. Sepulchre's watch-house, and took a parcel of the watchmen, and the Constable of the night; he knocked at the door, and

             would not let us in; the Constable of the night pulled down a window-shutter, then she let us in; four or five of the people made over the houses, and four or five of us followed them, by going up a trap door; we took the prisoner below in the next house; she owned she had been in my company, but had not the watch, but would not own that before the sitting Alderman. I never found my watch again.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to think she stole it?</p>
               <p>Wall. I saw it in her hand in the room that night, and asked her for it, she said I should not have it; I do not know whether it fell out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible it might fall out?</p>
               <p>Wall. It might; there is a bed in the room, I was upon the bed, I was afraid to take it from her, the place had so bad a name.</p>

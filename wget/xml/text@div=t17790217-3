I left it on my desk on Wednesday the 27th of January, at eleven at night; I missed it on Thursday morning very early; I made great search, but could not find it; it was stopped on Thursday at about seven o'clock, at Mr. Leighton's, a pawnbroker in Wardour street; he came and asked me if I had suffered a loss that day; I said I had lost a diamond slider. He produced it. It is worth fifteen or sixteen pounds. The prisoner was my <rs id="t17790217-3-deflabel19" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>I am journeyman to Mr. Leighton, in Wardour-street, Soho. I have in my hand a gold slider which I stopped on the prisoner. He came on Thursday the 28th of January, about seven in the evening, and asked to borrow half a guinea on it. I asked him who it belonged to, as I did not think it was his own, he seemed staggered at the question; then he said it was the maid servant's in the house where he lived, and that she had sent it to pawn.</p>
               <p>Did he tell you where he lived? - Yes. I asked if I should send to the house; he said he did not choose it. I took him to his mistress's door; he then said his mistress came late from the masquerade, and lost it, and he found it in the kennel all over mud. I then suspected the maid was concerned, and took him back to my own house, and sent for a constable, and took him before the justice, and he then said he found it in the kennel. I applied to his mistress that evening, and she said she had lost it, but did not know by whom it was stolen.</p>

I intrusted him to receive money of them - he was to account for it directly he came home - I had a customer of the name of Comber; Fray is his servant. On the 7th of April, I sent them a sack of coals by the prisoner; he was to bring back 4 s.; he returned, and said they would pay next time - I supposed that it was all right. He left me on Saturday, the 10th of April without warning; I had paid him 7 s. a week, and gave him tea, and what we could conveniently spare; he said he should come on the Monday, but I did not see him again till the Tuesday fortnight, when I took him into custody; I called on Mr. Comber, who paid me for the coals, but I returned the money, suspecting that my servant had robbed me.</p>

On Monday following, the 9th of July, in the morning, I got up a little before seven o'clock, and went into the stable. I perceived that my brown gelding was gone. I came from the stable into the garden. I saw the gardener, and asked him if he had seen William. The gardener told me he had not seen him that morning; that he had seen the key in the stable; and, missing the horse, he thought he was gone to take a ride. As he had no orders from me to take the horse, I thought it extremely odd he should take that liberty. I walked about the garden, thinking he might return about the time he expected I should rise. I waited till nine o'clock. He did not return. Then I suspected something had happened. I was determined to come to town. I called for my boots: they were missing. I enquired after the prisoner's clothes: I found they were gone. I came to town, and immediately went to the office in Bow-street; and, pursuing such methods as they thought proper, to apprehend him, I advertised the horse several days. Some time after, the horse was found at the Queen's-head, in Gray's-inn-lane.</p>
               <p>How long had the prisoner lived with you? - Five weeks. I had an exceeding good character with him, from a gentleman who knew his family. The horse was a brown gelding, with a star in his forehead, seven years old, fourteen hands and one inch high.</p>
               <p>Did you see the horse in the stable overnight? - I did.</p>

               <p>To Mr. Mainwaring. How far is your house from London? - About 17 miles.</p>
               <p>To Nowle. What did he say to you? - He desired me to give him a seed of corn, and he would come by-and-by for it. He had boots on: as for spurs, I cannot tell. The horse was there eight or nine days, before the prisoner was apprehended.</p>

There was something else, belonging to Mr. Mainwaring; but it is not proper to mention it on this indictment. We took him to Bow-street. We found he stood advertised by Mr. Mainwaring.

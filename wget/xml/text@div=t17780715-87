               <p>I went on the 26th of June to apprehend Milbourn; I received an information on the 25th, that Voiture and the two prisoners used the Three Hats at Islington, and breakfasted there generally in a morning; I went on the 26th; they did not come; but opposite the Three Hats, Milbourn was a-bed up one pair of stairs; I sent the officers over; he was apprehended and kept in custody for about half an hour; I sent him home and went down to his mother's and Voiture's; for they live together in Goswell-street; when I came there I shut up the door close; in about a quarter of an hour the prisoner Allen came in; he was taken into custody likewise; I searched the room, and in one corner of the room there was a trunk, which I broke open.</p>
               <p>Had that trunk any name upon it? - No; the first thing I saw was two suits of brown clothes with plain silver buttons on them; a quantity of other clothes, and five pair of new shoes, and in the foot of one of the pair of shoes was I think forty-two guineas and two half guineas; and I found this pocket-book in it, (producing it.) Allen owned that that pocket-book was his; in that pocket-book there is a bill and receipt of the purchase of some buttons. (The bill and receipt was read in Court.) He said before the justice, that what was written in the pocket-book was his own writing. They both lodged in that room and lay together; there was all their clothes in that one box in that room. I found thirty-nine guineas upon Voiture.</p>
               <p>[In the pocket-book there was an account of expenditures from the 15th of June, to the amount of two hundred and thirty-two pounds five shillings and seven-pence.]</p>

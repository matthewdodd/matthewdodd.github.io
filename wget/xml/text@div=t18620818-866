                  </hi>. I was residing at 34, Upper King-street, Hol<lb></lb>born—on 9th July, I returned home about a quarter-past 11, and found the prisoners at my door—I could not swear that they were trying to get in—I said, "What do you want," and Tucker began directly to beat and strike me in the head, and took hold of my neck and took my watch—I called out, "Stop thief!"—he bad my watch in his hand, and the other one wanted to take my pocket-book—I could not struggle with them because they were beating me—they both of them struck me; Goldsmith beat me again before the policeman—Tucker succeeded in getting my watch—they got nothing else—I took it back from his hand; the chain was broken—Goldsmith struck me again—they did not get the watch again—the chain was not broken in any getting it back; but it was broken when I had got it back—it went through the buttons of my waistcoat, not round my neck—I succeeded in ringing the bell, and then they both ran away—I did not see them stopped—I saw them when the gentleman had stopped them—I could not see them from my house when they were stopped, but I am quite sure they are the two men—I lost sight of them about a minute—after the policeman came up, Goldsmith struck me again in the mouth, and on the top of my head, and bent my head down—the other man did not do anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a professor of music of St John's street-road—on the night of 9th July, I was in the neighbourhood of South<lb></lb>ampton-street, Bloomsbury, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw two men running towards me from King-street—I stopped Tucker, and my friend, who is not here, took the other one—I saw Mr. Depoix come—I saw Gold-smith strike him—I am certain these are the two men I saw running—I recollect the officers coming up—Tucker said it was not him, when I first took hold of him, but it was his friend—that was all he said—the prose<lb></lb>cutor came up directly.</p>

It it likely I could bend his hand down as he says I did, and have hold of his throat and take his watch all at the same time. Tucker is a perfect stranger to me.</p>

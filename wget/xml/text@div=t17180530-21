The Servant deposed the same, adding that he going down into the Cellar to draw some Sider, met the Prisoner on the Stairs different from what he went down, and asking him what he did there, he pretended he had mistaken his way; but when he came into the Cellar saw the Cock taken out of the But of Stout, and another out of the Cask of Sider, and the Liquors running about the Cellar; however the Prisoner got off for that time, but was afterwards taken by accident. The Prisoner denied the Fact, or that he ever was in the Prosecutor's House in his Life.

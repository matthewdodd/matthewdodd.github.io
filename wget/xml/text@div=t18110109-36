On last Monday afternoon about four o'clock, two women came into the shop and asked to look at some ribbons. I took out the box, and they took up some ribbons to look at. The prisoner came in, he asked to look at some ribbons. He stood close by the women, put his hand over the box, took out a piece of satin ribbon, and was putting it into his pocket; I said you have got a piece of ribbon; he put it back again, and immediately took up a piece of broad sarsenett ribbon,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181101090035"></xptr>and ran out of the shop immediately, and the women after him.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of it was there - A. About eighteen yards, worth nine shillings, it cost me more. I ran to the door after him; my brother was coming up to the door at the time; his name is

               <p>JAMES TAYLOR. I and the prosecutrix's brother-in-law were coming from the timber yard with a deal, a piece on our shoulders, when we came to the door, Mrs. Whiffen said, brother, that man has got a piece of ribbon from me; we put down our deals, pursued the prisoner and took him; he continued to run till we overtook him, we took him back to the shop; I told the prisoner in the shop, after Whiffen was gone for the officer, if he would give up the ribbon he might go about his business; he put his right hand into his left coat pocket, took out the ribbon, put it under his blue apron, and dropped it under the leg of the table; the officer came immediately after that.</p>

             KING sworn. - Examined by Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280086"></xptr>Knapp. I am clerk to Mr. Litchfield, Solicitor for the Customs. (Reads the names of the Commissioners from the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the names of the commissioners? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Lucas demanded a shilling of me, and said I should not work there long if I did not give it him; the next day he asked me for a shilling again; some time after that I met him upon London-bridge, and my wife was with me; he asked me where I was going, and I told him I was going to work in the Borough; and he told me I was very foolish not to give him the shilling, for I might have staid there till now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Lucas.) Q. Is there a word of truth in any thing he has said? - A. Not the least; it is as false as there is a God in heaven.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He says he met with you upon London-bridge? - A. I never saw him from the time he made his escape till I saw him before the Magistrate at Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened it that you let the man go when you found the property about him? - A. Years back it was a customary thing to take the tobacco from the men, and let them go; Government did not think it worth their while to prosecute, but carrying things on to such a pitch in taking the tobacco, Government began to be more severe, and thought proper to prosecute them; I did not know that till after the man was gone, when one Mr. Kelly, who is warehouse-keeper to the merchants, told me I had done wrong in not detaining him.</p>
               <p>Mr. King. With respect to this warehouse, there has been no prosecution for stealing tobacco since Mr. Litchfield has been Solicitor for the Customs.</p>

             sworn. - All I have got to say, is, that I nursed the prisoner's wife during the time that this transaction transpired, and while I was there they were very much distrest for money, and he left his work and went to work over London-bridge, at Mr. Mackenzie's; he is a sawyer by trade; and being short of money he took me one morning over London-bridge.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after the transaction of the tobacco? - A. Yes; it was the latter end of September; his wife was delivered on the 2d of September; he was going to take me to his master's for some money; we met a man upon London-bridge, I am not confident who the man was; there were some words between them; the man said, you were very foolish to leave your employ; he said, how came you to be such a fool to leave your business; had you given me a shilling, this would not have happened.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that man; is that the man? - A. I think it is like the man; I won't take my oath of it; I believe you are the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you meet him in the month of September, at any time? - A. I never saw him from the time he went away till I saw him before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not meet you several times, both morning and evening, as you were going to and from the tobacco-warehouses, and I going into the Borough to work; did not you and I go to the Tumble-down Dick in the Borough, and have a pint of porter, and toss which should pay for it? - A. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Lucas.) Q. Where do you live? - A. In Little Suffolk-street, in the Mint, in the Borough.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. How long have you been an officer employed by the Customs? - A. Twenty-oneyears next Christmas.</p>

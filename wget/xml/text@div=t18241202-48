            . I am the prisoner's wife; we were married eleven years ago. On the 30th of October, about a quarter to nine o'clock at night, I was in <placeName id="t18241202-48-crimeloc256">Bucklersbury</placeName>

I put my hand up to keep it from me, as much as I could, and I think the balls must have gone over my head. When he had fired it he knocked me down, and beat me with it, and was going to load it again, but I took hold of it. I took hold of it when he first presented it, to keep it off, and my hand was black with the powder.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he going to load it with? A. He was going to take something out of his right hand pocket. I tried to get the pistol out of his hand, but he knocked me down, and beat me on the head with it. I was taken to St. Bartholomew's hospital for the wounds I received on the head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you saw him with the pistol, you turned it out of the way? A. I put my hand up. I must have touched it with my hand; the point of the pistol was directed towards me - I put up my hand, diverted it, and it was fired over me. I did not touch it till he was going to reload it. I cannot say whether there were any balls in it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Wallbrook. I was crossing the end of Bucklersbury, and heard a female scream, and immediately heard the report of a pistol. I went into Bucklersbury, and saw the prisoner violently beating this woman. They both fell to the ground, and as they arose, I laid hold of him, and asked what he had done - he said he was satisfied in what he had done - that she was his wife, and had been treacherous to him, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182412020023"></xptr>had shot her. He made no resistance, but gave himself up. I delivered him to Cecil: it happened nearly opposite to Mr. Banks's door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not come up until the pistol had been fired? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in - I searched him, found some powder in a tobacco box, some shots in a paper, and a knife in his pocket. I very particularly examined the shutters about the spot, and all about Mr. Banks's house; there was no appearance of shots having lodged there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What shot are they? A. Very small; I think No. 2; such as birds are shot with. I took him to the Compter that night.</p>

            . On the night in question, about nine o'clock, I searched the area of Mr. Banks's house, a hatter, in Bucklersbury, and found a pistol, which I produce, in the state in which I found it; the lock is down - that is the only particular appearance of its having been fired.</p>

            . I am a City marshal. I saw the prisoner in the watch-house after he was in custody, and asked him if the pistol was loaded with ball; he said No, for he could not get ball; that it was loaded with shot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not his words "I could not get ball, but I have got shot?" A. No; he said it was loaded with shot. I was about half an hour with him - he appeared inebriated, but besides that, from his appearance, I thought him insane.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What led you to think so? A. Merely from his manner and expressions. He said he was extremely happy in what he had done - that he felt quite easy in his mind in having attempted to destroy her; he only wished it had taken effect. He spoke but little, only when he was spoken to; he was not at all violent in his manner, but sat down quietly in the corner of the watch-house.</p>
               <p>MARY DEVOLL re-examined. I cannot say whether the pistol is the same, or like it - I did not notice it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How much of the eleven years have you lived with him? A. Not long at a time - he sold my furniture several times, and I was obliged to leave him. I never went by any other name but his, and my maiden name, Mills, and that was at his request.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever gone by the name of Clayton? A. Yes. I was married before I married him; it was his wish that I should go by those names. I never passed as Barnett. I lodged with a man named Wells, and people, who chose to make a mistake, called me Mrs. Wells - I lodged with him, but did not live with him. I never heard of the prisoner's hanging himself. He told me about three years ago that he was going to a situation at Brentwood; I got his things ready; he got into a coach, and said, "I am going into the country, you will not see me any more," and with that took out a knife and stabbed himself. I have every reason to believe that he is not in a right state of mind, for he has been confined as a lunatic.</p>

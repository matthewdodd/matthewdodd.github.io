               <p>On the 2d of June my house was broke open, my apprentice was last up the night before, he is here: about six in the morning we were alarmed; my servant alarmed me first, he called me out of bed; the cellar window appeared to be forced open by some kind of an instrument, it had been fastened by two bolts, which were forced back: I lost the things mentioned in the indictment, but the tobacco I lost was my greatest loss; I was directed to the King's Arms, there I saw my sack, and some soap; I went home, and there I saw I had lost some soap: the sack was marked J. H. on one side, and J. Hogskins on the other, that sack was in my house before the robbery; I cannot say positively who it came from, it was there the day before, I am sure of that, I look upon it it came from Mr. Stone, because I had some bags from him.</p>
               <p>What was in the sack? - The shag tobacco.</p>
               <p>How comes it there is no tobacco in this indictment? - Because it was found in the street; there was some soap without a mark, common yellow soap, not in the sack; the prisoner was in the house when I found these things.</p>
               <p>What did he say or do? - He did not say anything to me there, there were other people there.</p>
               <p>What connection had he with the sack or the soap? - None that I know of.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Are you a licenced dealer in tobacco? - There are no licenced dealers.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was headborough of the night, the 2d of June, on my return, I found the prisoner stopped with some soap, which he said he had brought from board a vessel, I believe he said a French vessel, I removed him to our lower town watch-house, and in going along, I observed something bulky in his coat pockets; I searched him, and in each of the pockets of his coat I found an apron, which the prosecutor's wife swore to the next morning, I took him to the office; the King's Arms is opposite to it; he said he had the aprons from the same place where he had the soap, on board the ship; this soap, and the apron, and the bag of tobacco, another watchman had stopped another man with a bag of tobacco on his back, and the other man who had it ran away.</p>
               <p>Court. Let me look at the two aprons before I examine the woman.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Beaumont. Did you see any of the things afterwards that the constable found on this prisoner? - I saw them at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Do you know any of them? - Nothing but the two aprons; one was a very dirty check apron, a little daubed with red paint; the other was a rough-dry white apron, which was full of iron-moulds, which I had folded up and hung over a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290049"></xptr> chair; here is the fellow apron to the check, the coloured apron has no mark, but diaper tape at the top, and seamed up the middle with blue thread, I seamed it myself, I can speak to it being my own work.</p>
               <p>(The aprons deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You told me twice, it had no mark.</p>
               <p>Court. If it has a mark, what is the mark ? - I cannot say, I have had it these dozen years; I think one mark is an M; I am not sure, the aprons I bought out of pawn, and I cannot say, it is such a quantity of years.</p>
               <p>Is this an M? - No, it is not, I have one that has an M. it is a very old apron.</p>
               <p>Court. But if you have had it so long you must have taken notice of it? - I know it by the iron-moulds, and being rough-dried; I can swear to my own work, I darned it myself .</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now about this same blue apron, is that an old one? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not twenty women sew check aprons with blue thread? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Now is this said draper tape a curiosity? - It is very dear, it is not extravagant, they last so much longer.</p>

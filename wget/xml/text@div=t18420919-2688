                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Fernie, a shipwright I went to work on his premises at six o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of September—I missed a log of timber, which I had seen safe at six the night before, when I went away—it had been fastened with staples, and floated on the tide—I got a boat, and found the log, about half-part two in the day, in a barge in which the prisoner was—I went on board,</p>

               <p>examined it, and told him my master bad lost a log of timber, and this one resembled it very much—he said that could not be, for he bought it of a Mr. Watts, or Watson, over the water—I said I could swear to its being my master's—I went into the street through his premises—he called me into a passage, and said, "Come here want to speak to you; I will tell you what it is—between you and me, I bought this piece of timber <hi rend="italic">on the cross</hi>"—I said it was a bad job—he said, "Can't you and me settle this? go and say you can't find it"—I said, "I have got a wife as well as you; if I don't find it, I shall lose my place"—he said, "Go, and say you can find nothing of it; if you can find a person who can keep a secret, I will sign any paper, and pay you any thing afterwards, if you are made to pay for it"—I said, "No, my master must know it".</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipwright in the prosecutor's employ. The prisoner came to the premises, and said he wanted to see Mr. Fernie—I said he was out, was it any thing I could do?—He said he had fallen into a bad job, he had bought a log from a lighterman, or a dredger-man—he said be paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and he bought it of a very bad character—I know this log—it is my master's, and should think it worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would not a timber-merchant know the value of it better than you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I never was in the habit of buying timber. <hi rend="smallCaps">THOMAS FERNIE</hi>. I am a shipwright, and live at Wapping. The prisoner and my foreman came to me—he said a bad job had happened; he had a log of timber of mine, which he bought of a dredger-man, and he gave 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I told him he must know it was worth more than that—he said he knew it was, and offered to pay me the value of it, and the expense, which I declined—I went with him to his premises, and identified the log as mine—it is worth between 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know it to be mine by my marks on it—I had seen it safe at eleven o'clock the night before.</p>

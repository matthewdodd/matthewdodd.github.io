Between ten and eleven on Saturday evening, the 1st of June, I saw the prisoner at a public-house—I was going away from her—she said, "You must not go just yet"—I told her I would give her a punch of the head if she did not let me go—she laid hold of my waistcoat, and would not let me go—she asked me for money—I said I had not got any—she pulled a knife out of her pocket, opened it, and said, "I will put this into you if you touch me"—I either hit or shoved her away—she stabbed me in the arm and said, "You b——, if you come here I will give you more"—I saw a policeman about ten minutes after it was done—he asked me who did it—I said, "I do not know," because I did not like to give her in charge—I had been living with her—I was taken to the station-house—they asked who did it—I told them.</p>

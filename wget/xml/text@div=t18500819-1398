                  </hi>. I am an oilman, of 69, New Church-street, Mary-le-bone. On the night of 8th July I had come up from Erith, and was waiting in the Haymarket, about a quarter to eleven o'clock, for somebody who was indebted to me, and had gone into a house there—the prisoner came up, and began talking about the weather—I had never seen him before—I waiting talking to him about three-quarters of an hour—I crossed the road towards Piccadilly—he followed me immediately, and said he was going that way, towards Oxford-street—I said, "Are you?"—he said, "Will you take a glass of ale?"—I consented, and we had a pint of ale between us—in Regent-street he said he was in a great muddle—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said he was locked out—I asked him how old he was, and where he lived—he said nearly twenty, and he lived in Oxford-street; that his father was a very severe man; and if he was out alter a certain time, one of the servants would be sure to tell his father—I asked him if he could not go to one of the neighbours—he said he did not like to throw himself upon his friends, and that his father had been an upholsterer in Oxford-street some years—I said, "You had better go to a public house or tavern"—he said he had no money—I said, "If you like to walk home to St. John's Wood with me, you can share my room to-night"—we walked home together, and went to bed—he shared my bed with me—after I had been in bed some time, I was awoke by his arm across my chest—I asked him what was the matter—he immediately moved his arm, and said he felt very ill—I gave him a light, and he west down-stairs—I got into bed, and dozed off—I awoke again, and found him sitting in a chair by the side of the bed, with his clothes on—he had taken them off at first—I went to sleep again—I awoke a third time, and saw him washing himself—I asked if he had been down-stairs again—he said, "No, I am going down"—I said, "Very well, I will rouse myself up, and let you out"—he said, "What is the time?"—I went to take my watch from under my pillow, and he said, "I have got your watch, I have just taken it from</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185008190029"></xptr>
               <p>under your pillow"—I said, "Have you?"—he said, "Yes; it is such a curious face, I cannot tell the time by it"—I said, "If you will give it to me, I will soon tell you the time"—he took it to the window, and said, "Oh, I can tell the time now; it is twenty-five minutes past four; it is very pretty, I shall keep this," and he put it and the chain into his pocket—he did it in a jocular way, and thinking he was in play, I said nothing—he then went to my dressing-case, and said, "Let me see what else you have here"—I got out of bed, and said there was nothing there belonging to him, and demanded the watch and chain—he said, "You don't sup<lb></lb>pose I am going to give you that, do you?"—I said, "Are you going to commit a felony, then?"—he said, with an oath, "That is no felony; what are you going to give me for bringing me home last night?" I said, "I have given you a night's lodging, and treated you like a brother; what else can you expect?"—he took his oath that he would not give it me unless 1 gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l,;</hi> or he said, "I shall accuse you of an unnatural offence"—I turned round, and found I was locked in, and he had the key in his hand—I felt very much alarmed, and fainted away—when I came to myself, I was sitting on a chair by the side of the bed, and the prisoner was bathing my hand or my head with water—finding I was more collected, he opened all the drawers, and took out two waistcoats, but there was nothing in them—he went to the waistcoat I had worn, and took out 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or more, and put it into his pocket—I got up to snatch the waistcoat from him, and he demanded 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me again for the watch and chain, or else he would charge me with an unnatural offence, and said that he had made 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by such a job—I said, "I will give you the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you will let me let you out"—he helped me on with my trowsers and stockings to go down and get it—I could not put them on myself, I was in such a state from excitement and fainting—I opened the door at last, and called for Mr. Sarto, who slept in the room above—he came, and I told him the prisoner had my watch and chain in his pocket, and would not give it me unless I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or else he would accuse me of an unnatural act—Mr. Sarto said, "I will go and get a police<lb></lb>man"—the prisoner said, "Yes, that is the best way"—he did not contradict what I said—he said, "You shall not say I have stolen your things, I will put them back again"—he went to the bed, turned them out, and said, "There they are in your dressing-case, now I shall go"—I said, "You shall not go," and tried to prevent him; but he dragged me down, and rushed down-stairs—I found the watch and guard in my dressing-case, but not the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a writer to the Great Western Railway I lodge with Mr. Brown, and sleep in the room above him. On 19th July, about five o'clock in the morning, I was called—I went down, and saw the prisoner and Mr. Brown, who said, "This young man has got my watch and chain, and says he will not give it up unless I give him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and if I do not, he will accuse me of bringing him home with the intention of committing an unnatural crime," he asked my opinion of what he should do—the pri<lb></lb>soner heard it all, but never said a word—I said it would be best to fetch a policeman—the prisoner said, "Yes," that would be best—I went out, and found one, and in bringing him towards Mr. Brown's, the prisoner ran out of the house as fast as he could—the policeman gave chase, took him, brought him back, and found 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver in one waistcoat pocket—he objected to be searched, and said there was nothing there which belonged to anybody but himself—he was left at the bottom of the stairs with me, while the policeman and Mr. Brown went up—I kept my back against the door, and the prisoner said, in a soft tone, "Now, as a married man, don't you think it looks bad for Mr. Brown to bring a man home to sleep with him?"—I said I knew nothing of the affairs between him and Mr. Brown.</p>

               <p>I keep a fruit-stall at the corner of the Chapter-house. The prisoner came to me and asked me how I sold my peaches; I said two a penny; she offered me a sixpence; I asked her if it was a good one, and gave it her again; she said it was a good one; I took it and put it in my pocket; I had only a crooked sixpence and a plain one. As I was giving her change, the man came up and asked for the sixpence.</p>

               <p>I was charged to aid and assist in taking the prisoner. There was a man that was taken up with her; I had this sixpence from the last witness (producing it).</p>
               <p>Fitzgerald. That is the sixpence the prisoner gave me.</p>
               <p>To Wiltshire. Did you search the man that was taken up with her? - Yes, there were eighteen bad sixpences found upon him, and five afterwards, and nine shillings and twopence halfpenny all in halfpence; in his side pocket there was found a duplicate of a ring, he put it in his mouth and tore it in three pieces; the constable took it from him; he said it would do them no good; the woman said my dear let them have it. Squires said to the woman I must search you, he took her up stairs, and searched her.</p>

                  </hi> I am an inspector of the detective police, Scotland Yard—on 24th April, 1866, the prisoner called on me and had some con<lb></lb>versation with me in reference to forged Russian notes—I showed him a forged Russian note which he had sent me, it is the one produced—he said that he had received it from a man named Powell, who was lodging in his house, and that he had arranged with him to get more notes from him—he knew who I was—about four days afterwards, I believe on the 30th, he called again, and brought me four twenty-five rouble notes which he said he had received from Powell, and that he was making arrangements to find</p>

               <p>out who were the makers of these notes, so that he might give me informa<lb></lb>tion, and he might be arrested—he told me that he would have to return the notes to Powell that night, or else take back to him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him back the notes, after taking the numbers and dates—this is the paper upon which I wrote them—I told him I wished he would give me some proof that what he had been telling me was true, and he volunteered to take the notes to Whitechapel, and give them back to the man of whom he had received them, in my presence—I told him to be careful what he did with them, and that if he did not return them to the man or bring them back to me, if he was ever found dealing with them, or if he fell into the hands of the police with these notes, it would be the same as if he was uttering them—I went, according to his appointment, to the place he indicated, a public house in Whitechapel, close to his house—I waited there an hour and a half, but saw nothing of the prisoner—I never saw him again to speak to him until June this year—on 1st June, in consequence of a communication, I went to a certain place in Whitechapel, where I saw a man named Prosinowski; he made a statement to me, and produced a forged rouble note, which I have here, marked B—the note which the prisoner sent to me I did not return to him, I paid him for it; I gave him the full value, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this note marked B is one of the four notes which the prisoner produced to me in April, and of which I took the particulars—in consequence of what Prosinowski told me I sent for the prisoner there and then, and he came to where I was—I had this note in my possession—I said to the prisoner in Prosinowski's presence, "This man is found in possession of a forged twenty-five rouble note, which he says you gave him this evening to utter"—the prisoner asked to see the note—I produced it, and at the same time cautioned him that whatever he might say might be used against him at a future time—he looked at the note and said, "I did not give it to Prosinowski, and I never saw it before in my life"—I said, "That cannot be correct, because the note in question is one of the four notes you brought to me in April last"—he said, "No, it cannot be one of those notes, because after I left you I was so frightened that I tore up the four notes I had shown you, and threw away the pieces"—I asked him if he had any papers about him—he produced this book, and in it I found an entry of the number of the note marked B—I asked him if that was in his handwriting—he said it was—I asked if he knew the note this number referred to—he said he did not—it is written in pencil—I then took him into custody—I afterwards went to the place where he lived in Leman Street, and searched, and in the room occupied by him I found this other book, in which are entries of the numbers of the four notes that he brought to me in April last—two of the numbers are repeated—on 3rd or 4th November last I saw two notes, the numbers of which corresponded with two of these four that the prisoner brought to me—they were brought to me by somebody else, a person living in the prisoner's house.</p>

               <p>acting on behalf of the Russian Government to detect these notes—I know a man named Gudstadt, he was lodging in the prisoner's house at a late date—the prisoner did not give me any information with regard to Gud<lb></lb>stadt—I know that Gudstadt has left this couutry—I don't think he took a vast number of forged Russian notes with him; I won't say I am sure of it—it was not stated that he did—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) this looks like an official letter from the Russian Government—I know that the prisoner has not given a great deal of information to the Russian Government respect<lb></lb>ing these forged notes—I am not aware that they wrote to him thanking him for the information he had given—I never heard of it with reference to Gudstadt—I believe Gudstadt was a great friend of the witness Nathan—Nathan is a tailor—he knows a great many Jews at the East end, and pre<lb></lb>tends to know a great deal about Russian notes—I told Nathan if he heard anything to come and see me from time to time, that I would hear what he had to say, and see if it would be of any service—I said nothing of that sort to the prisoner—I saw him three or four times; that was only with reference to Powell, who was then living in his house—Prosinowski was also lodging there—I know nothing of Prosiuowski's character—I know very little of him—I have never seen the Russian official documents of con<lb></lb>viction—I did not arrest the prisoner when he brought me the notes, because he pretended to have information respecting other persons, and by allowing him to return the notes to the man that had given them to him there would be a chance of discovering where they were made; under those circumstances I allowed him to take them away, but I took the numbers first—the place where the appointment was made was close to his house; that was the same evening when he arranged to return them—it was the third or fourth time of his coming to me—I did not go back with him and arrest the man, because I am pretty well known among the Jews at the East end—I had no sergeant at hand just then—it was not a ques<lb></lb>tion of arresting—it was a question of seeing the notes returned to the man who had given them to him—I went to the place and waited, but neither came; it would have been unwise to have gone with the prisoner—I did not see the prisoner again till June—it would not be fair to tell you why—he did not leave his lodging—I heard that Powell knew nothing about the notes, and that it was the prisoner's intentions to <hi rend="italic">plant</hi> them upon him, that he might be apprehended; under those circumstances I refused to see him again—Powell did not quit the country then—he left some three or four months afterwards, and I believe is now in Paris—I believe Prosinowski went to lodge with the prisoner five or six months ago; I don't think he was lodging there at the same time as Powell—the men who give informa<lb></lb>tion are rewarded.</p>

"—he said, "Yes"—he turned round into another room, and brought me two or three twenty-five rouble notes—I said, "I am afraid of this sort of business, and I don't want to do anything of the kind"—he said, "Oh, you are a fool, they are very good indeed, nobody can detect them"—I said, "That might be, I don't know much of these notes, they may be good or they may not, only I am afraid; I don't want to do such a business, I never done such a thing, and I don't want to do it"—he spoke to me about it several times; he used to come to my house—he said business was very bad—it was middling, but I declined it—he asked me to go to Russia—I said, "Why don't you go? "—he said, "I must not go, but I will send my wife with you if you like"—I said, "No, I don't want to do such a business"—I declined it several times—I can't say when I first gave information about this—he came to my place one Saturday with two young men, to take his likeness, which I did—after that Mr. Nathan came to my place; I then said something of what had occurred.</p>

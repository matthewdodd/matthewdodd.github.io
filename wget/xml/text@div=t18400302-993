                  </hi>. I lost some flour on the 19th of February—that was second flour—it was in this bag, which I had done up on Tuesday night, the 18th, and it was found on the 19th, in the cupboard in the prisoner's room—the prisoner at first said she had no flour, and when the policeman went to the cupboard she said she had it of my servant—there were two bags of flour gone that morning, one marked, which was torn up, and this one, which was not marked.</p>

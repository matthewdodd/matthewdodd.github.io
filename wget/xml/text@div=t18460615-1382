               <p>with the prisoner, No. 2, Neat-street, Coburg-road, Old Kent-road; the prisoner occupies one front room. On Saturday, the 6th of June, toon after twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner come home, out of a I public-house—he was very drunk and quarrelsome—he went up stairs into his bed-room—I went to bed—I did not hurry myself to bed—after I had been in my bed-room some time, I heard a scream of "Murder!" from his wife—that was about half-past twelve—I came out of my room, and saw his wife standing on the landing-place, in her shift—the door of his room was open, and the prisoner was against the door—he shut the door, and shut him<lb></lb>self in—his wife was out—she screamed, "Oh! my child," three times—I opened the room-door, went in, and saw the prisoner standing at his child's feet, and was about to strike—he had a weapon in his hand, which is called a "glen"—I caught it from his hand, and prevented him, and sent him across the room—I said, "You villain! what are you at?"—he never spoke, but stood amazed—the child was lying in bed, in his blood—his head was hurt—his name was Henry, and he was nine years old—I screamed for assist<lb></lb>ance—I never heard the prisoner speak a word after he came in.</p>

On Sunday morning, about half-past one o'clock, I was called into the pri<lb></lb>soner's house—I went to his room, which is on the first floor—on entering the room, I saw him standing, with nothing on but his shirt—he seemed drunk—he told me he would put his clothes on and go quietly with me—I told him when I entered the room, there was a very serious charge against him, for striking his child on the head—he said he knew he had done it, and he hoped he had done it effectually, that he had had it in his mind for six months past—he put on his clothes, and after that repeated what he had previously said, he hoped he had done it effectually—he went with me—I found this instrument at his lodging—it is a combmaker's instrument—he is a corabmaker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at No. 6, Surrey-place, Old Kent-road. On Sunday morning, near one o'clock, I was called into the prisoner's house, to see a little boy—I examined him, and found a severe contused wound on the right temple—the right eye was very much bloodshot—this instrument would produce such a wound—the child is now recovered—I did not see the prisoner at that time—I saw him on his way to the police-station—I asked him how he came to do such a foolish thing—he said he wished the poor boy was dead—he spoke affectionately of the child—he was in a very excited state, as a roan in liquor would be, and repeated similar words—his mind appeared to be in a very unsettled state—he appeared to know what he had done, but I can scarcely say.</p>

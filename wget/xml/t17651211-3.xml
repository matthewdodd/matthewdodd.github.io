            . I am wife to the prosecutor. We have our goods in a two pair of stairs room, where we lodge. The prisoner had access to that room at times. On Monday was three weeks I rung the bell for the prisoner, she not coming, I waited a great while, at last went down and found her dead drunk and asleep in the kitchen. I went to Mrs. Deblee, at whose house we live, and desired her to go with me and see what a pickle my servant was in; she informed me the prisoner had that morning brought to her a piece of muslin, and desired her to cut her out an apron of it; that morning I looked at it, and said she was both a thief and a drunkard, for that was my muslin. We went to her and awaked her; I' desired her to unlock her box which was in the kitchen; she did. The first thing I found was the piece of wrapping callicoe, then two pieces of Irish linen, with my shop mark upon them; then we desired her to unlock her trunk; in that we found a remnant of long lawn, with our mark upon it. I, by inquiry, got another piece which she had carried out, and left with

Mrs. Sheldon desired me about two o'clock one day to go and see what a pickle her maid was in; I went and found her drunk and asleep; we awaked her and desired her to open her box, which she did, and the things Mrs. Sheldon has mentioned were found there and in her trunk.</p>
               <p>Catherine Deblee.

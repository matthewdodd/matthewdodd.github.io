               <p>About two o'clock on the 12th of November, I saw the prisoner Walker in my shop, she was looking at some silk handkerchiefs, I was backwards in the parlour, I do not know how long she had been in the shop, I only saw her when she was going out; two or three minutes after she came back, and the other woman Taunton who had the goods, which I took out of her apron; it is my cotton, and has my shop mark on it; she did not buy any thing of me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Walker. When I was examined before my Lord Mayor, the gentleman said he had no mark on this piece of linen, he could only swear to it, by having such a piece of linen in his shop in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that so Mr. Webster? - It is not, it has my own private mark upon it.</p>

            - Yes.</p>
               <p>That sort of mark I believe is the mark of very many tradesmen besides you. - Yes.</p>
               <p>And that mark is not of your own making. - It is not.</p>
               <p>Therefore all that you can say is, that it is such a mark as you mark goods with. - Several other retail drapers have goods marked in the same way; I saw this very piece of goods myself in the morning.</p>

               <p>On the 12th of November about two, I saw the young woman Taunton stand in the street, about twenty yards from Mr. Webster's shop, on the same side of the way; I had some little suspicion of her, I looked through my shop window, which looks into Mr. Webster's shop, and saw a person in the shop, I saw her come out, and she turned on the left hand side of the shop step; and looked in at one window, and then at the other: Taunton seeing her come out, came a little nearer the shop, then Mary Walker went into the shop again, and in about five minutes came out; after she came out of the shop, she made up to the other that was looking in at a silver-smith's shop window, they were going up a passage at the corner; but as I suppose somebody was coming, and they went a few yards further, and stood at a gentleman's door;

I am a schoolmaster at Forty-hill—I live in a house attached to the school—I remember 22nd February—I cannot speak positively as to whether it was Saturday or Sunday—I lost something, but was not aware of my loss till the policeman told me of it—these articles (produced) are what I lost—it is a case of mathematical instruments—it was on Ash Wednesday that the policeman came to me—he took me to see Watts—the things had been in a desk in the school-room; some were on the desk, and some in it—I last saw them safe in my possession on Saturday the 18th—they are mine—I know them by the tap that I set up, and a wheel that I used for a certain purpose—I have used them for many years—I saw Watts before, on the Sunday as I was going to Church.</p>

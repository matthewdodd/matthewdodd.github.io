                  </hi>. I am the son of William Covell, a butcher, in Broad<lb></lb>way, Deptford. The prisoner was in his employ—in consequence of sus<lb></lb>picions I entertained on the 17th of April, I marked one half-crown, seven shillings, six sixpences, and three fourpenny pieces, and put them into the till—I examined the till the following morning, and found the marked money still there—I then put it into a purse into a desk in the shop, and af<lb></lb>terwards missed the money from the desk, but not the purse—I sent for a policeman—the prisoner was searched—one marked shilling was found on him, and another the policeman got from the maid servant—I had left the key of the desk on the mantel-shelf in the parlour, and the desk was in the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you paid the prisoner any silver between the time of your de<lb></lb>positing the money in the desk, and your causing him to be taken into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—most of that was in sixpences and four-penny pieces—I cannot tell what the rest was—I cannot say whether there were any shillings—I paid it him on the Sunday morning previous to his being taken—I will swear I did not pay him as many as eleven shillings—I had not marked any other money before—it was about eleven o'clock on Thursday night, that I found the marked money gone from the desk—it was about one o'clock in the afternoon that the prisoner and Munns were playing at <hi rend="italic">cock-shy</hi>—the prisoner lost two shillings to me the day before, and two shillings to Munns—he continued to play with Munns and I left them—I did not go after that, and play at skittles at the Druid's Head—I had been there on the Monday before with Munns, and the prisoner wished to go to stick up the skittles—I scarcely ever played before, and should not then had it not been for my cousin Munns being in town—I am not in the habit of frequenting skittle-grounds—I will swear I did not play at <hi rend="italic">cock-shy</hi> with the prisoner on the Thursday that he was taken—I wished the prisoner to go about his business, because I wished the business to be done—there were some sheep to be killed, and I wished him to go and do it—(<hi rend="italic">my father was at home at the time</hi>)—he said he wished to have a game first—I told him to go and kill the sheep—nothing else passed—we did not quarrel—I think they left off playing in my presence—it was about three o'clock in the afternoon—not so late as five or six o'clock—the prisoner came to live with my father through a friend—he was not engaged because I was in the habit of playing at skittles and <hi rend="italic">cock-shy</hi>, and would not attend to the business.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. The prisoner borrowed eighteen-pence of me about two months ago, and on the 26th of April he paid me one shilling of it back—he said, he had not got a six<lb></lb>pence—I put the shilling into my pocket, and gave it to the officer</p>

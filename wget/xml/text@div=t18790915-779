                  </hi>. I live at 31, George Street, Croydon, a private house—on the 26th June I let a sitting-room and bedroom to a Mr. Drew at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he came again on the 28th, Saturday—he did not sleep there—I did not see him there again till Wednesday, the 2nd July—he came again on Thursday—Bangham came on the 2nd July (? 9th), when Drew was there, and on Saturday the 5th (? 12th)—he came again on the Monday and not after I received this letter from Mr. Drew (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also received a letter from him for his clerk on the Saturday, which I laid on the table for him, and gave it him when he came in—he went away between 3 and 4 o'clock—Drew did not come that day—I think I got another letter from Drew enclosing one for his clerk—I always laid them on the table as they came in—Bangham came somewhere about 9 on the Monday morning.</p>

From instructions I. received I went to Croydon, on Saturday, the 12th July, at about 8.30 a.m.—I saw Bangham in North End coming from the direction of the London and South Western Bank towards George Street—I and some other officers followed him—he went right through George Street, and I lost sight of him at the West Croydon Railway Station—I last saw him in Croydon about 12 or 1 o'clock at the North End, at the end of George Street—I went to Croydon again, on Monday, the 14th July, with Sergeant Outram, when I saw Bangham at the counter of the London and South Western Bank at 9.30—from a communication made to me I went outside the bank with Outram—I saw Bangham some twenty or thirty yards off, being followed by Outram—I saw Fortesque just outside the bank, on the same side of the way, strolling along—he passed me slowly and looked in at a shop window—I stopped short and beckoned to Outram to stop Bangham—I said to</p>

               <p>Fortesque, "Your friend is coming back"—he said, "I have no friend"—I said, "You must come along with us," meaning Trafford, a constable, and myself—we then took him into the bank—I said, "Will you give me your card?"—he said, "I have not got one"—I said, "Will you give me your name and address?"—he said, "I am a gentleman"—I said, "What an you?" and he repeated "I am a gentleman"—I said, "What are you doing down here?"—he said, "I have an appointment with a lady—I don't understand why I am detained—what are you?"—I said, "We belong to the police"—he said, "I thought it was something of that sort—I can't understand why I am detained"—I said, "You will be charged with being concerned in uttering a forged cheque at this bank—you will have to go to the police station"—he made no remark on that—I left him in charge of Trafford and went in a room in the bank where Bangham was in conversa<lb></lb>tion with Outram—I said to him, "Where were you going to take the money?"—he said, "To George Street"—I said, "Where is Drew?"—he said, "I don't know, I have to meet him at Hun? mum's Hotel, Covent Garden, at 11 this morning, in the coffee room"—I believe this is the letter he showed me.

I asked Bangham where Drew's London place of business was—he said, "King Street, Covent Garden"—I said, "We know"—he said, "I don't know, I was never there and don't know the place"—I said, "Where have you seen Drew besides at George Street?"—he said, "Nowhere else; everything was done by letter, and I only saw him at George Street twice"—I afterwards went to Bow Lane Police Station, where the prisoners had been brought by Outram, Trafford, and two other constables—I said to Bangham, "What did you do with the pass-book you received at the bank on the 12th?"—he said, "I took it to George Street"—I said, "Where did you get it this morning?"—he said, "At George Street"—I said, "Why did you take it back to the bank?"—he said, "I thought it the best thing to do"—I was present when the prisoners were charged—the station sergeant asked Fortesque his name and address, and he said, "With all due respect to everybody present I decline to give my name and address"—I went to 164a, Liverpool Road, Islington, the address Bangham gave—his mother lives there—she gave me a copy of the Daily News, of July 7th, containing this advertisement.

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and am the landlady of the Hotel Phoenix, Praed Street, Paddington—I had a person of the name of Lewis staying at the hotel—prior to the 7th July some letters had been left by the postman at my place addressed to W. Shannon—this is one of them</p>

I am clerk in the Inland Revenue Office at 183, Great Portland Street—Bangham was employed there from 2nd January to 8tb February, 1879, as copyist—I know his handwriting—this letter marked "B.T." was received by the Inland Office from Bangham—I believe it to be his writing—I have frequently seen him write. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "51, Pentohville Road, London, 21-1-79.—Sir, I regret to inform you that I am unable to attend at the office to-day, as I am suffering severely from neuralgia; I shall hope to attend to-morrow. Yours obediently, H. W. Bangham.") This blue counterfoil book is called the establishment licence book—Bangham wrote licence forms in this book—there are numerous entries of his here—"H. G. Griffiths, Belmont House, Hampstead"—the figures are in Bangham's handwriting—"James Jordan "is very similar to his handwriting—the writing in the body of this cheque signed James Jordan does not appear to be the same writing as the signature—the "Albert Drew "is evidently the same, written by the same person as the James Jordan—the money is not—this letter, "Sir,—In reply to your ad<lb></lb>vertisement," is to the best of my belief in his writing.</p>

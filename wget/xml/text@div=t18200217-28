On Wednesday, the 26th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop and asked for a pair of gloves; I opened not less than three dozen before I could find a pair large enough to fit him - I tried to fit him, and took notice of the size of his hand, it was particularly long and large; I at last fitted him. He also bought two pair of drawers, six pair of men's and four pair of women's lamb's-wool stockings, two nets for the neck, and three pair of muffatees, they came to 2 l. 12 s. He said he was going into the country by the coach, and gave me a 10 l. Bank note. My daughter was present, and said,</p>

               <p>"Then you must send the goods;" she gave him the note, then took it out of his hand again, and said she would try another neighbour, a Mr. Manson - she went out; a man came in, about two minutes after she went out, and said in the prisoner's presence that he was come for a pair of stockings, which he had been for in the afternoon, when I could not change him a 1 l. note - (he had been in the afternoon, and offered me a 1 l. note - I did not like the looks of him nor the note). He paid me 3 s. in silver for the stockings. While he stood there, the prisoner said,</p>

               <p>"Yes, it is." I folded the stockings up and the man went away. The prisoner directly got up, and said he must go, he could not wait, and I must send the goods. He was moving rather in a hurry towards the door, I asked him what his name was? he said, as he was going out,</p>

I went with her servant to the George and Dragon, Jermyn-street; the servant carried the goods - I remained at some distance from her; she came out in about three minutes, and we went to the Old White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly - there is no Old White Horse Cellar at Charing-cross. We afterwards returned to the George and Dragon, waited there two hours and a half, and enquired for a person named West - a person calling himself West had been there to write a note; I found no direction about leaving the things, On the 3d of February I was informed that a man resembling the prisoner was in Tothil-fields prison, and I immediately took Mrs. Applebee and her daughter there.

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes, and have been so twenty-two years. The 10 l. note is forged in every respect; it is neither the Bank paper, plate, or the signature of Phillips. The 5 l. note is also forged in every respect.</p>

We went into several—public-houses. Coming home along the Cambridge Road I fell down or sat down, I don't know what became of me. When I got up the door was ajar, and the constable said be saw me come out of the shop and took me back and asked the prosecutor to give me in custody, and said "If I will take him, will you come?"

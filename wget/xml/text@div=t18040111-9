             sworn. - I am a constable of Aldgate ward: I was sent for to Billiter-lane on the 16th of December last, about half past two o'clock, to take charge of the prisoner at the bar; I went, and searched him; I found in the after-part of his small clothes this bag of galls, weighing three pounds six ounces, (produces it.) I then went to the prisoner's lodgings in a lane in Horslydown-court, where I found pepper, indigo, borax, loose galls, and a number of other things.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Matthews.) Those are the sort of articles that would be in the India Company's warehouses? - A. We have articles of that description; these are blue galls, and correspond exactly with the galls in the warehouse; he was at work close by this heap of galls; I took him to be a very honest man till this time.</p>

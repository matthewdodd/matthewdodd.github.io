On the 16th of December last, in the morning, I observed that somebody had been trying to take away my pump, the over night; the spout of it was very much bent; the pump stood in a back yard; the wood is fixed to the house, and the lead is fixed to the wood; being in London the next day, I was on horseback; and the turnpike man asked me to alight, and shewed me the pump; I had not missed it before I went to London; the turnpike man's name is Henry; I knew the pump; it was the whole of the pump, as far as was above the ground; I went home to see if mine was gone; and it was; and I let him know; I knew it by being so particularly bent in the spout; I observed no letters upon it: I did not compare it afterwards, being so very positive it was mine: it is not a large pump, and the spout very narrow, remarkably narrow; the pump is here: I went to the turnpike with a friend: I saw the prisoner three or four days before this happened; he used frequently to pass through the house; ours is a publick-house; and the prisoner and his master live in the Mews; they are chimney-sweepers: after looking at the pump, I sent my servant for it; and from the description of the patrol, I apprehended the prisoner; and he came to me and acknowledged that he had took it, after some persuasions.</p>
               <p>Court. You told him it would be better for him if he confessed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>- HENRY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am employed at present, on the road, as a patrol man. On the 17th of December, between seven and eight in the evening, I perceived the prisoner passing by my box, which is just by Tyburn turnpike; he was coming from Paddington; he had a bundle, which seemed very heavy; I came out of my box, and went up to him, and laid hold of his load; I perceived it was of substance; and asked him what he had? he said, it was lead, he found it in the road; it was wrapped up in a bag; and was going to take it to the watch-house; I laid hold of him, and brought him back towards my box; and he dropt it down so gently, while I was going to my box, to get my piece, that I did not even hear him drop it; and he made off; I made a noise, but could not catch him that night; the next day I saw him again: I took the lead to the turnpike; the turnpike man is not here; the next day the proprietor took it away; but I did not see him: I saw it at the turnpike the next morning, the 18th.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that the lead which you saw the next day, was the lead you had brought there? - By the bend of the spout I can. In the evening of the 18th I saw the prisoner again, at the prosecutor's, where he was sent for; I could not altogether so well swear to him, it being dark, though his voice I knew; and by his size, I could well guess, but could not positively swear.</p>
               <p>The prisoner now makes a very different appearance? - Very different.</p>
               <p>Can you swear he is the boy? - By nothing but his mere confession.</p>

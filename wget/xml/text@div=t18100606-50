On the 26th of April, I cannot say the hour it was between twelve and five some where about the middle of the day, she came to our shop for half a yard of Irish linen, I sold her the half yard of Irish linen she paid eleven pence for it. I was engaged with other customers while she was looking at different things on the counter, we had a great many pieces of printed cotton laying on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. How many other shopmen were there in the shop serving beside, you - A. Only myself, Mr. Blower's, and his wife went in the parlour at the back of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door of the parlour open or shut - A. Shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a glass door - A. Yes, a looking glass door, not to look through, persons within could not see the shop excepting through a small side window.</p>
               <p>Q. Could they see through the side window as they sat in the parlour - A. No; they must come up to the window for the purpose of looking through.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think the prisoner staid in your shop, altogether - A. About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she dressed - A. As she is now with a shawl and no cloak, she went out of the shop, and in five minutes after she was gone I missed nine yards of printed cotton, the moment Mr. Blowers came into the shop I missed the cotton, I told him I missed the print.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the woman went out of the shop were there any other customers in the shop besides her - A. Yes, several others, I ran out of the shop and pursued the prisoner, I saw her going into Howland-street, I ran into Howland-street, and overtook her, and as she was walking the way to the watch house, I said very little to her, she wished to know what I wanted with her, I laid hold of her shoulder, I told her that she had stolen something, she said, she had not, I told her I was certain that she had; then she said, she had; and gave the cotton to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she take it from - A. It was concealed under her clothes, she put her hand under her apron or gown, I am not certain which, and she produced it, I took it and her likewise to the watch house, I gave the cotton to Mr. Baker, the watch house keeper. The next day she was taken before the magistrate, and committed.</p>
               <p>- BAKER. I am the watch-house keeper. The prisoner and this piece of cotton was delivered into my charge, I have had the cotton ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gudgeon. Look at that printed cotton does that belong to Mr. Blowers - A. Yes, I know it by my own mark.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear that that piece of cotton was laying on the counter when the prisoner came into the shop - A. Yes, and it is the piece of cotton the prisoner gave me when I overtook her.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181006060031"></xptr>Q. What is the value of that piece of cotton - A. Ten shillings it cost more, it would sell for twelve shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into that man's house, to buy a bit of linen, I asked him if he had any linen at one and eleven pence per yard, he said, he had, he asked me to wait, I was not well I sat down on a stool, I asked this boy would he please to cut off a bit of linen for me, he did, going out of the door I being very ill I caught hold of the rail of the door. A woman came and gave me this bit of cotton in my hand, and immediately this boy came and put his hand on my shoulder, he asked me what I had got; I said, I did not know that woman gave it me, she was gone to get a coach I was so ill, I was not able to go home. When I was taken to the watch house, the bit of cotton was given to the watch house keeper's wife, when the watch house keeper came in he was very tipsey, there was a milkman there he said, he knew me, and that I was a hard working woman.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your business?</p>
               <p>West. I am a hosier and haberdasher: these were part of the handkerchiefs found upon Gammon, (nine in number produced). I can swear to all of them, but particularly one of them.</p>

               <p>William Hill. I am a butcher, and live in Chiswell-street. I know Davis very well; he came to my house, and asked my wife, if she would drink a draught of purl? I was at home; he asked me to drink also: then he asked Imer and Gammon to come up into my room.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Hill. This was Christmas-eve, about 7 o'clock. I sat with my back to them, and never got up; they had some handkerchiefs, but I did not look at them, so as to take much notice of them. I heard them say they had thirty-three.</p>
               <p>Q. Which said that?</p>
               <p>Hill. I cannot tell which said it.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of handkerchiefs?</p>
               <p>Field. Some silk ones, and some cotton ones; they took them all out of my room, but two, which they dropped: them I gave to Mr. Wright.</p>

               <p>Q. Did they know your business?</p>
               <p>Gammon. They did: they asked me if I would go up to Islington with them: I said, I could not, because I had no money: they said, never mind that, that does not signify: so I went along with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Gammon. This was about one o'clock in the day; we went together to the Coach and Horses there, and had two pots of beer, and bread and cheese, and gin; when we came back it was dark: they said, they knew of a place where they could get some handkerchiefs, and asked me to go along with them: I said, I would; we went down St. John's-street, and up the city, to the back of the Royal Exchange: then they shewed me the prosecutor's shop, and bid me push the window in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in the shop?</p>
               <p>Gammon. There were people backwards, in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you push the window in?</p>
               <p>Gammon. I did; then Davis took out a piece of handkerchiefs, and gave it to Imer; he went with it, and stood just by, till we got the rest out.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity did you take?</p>
               <p>Gammon. There were twenty-five silk and cotton ones, and eight silk ones: Imer stood at the corner of a gateway.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the last parcel out?</p>
               <p>Gammon. Davis did, and gave them to me; I carried them to Imer.</p>

               <p>[Continuation of the Trial of Davis and Imer.]</p>
               <p>Q. WHAT time of the night was this?</p>
               <p>Gammon. This was nearer seven o'clock than six.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark, or light?</p>
               <p>Gammon. It was dark, at that time, about five.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do, when you had got them out?</p>
               <p>Gammon. Then we went over Moor-fields, till we came to the corner of Bunhill-row; there was a woman stood with fruit: Davis went and spoke to her; what he said to her I know not: then we went up a turning, and Davis went up a pair of stairs, into a room; and called us up after him: there was this butcher that has given evidence, and a little girl: he sent the girl down for that woman that was selling fruit. She came, and brought up a pot of purl: there we opened the handkerchiefs, and counted them, to see how many there were.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the butcher employed?</p>
               <p>Gammon. He was sitting by the fire: he saw us come in, and must see the handkerchiefs on the table, but he did not get up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay there?</p>
               <p>Gammon. About ten minutes: we wrapped the handkerchiefs up in an old one, and Imer said, he would go and sell them. He went to a place down Field-lane, while Davis and I stood up a turning; then he came back, and told us he could not sell them: then he said, he would go and leave them in Bleeding-hart-yard: we all three went there: he asked somebody for the key of Bett Field's room, and got it. Imer went up, and stood at the door: he said he would leave them there, and he knew of a place to get some more. We left them there, and went down as far as the end of Fleet-lane: then we said, as we had not sold them, it did not signify to get any more: so we went back, and bought a candle, and went all three into the room, where we divided them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many had you a-piece?</p>
               <p>Gammon. We had eleven each. As we were counting them on the table, she came in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of any being drop'd?</p>
               <p>Gammon. No, I did not: I had all my eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. from Imer. Did you ever see me carry any handkerchiefs up into that house?</p>
               <p>Gammon. No: it was Davis that carried them up.</p>
               <p>Q. from Imer. Had I the key, to unlock the door?</p>
               <p>Gammon. No: Davis had the key, but you was with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176501160023"></xptr>Davis's Defence.</p>
               <p>Going along the lower end of Bread-street, I met this lad, Gammon, with a bundle: he said, So, where are you going? I said, to my mother's: he said, I found a bundle going a cross Moorfields; he laid them on the table: there were a parcel of handkerchiefs: he asked me to go and tell them; I said, I would have no concern with them; this was at Mr. Hill's daughter's house; he lives in Chiswell-street: we were going home, and he was going that way; the woman named Haines, lives below; Gammon was not acquainted at that house: I have seen Gammon two or three times at my grandfather's, but was not acquainted with him. The handkerchiefs he had were all dirty.</p>
               <p>Imer's Defence.</p>
               <p>I went on the other side of the water with Davis, to see his wife in the hospital: coming back, we met this lad; he said, he had found some handkerchiefs; we went to Mr. Hill's with them; t he bundle was put upon the table, and he opened them, to the best of my knowledge; he counted either eleven or thirteen: he wanted me to go and help to sell them: I said, I would have no concern with them.</p>

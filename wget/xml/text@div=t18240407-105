            . My husband is a clock-maker - we live in Rose-alley. On the 22d of February, I was at the <placeName id="t18240407-105-crimeloc594">Cooper's Arms-public house</placeName>

I had half a pint of beer, and warmed it in the tap room, he came up and squared in my face, and said he would fight me, and stamped on my toes - he insisted upon stamping on my toes and used bad language, and struck me on the side of my face; I cannot say whether he was drunk. The prisoner was sitting on the other side of the tap-room alone. Parteridge went up to him, and spilled his beer over him. The prisoner said he hoped he would pay for another pint; he then struck him over the head. I turned my head, and did not see whether the prisoner returned the blow. I saw his arms round the prisoner's neck, and both fell.</p>

            . I keep the Cooper's Arms. I was called into the tap-room. One M'Keal was in the act of rising to strike Parteridge, who was in liquor; he turned round and behaved very indecent to Stokes, then jumped about, and knocked the prisoner's beer over. Stokes slapped his face, and he struck her. A man jumped up and struck him, and just as the prisoner was rising, Parteridge turned and struck him on the side of the neck. The prisoner returned the blow, and both fell. I picked Parteridge up, and he was taken home.</p>

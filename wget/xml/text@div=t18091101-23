            . On the 28th of September, the prisoner accompanied by another woman, came to our house about a quarter after six in the evening to match a pattern of silk. I was alone in the shop, one of the women came to me, and asked me, if I could match the pattern; I told her we had not the colour and if we had I could not match it by candle light, being purple and green, to the best of my knowledge on my reply she kept close to me my, back being to the window,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180911010018"></xptr>while I was looking at the pattern by the candle, the prisoner went out, and I thought she went out rather suspicious; I cast my eye to the window, I found that a piece of linen cloth was gone, I immediately ran after her, and took her about two yards, from the door.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a piece that you had in your recollection being in the window before. - A. Yes, I dressed the window myself and I knew I had placed it there on which we placed some lustres in the day, to show to the best advantage; I pursued her I took hold of her hand, and she had the piece of cloth in her right hand, she made some remark, pleading for mercy; I took her back to the shop, called my employer down; I told him the affair, and then he sent for a constable and gave her into custody.</p>
               <p>BARNES. I am a constable, who took the charge of the prisoner and the cloth.</p>
               <p>GRIFFITHS. It is my masters property, it is the piece of cloth that the prisoner took.</p>

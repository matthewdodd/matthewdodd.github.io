            . Q. Are you acquainted with the three prisoners at the bar - A. I am; I have known Badcock about a twelvementh, or rather more; Hill and 
               <persName id="t18130602-54-person418">Brady</persName>
             some years; two years latterly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Cook - A. I do; I have known him upwards of three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been engaged with these parties in various transactions - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of August last year was it agreed between you to do anything respecting any bankers in the City - A. It was in the middle of August we agreed to commit forgeries upon the house of Robarts, and other bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the parties in that agreement - A. Brady, Badcock, Hill and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. For the purpose of concerting the mode had you various meetings - A. We had; we met at the Horn tavern, in Goodliman-street; and I think once at the Swan tavern, in Sloane-street; our principal place was at the Horn tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you met at the Swan tavern in Sloane-street, do you remember what time of the day it was - A. I think it was in the morning part.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what refreshment you had - A. Some sandwiches, and sherry.</p>
               <p>Q. You say your principal place was the Horn tavern - A. It was. It was agreed that Cook should forge the drafts and Hill should obtain the copies: that he should obtain small drafts for the purpose of copying the hand writing to obtain genuine checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards meet and receive from Hill any genuine checks - A. We did; that was about the middle of the month of August; I cannot state the precise day; it was at the Horn tavern, Doctor's-commons. They were delivered to Cook by Hill, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hill tell you from whom he obtained them - A. No, he did not; I understood that he was acquainted with a man of the name of Parsons by report only.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they were delivered to Cook, what was Cook to do - A. Cook was to forge other checks from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it understood further what was Hill to do in the business - A. It was understood that Hill was not to be present at all, at any future part of the business; not at the committing the forgeries, or at the uttering.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he intended to do with himself - A. He did not tell me, but I understood he was to be out of town at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive back the three checks which you saw Hill give to him - A. I did, with other checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the house of Robarts and receive the amount of these checks - A. I firmly believe I did; it was a day or two previous to the forgery being uttered; I went and received the amount of the genuine checks.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and tell me whether you believe these to be the checks - A. I believe these to be the checks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. One dated 17th of August, 1812, Messrs. Robarts and Curtis, pay Messrs. Magnay and Pickering, nineteen pounds ten shillings, Priest Shrubb; another dated 12th of August on Robarts and Curtis, drawn by Walker, for six pounds; another 12th of August, nine pounds ten shillings, drawn for Burchall and Company; all three on Robarts and Curtis's house.</p>
               <p>Richardson. I think I received twenty-five pounds in notes, and part of it I think I received a twenty-pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Brady and you in two or three days after any arching anything, any intercharge with paper -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181306020023"></xptr>A. I cannot recollect that; I met Brady afterwards, I do not recollect paying him any money.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you receive from Cook the forged checks - A. On Friday the 4th of September; I received from Cook, a number of forged drafts at his house, King's-road, Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that one of the forged drafts that you so received of Cook - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did Cook and you come to the Horns tavern - A. Yes; I think Cook, myself, and Badcock, to the best of my recollection on the 4th.</p>
               <p>Q. What was agreed between you to be done - A. It was agreed that various forged drafts should be uttered, and we agreed to meet there the next day that is Saturday. On the morning of the 5th, I met Brady, Badcock, and Cook, at the Horn, we met together to consult about uttering these, and other notes; we had very little conversation on the subject, as it had been previously arranged, that Badcock and myself were to go with these drafts, and negotiate them; that had been settled at that, and other meetings. When we met that day, after we remained a short time in the coffee-room at the Horn, Brady and Cook parted; I understood they went to Moorgate coffee-house, as I was told. I accompanied Badcock to Milk-street. I had the forged draft when I went out of the Horn, and in my way I gave it to Badcock. Badcock delivered the forged draft to a porter in Milk-street; I suppose then I was about twenty yards from him. I followed the porter to the house of Robarts and Curtis; I went into the banking-house; I had some country note to change, payable at Robarts's.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the object of your going with the porter to the bankers - A. In case the check should be paid I was to come back and give notice to Badcock, who waited at a public-house in the neighbourhood; I think at the Bull's Head, in Bread-street. I saw the porter present the check at the compter, and receive the money. After having seen that, I returned to the public-house to Badcock, and told him the draft was paid; Badcock then went to Milk-street, and received the money of the porter, five hundred and ninety pounds. I was standing at the time he received it thirty or forty yards from him; after Badcock had received this of the porter Badcock and I joined in company, we went to the Bolt in Tun coffee-house, in Bouverie-street, and there we divided it; Badcock retained three fifth shares, and gave me two for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were these three shares for - A. Hill, Brady, and himself; he gave me two shares for myself, and Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you receive for your two fifths - A. I am not able to say.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was the whole sum you divided - A. I think three thousand eight hundred pounds; that was the produce of this day, and the day preceding.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the evening did you part any of this you so received - A. I did, to a man of the name of Birkett, the man that stood at the bar just now; I let Birkett have eleven one hundred pound notes at the rate eighty pounds for an hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe in the course of the last winter you were taken up - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. When apprehended you disclosed this and other transactions - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe some years ago you were convicted here - A. Some years ago I was, sir; I think twelve years ago.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Pell. About twelve years ago you went from there to the hulks - A. Yes; I was sentenced for seven years. I staid there the whole seven years nearly; I served seven years, from the date of my sentence.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you on board the hulks - A. Nearly the whole of seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been concerned in transactions of this most infamous nature - A. I never kept any account; a bad action needs not to be recorded. I am not able to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Hill live when you first knew him - A. I first knew him in Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know whether at any time of his life he lived in Whitechapel, and kept a public-house - A. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Cook - A. That is a difficult question for me to answer, except in being engaged in these transactions; he has gained his livelyhood in an honest ways, and some in dishonest ways.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give me the time you met Hill upon this business - A. I think towards the 20th. I do not know that I am correct; I only know by report that he was out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that meeting on the 20th - A. I think at the Horn tavern. I was there about half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a private-room - A. I do not know that we had the day that Hill was with us. I had about three meetings with Hill himself, and others; they were previous to the 20th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at the next meeting before the 20th of August - A. I think Cook only.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at the first meeting - A. I think Brady, but I am not positive as to that. We had one meeting in addition at the Swan tavern, Sloane-street.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told me you did not see Hill after the 20th of August - A. Not to my knowledge; I never saw him after that day, until I saw him here now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Badcock appear to know, or did you know the porter that was sent to Robarts - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hill know him - A. No, he was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. Then according to your opinion Hill obtained the checks as copies, from which the forgeries were to take place - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you learned from Hill that he was to obtain these checks from Parsons - A. I never learned it immediately from Hill; I heard it at the first meeting, at the Horn tavern; it was generally stated in conversation, and well understood by the whole of us; I cannot recollect who stated it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lockhart. Q. You have stated that you have been in the hulks a considerable time, and that you served your time out there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You think you have atoned for your offence by serving your time out - A. No doubt, sir. I was discharged regularly.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Did you meet Hill, Brady, and Richardson - A. Yes; I met them there two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time in August - A. To the best of my recollection about the 20th.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purpose of the meetings - A. To commit forgeries.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose was to be the hand to commit the forgeries - A. I, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. By what means were you to be enabled to commit the forgery - A. By a draft that I understood was obtained by Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at either of these meetings receive any draft from him - A. I am not certain, I think I received three from him. Richardson was present at the meeting, and Brady was there I think. I do not remember whether any other person was there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these the three drafts so received - A. I think they are.</p>
               <p>Q. One is drawn by Priest Shrubb, nine pounds ten shillings; assisted by that, did you forge the check that you have in your hand for five hundred and ninety pounds - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had forged it to whom did you give back the three genuine bills - A. To Richardson, and the forged draft for five hundred and ninety pounds I gave to Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting at the Horn tavern, in Doctor's Commons, in the beginning of September - A. Yes. I do not remember the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting there the day the forged check was uttered - A. We did. I then met Richardson, Brady, and Badcock; this forgery was to be presented by Badcock; I left the Horn, and Brady and I went to the Moorgate coffee-house. Brady and me left the Horn, and left Richardson and Badcock.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see any of the party again - A. The same day, I saw Badcock, and Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that day or the next day receive any produce of the draft - A. I received part of the five hundred and ninety pounds on that day, or the next day, my share. I received the fifth part of Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 20th of August, when you met at Doctor's Commons, was anything said what was to be done with Hill - A. I understood from him that he was to leave town.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Pell. Where did you commit the forgery - A. At my own house, King's-road Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been concerned in many forgeries - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had brought against you any charge of having committed a forgery - A. I acknowledged it. I do not recollect the time I was so charged.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish you to state, if you can, who it was said Hill was to provide the genuine checks - A. Brady. I cannot tell what meeting that was.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your occupation in life now besides committing forgeries - A. I cannot tell you. I was an hosier once; for the last twelve years I have supported myself by these depredations; I have forged instruments. I was a witness here last sessions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you know Richardson in the year 1801 - A. I have heard him say he was convicted of larceny. I do not know the year nor the charge.</p>

You having a great variety of these small drafts in your possession; you have, as has been most convenient, given them to Mr. Hill, or to Mr. Nash, to cash for you - A. Yes. Mr. Hill and me had many transactions together. Mr. Hill lent me money; he lent me one hundred pounds; I paid him twenty-five pounds; I am indebted to him seventy-five pounds.

Yes, I do; Badcock, he was the person that sent me; he asked me if I knew Robarts, Curtis, and Company, Lombard-street; I told him, yes.

               <p>Badcock's Defence. I can say no more than I am innocent.</p>
               <p>Brady's Defence. Respecting the twenty pound note that Mr. Partridge says he received of me, I purchased five hundred pound stock. I knew Mr. Partridge, and he knew me. I had five hundred and fifty pound standing at that time in the name of Hazard. Is it reasonable to suppose that I had the most distant idea that was part a forgery? and to part with it where I was likely to be criminated for it: had I known how it was obtained, can it he supposed that I would have gone to the stockbroker where I was known. The name of Swan, Manchester, I told him in the street; as for Suffolk-street I am not acquainted with: I only did it for a family motive; and how I came possessed of the twenty pound note I cannot say. I was in the habit of receiving and paying a great deal of money. The name of

We three persons formed a sort of triangle, with Mr. Payne standing at the apex, so that the ball would not pass Mrs. Pepper, it would go on the opposite tide, and strike the wall; a ball discharged from a pistol that size would go fifteen or sixteen yards before it fell. I will produce a witness who saw me load the pistol the night before with a charge of powder and paper, but no bullet; I told the policeman I could not bring my case before the public in connation with the money, as it embroiled me with Mrs. Williams's husband. He said, 'Was the pistol loaded?' I said, 'Yes, but not with a bullet, only with paper and powder.'

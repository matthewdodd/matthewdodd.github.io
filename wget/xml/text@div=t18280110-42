I came to town with some cattle on the 4th of January, and brought them to market to sell - I brought eighteen beasts - I sold seventeen on the 4th, as I thought, but sent only fifteen of them away - the three remained, which were two cows, with each a calf, and one in calf. On the evening of the 4th of January I was at the Lock and Key public-house, Smithfield, and saw the prisoner there - he sent for me out of the room - I went out to him into the bar - I knew him before - I had had one transaction with him before, and only one; I had sold him a cow and calf at Barnet-fair, on the 4th of September - he had not money enough to pay for them - I said I could not let them go without the money - he said if I would keep them till Thursday, he would bring the money to Laycook's, at Islington, and they were delivered to him on the Thursday, from Laycock's shed, at Islington.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100048"></xptr>Q. Well, how did your conversation begin with him at Smithfield? A. He asked if I had any thing left - I said I had one left, and two more, which I had sold, but the man had not fetched them, and if he did not come for them by eight o'clock the next morning, I would sell them - he asked where I should be at eight o'clock - I said at the Grapes public-house, which was next door; I asked him to come and breakfast with me; he said he would, by eight o'clock, without fail - this was about five in the evening - nothing further was said that night; he wished me goodnight, and I wished him the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any inquiry about the beasts? state all the conversation that passed that night? A. He asked whether they had calved; I said two had calved, and one had not; nothing further passed at all; I am quite sure that is all the conversation we had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about what was to be given for the cows, or what he wanted? A. No price was mentioned; he did not ask the price, nor did I set any price, nor did he say he should wish to bargain for them; he only asked what I had, and that is all that passed; I waited for him on the following morning, till half-past nine o'clock - he did not come - I sold one of the cows that day to Mr. Howard, of Queen-street, Seven-dials, for eighteen guineas, and I had to send the other two to Mr. Styles; I went to Laycock's that day, and took two men to take the two cows to Mr. Styles, and one to Howard; Styles lives in Upper Gower-mews, Bedford-square; I stated at the office about making this sale to Howard and Styles; when I got to Laycock's I found one of the cows and calf was not there - they were worth 18l.; it was a red roan cow, a kind of strawberry-colour; the cows and calves were all the sole property of William Smeeton, my father; I have no share in the business; I was going to leave town that day, but stopped to find the prisoner; it was Saturday; I had told the prisoner I should leave town that day - I am sure of that - I saw the cow again last Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has your father no partner? A. No; I do business for my father - he does not pay me; I have no share at all in the business; I had seen the prisoner but once before; he paid me for that transaction, but not all at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not usual in your business, when a dealer wishes to buy a beast, that he takes it, and it is left to the salesman afterwards to settle the price? A. Yes, sometimes, but it must be a gentleman whom we know well - it is very seldom done. I have known Mr. Styles twelve months: I am certain none of my brothers are in partnership with my father.</p>
               <p>Q. Although you have only had one transaction with the prisoner, has he not several times bid money for cattle? A. Never.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Was there ever such a bargain between you and the prisoner, as for him to take cattle, and you to fix the price afterwards? A. Never.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would you have allowed him to take any of your cattle without a regular bargain, and the money being paid? A. No.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Laycock, of Islington, who keeps places for housing and foddering cattle. I know the prisoner; he came to me on Saturday morning, the 5th of January, about eleven o'clock, in the lairs at Islington, and asked me if Mr. Smeeton had not got three cows there - I said Yes, and showed them to him - he said, "Those are the two cows which I have bought," pointing to a cow and calf, and one that was in calf - he said he had bought them of Smeeton, and said, "This old devil here, he wanted to shove upon me, but I would not buy it;" (meaning the third cow, which was older than the others) he said, "I did not know this cow was so lame, for I sold it last night to a gentleman for 21l." - that was a cow in calf; he did not say who he had sold it to - he told me he had bought the cows for 37l., and paid for them - he said he was to meet Mr. Smeeton, and breakfast with him, at the Grapes, but had not seen him: that was all the conversation I had with him. He waited at our place for Mr. Smeeton for an hour, and then said he would wait no longer - he said the other cow was lame; I said if he took it away he would ruin it, and he had better leave it there, and I would dress it; he said if I would, he would satisfy me for it, and would fetch it on the Thursday; he said he was going to take the cow and call to Wandsworth, but did not say who to: he had come to our place before, about Barnet fair time, for a cow which he had bought at Barnet, of Smeeton: he fetched it away from our place. He drove the cow and calf away - I went part of the way with him - it was a strawberry colour.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you in Mr. Laycock's employ? A. I look after his cattle. The prisoner said he lived at Wandsworth-common - I knew his name before - I should have given him the other cow if he had chosen, but he left it behind, and for that reason I had no suspicion; I suppose the one left behind was worth about 17l. - this was on Saturday: he came after two more cows on the Monday following - I saw him myself; he knew that I knew Smeeton; it was about twelve o'clock when he drove away the cow and calf. I understand he has been a dealer in cattle; I am not the foreman - I am under the foreman. I went to Battersea-bridge, to the prisoner's father's house, with the officer, on the Saturday on which he had the cow away, and he came to our yard on the following Monday; I told his father he had got a wrong cow; I did not state that it was an officer who was with me; he told me he was to meet Smeeton at the Grapes, but said he had not seen him.</p>
               <p>MR. QUIN. Q. Do you mean to say he said he had not seen Smeeton, or that you yourself say so? A. He said he had not seen Smeeton on the Saturday - I believed, from what he said, that he had purchased the cows.</p>

            . I am a cow-dealer, and live at the Bull public-house, at Holloway. On the 5th of January, as near one o'clock as possible, I was in Bridge-street, Blackfriars', and saw the prisoner driving a cow and calf; whether he asked me to buy it, or I asked him to sell it, I cannot say, but he asked me eighteen guineas for it - I bid him 15l. for the cow and calf; I asked how he came by her, and he said he had her from Cambridgeshire, or something to that effect; I looked at the cow more steady, and saw it was one I had seen exposed for sale on the Thursday before, at Mr. Laycock's lairs; I then went away, declining to buy it, in consequence of suspicions; he had offered it to me at 18l. I walked away, being determined not to purchase it, and told him his story was an untruth; I have seen the cow and calf since, and am quite<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100049"></xptr>certain they are the same as he offered to me; I saw them yesterday morning, at Mr. Laycock's lair; I saw them on the evening after he offered them to me, at Mr. Lewis', in the Borough, and was sure they were the same - it was a strawberry cow, of a Lincolnshire breed.</p>

On Saturday, the 5th of January, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner at my premises; he said he had a cow and calf in the street, and if I was a buyer he would sell them to me worth the money; I asked him to bring them into the yard, for me to examine; he did so; I asked where he brought them from - he said they came from Smithfield that day - that he had turned his back a little, and the man took the cow away, for that money, as far as Blackfriars - that he and another ran after her, and brought her back, and he had lost the sale of her for the day; he took her to the Ram yard, Smithfield, and locked her up all night - he said he would sell her worth the money, as he wanted the money to go to a fair in the country; he asked 16l. for it; I offered him 14l., which he took. I paid him for them, and gave them up next day to the officer.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Laycock. I know the prisoner by sight. On Monday, the 7th of January, I saw him at Laycock's yard, about five o'clock in the afternoon - he asked for his two cows - I am sure he asked for two; he did not show me which two he meant; I told him he had none there - he said he had two, which he had bought of Mr. Smeeton (the strawberry cow and the calf had then been brought back by the officer;) I spoke to Mr. Laycock, and the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to his father's house? A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS COPE. I am a constable of Islington. On Monday, the 7th, I received the prisoner in charge at Mr. Laycock's; he told me he had paid Smeeton 37l. for the cows, and that the cows and calf were at Wandsworth. I had fetched the cow and calf from Lewis', and they were at Laycock's when I apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go to his father and mother's house? A. I did; I went to different houses, and found where he lodged; no offer was made to give up the prosecution for 18l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had an interview with Mr. Smeeton on Friday afternoon - I asked if he had any cows to suit me; before that I had been at a public-house, and seen Smeeton's man, who said his master was at the Lock and Key, and that they had turned three cows out of the market; I went there, saw Smeeton, and had a glass of something with him; he asked me to breakfast with him next morning; I said I would, and intended going, but the morning was so very wet and snowey, I was not there till after half-past nine o'clock. I asked the young woman in the bar if he was there; she said he was gone, and I asked where he was going; she said he said he was going into the country; I asked if he was likely to be at Laycock's; she said, "Most likely;" I went and inquired if he had been there; they sent me to the foreman's house; I went and asked if Smeeton had been there; a young woman said No, and told me to go into the lairs, and inquire for George, which I did, and asked if Smeeton was there; I said I expected to meet him there about some cows; I waited there an hour and a quarter; he never came; as we were dealers together, and he had left the price to other people, I thought he would do the same with me; and so he would if he had not been pressed to bring this charge; seeing one was lame, I left her there, and promised to give George 3s. for dressing her, he having told me to say nothing to the foreman about it - I was a perfect stranger to George; I waited a long time, and then said I would take one away; he said,"I dare say it is all right;" I said, "You may depend upon it, it is," and when Smeeton came, he should have put the price on them, and I would have paid him. In Bridge-street I met this man, who calls himself a dealer, but he only goes about to look after cows for other people; he asked me to give him some gin; I said I would not; he said, "Where did you bring that from?" I said, "Out of the country,' for I was not going to satisfy him - he never came out into the road at all to me; I was going to take it to Johnson's, of Kent-street, to show him, but Mr. Lewis' man came out, and said, "That cow would suit my master;" I said if he liked to look at it he should: I went into the yard, and told Lewis I had a cow to sell; I sold it to him for 14l., and referred him to Johnson, of Kent-street; he went there before he paid me, and got the best of referrences. This cow is valued at eighteen guineas - it is not worth the money. On Monday I went to Islington, to see if George had dressed the cow as he had promised; these people had been at my father's house on the Sunday, and a man said if my mother would give him 18l. they would say no more about it. I went to Mr. Laycock's foreman's house on Monday, and asked if he was at home; they said No; I called out George, but he did not answer; this gentleman came; I said I came to look at the cows I bought of Smeeton; he said, "You have none here;" I said, "I have two, which I bought of Smeeton;" he left me, and this man came up; we went to a public-house, and had some brandy and water together; this gentleman came in, and the constable said he had a charge of felony against me, for stealing the cows; I said I would go any where, but as to my mentioning a price I never did: I asked George if they were worth 37l., but never said I gave that for them. The Magistrate would not have committed me if he had not been pressed. Is it likely, if I wanted to steal the cows, that I should go to Laycock's? I intended to pay him the money this week, when he came up to London. I have sold 40l. worth of cattle at a time, and nobody can say I owe them 1s.; the time being short, and my friends living in the country, they are not here. I intended to pay Mr. Smeeton honestly for them; I had no conversation with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182801100050"></xptr>man in Bridge-street; I never went out of the road, and he and the drover stood on the pavement; would a guilty man have gone to Laycock's on the Monday, as I did? my friends went yesterday to the Grapes, to ask the young woman to come and prove that I had been there, and asked for Mr. Smeeton, but they said she should not come, and that she should know nothing about it; I sent her a subpoena, but believe she is not here.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM LEWIS. He did refer me to Johnson.</p>

               <p>SUSANNAH SHIRLEY. My husband's name is John Shirley; he lives in Hoxton. I lost these halfpence on the 16th of November, at the <placeName id="t18121202-84-crimeloc500">corner of Saunder's gardens, Kingsland-road</placeName>

My halfpence were tied up in paper, and while I was picking my herrings out I laid the five shilling paper of halfpence on the prisoner's stall. I went away, and forgot them. I had not gone far before I returned for them, and the prisoner was gone from the stall. She returned. I asked her whether she had seen the halfpence. She said, no, she knew nothing of them. She went into her room, and asked me to get something to drink. She ran away. This woman brought her back, and when she came back she had a great quantity of halfpence in her pocket, loose. She had thrown the paper away, and the string. A little boy brought it to me. When I felt her pockets she had a very few halfpence before, and when I took her she had six shillings and sixpence in her pocket.</p>
               <p>HANNAH PURCELL. On my seeing a mob, I stepped up. I heard the prosecutrix accusing her of having the halfpence. She came and took her herrings in. I ran after the prisoner, and put my head in her door. I saw her take something out of a dark cupboard. She then went up to the street where she sat. I ran after her, and brought her back. I told her, if she had the halfpence to give them to the woman. She said, she would see her d - d first; if she had them she would keep them.</p>

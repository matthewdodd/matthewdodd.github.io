                  </hi>. I am at present a private gentleman living on my property. At the time of the fire I resided at Clapham—I now live at East Hackney—I have considerable property at Clapham, consisting of freehold land and houses—I am erecting a very great number of buildings there—there was a workshop on a vacant piece of ground behind the houses—there were all sorts of deals in the workshop and materials used for the purposes of building—on Friday, 20th Dec., a fire took place, which reduced the workshop completely to ashes, nothing but charcoal remained, nothing of the building itself, and a very small portion of the materials—the fire broke out between half-past seven and a quarter to eight o'clock—I was on the spot very soon after it broke out—I should apprehend from the materials being very dry, and there being a great many shavings and other combustible materials there, it must have flared up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185101060117"></xptr>
               <p>instantaneously—it broke out after dark—the prisoner had been employed on the premises some weeks previously, not directly by me, but oy another man named Wood, a sub-contractor—he had been working on the premises, but not when the fire occurred—I did not discharge him or give orders to have him discharged—he came to me about five weeks before the fire and said that he apprehended Wood was about discharging him, and he said, "Sir, you have a great many mouldings to make for houses that are about being erected, I will engage to do them for you at so much a hundred," naming the price—I said, "My good fellow, I do not see why you should not have as good a chance as any other man, and I will take care that you shall do them at the price you have named"—I did not see him again until I saw him in the station-house on the Sunday after the fire—I went there merely to identify him, or to see if the man Amos was really the man who had been at work on the premises—I had heard that a man had given himself up accusing himself of this matter—I saw him and recognised him—I said, "My good fellow, what inducement could you have to injure me?"—he said he wished to be revenged against the Woods—as I was coming away he asked me how much the loss was—I told him over 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he did not think it had been so much—he said he was now ready to give me all the satisfaction in his power, that he had done it, and as a proof that he was there he stated that he saw old Mr. Wood's boy taking his tea to him about five o'clock, but the gate was locked leading to Wir<lb></lb>temberg-place, and he saw another boy help Wood's boy over the wall; that he went to the Cock and had some beer and bread and cheese there, and as a proof of it, a man who took beer from the Bowyer's Arms some time since, but is now discharged, and who was a Norfolk man, could prove that he really was there—he said he went into the workshop at six, having found the door open, and he remained there until he heard the two chimes after seven; that he then took a lucifer match and set fire to the place; that he was resolved to be revenged of the Woods, and wished they had been there to be burnt in it; that he did not mind having seven years, but he hoped he should not have more, as he was a good tradesman, and would be bettered by being sent where be could get better work and better wages than here—after uttering other expressions of revenge against the Woods he ceased, and I came away; in fact, he pressed the latter part upon me, for my child was outside in the carriage, and I wished to get to her—I had seen the prisoner while working on my premises, but have not spoken to him above twice in my life—there was not the slightest appearance of insanity about him when he spoke to me—he seemed to take care of the pounds, shillings, and pence, as well as any man I ever met with.</p>

               <p>the place on fire—I do not recollect whether I have stated before that he said he was resolved to do it; but he certainly made use of that expression—I signed my deposition before the Magistrate; he stated what I signed to, but I did not say that he might not have said a great deal more—one of his expressions was, "I do not know what came over me to set fire to the building," but he also said that he wished to be revenged, that he was determined to be revenged on the Woods; that seemed to be all his aim, and he wished they had been there to be burnt—I have been an officer in the army—I am not in any trade or vocation—I do not keep a shop—this is a plan of my premises—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—the houses are erected, and fit for habitation—I should say they are about thirty yards from the work<lb></lb>shop, the workshop was upwards of forty feet square; in the centre part it was about twenty-four or twenty-five feet high; the outside part was perhaps not more than thirteen or fourteen—it was covered with slates, and had glass windows at the side—there was only one door—there had been two, but one had been closed up for a long time, and could not be made use of; it had not been opened for two or three years; it was a double door, wide enough to admit a carriage—the windows were a con<lb></lb>tinuation of glass on one side—it was covered in all round; it was not painted, it was weather-boarded—there was brickwork at the bottom, merely to prevent the timber sinking into the ground and rotting—when I saw the prisoner at the station, I immediately addressed him, saying, "My good fellow, what could have induced you to do me this injury?"—I am not aware that he had said anything before that—he was not alone, a police<lb></lb>man was with him—I addressed him in a kind way, and he thereupon made the statement—I have not the most distant recollection of his saying anything about a letter; I do not believe he did, or I should have some slight recollection of it; I cannot venture to say whether he did or not, he might or might not—he might or might not have said, "A man sent the letter to Clapham to inform them all about it;" I have no recollection of it—his statement was not coupled with the letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GARDE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you ever in any trade or business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the Woods are not now in my employment—I discharged them imme<lb></lb>diately after the fire.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the amount of damage done by the fire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a difficult question to answer—no money can replace what I have lost, because it would be impossible to buy the same materials which were six or seven years old and well seasoned; it was a considerable loss—the workshop was erected immediately after I bought the property, in 1846—it was used as a warehouse for various things, as a workshop, and a place in fact to put anything out of the weather; as a universal convenience—the Woods took contracts for different kinds of work—they were not the proprietors of the workshop or the materials, everything there belonged to me—I was my own architect, and my own everything.</p>

I saw the prisoner on the Thursday morning before the fire—he said he would come over to Clapham, to give my brother a severe hiding; he then said, "No, I will not do that, it will be of no benefit to me; but I will have my revenge in some other way."</p>

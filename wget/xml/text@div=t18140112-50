The prisoner ran against me; I missed the watch out of my pocket; I immediately seized the prisoner, and told him he had robbed me of my watch. I took him into the Red Lion public-house just by there, charged him with a constable, and got him searched; no watch was found on him. On going to the Compter, I told him if he would give the watch up I would not prosecute him. The watch has been sent to Mr. Bruce, No. 78, Little Britain.</p>

               <p>Q. Was any body else near you at the time that you lost the watch - A. Yes, an old man was nigh me. I cannot say who robbed me. I lost the watch against the posts that night.</p>
               <p>MR. HUSSEY. I am a constable. I searched the prisoner at the Red Lion. The prisoner said it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120026"></xptr>not him that took the watch, it was a woman, and the watch would be sent back.</p>

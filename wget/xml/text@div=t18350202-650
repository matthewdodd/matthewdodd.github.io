                  </hi>. I am an oil and colourman. Justice was in my employ, as porter—I sent him on errands to deliver goods—Palmer was the servant of a Mr. Holraan, my neighbour—my premises open upon Holman's yard—on the night of the 4th of February, I received information from Holman, and accompanied him to a cart-shed in his yard; and under the cart, in a box, I saw a quantity of soap, which I had every reason to believe was mine, from having a similar description of goods on my premises—Holman went into the loft, and there was a quantity of candles in a canvass bag—I have every reason to believe they were mine, having candles of a similar description on my premises—I got a policeman, and went to Holman's premises again, and in the interval the property had been removed—the candles from the loft, and the soap from the box—I found near the box five bars of soap afterwards in a nose-bag—in consequence of information we went to a shop in Arbour-street, within fifty yards of my premises, and there saw Miller—I told him I had come for the soap and candles which Holman's boy had left a few minutes before—his reply was, "I have no candles"—I said, "It is no use to deny it; we know all about it;" and then he stooped down, opened a drawer, and produced the soap, and after<lb></lb>wards the candles, in a canvass bag—I believe the bag to be the same as I had seen in Holman's loft—I got a policeman, and gave Justice and Pal<lb></lb>mer into custody—I value the candles at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the soap at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Miller keeps a chandler's shop—Holman is a carter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in George-street.

                  </hi>. I live at 27, New Street, Prince's Road, and am a general dealer—on the morning of the 18th December, between twelve and one o'clock, I was going home along the Lambeth Road—I met a woman about ten or fifteen yards in advance of the three prisoners and another man—the woman came straight to me, and, to avoid her, I stepped off the path, and she exclaimed, "Mind, you will slip"—I said, "All right; make haste home, there's a good girl, for you ought not to be out at this hour"—as near as I can recollect that was all I said to her—she said nothing further to me until I got close to the prisoners, and then she turned round and said, "What is that you say?"—upon that, I can't say whether it was Henry Perram or the other one struck me on the head and knocked me down—I got up, and was knocked down a second time by all three pri<lb></lb>soners—the man not in custody held me back by the collar, apparently to pull me away from them, and the others instantly came and struck me and kicked me—I have been suffering ever since—they then went away from me—I staggered on as well as I could to find a policeman—I found a con<lb></lb>stable, in company with one of my witnesses, when I came back to the corner, and he pointed out the Three Stags public-house and said the prisoners were in there—when I met the woman I had two sixpences and four half-crowns in my right trousers pocket, and when I got up they were gone, and my trousers were torn right down the side—I went to the Three Stags, and saw the prisoners and the woman there, and gave them into custody—when I was knocked down both the Perrams knelt upon my chest—my mouth was cut and my nose bled—I had two black eyes, a large swelling under the ear, and was black and blue all over the body—I had drank the share of one pint of ale—I did not say anything to the female about her leg, or ask if she was going with that fellow—I never spoke to her at all; she spoke to me first, and I gave her the answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, and live in Baal Zephon Street, Bermondsey—on the morning of 18th December I was in the Lambeth Road and saw the prosecutor walking along the pavement—I saw a woman go up to him, and there were four men standing pretty close—as he was walking "along he slipped from the kerb and said, "I was nearly down"—the woman came up to him and said, "Did you speak to me?"—he said, "No, I said I was nearly down"—as soon as he said that Henry Perram came up and struck him and knocked him down insensible, and as soon as he got up William Perram caught hold of him and held him across his knee, while Henry hit him as hard as he could and knocked him down again—the prosecutor might have had a drop to drink, but he was none the worse for liquor—I went to look for a constable, I could not find one, and as I returned I met the prosecutor talking to L 116 at the corner—I told him I had seen the prisoners go into the Three Stags with the female—we went there, and the two Peirams were taken into custody—I saw Crane walking to and fro, he offered me a quart pot to drink as we came out of the house, he was talking to the Perrams—I saw the woman go up to Crane and they walked together—I saw her go to her husband (<hi rend="italic">William Per<lb></lb>ram</hi>), and he gave her a purse—I don't know what she did with it—I saw her give Crane a half-crown—I am not able to say whether there was more or not, I saw one half-crown distinctly—Crane then went away for about seven or eight minutes, and then came back and joined the others; that was after the Perrams were in custody.</p>

               <p>wife?" and hit him one or two sharp blows in the face, and then both the Perrams began hitting him as hard as they could—Crane was behind him, but I did not see him strike any blow—the others knocked the prosecu<lb></lb>tor down and fell on him and kept him down, and were hammering him with their fists while he was down—as soon as he got up they laid hold of him and flung him into the road—the three then went away—I followed them to the Three Stags and stayed outside till the constable came and took them into custody—as I followed them to the station I saw the female pass something to Crane, and he went into the public-house and called for some tobacco—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> some money on the bar, what it was I don't know—I believe it was one piece.</p>

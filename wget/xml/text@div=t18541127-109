I live at No. 7, Mason's-court, New Crow, Surrey; I am a plate layer, in the service of the London and Brighton Railway Com<lb></lb>pany, and am employed between Forest-hill and New Cross. I know Harding—he has been employed as a labourer on the line—I should suppose that all the labourers know what the wires of the telegraph mean—on Sunday, 6th Aug., I saw Harding and another man; I cannot say whether it was Goodman—they were just below New Cross—they both had hold of telegraph wires as they walked along—they pulled the wire down from the standard, but it did not break—it came right down on the ground—it was quite as high as a man could reach before—I called to them—they walked away from it altogether, and I saw no more of them—I went back, and assisted in putting it back—one of the insulators was broken—a gentleman gave information.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 4, Holland-street, Brighton, and am in the service of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company. On Sunday evening, 6th Aug., I was walking on the railway bank, and saw the prisoners, whom I knew before, and the last witness—the prisoners took hold of the telegraph wire, and went for four or five steps hand over hand on the wire, and then they gave a heavy <hi rend="italic">sag</hi>, and broke it down from the standard, and it fell to the ground, and nearly hit my feet—I was sitting down at the time—I got up, and called after them—they both turned, made some remark, and hurried away, but did not exactly run—I went and assisted in putting the wire up; it was lying on the ground—the prisoners appeared sober—it was between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening.</p>

I was superintendent of the telegraph on the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway at this time—I saw this wire, but not till after it had been repaired—it belongs to the Electric Telegraph Company—the damage was very trifling—if the ground was wet, the effect would be that the electricity would not travel farther than that</p>

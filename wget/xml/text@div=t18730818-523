(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 22nd January, 1873, signed by the pri<lb></lb>oner, and stating that his decision of a residence was between Vanbrugh House, Blackheath</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Admiral Coffin's</hi>), <hi rend="italic">and the Old Manor House, Mitcham, and asking for a cheque according to agreement.</hi>) I wrote this letter to him enclosing this cheque.

Madam told me herself that she was Mrs. Berrington—I with<lb></lb>drew from the agreement on account of what I heard from Mrs. Garth and Mr. Humpherson about you—there was no conspiracy by us against you—I sent the cheque as collateral security—I wrote this letter to you.

Humpherson the sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., per cheque, according to terms of agreement. J. Berrington. Hampstead, February 2nd, 1873."—I gave up my situation after signing the agreement, and went to Bewdley for my holidays—he told me I was to begin duty on the first or second week in February—I received three prospectuses from him while at Bewdley, but there was no address on them—I came back to London shortly afterwards, and went straight to see the prisoner—he told me the reason there was no address on the prospectus was because he intended changing his residence, as there were so many schools at Blackheath, and he should take a place at Hampstead—afterwards, when I reminded him, he said he never had had a school at Blackheath, and that I was mistaken—the school he had, he said, was at Brighton—I parted with the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the prisoner's representations that he had a school at Blackheath, that he had pupils, that the school was in a flourishing condition, that he was a clergyman of the Church of England, and that he was so situated that he could get ma ordained as a clergyman.</p>

I am Vicar of Plumstead—in 1847 I made the acquaintance of the prisoner through an advertisement—he had an establishment at Bays water; I received instruction from him previous to my ordination—I do not know whether he had a cure of souls there then—in 1868 he took my house at a rent of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, for a school; he was with me about five months—I received no rent—he was never in charge for me there during my holidays—I do not owe him any money—he owes me upwards of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no pupils of his, since 1868, have been stopping at my house—I cannot tell whether Madam was his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I believe the school was properly con<lb></lb>ducted—I have seen your pupils at Rockhill's in 1872 or 1871—your income from Government referred, I always understood, to a document on Madam's account, to draw money from the India Office, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I do not know whether you have many pupils who are now beneficed clergymen—I have expressed an opinion about Madam being with you and that she was not fitted for the school—I never sued you for any money you owed me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Chief Inspector of the Metropolitan Detective Police, Scotland Yard—on Wednesday, 10th June, I saw the prisoner on Finsbury Pavement entering the post-office—he came out with five letters and a post card—I charged him with defrauding Newton of 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he was surprised that Newton should take such steps, as he intended to carry out his contract with him—I took him to the Hampstead police<lb></lb>station—on searching him I found twelve or fourteen advertisements of different kinds, letters addressed "A Clerk," "D.D.," "M.P.Q.," "F.R.S.," and various other initials, and a purse containing memoranda and cuttings from newspapers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi>. This was a civil contract, honestly land righteously made, and one which, up to the eleventh hour, I have treated as a debt. I have always had respectable establishments and high class pupils, whom I have prepared for the Army, for India, and the Universities, and so on. I have had a private income to fill up gaps, but as a last resource, I deter<lb></lb>mined to try a general school, and associate the undertakings with co<lb></lb>adjutors. I found two, as I thought, out of 200 applications. I have obtained distinctions which few schoolmasters can lay claim to, and I have been debarred from carrying out my agreements for want of reasonable time. All I wanted was an equitable settlement I gave them every opportunity of inquiring into my circumstances. I never told them I had pupils, or anyone else, it is wicked of anybody to take out a warrant on <hi rend="italic">ex-parte</hi> statements. I have spent some 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in running about and advertising.</p>

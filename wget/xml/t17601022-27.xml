On the 7th of July, between eight and nine in the evening, the prisoner at the bar came to me for two half pounds of tea; after I had weigh'd it, and given it her, she wanted change for a 36 s. piece, as she call'd it; I look'd at it, and told her it was bad; she would not believe me at first, then I carried it to one of the masters, Mr. Davidson, and shew'd it him; he came down stairs, and told the prisoner, it was had, and that he had a good many of them, and the first that brought him any more he was determin'd to prosecute, as an example to others. He said, if the prisoner could make it plainly appear how she came by it, he would release her, otherwise he wou'd go the next morning before the sitting alderman; she said, she did not know who gave it her; we detain'd the 36 s. and the next morning she came of her own accord, and went before the sitting alderman at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you send for a constable?</p>
               <p>Hudson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What evidence did you give before the alderman?</p>
               <p>Hudson. The same as I do to you; and she was committed, but somebody gave bail for her.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the 36 s. piece to be a bad one?</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, I judg'd it so; it was very perceivable.</p>
               <p>Q. On your charging her with this piece as being bad, Mr. Davidson ask'd her, where she had it? what did she say?</p>
               <p>Hudson. She said, she receiv'd it in payment, but could not tell where she had it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she endeavour to use any art, or did she come in a common way to purchase goods?</p>
               <p>Hudson. She came in a common way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she seem surpriz'd, when you told her it was bad.</p>
               <p>Hudson. Yes, she thought the piece was very good.</p>

            . I live at Lethulier's and Chaneler's in Leadenhall-street; on the 7th of July. about 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and wanted two half pounds of tea; I look'd at the money, and thought it was bad; (the piece produc'd and shewn to Sowerby) who says, it was the same, or one very much like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you that piece?</p>
               <p>Sowerby. The prisoner at the bar offer'd it, and I dislik'd it, and told her it was a bad one; she seem'd a little surpriz'd, and said, she did not know it was. I then advis'd her not to offer it to any body else, for she was liable to be prosecuted. She said, she had it from her master, but did not say who he was; I ask'd her, but she did not tell me, then she went away.</p>

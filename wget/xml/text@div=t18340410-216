               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you been taking any gin-hot? A. No, I did not get up till five o'clock that morning - I had been at the White Hart before I saw the prisoners - I had half a pint of ale there - I paid 3 1/2d. for it - I then saw the prisoners, and went to the Crooked Billet - I then had half-a-crown and a farthing - the gin came to 3 1/2d., and I had 2s. 2 1/2d. change - I had not seen the prisoners before - I treated them because I wanted to get rid of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you talking to Smith? A. Yes; and she put her hand into my pocket and took the money - Isbester had had hold of my arm before, but she had let go before Smith took my money - they both ran away together.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in the Crooked Billet, and saw the prosecutor and the two prisoners there - I saw the prosecutor change the half-crown, and they all returned into the tap-room - in about ten minutes the two prisoners came running out - I went in pursuit of them and took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean he was ten minutes in the tap-room with these women? A. From six to ten minutes - they had half a pint of gin at the bar, and they all drank it - whether they had any thing else I cannot say- the prosecutor is a very eccentric kind of man - I have known him take women home, fill their belly with victuals, and send them home again - they seemed very friendly together, and came in together - I do not know whether they took any thing in the tap-room.</p>

             (police-constable K 156). I apprehended the prisoners - I found two shillings, two penny pieces, one halfpenny, and one farthing on Smith - she said it was no great catch - I was at the bar, and saw them drinking the gin - I cannot say I saw them go into the tap-room.</p>

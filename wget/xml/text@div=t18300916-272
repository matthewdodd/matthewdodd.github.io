             and his son were with me; I saw a person laying drunk - I cannot say that it was Tilson - I hired the boat of Peck, and was to pay half a crown for it; he asked for security for it, and I gave him four sovereigns - he said his name was Cook; I said the boat had the name of Sawyer on it - he said it was his, and he had bought it of Sawyer a few days before, and that he would be there to meet us when we came back; I went out, and the boat began to leak - to save myself I took hold of one of the barges, and the boat went off; a waterman came and took me in - my two friends caught another barge, and they were brought back; when we came to the stairs I did not see Peck - I came again at eight o'clock, and staid till nine; he did not come: I gave the boat to the Thames Police, and mentioned the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was Peck intoxicated? A. I cannot say - I am positive I was sober- there was a lad named Watts; I do not know whether he was sober - I do not know that I saw Tilson then; Peck was sober enough to stand, and to take my money - he did not deny having taken the sovereigns; I did not nearly upset the boat - we had had a pot of stout and two pots of ale, at Vauxhall, among four of us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Tilson the man laying asleep in the boat? A. No; I cannot say whether he was the man laying on the stairs - the man had his face down on his knees; I have not been trying to make any money of any friend of Tilson's - I have received 8l., but I hope I shall be allowed to explain it; since the prisoners were indicted a gentleman called in my neighbourhood, and made inquiries of my neighbours as to my circumstances, and left a card, inviting me to an inn in the City - his name was Waters; I went and saw him, and we got into conversation on this affair, how near I was being drowned - he said he supposed if he were to make me some recompence I should not be above receiving it; I said No, and he said, "Here are 8l.;" since then it has been said it was intended that I should not appear.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you receive the 8l. for? A. I took it to be from some charitable fund - he did not tell me where it came from.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What were they to give it you for? A. It might be partly for my fright - I did not take it for what I said I had lost, and in lieu of my loss of time. Mr. Mellows was with me.</p>

            . I was with the witness, and not in the boat; Peck is the man we had it of - he gave his name Cook; I was on the top of the stairs: my son came up, and said, "This man wants 4l. as security for the boat;" I said, "It is as much as the boat is worth;" I said to Peck, "What is your name?" he said Henry Cook - I said, "How comes the name of Sawyer to be on the boat?" he said, "It is all right - I bought it a few days ago;" when we got to Waterloo-bridge it began to fill with water - we got back; I waited from eight o'clock till twelve, but Peck did not come.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did Peck appear drunk or sober? A. He did not appear drunk - I was not drunk; upon my oath we did not run the boat against a barge, and capsize it - we had been to Vauxhall - as we came over the bridge we had a pot of stout, and some beef and ham in the garden; I cannot swear to Til<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183009160121"></xptr>son's person - there was a young man named Watts on the top of the stairs; I could not tell whether he was drunk or sober - I did not hear Peck say he would rather accompany us than let us have the boat, unless we returned in an hour; I never received 1s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you with the prosecutor when he received the eight sovereigns? A. Yes - I do not know what possessed him to think that a charitable fund gave him the money; I understood it was for what he had lost, and the danger he had run.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do not watermen lend their boats to one another? A. I believe they do allow others to take fares in them; the damage to the boat had been done in launching, not on the water.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. So a sovereign was offered you? A. Yes; I was not sober - Peck was drunk, but not so much as I and Tilson were; I was on the top of the stairs at Westminster-bridge, lacing up my boots; I never was in trouble myself - my master was taken before the Magistrate about some coals, the sweepings of some barges; I went with him - my master had a month at Kingston; I was sent home - I never was in prison; I was taken on this charge by Mr. Little - he said, "Watts, you must step into our boat;" I was examined before the Magistrate - I told the truth.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Buckhardt, a baker, at Hoxton. On 3rd March about 4 o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop—he asked for a half quartern loaf—he gave me a shilling—I tried it with my teeth, and I believed it to be bad—I took it next door, and showed it to my neighbour—when I returned with it, the prisoner was still in my shop—I told him it was bad; he looked at me, and said, "I did not know it"—he seemed to want it back, but he did not say so—I kept it—he went away—I put it on the mantel piece—I afterwards put it into the cash box, where there was no other shilling—it remained there for about a week, my husband then gave it to the policeman.</p>

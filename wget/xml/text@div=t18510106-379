                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Beck, of 18, Great James-street, Bedford-row, a printer. Thompson was in our service—on 26th Aug. I went out; on my return the prisoner was gone, and I missed a gown, a pair of stays, a petticoat, a velvet mantle, a mantle trimmed with crape, and a whole suit of black of my husband's; another pair of trowsers and a black satin waistcoat—I went to Thompson's parents in Upper Ground-street, Blackfriars, where I had been with her two or three days before, but did not see her—on 31st Dec. I met her in Castle-street, Hol<lb></lb>born, and said, "You know, Caroline, you have robbed me; you are my prisoner, you must come with me"—she pulled my shawl off me in the street, called a crowd round me, and told the people I was drunk, and that she knew nothing at all of me—I kept hold of her till we got into Holborn, and then she said, if I would not expose her in the public-streets she would come to my house and tell me the truth—when we got there she said, "It was not I that robbed you, it was a person assisted me to rob you; I was set to do so;" or something similar to that—a policeman was sent for, but before he came she told me, without my asking her, that on the Friday previous to her robbing me on the Monday, she met a person of the name of M'Carthy, who said, "What, are you living in this neigh<lb></lb>bourhood?" that she answered, "Yes;" M'Carthy said, "Can't you take some things from them people?" or "Can't you rob them people?" that she, Thompson, said she could not do it, or she did not wish to do it, I cannot exactly recollect what she said, but I believe she said she met her twice, and impressed it on her mind that she must do it—I know nothing of M'Carthy—my house is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn.</p>

               <p>High Holborn. I produce a waistcoat and coat, pawned on 26th Aug. by a woman in the name of Ann M'Carthy, of 60, Baldwin's-gardens, for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot say who the woman was—my attention was not called to it till last week.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman, E</hi> 8). On 31st Dec. Thompson was given into my custody at Mr. Beck's—she stated that she was induced to commit the robbery by a woman named M'Carthy, who charred at a house where she formerly lived servant—I afterwards, in consequence of inform<lb></lb>ation she gave me, took M'Carthy at 18, Ely-place, Holborn, where she was charring; I told her I took her for being concerned in a robbery, in Great James-street, at the latter end of last Aug.; that Thompson said she had aided and assisted her—she said, "Good God! I know nothing about it; the girl must be mad!"—when the charge was being taken at the station they were both present, and M'Carthy said to Thompson, "Why, Caroline, you know you gave me a coat and waistcoat, which I pledged at Mr. King's, in Holborn"—Thompson said that M'Carthy was the cause of her being in trouble, or words to that effect, and M'Carthy made no reply—I asked M'Carthy for the duplicate, and she said she burnt it when in a passion, with some of her own—she told me she lived at 60, Baldwin's-gardens, I went there, and in a box in the front-room second-floor, I found this waistcoat, which Mrs. Beck identifies, and under the bolster of the bed I found this pair of trowsers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she told me her room was the second-floor, and I asked the parties there which was M'Carthy's room—she did not say whether it was front or back—there was another person in the back-room—this was the only one unoccupied—there were two beds in the room; it appeared occupied by a man as well as a woman—I took seven keys from her, and one of them opened the box, which contained women's apparel, except this waistcoat—I then went to 18, Brook-street, Holborn, which Thompson said was her lodging, and there found these two mantles, and this collar (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

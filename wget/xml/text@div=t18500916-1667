                  </hi>. I am an eating-house-keeper, at 101, Fore-street, Cripplegate. I know the prisoner—I first saw him on a Friday night</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185009160089"></xptr>
               <p>in Feb.—he came to my house with a female and had supper—I cut their suppers, and then went into the Green Dragon next door—I had only been there a few minutes, when my waiter came in and said, "Here is a gentleman wants to speak to you about taking the house"—I went in, and Saunders said, "I have been speaking to your waiter about taking your house; I have dined at your place a good many times, and I know it is a good one"—he said he knew an old gentleman who had a nephew in the country, and wanted to take a business of that description, would I object to disposing of it—I said I had no objection, provided I could get my price—he asked what I wanted—I said 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "Well, I don't consider that at all out of the way, and I will bring the old gentleman next day"—he said the nephew had come into 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and was about getting married, but he would come next day, Saturday, and bring the old gentleman to settle the business—I had never seen the prisoner at my house before; he never dined there, to my knowledge—he came next day, with a man named Anderson, who has been tried—I was very busy, and asked them to walk up-stairs, and my waiter attended to them—in about half an hour Anderson came down, and said he wished to speak to me about taking the house for his nephew—I said it was impossible I could speak to them then, I would in half an hour; they had better come back again here—they said, "No, we will meet you at some house"—I said the most convenient place was next door, the Green Dragon—I went, and he asked me all the particulars about the business—I asked 350<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, and the prisoner said I was to give him 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if his friend took it for his nephew—they both said that the young man had come into 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he lived at Dover—I said he had better bring the nephew there, to satisfy himself about it—Anderson said, "Oh, it rests with me and his aunt; be is but a youngster"—an appointment was made for the Monday following, at the Albion, at four o'clock—I went, and Saunders came after I had been there about a quarter of an hour—he said he hoped he had not kept me waiting, he had had a letter from his friend, which he pro<lb></lb>duced—I said, "I suppose, then, it is all knocked on the head; they have declined"—he said, "No, it is all right"—he read the letter to me, but he would not let me read it, or handle the letter—the letter was, "Dover,—Dear Uncle, I received yours of," a certain day, I cannot exactly recollect now, "and I am glad to think you have taken a house for me in London; there is no business I should like better than an eating-house; it is impossible for me to be up by this morning's train, but I will be with you to<lb></lb>morrow afternoon, by the three o'clock train. I have spoken to my intended, Miss Watson, on the matter, and she approves of it very much. I remain, Dear Uncle, yours etc."—that was the letter, as near as I can recollect—as soon as he had put it into his pocket, I saw Anderson looking through the window—I said, "Dear me, there is your friend"—he said, "Oh, that is impossible, I have just left his house"—I said, "Where does he live?"—he said a few doors from the Bricklayers' Arms"—I said, "What is he?"—he said, "A cigar<lb></lb>merchant"—I said, "He must have been very fast after you"—Anderson then came in and joined us—he said to Saunders, "Dear me, as soon as I sent you out of the house with the letter, my niece came up by the last train from Dover, and I expect my nephew up by the seven o'clock train; they are up buying the wedding-dress; it is no use our stopping here any longer, we will meet here this evening, at seven o'clock"—I went and found Anderson there alone, smoking his pipe, and having a pint of half-and-half—in about half an hour the prisoner came in with another man, and after them a man pretending to be drunk, and another man who pretended to be <hi rend="italic">disinterested</hi> with him, but they both sat at the same table—I thought the man was drunk at the time—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185009160090"></xptr>
               <p>talked a parcel of nonsense—he first addressed his conversation to Anderson about throwing a heavy weight—Anderson laughed at him, and told him to mind his own business, but he dare say he could find a person to throw as heavy a weight as him, meaning Saunders—I know he meant Saunders, because he was sitting alongside of him at the time—I told the man to mind his own business, and told Saunders to take no notice of him—Saun<lb></lb>ders said he could throw as heavy a weight as he could—the man pulled out some sovereigns, and said he had been selling some cows at Smithfield-market for his mother—Anderson said it was near nine o'clock and his wife ought to have been there, to let him know whether his nephew had arrived or not, therefore he must go; because if she was not there at that time, she was to be at the Surrey Theatre; and he said, "We will go down there together"—we went—the drunken man, and the other with him, left first—we went out immediately after—they went across the road, and I lost sight of them for a time—Saunders, Anderson, and the man that came into the Albion with Saunders, left with me—we walked down to the Surrey Theatre, and Anderson pretended to go and see whether his wife had come—his wife was not there, and we adjourned to a beer-shop, named the Flying-horse, kept by Dickenson, in the Webber-road—when I went in, I said, "This is not a place for us to meet, let us go to some respectable house"—we went to the bar, and there I saw the drunken man and the other standing—the drunken man was leaning over the counter; and the landlord came round, and said, "The ground is ready for you now, gentlemen; you can go in and do as you like with it;" and I saw eight or nine persons come out of the skittle-ground—I did not like to go in; but Anderson said, "Come in; I don't like to see my friend challenged, and not to accept it"—we went in, six of us altogether, with myself—there was no one else in the ground but the landlord; he brought in two pots of ale, and said, "I shall not allow anybody else to come in the ground while you are here"—I do not know who paid for the ale—I did not see it paid for—no other drink was brought in—when we were in the skittle-ground, the door was closed, I cannot say whether it was fastened—they began to play—they had some chucks for several sovereigns—Saunders and the drunken man tried the weight of the ball—they played for money—I saw 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. pass—the drunken man lost a great deal; and Saunders said, "You may as well go in and have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as well as us; he has been and sold his cows, and you may as well have his money as us"—I said no, if I did play with a man, it should be when he was sober, and he should have as good a chance as myself; therefore I did not go in with them—I did not play at all—while the play was going on, I was sitting on a stool on the left side of the ground—one or two of the persons sat on the stool by me at different times—I think the man that came along with the drunken man sat alongside of me once or twice, and Saunders, and I think the man that came in along with Saunders—I had a green silk purse, containing 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a gold Spanish piece—I think the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was eleven sovereigns, and four half-sovereigns—at the end of the playing they <hi rend="italic">kicked</hi> up a dispute about cheating: Saunders, the drunken man, and the other one—they got pushing one another against me as I was sitting on the form—I got up several times, and pushed them away—they trod on my toes, and as I got up they were all round me once or twice—I was rather exasperated; and the last time I fancied I saw, in fact I did see, my purse in Saunders's hand—that was while they were all round me—I saw Saunders close to me—whether he took the purse out of my pocket, or not, I cannot say—it had been safe in my right-hand pocket a quarter of an hour before—I am certain it was taken from me during the scuffle—I put</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185009160091"></xptr>
               <p>my hand into my pocket, and said, "Halloo, you have got my purse out of my pocket!"—I said that to all of them; they could all hear—Saunders was perhaps about a yard from them—two of them then fell down, and some money fell out, and two or three of them fell down on the other side of the ground; and the man who came in along with Saunders at the Albion, stood before me and said, "For God's sake, don't talk like that," or something to that effect; "I would not be known to be in such a concern as this for the world, for I hold a responsible situation in the City;" and he kept me back, and said "I know the man that I came in with very well; I will take you to him"—while he was doing this, the others all went out; Saunders among the rest—they all went out, one after another—the drunken man went out with his coat on his arm—I did not see any of them stopped as they went out—I came out along with the other man, and went to a public-house in the Black friars-road—I saw Saunders again, I think on the Friday following—I gave information to the police, I think the week following—I first went to the City-police in my own neighbourhood—I afterwards went with the police to the skittle-ground, and there I found my purse, behind the frame, at the end of the skittle-ground—I do not know how long that was after this occurrence—I do not think it was the same week—I can speak to the purse, I believe one of my children netted it for me—there was a piece of paper in it when I found it, which had been written by Anderson in the public-house—this is it, it is "Meet me at four o'clock."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live in Upper Chapman Street, Pimlico. I was in the prisoner's house on 12th Jan., No. 12, Cartwright Street, Westminster—I went to the house about 11 o'clock in the day—the prisoner and his wife were at home—they went out together, and returned in about an hour, both in liquor; the prisoner was very much so; the deceased was not so much as the prisoner—a quarrel took place between them which lasted about a quarter of an hour—towards the close of the quarrel the prisoner told his wife that if she did not hold her noise he would smash her head—she replied, "Do it; do it"—my head was then turned from them, and when I turned my head again, I saw the prisoner with a five-pint tin saucepan in his hand—the deceased got hold of the saucepan lid, and tried to return the blow—the lid had fallen off the saucepan on to the counter—I had heard it fall—the deceased did not return the blow—I prevented it—there were no more blows struck after that—the deceased was bleeding from the left side of the upper part of the head—the prisoner asked me if I would go with his brother to the chemist's to have her head dressed, and I and the deceased and the prisoner's brother went to the chemist's—this happened on Tuesday; I saw her afterwards on the Thursday, she seemed better, and went to the theatre—I won't answer whether her head was bandaged—I saw her on the Thurs<lb></lb>day after, and she was not quite so well.</p>

My sister-in-law was 29 years of age—I live in my brother's house and carry on business there—I was there on 12th Jan., between 12 and 1 o'clock—I was up stairs, dressing myself—Wise was waiting for me to go out—while I was washing myself, my brother called me down—I saw his wife leaning against the counter and the shop door; she was bleeding from the left side of the head—I went to a chemist's with her—I have never seen her intoxicated since that time.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe during the whole of their married life they lived on most excellent terms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, so far as I know—she did not go the same evening to a raffle—she went on the Tuesday following, and took the bandage off her head—it was on the Thursday she went to the theatre; she had the bandage on then, but she took it off on the night she went to the raffle—she told me to tell any one that asked, that she had hurt her head in getting some coals.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and druggist. On 12th Jan., the prisoner's wife came to my place—she had a scalp wound on the left side of the head, about an inch above the temple, about an inch and quarter long, and of slight depth—I dressed it within a couple of hours—I saw her afterwards, and did every thing that was necessary to the wound.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you caution her not to take the bandage off, and not to drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cautioned her not to drink, and keep herself free from excitement—I never supposed she would do such a thing as take the bandage off—such a wound would not cause death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine and licentiate of the Apothe<lb></lb>cary's Company. I first saw the prisoner's wife on 22nd Jan.—she was suffering from erysipelas—she had a wound a little above the temple, on the left side of the head, which I look upon as the exciting cause of the erysipelas—I know no other cause but that—the wound itself was very slight, but it would be sufficient to produce that effect—I had known her for years—I am</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185802220061"></xptr>
               <p>speaking of her general habit and temperament—I continued to attend her till her death on 31st Jan.—she died, as the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination showed, from contusion on the brain—I connect that with the erysipelas I had seen on the 22nd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might the contusion on the brain be caused by other diseases as well as erysipelas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I look on the effusion as the consequence of the erysipelas—I found nothing else to account for it—erysipelas continually takes place without any wound having been inflicted—some persons are more predisposed to it than others—being given to drinking is one of the most common causes of it—I should call her a person singularly predisposed to erysipelas—erysipelas is a disease of the whole system, and her indulging in drink might have produced it independent of and quite irrespective of the wound—I look upon that wound as the most manifest exciting cause of the erysipelas; but erysipelas and effusion are quite consistent with constitutional derangement—supposing there had been no wound, the erysipelas would have proceeded from natural causes, and more especially so from her previous state—the wound was of the most slight description—it did not go through the inner skin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SALTER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is erysipelas a disease which will spread over the whole body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is a disease of the whole system—it requires an exciting cause to develop it, in any one given spot—it will very frequently occur without any manifest exciting cause—the wound did not appear to be the <hi rend="italic">nucleus</hi> from which the erysipelas proceeded—it was on the left temple—the greater part of the disease was round the neck and face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But may it happen that where there is a wound, the erysipelas does not appear to spread from the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The erysipelas will develop itself at a distance from the wound—the development may, in all probability, have arisen from the constitutional cause—the erysipelas had ex<lb></lb>tended up to the wound—I attribute the erysipelas to constitutional causes, but I believe it was excited by the wound—I believe the constitutional causes and the wound produced it—it might have arisen without the wound—I considered the wound but a very small matter, but it being there I could not but notice it—I had seen symptoms of erysipelas in her once before—the death in this case may have been caused by the erysipelas, without any wound at all—she died of erysipelas, and I think the wound had very little to do with it.</p>

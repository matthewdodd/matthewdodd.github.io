                  </hi>. I am an assistant to William Abner Vaughan, a linen draper, of Aldgate. The male prisoner was a porter in Mr. Vaughan's service—I have seen the female prisoner at the shop—on Sunday, 11th Nov., in consequence of directions from Mr. Vaughan, I and William Bun-dock, another assistant, concealed ourselves in the shop—about 6 o'clock the male prisoner was admitted—that was the usual time for him to come to the house—I do not know who admitted him—Mr. Vaughan and his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185511260006"></xptr>
               <p>family then left the house, and went to a place of worship—we were then in concealment in the shop, under the window—there is a partition that sepa<lb></lb>rates the passage of the private door from the shop—the partition is put up like shutters—when the partition is up, there is no means of getting from the passage into the shop without taking down one of the shutters—when I and Bundock concealed ourselves the partition was perfect, all the shutters were up and fastened—we were fastened up inside—we had the key of the shop door leading to the other part of the house—about 25 minutes to 7 o'clock I heard the male prisoner come down the stairs—he opened the side street door, and let the female prisoner in—I saw him through a crack between the shutters—he said to her, "You are late to-night"—she made some reply about two children—she had the child with her that she has now in her arms—they then went up stairs, to a room above the shop, and were talking between two and three minutes—I then heard the male prisoner approaching the stairs leading to the kitchen—he passed by, and went down into the kitchen, and returned with a knife in his hand—I could see that by the gas light in the passage at the top of the stairs—I then heard foot<lb></lb>steps coming down the stairs that I had seen them go up—by means of the knife they unfastened the bolt, and took down the shutter—I could not see which did that; I had to get to my place of concealment again—the male prisoner entered the shop first—the female handed in a light, which was placed upon a stand, and then she came in herself—she then took down from a shelf two lengths of printed cotton for dresses, and laid them on the counter, close by where I was concealed—she then undid a wrapper which was on the counter, but did not take anything from it—while she was doing this, the male prisoner was in the centre of the shop, walking backwards and for<lb></lb>wards—she then took down another wrapper, of black Coburg cloth, and cut about two yards from one of the lengths—the male prisoner went to the opposite side of the shop, brought a drawer of ribbons, and placed them on the counter, by the side or in front of the female—she then tied up the wrapper, or put the string round it, and was going to put it back into the fixture—the male prisoner made some remark about the wrapper, to which she sharply replied, "I shan't"—she put up the wrapper—she got on the ladder to do it—I could not hear what it was he said to her—she then cut lengths from several pieces of the ribbon, and wound them round her hand—they were placed with the other goods upon the counter, about a yard from where I was hid, and they both went to the opposite side of the shop—the male prisoner then reached from the top fixture of the shop a paper of wool shirts and handed them to the female—she was then holding a lighted candle—the female undid the paper, and the male asked her whether they were the right sort, and she replied they were very fine ones, and he said the paper was written on <hi rend="italic">Supers</hi>, and they both laughed—the male prisoner then made some remark about leaving, as the time was up, and the child was crying up stairs—they looked through several boxes, I did not see them take anything—they then came into the centre of the shop, and the female asked for table covers—they got over the counter to the side of the shop they were first in—the female took down a wrapper of table covers, took two from them and replaced the wrapper—she then looked over several fixtures, containing lengths for dresses, of different textures, and from one she took a length of six yards of woollen and cotton stuff—she laid the various things upon her arms, and went out of the shop—before that, he asked whether there was anything else she required, that was before she took down the table covers—I believe she made some reply, but I did not hear what it was—it was after that she went and took down some table</p>

               <p>covers—as soon as she had left the shop the male prisoner followed, behind a stand close against the opening—I then got from my place of concealment—the male prisoner left the shop—I saw the female go up stairs first with the goods on her arms—the male prisoner then put up the shutters again, and followed—he had not seen me at that time—I and bundock went up the opposite stairs which we had seen them come down, and at the top of the stairs I saw the female prisoner with the goods at her feet—I went up rather quickly—I said, "Well, Mrs. Peckham"—Bundock said, "You had better go into the room"—her husband was then in the room with the child in his arms—the female entered the room, followed by Bundock—she wished to come out to get her bonnet—I would not let her pass—we had a short scuffle there, and by force we kept her back—I locked Bundock and the two prisoners in the room from the outside, and I remained outside the door—she asked several times to be allowed to get her bonnet, and then she said, "Let us go and put the goods back, and let us both off, for my husband's sake, for it is all my fault, and not his"—she repeatedly asked me to allow her to go up or down stairs, and also the male prisoner—I declined—she was kept there until Mr. Vaughan came home—I told Bundock to look after the fire—when Mr. Vaughan came home I gave him some inform-ation—when I went into the room with Mr. Vaughan the male prisoner said, "I will bring all the goods back I have got at home"—a constable was sent for, and they were taken into custody.</p>

I am in Mr. Vaughan's service—I was concealed in the shop on 11th Nov.—I did not see the female prisoner go up stairs, I saw her when she was there—I told her to go into the room, and she went—I remained, there while Ives locked the door upon me—he told me to look after the fire, to which the prisoner replied that she should not think of throwing anything into the fire—I looked towards the fire and found about six yards of ribbon, the portion of two lace lappets, part of a head dress, which I took out of the fire in time to identify what the articles were—I did not throw them into the fire—there was nobody else in the room but the prisoners and the child—I did not see the female do it, she owned to it—the male prisoner said to her, "You should not do that, as it will only make it worse"—she said she should not have thought of throwing it into the fire if Ives had not put it into her head.</p>

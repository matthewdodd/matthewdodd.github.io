            . About two o'clock in the afternoon of the 12th of October, I was in my room at Temple-mills, Hackney-marsh, and saw the two prisoners and another boy (I am certain of the persons of the prisoners,) they were going along in the water - Over had a basket on his left shoulder. I went down, and called them; they then went on faster. I went to get my horse out of the shed, and on casting my eyes round I saw Over throw something out of the basket into the water. I pursued them on horse back; Over threw down the basket, and ran away with Taylor, and the other went in another direction. I followed then about two hundred yards further, and then they got into an old building; I got off my horse, and and found them concealed in the fire-place. Over said,</p>

               <p>"I have got nothing:" I said,</p>
               <p>"You must go and find what you threw into the water;" he said,</p>
               <p>"We will." - Taylor said nothing, but when we got to the water he asked me to let him go, and he would go quietly. When we got to the spot where the chains were, Over put his hand into the water, and drew out four chains. Taylor then said,</p>
               <p>"Here are some more chains," and drew out five chains, two bolts, and a nut. I know the property to be my master's; they had been left in a barn.</p>

               <p>TAYLOR'S Defence. We were going blackberrying, and met a boy with the basket - he said he would go with us; when we saw that the water was so high, we went back into a yard, and the lady said,</p>
               <p>"You had better go into the shed out of the rain." That boy put the chains into the basket, and gave it to Over. We went on together; he then said,</p>
               <p>"The man is coming, you had better throw them into the water."</p>

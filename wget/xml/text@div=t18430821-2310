                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at the Windmill Inn, Bushy-heath. Jane Perry was my servant occasionally—she was employed as a charwoman on the 25th of July—not as a regular monthly servant—this pro<lb></lb>perty was in a drawer in my bedroom, whieh was not locked, but the room door was locked with one of Bramah's locks, and I always kept the key in my pocket—the room was opened sometimes—I gave the key to her to make the bed, and then she would have an opportunity of taking the property out of the drawer—I did not miss it till I saw her wearing this puce-coloured silk dress at my house, which was on the 25th of July—I knew it instantly to be mine—I did not say anything about it to her on that day—on the 27th I went and searched, and my pieces of silk were gone from my drawer—it was not made up into a dress when I lost it—I did not miss anything else in parti<lb></lb>cular—I then sent for the prisoner, who was at work down stairs, and told her that the dress which she wore at my house on the fair day, the 25th, was made out of the silk that was left in my room—I said the dress was rather too short, and asked her who made it—she said she had made it herself, and bought the silk of a woman in Suffolk, but she did not know who she was—she</p>

               <p>first said she bought it for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that it was lined with white silk, but she had sold the white for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., so that it had only cost her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I must know who the woman was, because I could swear to the silk—she then told me she had it from a person in Suffolk six or seven years ago—I offered to write to the lady—she objected to that, and did not give her name, but said she would write to her herself—I insisted upon her fetching the silk, as I could swear it was mine—my little girl and servant went with her to her home to fetch it—I pointed out some marks by which I knew it—I told her the consequence if the policeman was to know it—she then went to the po<lb></lb>liceman to see herself righted, and brought him with her—I afterwards went with the policeman to Mr. Hatton's, where I found a part of my property in the room where the prisoners slept—it consisted of a pair of drawers, a nightcap, and some other things now produced—these drawers are mine, and had been kept in a chest in the same room where my silk had been—my house is in the parish of Harrow-on-the hill.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 260.) On the 27th of July the prisoner came to my house, and said Mrs. Davidson had got a silk dress of here, and she would have it back—that she had had it nearly ten years, and bought it down in Suffolk, and had had it made up by an old woman—I went with her and saw the dress—Mrs. Davidson claimed it—the prisoner said it was her own, and she had written a letter to the person who had made it up in the country—Mrs. Davidson then said, "Do not take her into custody, at she has written into the country; stop till the letter comes back"—on the fol<lb></lb>lowing day, Thursday, the prisoner sent for me again, and said her husband had been making a fool of himself, by going down to Mrs. Davidson, and acknowledging that she had stolen the dress, but she had done nothing of the kind; and she said she would have the gown "back, as her husband was very much out of the way about it—Mrs. Davidson told me to take her into cus<lb></lb>tody—this is the gown—the prisoner still claimed it—she lived at Magpie Hall—it is a house that is under repair—she and her husband were taking care of it—I took her at that house—I made a search there, and found this pair of drawers by the side of the bed where she slept—the prisoner, William Perry, was lying on the bed at the time—he was tipsy, and he did not say a word about them.</p>

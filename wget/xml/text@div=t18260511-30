I asked the prisoner how he could be guilty of driving so furiously, as every body around complained of his driving so furiously; his answer was he was driving no faster than he usually did; I said, "If you have any witnesses to prove you were not driving furiously, you ought certainly to take their names, for it appears a very serious matter, and there appears ten to one against you;" he turned round, and said, "This gentleman saw something of it." He made no attempt to get away, I assisted in carrying Mr. Cundy into Mr. Ponsonby's house, and remained four hours with him.</p>

            . I am a solicitor. I heard of this affair, and waited on Mr. Layburn, of Newgate-market, the prisoner's master; he sent for the prisoner, and I asked him to describe what occurred in Regent-street - he stated that he had been leaving some meat at Messrs. Swan and Edgar's door, in the Quadrant, and was driving home in a direction for Carlton House, and just below the Circus he came in contact with a gentleman on horse-back; I asked what time it was - he said about half-past nine o'clock; I drew a small sketch of the street, and said, "Now describe where you were exactly" he said he was in the middle of the road - that something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182605110022"></xptr>had passed him, but there was nothing by him on his own side of the road at that time; Mr. Layburn asked at what rate he was driving - he replied, at a moderat rate; he was asked how many miles an hour - he said eight miles an hour; I said that was too great a pace to drive in London - he made no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As the street is very wide, if Mr. Cundy had been on his right side this would not have happened? A. If it was in the middle. I call eight miles an hour a very great pace. The street is McAdamized.</p>

            . I am the deceased's brother; I saw him at Mr. Ponsonby's, about two hours after the accident happened: he said, "I was going at a fast walk up Regent-street, towards the County Fire-office - about eight yards before me, I saw a gentleman on horse-back, riding at a slow trot; I heard the rattling of a cart, and saw a gentleman before me put his horse on the pavement, or on the curb-stone, in order to avoid the cart; the butcher's cart was coming at a furious rate towards me - I then attempted to put my horse on the pavement, which I could not effect - I therefore turned my horse to the right hand, to gain the other side of the road; the butcher appeared to turn his horse also, with a view of correcting my error; I met him about a third of the road, and so the mischief occurred;" he thought the prisoner did all he could to avoid it. My brother lingered eight or nine days, and then died.</p>

            . I was standing against a post, directly opposite Mr. Ponsonby's door, when this happened - the prisoner's cart was within five yards of the pavement - if the gentleman had kept on his right side instead of endeavouring to come between the prisoner's cart and the pavement it would not have happened - the gentleman's horse was not restive.</p>
               <p>Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Do you know which is the proper side? A. The left; he was coming from Jermyn-street, and kept on the right side, instead of the left - before that he was in the center as near as possible; a gentleman on horse-back saved his life by turning on the side, on the stones - that was the deceased - he went on the flag stones, and fell instantly. I saw no other gentleman on horseback.</p>
               <p>Mr. BRODRICK. Q. The left was the gentleman's proper side - the cart was on the right? A. On the left, but on the proper side - the gentleman was on the wrong side.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What were you at? A. Sweeping the crossing. The cart was within five yards of the curb, on the left; the gentleman's horse got on the curb, with the force of the cart. The cart went straight on - it never turned aside.</p>

            . I was standing with Green, sweeping the crossing. I have known the prisoner a long time. I think the gentleman was in fault, for he was not on his proper side, and he came cantering up; the cart was coming straight down the Quadrant; a carriage was coming up, which prevented the gentleman keeping the proper side.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the pavement? A. Within five yards; the accident happened just at the crossing, by Piccadilly; the cart was right in the middle. I did not see the gentleman's horse on the pavement.</p>

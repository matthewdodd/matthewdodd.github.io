I was standing on the stairs, and nobody near me but the prisoner, till I called for a constable. I felt a check at my watch; the prisoner's hand and knee went together; I catched him by the shoulder. Mr. Heartley a constable came, and upon opening the prisoner's coat, I saw the string and seal hang down from a slit in the lining of the prisoner's coat near the bottom.</p>

            . I am a constable: I saw the prosecutor swear in a substitute. I heard him call out, I lost my watch this moment; there was only a half-breast board between us. I found the watch in the inside of the lining of the prisoner's slap of his coat, and the string and seal hanging out. I took it out.</p>

            , who had known him both in England and Ireland above six years, who all gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Mr. Higgs. We were swearing in our militia; Mr. Holliday was there in order to swear in a substitute; I heard him call out, he had lost his watch: I gave orders to shut up the doors of the hall: The first person we searched was the prisoner. The watch was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell the position the prosecutor and prisoner were standing in?</p>
               <p>Higgs. I look upon it they were standing equal together, just at the going up on the top of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other people near them?</p>
               <p>Higgs. There were three or four people, if not more, standing close to them, and several more on the bench just by.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any body as near the prosecutor as the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Higgs. There were some quite close.</p>
               <p>Q. to Heartley. Did the prisoner readily open his coat to be searched?</p>

               <p>Heartley. He neither did one thing or another; the seal shewed itself immediately, without the least opening of the coat, as it was unbuttoned; the seal was plain to be seen.</p>
               <p>Higgs. The prisoner absolutely denied the taking of it, and said, he believed it was put there by somebody else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer's lad, and live in Teddington-lane. On the 16th of Dec., about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Ringham and another young man in Shacklegate-lane, near Mr. Carpenter's house—I went home and told my mother, and went out again within twenty minutes to watch them—I went toward. Mr. Carpenter's house—saw Ringham go down the lane—I then saw Lucas and another come over the hedge that parts the lane from Mr. Carpenter's garden—it is ata the back of the house—they joined each other, and all three came out of the lane together—Lucas had something under his arm—I went to tell carpenter—I found him in Mr. Webb's field, about a quarter of a mile off—I re<lb></lb>turned with him to his house—he opened the door with the key—I notice the window of the ground-floor room—all the iron was broken down, and a piece of wood broken off from the bottom of the window was a little open—Carpenter sent me for the police—I made inquiries of persons I met, in consepuence of which I went along the road till I got to Goodall's-corner, which wasa bout half a mile off—I there saw the prisioners standing—when I was about 100 yards from they went in-doors, into Lucas's house—I went to Dodd the policeman's house—he was at home, and I told him what had happened—I went back with him after the prisoners—I did not meet with them—I am certain the prisoner are the men—I knew Lucas before.</p>

               <p>a quarter to four o'clock, Cooper came to my house, and called me—I went with him after the prisoners up Mill-lane—I saw them at the top of the lane, which is a mile and better from the prosecutor's—it was the same lane that Lucas lived in—they went round across the fields, and worked back again towards Lucas's house—as soon as they saw me they ran—I had seen Lucas before, and am sure of him, but am not sure of the other—I went to Mr. Carpenter's—I saw the window broken, and the bar lying down—I went back to New Hampton—I finally took Lucas at his own house, at eight o'clock—none of the things have been found.</p>

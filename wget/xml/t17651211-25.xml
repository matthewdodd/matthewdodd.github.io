On the 6th of November, between 6 and 7 at night, the prisoner, his wife, and another woman, call'd at my house, and desired to stay all night: they said they were going with goods to Hertford fair: they had a horse: they supped, and went to bed betwixt 8 and 9: the maid was ironing: she carried up the linen into a one pair of stairs, after they were gone to bed: they laid in the room above: he made an excuse to come down again for a quart of water, about half an hour after he was gone to bed; he took the water up with him: about 10 o'clock I was call'd up by my wife and maid: they missed the things mentioned in the indictment, from the room they had been put in: I went up to the prisoner's room-door: it was locked: I insisted upon going in: after some time he opened the door: I began to search about, and told him I thought he had things that were not his own: he said he had not; we took up his coat, and in his pocket found the two aprons, one my wife's, the other her mother's: from underneath him we pulled out one of my shirts, from between the feather-bed and the bedstead. I seeing the window open, sent the ostler down to look under it; he went down, and brought up the other shirt, and said he found it under the window: I sent for a constable, and he took the prisoner in charge, and has had the things in his possession ever since (produced in court).</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday evening, the 27th of November, I saw the prisoners standing near the White Horse, where they generally assemble together: they had some books, and knowing there were some stolen, I watched them, and saw them taking them about for sale; I got a man to assist me, and I went and took two books from Fitkin, and while I was taking a third book from Tuston's hat. Fitkin ran away - I pursued and took him in the top room of a house - I then went to Tuston's house, who came with me very willingly; Grimes was the first who had offered the books for sale - I afterwards found the prosecutor in Scotland-yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What did Grimes and Tuston do? A. Both ran away - Tuston said, he received them of a man in Orchard-street, in a long white coat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you keep them? A. Outside the window; I am sure they were there between three and four on Saturday.</p>

            . On that Saturday Grimes brought me three books, and asked me to buy them - I said I would not; the other two prisoners were with him.</p>
               <p>Grime's Defence. I was going through Orchard-street- I met these two young men, who said, "We have been and bought some books - I wish you would ask Mrs. Minchington, where Summers lives, and what is the value of them;" I went to ask, and she called out that she did not deal in books; we went out, and Summers came after us, and said her mistress would buy them - we showed them to her, but she said she would not.</p>
               <p>Fitkin's Defence. I was offered the two English books for 2s. 6d., and I gave 2s. and some halfpence for them.</p>
               <p>The prisoners received good characters.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Ask him, if he did not clap hold of both my Hands at that Time?</p>

             . On Friday the 4th of April, I was coming by the Popish-Chapel , between 7 and 8 o'Clock, and saw Mr. Lampton lay hol d of the Prisoner by the Collar. I stood to see what was the Matter; the Gentleman held him with one Hand, and while he was stooping , (as if it was) to feel in his Fob with the other, I saw the Prisoner with his Right-hand throw a Watch over the Gentleman's left shoulder. Then he said, I have it not, - I did not pick your Pocket! - The Case opened, and the Watch flew in two Pieces; and I ran to take it up, but this Man, (Hadley) took it up before I got to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lampton . While I had him by the Collar, I stooped to feel for my Watch with the other Hand, and found it was gone.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was there not a Woman going by, who said I was wrongfully accused?</p>
               <p>Mr. Lampton . Yes, there was a Woman in the Croud who said so, and I believe I saw the same* Woman in the Bar just now.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mrs. Collier in Green's Building , and at that Time I was standing opposite the Mass-House Door, and saw a Watch flung by me, but whence it came I knew not. It fell by me, in separate Parts; I took it off the Ground and held it up; and Mr. Lampton having seized the Prisoner by the Collar, at the same Time, I asked him, if it was his Watch? He owned it; I am sure I delivered him the same Watch I saw thrown; and that there was one Seal to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lampton . The Watch and Seal which this Witness delivered to me was my own.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Put him, (Hadley) to his Oath, whether Barret was not talking with him at the same Time?</p>
               <p>Hadley. No; I was not.</p>

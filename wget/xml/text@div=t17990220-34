               <p>Q. Was it then dark? - A. It was dark, and the shop was lighted up; an opposite neighbour informed me that a man had entered my shop, and taken three umbrellas; I was at that time in the parlour, gone for a candle; the man who came to inform me, and myself, immediately pursued the prisoner, and took him; he had two umbrellas in his arms, and one dropped at his feet at the time; we brought him back to my shop, and I sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the property you took from him was your's? - A. I am positive of it; I had them in my hand not two hours before, and had seen them within five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they were hanging up in your shop? - A. They were; as we were taking the prisoner to Bow-street, when we got to the top of Little Whitelion-street, Seven-dials, about a dozen fellows came upon us, and one of the party called out to the prisoner, d-n your eyes, why don't you kick; the prisoner at the bar immediately kicked the constable, and gave me a blow across my breast; and some of the party, at that time, knocked down the constable; I seeing the constable in that situation, continued holding him; I was then struck with a bludgeon, which cut my eye very much; I then received another blow upon my shoulder, which knocked me down, and the prisoner was rescued; after they had rescued the prisoner, they came to me a second time, and cut me across the head with a cutlass, or some sharp instrument, that my life was in great danger for some time, and made use of the expression, blast the b-r, I have done him; I was then taken to a surgeon's to be dressed; as soon as I could, I went to the different Police-offices; and having had him in my hands for forty minutes, I identified him as well as I could; I gave information to Mr. Blamite, at Hatton-garden, and in consequence of my information he was detected; they knew him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I wish to ask Mr. Newton, whether he did not find one of the umbrellas in the grocer's shop? - A. No; he had one under his arm, and the other was under his feet; he endeavoured to throw it down the area, but it did not go down.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN DUDLEY sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Davis, the linen-draper: As I was standing at my master's door I saw the prisoner run away from Mr. Newton's door, and I went after him, and stopped him; he had one umbrella under his arm, and the other was down by him; he had nothing with him when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Q.How far from the shop was it that you took him with the umbrellas? - A. About two hundred yards. (Produces the umbrellas).</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179902200031"></xptr>Newton. These are my property, they have my initials upon them, they cost me two pounds ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shop-door open or shut? - A.Shut; I had just served a customer, and shut it after him, and left it so; it has a spring latch, and I am positive it was latched at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door in that sort of security as when you go to bed? - A. Yes, excepting that it was not bolted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Dudley.) Q. Was there not an umbrella found lying upon the grocer's steps? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Newton.) Q. You lost three? - A. Yes; the two that were found upon him, and the one that was upon the grocer's step; he was upon the step when we took him.</p>
               <p>CHARLES SCRANNECK sworn. - I am a parish constable; I was sent for on Friday the 19th, to take charge of the prisoner; as I was going down to Bow-street, Mr. Davis then had the umbrellas, who is not here; and when we got to the Seven-dials, a signal was given by some of the gang, I suppose, to strike; they immediately began to strike, and the man was rescued; the prisoner struck the first blow, and another man knocked me down, but who it was I cannot say; then he got off, but has been retaken.</p>

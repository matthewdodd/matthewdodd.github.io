On the night of the 12th of Jan., about half-past eight o'clock, I saw Clark and Mortishead drawing a truck along Glasshouse-street—they stopped at the door of the prisoner Hickman, which is a marine-store shop—I went there and Mortishead and Clark were in the shop—I went into the shop—Hickman had been out to the truck, and was going in with a piece of lead in his arms, from the truck—Clark was coming out—I told him he must account where that lead came from—he said the other man would account for that—I then asked Mortishead to give me an account of it—he said he could do that, but he did not—Hickman carried the lead he had into the shop, and put it on some rags—Clark then iaid hold of the handle of the truck, and was going away with it—I told him he must not take it till he gave me an account of the lead—he then threw down the handle of the truck and ran away—Mortishead came out of the shop, and turned to the right—I brought him back into the shop—I saw the lead which Hickman had carried into the shop—it was on the rags still—I saw a scale there full of lead—I told Mortishead he must give me an account of that lead—he said he could do that, and said the other prisoner would account for that when he came</p>

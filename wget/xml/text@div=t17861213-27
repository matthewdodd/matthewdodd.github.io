               <p>My Lord, I get my bread by working on the quays; I went on board a lighter to look for work, and coming back I met these gentlemen; they said, I had got a prize; they made me jump in; then they ordered me to be roped; and then they hoisted me to the crane, and suspended me in great torture; and I leave it to your Lordship how far legal their conduct was.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is that true? - He might be suspended to the diversion of those that were around him for a minute or two, but not more.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Well, Gentlemen, this is a clear case; but I do not like people<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178612130046"></xptr> taking into their own hands this mode of punishing; the laws are open, it is a very serious thing, being craned up in this manner, the man might have fallen down and lost his life, and Mr. Goss must have answered for it if he had.</p>

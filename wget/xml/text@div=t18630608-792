                  </hi>. I am a stonemason, at 11, Somerset-place, Hackney-road—on Sunday, 10th May, between 4 and 5, I was in the Barge-house beer shop with a friend of mine, named Sydney Underwood—I saw the two prisoners while we were there—there were four altogether—Gilks' brother was one of them—Underwood remained in, and I went out of the house at the back—when I got into the garden both the prisoners came out, and Huns said to me, "Young man, your friend has gone to the station; we are going too; you had better come with us"—I said to them, "Has he taken those flowers off the table in the parlour?"—we had some wild flowers there—they said, "Yes;" and I went with them down by the side of the water—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186306080026"></xptr>
               <p>we got a little way from the house, Huns was walking next to the water, and Gilks the other side—I had my watch in my left-hand pocket, and as I went along one of them, I do not know which, put their heel behind me and tripped me up, and Gilks took my watch—my friend then came up and said, "Have they got your watch?"—I said, "Yes," and he ran away after them—I lost sight of him at first, and when I saw him again all of them had crossed the water, and Underwood was on the ground, and Huns was kicking him on the head—I jumped into the water after them, and when I got across to him, I was very nearly as bad as he was—I said, "Have you got the watch?"—he said, "No;" and Huns came and hit me in the mouth—there were only three of them in the fields—one got away—we were about the fields perhaps two hours—we kept with them till we could find a policeman—we were in the fields between Tottenham find Edmonton, and when we got to Northumberland Park, Tottenham, I saw a policeman, and gave them in custody—before that Gilks gave me this silk handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had it in the breast-pocket of my coat when I was in the garden—when I went into the garden I left Underwood in the house—Huns said my friend had gone to Edmonton Station, and I said, "What does he want to go to Edmonton for; because we have got a ticket for Tottenham."</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You all swam across the river, you say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We ran across—it was not deep enough to swim—it was about up to my chest—the prisoners would not go away from us—they might have got away if they chose—they said they would sooner be locked op than run away from me—I charged them with stealing my watch, and they denied it—I had not been drinking much—I might have been a little drunk—I had never known the prisoners before—I think my friend was all right—I don't think he was a little drunk—he drank the same amount with me—we drank nothing but ale and stout—we began to drink about 1 o'clock, and off and on till 5—I had some with my dinner—we were coming across a field when I first noticed the prisoners—I did not hear anybody call out to Huns, "Who's your hatter?"—he had a felt hat on, I believe—I and Underwood were not lying asleep on the grass—I never asked them to come with me—I did not say to Underwood, "Come on; we will go with them"—me and my friend got to Chingford-mill—I had nothing at all to do with the prisoners—they were a goodish <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> off us—Underwood got on some private grounds there, and a young man came from a stable and called out to him to get off—Underwood did not go up and strike him, and threaten to throw him into the pond—I saw two other men come up—I did not hear Under-wood abuse them—when we were having the squabble with these men the prisoners came up, and that was the first time we spoke to them, I believe—that was before we went to the public-house—Underwood went in first—he asked the prisoners to have something to drink—I don't know that while they were there, the groom that Underwood had had the quarrel with passed the door—I said to Underwood, "There goes that <hi rend="italic">Johnny</hi> you had them, words with just now"—nothing had been said about him before that—somebody told me he had gone by—I could not swear it was Huns—I then said, "I thought I saw him"—I did not then hear Underwood say, "I will be after him"—I will swear I went out of the house first—I did not go back again after that—I went to the water-closet—I did not ask the prisoners to wait for me—I did not hear a man at that time calling on them to take me away because I was so drunk—I believe one of the prisoners went behind me to put up my brace-button—I did not then ask them to see me</p>

               <p>as far as Tottenham—after they told me that my friend had gone to the station, they said, "We are going too;" and I said, "Wait a minute, and I will come with you"—I don't remember being tick at all on that day—Gilks said that I had lent him my hankerchief to wipe my mouth, but he said at first he had not got it—I swear I was not sick on that day—I missed my handkerchief, and asked them for it, and they said they had not got it, till we saw a policeman—when I told Underwood they had got my watch, he said, "Give me your knife"—I gave it to him, and he ran after them with the knife in his hand, and they ran across the river—when I saw Underwood on the ground I did not see the knife—I said if they had got the watch, and would give it to me, I would let them go; and they said they had not got it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, at 1, Frederick-place, Kings<lb></lb>land-road—on Sunday, 10th May, I was with Corbey at the Barge-house bear-shop, between 4 and 5—I had been in his company all day—before getting to the public-house I had seen the prisoners behind us some distance—I went in and had a pint of stout and a pot of ale, and then saw them outside the door—Corbey then went out at the front door, and Gilks' brother said to me, "Your friend has gone to Edmonton Station"—I said, "Well, I shall go after him;" and I went after him, as I thought—I got about 300 yards, and happened to meet a friend and looked back, and then saw Corbey and the prisoners alongside the river, just over the bridge—Huns was on one side of the prosecutor and Gilks on the other, and the other two were behind—I saw Gilks put his leg behind him, and try to throw him down—Gilks took his watch, tried to unscrew it first, and because he could not do it quick enough, he broke it—I went up to him, and said, "You have got his watch, and if you give it to me, I won't look you up"—he said, "I shan't"—I said, "Then I will make you" and I caught hold of his collar—he had the watch in his hand, and as I was looking after the other for a minute or two, he got away, ran along about twenty yards with the watch, and threw it into the water—it was quite light—it was not a knife he threw in—it was the watch—after that I ran through the river after them, and Huns kicked me directly I got across—I had two struggles with them, and kept them in view till they were given in charge—I said if they did not go I should give them in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>Q. Only just sensible? - A. I was not the worse for liquor; I asked the watchman to shew me where to get something to drink; I had never been at the house before; I sat down, and called for some purl and gin between the watchman and myself; I dare say there were half a dozen drank out of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stand treat? - A. Yes. I paid one shilling for the liquor; the prisoner drank of it, she was very officious, and made very free with me, and I asked her to drink; I fell down before I got there, and cut my forehead; it was freezing very hard, and any body might have fallen down; she came over to wipe the blood off my face; in pulling<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110063"></xptr>out the bag that I had my money in, I laid it on the table, and I found in about a minute it was gone; the landlord observed it, and said, what are you doing with the man's bag? and she said, if it was not for you, he would not have known any thing about it; I took it out of her hand, and found it all safe; after that, she told me she would get me a comfortable bed.</p>
               <p>Q. After she had attempted to rob you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you pretend you were sober? - A. I was stupid with the cold.</p>
               <p>Q. After having had gin and purl? - A. Yes; she took me to a place that she said was her lodging, but she did not go in; that was in <placeName id="t18040111-74-crimeloc443">New Gravel-lane</placeName>

I am single, and live at 3, George-street, King-street, Borough—I know the deceased; she went by the name of Ann Carr, and lived with the prisoner at 33, George-street—the prisoner has a little girl named Mary Jane Crane, who lived with them—they all three occupied the same room, the first-floor front—the prisoner and Ann Carr did not live happily together, they were always quarrelling—they continued to live together, but they had occasional misunderstandings, such as other men and women who live together occasionally have—she had lived with Crane so far as I can recollect about four years—she had no children—on 9th Janu<lb></lb>ary, about half-past eight o'clock, I was in her bed-room; she was in bed, and the landlady, Mrs. Downing, and the prisoner's little girl were in the room—the deceased was well and hearty then—the prisoner came home at five or ten minutes past 11—he asked me if I had seen his wife, I said, "No, I have not"—he asked me if I would go and get a pot of beer for him, and I went; when I came back he was up stairs, and I heard him say, "Get up you b—drunken b—, or else I will kick your b—guts out"—I do not know where he was then—I then heard her scream—I was down stairs in the landlady's room, and it sounded to come from up stairs—about two minutes afterwards I heard her say, "O father, do not kick me so," and then he came down stairs with a light—(they usually called each other "mother" and "father")—I said, "George, what game have you been up to?"—he said, "Why the b—is drunk"—I said, "Well, if she is drunk</p>

She made no answer, and he went over by the fire, and sat down, and said, "I do not know what it can be, I do not know what I can get for it"—she said, "You know very well; it is where you kicked me last night"—he turned round and said, "And a b—good job"—I than went home—I returned about 2 o'clock, and he was still sitting by the fire—he asked me to go to the pawnbroker's for him, and I took a child's frock, and pawned it for him for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and brought it back to him with the ticket—I then stopped in while he went out and got something for his dinner—about 10, or half-past 10 in the evening, he was out of bed, rubbing the deceased's neck, and calling "Mother;" and he asked me if I would go down and tell his sister that Annie was dying—I did no, and when I came back she was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Elliott, of Paradise-place, George-street—I have known the deceased about four years—on Tuesday night, 9th January, I was in her room—she was in bed—she seemed in pretty good health—I went there on the Thursday, and saw the prisoner in the room, and several other people—some one, I cannot tell who, said, "It is a bad job that Annie is dead"—I said, "Yes, it is a bad job"—the prisoner, said, "I cannot help it"—I said, "May be, perhaps you can help it; you know, George, you beat her many a time"—he said, "I own to all that, but I did not do this"—I have frequently seen him beat her, but not within the last three months—I have interfered between them several times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When yon have seen him beat her as you say, was that on occasions when she was drunk? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—she has got beastly drunk—the prisoner to my knowledge has frequently dragged her from the public<lb></lb>house himself, and begged and implored of her to give up drinking—he is a hardworking man, working all day, and coming home at night—they call him in the papers a cab touter at London-bridge—when that conversation occurred next day, he appeared sorry, and concerned for her death.</p>

I live opposite to 33, George-street—on Tuesday night, 9th January, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was awoke by a screaming which seemed to me to be opposite, across the street—it is a narrow street, but a horse and cart can pass by—the screams were in a woman's voice—I did not interfere because we used to hear it frequently, and she was very much given to drink.</p>

                  </hi>, M.R.C.S. I live at 13, White-street, Borough—on Friday afternoon, between five and six o'clock, I think, but am not certain, I went to see the deceased—I found her dead and laid out—the clothes were taken from her body, and she was covered with a sheet—the eyes were very much blackened, and the belly very much distended, greatly swollen—there were other bruises about the face, one on the side of the face, and the right side of the jaw was bruised—a portion of the outside rim of the right ear was gone, that was recent, and also a small portion of the left ear—I am not certain that that was not inflicted after death; it had the appearance of having been gnawed by rats—I found the right shoulder very much dis<lb></lb>coloured by bruises, which appeared to be recent—the right elbow seemed greatly bruised and black, that was recent—the right hip was also greatly discoloured, the bruise extended from the hip round the right buttock—there were many small bruises and scratches on the hands, small lacerations, or very shallow scratches and bruises—I examined the legs and found the same small bruises and scratches on the front of the shin bones—there were a great many on various parts of the legs, and all over the body there were small bruises, I should think 100 if I had counted; there were a great number—there were many about the hands and wrists, more particularly the fingers—the bruises were not caused after death—there was nothing external to signify the cause of death unless it was the collective effect of such a large number of bruises, some of which were immense—I cannot state that that might not have caused so much disturbance as to cause death from the general shock—on the 16th I proceeded to open the body; it was particularly well nourished—I examined the cavity of the pleura and the lungs; they were, generally speaking, healthy, but there was a slight con<lb></lb>gestion of the top of the right lung, and what we call calcareous deposit, evidence of disease, but not of a very important character, nor was it recent—the heart was perfectly healthy, but peculiarly empty of blood—there was no outward bruise on the belly, but on raising the skin I found the muscle and flesh underneath greatly bruised and blackened on the right side at the lower part, and the faciae and integuments underneath were greatly dis<lb></lb>coloured—the faciae is the cellular tissue which lies immediately under the fat and integuments—I am alluding to a black patch—the discolouration might be continuous with the large bruise on the right hip, but it did not extend there on the outside; it was not visible outside—it is very likely that a blow might be given without making a bruise outside, but which would make one inside, many cases are well known; even a cart wheel has gone over the body of a living person and destroyed an organ inwardly, and yet left no outward mark—I divided the muscles and the wall of the belly—on opening the belly the first thing that I saw was that the intestines were much more red than they could be in health; also that they were matted together by lymph, which could be peeled off, the product of inflam<lb></lb>mation—I carefully lifted the intestines aside and saw a large quantity of feculent fluid in the cavity of the belly, and in doing that I found a hole in the small intestine through which feculent matter was oozing as I lifted it—on examining it further, I found a dark crimson discharged patch about two inches long, going about three parts round the circumference of the intes<lb></lb>tine; the hole was in the centre of the patch—the immediate cause of death was the perforation of the intestine allowing the escape of the contents of the intestine into the cavity. of the belly—the brain, uterus, and kidneys were healthy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What size was the hole? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was ragged and the edges</p>

               <p>broke down under the finger; it was about three quarters of an inch in diameter—it was at the side of the belly, on the under side of the loup of the intestine—I had to lift it up, and found the hole was at the back—it was the small intestine, the <hi rend="italic">illium</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRIFFITHS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What in your opinion would have caused that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> External violence in all probability—a knife would be likely to cause it—judging from the general appearance of the body, if she fell with great violence over a sharp corner it might have produced the injury to the intes<lb></lb>tine, but it could not have produced at the same time the external bruises on the right side—a sharp corner such as I describe would be likely to leave a mark outside, and a kick would be likely to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> If the kick would have produced the external marks, so would similar marks arise from a corner of a box, would they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, probably—the absence of external appearances is consistent with it being either a kick or a fall, and so would the existence of external bruises be—I should expect them in both cases—some people exhibit external marks and others do not—I opened the stomach, but did not detect the smell of alcohol; the distance of time at which the examination was made might probably account for that—the cause of death was no doubt mischief inside the abdomen, the immediate cause of that being perforation—the perforation was in the posterior part of the fold of the <hi rend="italic">illium</hi> where the loup of the intestines lies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Posterior in reference to what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Anatomically we should call that the anterior part which is not attached; but I am speaking as I found the intestines when I opened the body—I do not say anterior and posterior with reference to the back and front of the body; it would be right and left—it would be on the left-side as the intestines lay in a loup—the <hi rend="italic">illium</hi> passes transversely through the <hi rend="italic">jejunum</hi> to join the other intestines in a number of loupes—it was only on one loup that the perform<lb></lb>tion was—that portion would be lying perpendicular in the normal state, not transversely—it would depend on whether the intestines were full or empty, whether the loupes lay in a sort of vermicular form—that is not the state in which they would be found in a dead body as contradistinguished from perpendicular—it might have been perpendicular or transverse, I am unable to say which; I only say what I found—this particular fold lay perpendicular—the perforation was towards the side of the abdomen on the same side as the liver; but the liver is up here—the portion of the <hi rend="italic">illium</hi> in which the perforation was beneath the hip bone in that cavity—perforation is sometimes the result of disease—I made a preparation of the intestine—I have not got it here, but I can send for it—the orifice is ragged and is the centre of what has the appearance of a bruise—the edges were bruised and torn with the surrounding part—that might be the result of external violence—the bruise could not be produced by disease, but by external causes—I believe cases are known of perforation of the intestines, where death is instantaneous, without any previous apparent causes, but they are excessively rare; I never saw a case—there was an appearance of incipient disease in the liver; you could hardly call it disease, it indicated that some time hence the woman would have liver disease—it was more in the condition of showing that disease was approaching—there was not such an appearance as to lead me to suppose her health was injured—I do not think the hundred scratches and bruises were of old standing, there might have been only eighty, I did not count them—I had no acquaintance with the deceased professionally, and do not know her habits.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRIFFITHS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Considering the bruises you found in the stomach, do you think it likely that the perforation was from internal causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not—if she had fallen on the box, the blow on the shoulder would certainly not have occurred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> About what age was the woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am told she was thirty-eight, but the face was so much discoloured I could not form an opinion—she might be from thirty to forty—perforation caused by disease would be instantly known to the patient, because it would produce agonizing pain—when I said external violence would cause it, I spoke of the hole and of the bruises—if a drunken woman was undressing herself and stumbled and fell against the corner of a sailor's chest, it might inflict that injury, but it would depend on the height she fell—I was told that she fell off the bed to the box—I say that a person would require to fall with very great force to inflict it—I believe that perforation would occasion pain which would gradually increase in severity as the matter came through it—the conclusion I arrive at that this should be imputed to violence depends a good deal on the other marks on the body, such as the blackening at the hip.</p>

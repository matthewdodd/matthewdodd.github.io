               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250036"></xptr>Q. Had he intimated an intention to leave your service? - A. He had not; on the 25th I got a search-warrant to search his lodgings; I attended Macmanus to Gray's-Inn-lane; the prisoner was at home; Macmanus entered first, and told him his business, and asked him if he had any property of mine; he said, he had none; upon the execution of the warrant there was found, in my presence, these six towels, a second volume of the Age of Louis XV. the Art of Swimming, a blank book, another book, which was blank till he wrote in it, a manuscript book, an account of costs, two cut glass bottles, a silver hook, they call it an Alderman's hook, and a bottle label; I cannot swear to any of them positively, except the manuscript, the towels, the silver hook, the second volume of the Age of Louis XV. and the Art of Swimming; I believe the rest to be my property; the prisoner admitted the towels were mine, but not the rest of the things.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the towels? - A. A shilling a-piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. With respect to the manuscript book, was he not permitted to glean from your Office all the information he could? - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that it is customary, on all occasions, for a clerk to take copies of the precedents of his master? - A. Regular clerks, not an hired clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not that a manuscript of costs? - A. Yes, it was in the state it is now when I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. As to any individual in the world out of the profession, is it worth two-pence to any man in the world? - A. It is an account of costs for fifty or sixty years back.</p>
               <p>Q.Except for your own information, it is of no value? - A. I should suppose there are people would be glad to have it.</p>
               <p>Q. That might be taken for the purpose of copying only without your consent - the towels have no mark upon them? - A. I can swear to them from their complexion, make, and his confession.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the care of your towels after his marriage? - A. Not generally after his marriage.</p>
               <p>Q. He had the care of them, and used to give them out to wash? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that he took them home to his wife to wash? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.There is a book, an odd volume of Louis XV. an amusing story he might take away for his amusement, it is worth nothing as an odd volume? - A. No, I suppose not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He could not improve in his profession by the towels? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He could not improve his knowledge by the hook? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were the things loose? - A. The towels were found in a paper, the books in his book-case, the other articles in his drawer.</p>

             sworn. - I am the porter's wife at Barnard's Inn, and laundress to Mr. Young.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner last at chambers? - A. The 5th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect him to leave the chambers? - A. No, he left the door wide open; I, seeing the door open, went in; I saw him the night after; he called at the lodge-room, and said, dame, how are you? I said, when you went away, you left the door wide open, and the things were gone; he said, I did not know I left the door open; that was funny indeed; that was all that passed between us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what part of the chambers the towels were kept in? - A. No, I don't, I believe they were kept in the middle of the room; there are some such now in the chambers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not recollect where the towels were - you had never seen them before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to swear to them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say you are a laundress, you mean you take care of the chambers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't wash the linen? - A. No, he always gave that out to wash.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know his lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.During his absence from chambers, did he always live in the same lodgings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he live in those lodgings when he went away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the things were found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You all knew where his lodgings were? - A. Yes, I knew he lodged there a good while.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. (To Mr. Young.) Q. Is that a silver hook? - A. I believe it is; it is silver.</p>
               <p>Q.Though it was silver, and worth something, he had not disposed of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, as to the articles of plate and bottles, I know nothing of them; the manuscript books were taken home to copy for my instruction, with intention to return them; the towels were taken home by me for no other purpose than to be marked; it not being convenient for my wife to do it just then, I placed them in the book-case.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 26th of July I remarked that some empty bottles had been removed from a bin in the cellar, where I had seen them the night before; I found a hat there, which Carty acknowledged to be his at the office - I believe this hamper and bottles to be our property, but I cannot swear to them; they are old bottles.</p>

            . I am a wine porter in the prosecutor's employ. On the 26th of July I saw Carty coming out of their premises, about five o'clock in the evening, with a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140074"></xptr>hamper, as I was turning out of Carlton-street; Spruhen was standing at the door; I went to Spruhen, and asked where Martin was going; he said it was an empty hamper which he had lent him to carry some things for his sister - that he was going to Wardour-street; but he had gone down Jermyn-street; I went in and sat down in the counting-house, and in about twenty minutes I saw Martin come back with a hamper hanging by a rope on his shoulder; he was coming in, but saw me, and turned back and went up Regent-street - when he was gone we locked up the place; I went home the next evening about six o'clock; I was going there again and saw Martin coming out with a hamper on his shoulder, which appeared to me to be full; Mr. Hilton had then left the place; Spruhen was standing at the door; I followed Martin down Jermyn-street to Duke-street; he crossed over to No. 10, a door with the name of Hodson on it; I saw him knock, and I went and stood at a door that he might not see me; he knocked two or three times, and sometimes sat down on the hamper; I sent for a constable, who went and brought him to me; he was then taken to the watch-house, and I went back to Spruhen; I asked if he had seen Martin that day; he said No; I said, "Are you certain;" he then said he had seen him about dinner time - I said "Have you not seen him since" - he then said he had seen him once; I said "Did you lend him a hamper to night to move crockery for his sister;" he said Yes; I said "Was any think in the hamper;" he said No; I said "There was straw in it, and was there any bottles;" he said No; I said "There was, and Martin was gone to the watch-house;" he said, "Lord, Lord, I have done wrong;" I said, "You should have considered that before."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you in the prosecutor's employ? - A. Yes; Martin stood twenty minutes at the door, and any one might have seen him; I do not think he saw me; he returned openly with the hamper on his shoulder; I have had no quarrel with him.</p>

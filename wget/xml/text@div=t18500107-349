                  </hi>. I live at Great George-street, Westminster, and am secretary of the West Cornwall Railway Company, where the prisoner was clerk—I keep the money in my back office, in an iron safe and leather bag—in consequence of suspicions one day last week, I marked two half-sovereigns, and about two o'clock put them into the bag and the bag in the safe, which I left open—I consider the money was mine, I was answerable for it—between two and half-past I examined the cash, and missed a sove<lb></lb>reign—the one produced by Field is one I put in—I sent for the police, and procured the attendance of the whole of the officers of the establishment, and Captain Morson, the chairman—I then stated to Captain Morson, that I had lost money, and had that day lost a sovereign, saying I had marked one—Inspector Field then expressed a wish to search the parties present, and first commenced on Hart who was nearest to him—he asked Hart what money he had—he said, "Some silver" I believe, and produced something like 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—Field asked him if he had a sovereign about him—I cannot say whether he returned any answer, but he produced a sovereign from his waistcoat pocket—Field took it up, handed it to me, and asked me if it was my money—I examined the mark and date, and it was mine.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-inspector</hi>). I was called to the Company's house—the prisoner was called into the room, and Captain Morson the chairman, and two other parties came in—Mr. Butterton told Captain Morson he had lost a sovereign that afternoon—the prisoner was nearest to me, and I asked him if he had any silver—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he had no sovereign—I cannot say whether he said yes or not—he was busy pulling the money out of his pocket, and I caught the sovereign out of his hand—he did not say he had not got one—I gave it to Mr. Butterton—he examined it, and found it was one he knew.</p>

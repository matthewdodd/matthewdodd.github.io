               <p>Q. Had the other man a pistol?</p>
               <p>Savill. I cannot say: they took from me a moidore, half a guinea, a five and three-pence, and some silver: I believe about 8 s. in silver: I am certain to 7 s. or 8 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it pretty dark?</p>
               <p>Savill. Yes, so dark that I could not discover their persons; they held the pistols very near my head on both sides; one had hold of one side of my coat the other of the other. About three weeks after the watch was advertized by Justice Camper; I applied there, and there I saw it.</p>

               <p>Staines. I took notice of it at Mr. Camper's, and I know it by the seals and chain; we went to the Black-horse in Kingsland-road after the robbery and there I looked at the watch.</p>

               <p>Q. Not the house just by it, you go there sometimes?</p>
               <p>Staines. No.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the watch I was robbed of. When the third came up, and demanded my money, I said if you use me well you shall have it; I was going to unbutton my breeches pocket, the third put his hand in my pocket and took the money out; I thought there had been a guinea among it; I said I was going into company, and had no money; I asked them for a guinea back, they said as I behaved like a gentlemen they would give me a shilling which they did.</p>

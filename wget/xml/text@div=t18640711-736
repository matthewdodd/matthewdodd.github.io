                  </hi>. I live at 17, St. Mary's-buildings, Rotherhithe—I am in the service of Mr. Hogarth, of the Thames Tunnel Iron Wharf—he had two fowls, a cock and a hen—they were kept in the yard at the works—I cannot swear positively that the cock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bird—to the best of my belief it is—I have no doubt it is my master's property, because I have seen it in his yard.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 205). On Friday morning, the 24th, I saw the prisoner in Albion-street—he had a cock concealed under his coat—I asked him what he had got—he said a fowl—I asked him where he had got it from, and he said from his father—he asked me to go there—I said, "I will take you to the station first, and go to your father afterwards"—I took him to the station—he dropped the fowl and ran away—there were two other constables following, and he was stopped—I went to Mr. Hogarth's shed—I found in the roost some feathers resembling that bird—I also saw footmarks leading from the shed to the prisoner's father's house—I did not notice them sufficiently to say whether they were the prisoner's or not—when I stopped him he was going towards his own house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was he sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he tried to make his escape—the bird could not get away; its foot was broken; I put it up in splints—the feathers I produced resemble in colour and length the hind part of the bird—they would resemble the feathers of any other bird—the foot<lb></lb>marks I saw led from the prisoner's father's—his premises are separated by a wall and fence from Mr. Hogarth's—I do not recollect having a man named William Jones in my custody a short time ago for drunkenness—I do not remember going to his house and saying, "I am going to see after a man named Baker"—Jones did not say, "What, do you know a man named Baker?"—I did not say, "Yes; I know him, and will have him in a month"—I swear the prisoner did not say, when I asked him where he got the cock, that it was one of his father's—after he got to the station, he said he</p>

                  </hi>. I live in premises next door to the prosecutor—there is no wall separating our places at all, only a dilapidated wooden fence—I keep fowls, as many as fifty or sixty at a time—I have about twenty at the present time—I should not like to swear how many I had six weeks ago—I should rather think the fowl produced is mine; it is very much like—there are plenty of holes in the fence between our places—it is a temporary fence made of staves of barrels—the prosecutor's fowls have strayed on to my premises—my son has worked for me up to the present time—I left him on the night in question at quarter past 11, quite drunk—I never knew any charge made against him except at Christmas, when he was drunk and incapable—my place is, I should say, about 200 yards from where the prisoner lives—I should say where the fowl was picked up was seventy yards from where he lives—I have told him at times of my losing fowls.</p>

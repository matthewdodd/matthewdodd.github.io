On the 6th of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming through Rosemary-lane, and saw the prisoner and another man run up another street into Rosemary-lane - an elderly man came up, and a scuffle ensued between him and the prisoner, his companion was with him - the prisoner did not appear to be sober, but the elderly man was. He knocked the prisoner over a woman's barrow; several people stopped and laughed, and I joined in the laugh. The elderly man was then taken from the prisoner, and the prisoner asked me what cause I had to laugh? I had not spoken to him, I only laughed with other people - I told him to say nothing, the old man was enough for him; I then walked on in the road, leaving him and his companion behind - that was all I said to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attempt to strike him, or hold up your fist at him - A. No, not at that time. I had not walked many yards before the prisoner and his companion came up to me - the prisoner asked me what business I had with the affair that had just happened? I had taken no part in it, I was only a spectator. I told him again that it was nothing to me, the old man was enough for him, and if he had any call with me he would not come off so easy. The prisoner said to his companion twice,</p>
               <p>"Give me the stick!" his companion did not give it to him, but came up to me, took me by the arm, and told me to excuse the prisoner, for he was in liquor. I told him not to lead me, for I did not want to have any thing to do with him or the prisoner. I then left them, and went up Back-church-lane, about a quarter of a mile off, and in less than a quarter of an hour after I left them I went into a wheelwright's yard in Back-lane, and asked the price of some wheels. I turned my head round, and saw the prisoner's companion standing against the gate of the yard; his companion said,</p>
               <p>"Here he is! go on" - I did not see the prisoner at that time. I then came out of the yard, his companion still stood at the gate, and looked me very hard in the face. I came out, passed him, and saw the prisoner a little way forward. I passed the prisoner also - I neither spoke to him, nor made any gestures at him - I took no notice of him. Both of them then followed me very close, so close that I was afraid they were going to trip me up. I crossed over the road, they both crossed after me. I came into the Commercial-road, they still followed me. I had occasion to go through <placeName id="t18200628-75-crimeloc421">Brick-lane, Whitechapel</placeName>

The prisoner then said,</p>
               <p>"Why, I will rip your bl - dy guts open!" We were then about half a mile from where I parted with them in Rosemary-lane. He immediately made a stab at me with his hand. I had no suspicion at that time that he had any instrument with him. He struck me, I lifted up my hand to strike him - I then saw the knife in his hand, and felt the blood running down me from my left side in the lower part of my body. I cried out,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God! that man has stabbed me!" The prisoner and his companion immediately ran away; they were pursued. I was immediately taken to a surgeon's in Whitechapel, and got my wound dressed, I then went home and went to bed. On the Wednesday following it got so bad I was obliged to go into the hospital - (it happened on a Saturday) - the surgeon who attended me there is dead. I continued in the hospital as an in-patient for a fortnight. I was confined first at my own house for three days. I could walk with great pain, but did not till I went into the hospital. I was confined a week to my bed there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You came up, hearing a running and noise - A. I was going past; I heard no cry of Stop thief! I think the old man had two arms. The prisoner was in liquor, but did not appear very drunk - he could walk and run very well.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he should not come off so easy with you - A. When he followed and spoke to me I did - I did not wish to fight if they would let me alone. If he had struck me I should have struck him again. I did not say I would bring him to his senses, or any thing of the kind. I do not know that he had a knife in his hand then.</p>
               <p>Q. In the Commercial-road you said if they wanted any thing out of you they had better take it, you meant to fight - A. Yes. I did not put myself in a fighting attitude till after he struck me, I then lifted up my arm to attempt to strike him but did not. I did not tell the Magistrate that I struck him.</p>

            . I have been a labourer in the East India Company's service, and live in Turner-street, Commercial-road - I am out of employ being ill. The prisoner and prosecutor were both strangers to me. I saw the prisoner, his companion, and the prosecutor standing at the top of Back-church-lane talking; I was on the opposite side of the way. I saw the prisoner make a thrust at the prosecutor - I did not see any weapon at the time - the prosecutor doubled up immediately as if he was going to fall. He exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"Oh Lord! he has stabbed me!" I came across the road; he pulled his waistcoat up, and the blood ran profusely from the lower part of his side. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182006280037"></xptr>saw the prisoner and his companion run away. I stopped with the prosecutor till some people went away with him. I left, and did not see the weapon with which the wound was given. The prisoner was taken and brought back - a knife was produced; I did not see it taken from him - there was no appearance of blood upon it. I did not see the prosecutor again till after he came out of the hospital.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to the office about five o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of May, he was charged with stabbing a man. I found a very small knife in his pocket, which I produce; it did not appear to be bloody - no other knife was produced. No person appeared with him as his companion. The prosecutor was not able to attend. I saw his wound about an hour after - the doctor said it might have been done with this knife. I know he was confined sometime in the hospital - the doctor who first attended him is not dead.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not very much in liquor - A. Certainly, he was. I believe he has shown every contrition for it, and appeared very much concerned.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never wished to do anybody grievous bodily harm, and never had the intent. I never heard the words. On the 6th of May, about half-past four o'clock, I was coming along very drunk, ran against a public-house window, and broke it - the servant laid hold of me, somebody said,</p>
               <p>"Let him go, I will pay for it" - he let me go and struck me; he had but one arm. Being in liquor I struck him again; some people who knew me took me away. I fell over a wheelbarrow. I walked on, Browning came after me and said to me first,</p>
               <p>"The old man would have beat you well." I did not speak to him, for I was so much in liquor - I did not know which way I was going. A young man told him to take no notice of me, for I was in liquor. I turned up Church-lane; Browning came after me and said,</p>
               <p>"You have broken a window, and ought to pay for it." The young man told him again not to notice me, and shoved me on. Browning said,</p>
               <p>"Lend me that stick, if he is in liquor I will fetch him out." He would not lend him the stick, but took hold of his arm, and pressed him not to notice me. Accordingly Browning came after me - I took my knife out of my pocket, and said,</p>
               <p>"Young man, if you will let me have half that stick he may take the other half, and see if he can beat me with it." Directly Browning heard this, he flew at me, and struck me on the back of my neck - I went to hit him again, and when I hit him, whether I stuck the knife into him, or he ran against it, I cannot tell. He hit me away from him - I stood, and never moved from the spot. When he was going to hit me again, somebody cried out,</p>
               <p>"He has got a knife, or some sharp instrument, in his hand!" I walked away, and as I was going away, he said,</p>
               <p>"He has stabbed me!" I was taken afterwards, but being in liquor I could not stand, and was sick in the lock-up place. On Sunday I sent to the prosecutor's - he said he was stabbed, but not much hurt; and as I was in liquor he would take no notice of it. I said I would give him 2 l. Next day I sent, and he said 5 l. would pay his expences, and he would take that, and have nothing to do with it. Since that he has sent his landlord to say, that if my friends would rise 5 l. now, and 5 l. more in a fortnight, he would give it up. I could have no malice towards him, and did not want to take his life. I did not go up to him like a thief. I did not think I had the knife in my hand when I struck him.</p>

            . I live in Brown Bear-alley, East Smithfield - I am married and am a silk-weaver. The prisoner is a stranger to me. I was going to Bow to meet my mother and help her home from work. I left home at five o'clock, went up Back Church-lane, and saw the prisoner cross and Browning after him. Browning was behind the prisoner, and took hold of him and shook him. I saw nobody with the prisoner, but I did not take notice. Several people were round him, so that I could not see whether he had a companion or not. That is all I have to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see any wound - A. No: my business called me to meet my mother at such a time, and I went on.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this to strike your attention - A. Why, I will tell you. I came back again, saw the mob there and this young man, and gave him my direction. I had then met my mother by the hospital, about a quarter of an hour's walk from where I saw him strike the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Your mother came to the spot with you - A. No, not the spot, because I met her, and then returned back. The crowd was then at Lambeth-street office - I went into the lock-up place and told the young man what I had seen. I did not know what had happened then. I went in from curiosity, and heard he had stabbed a man.</p>
               <p>BROWNING re-examined. The prisoner did same frequently, in kindness, to enquire after my health.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character for mildness and evenness of temper.</p>

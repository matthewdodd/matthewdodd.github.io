George Capper and Co. keep cash at our house, and had considerably more than 261 l. in our hands on the 23d of November - on which day, about three o'clock, the prisoner presented this cheque at our banking-house; immediately on taking it into my hands I doubted the authenticity of the signature, but being very dubious at making any demur at a cheque of Messrs. Cappers, I placed it on the book, and entered it for payment, proceeded to the Bank note drawer, and took out 260 l., but I requested Mr. Matthews, another clerk, to look at the signature, and by the time I had entered the notes, Matthews came up, looked at the draft, and said it was all right. I handed the prisoner the 260 l. and while I was preparing the odd money, Matthews suggested a doubt about it. I either asked the prisoner then, or previously, if he received it for, or of Messrs. Cappers; his answer was, for, or of 
               <persName id="t18241202-115-person750">Mr. Purdy</persName>
            , of the Commercial sale rooms; Mr. Matthews went to Messrs. Cappers', to ascertain the authenticity of the cheque. I believe I had told the prisoner that there was a difference in the signature; he was near enough to hear the conversation between me and Matthews, and a few minutes after Matthews was gone, he said he thought, or was afraid that there was something odd about the cheque, and began to state that he was out of employ, and had given the porter at the Royal Exchange a shilling to stick up a bill, but that bill was not written large enough - he had written another; he was stating something further about the bill, but my original suspicions being confirmed, I asked him to give me back the note, which he did. I requested him to walk into a private room; he then resumed the conversation, and stated more clearly about the bill, and that, after the second bill was stuck up, a very respectable person asked him if he was out of employ, and if the bill was his writing. After some conversation they went to the New York coffee house, and after some conversation there, the person sent him to receive this draft. I then asked who he had lived with - he said, 
               <persName id="t18241202-115-person751">Mr. Williams</persName>
            , a tea-broker, of Jewry-street, and that while he was there a very unpleasant circumstance occurred at Messrs. Williams, the bankers. Being aware that 200 l. had been improperly obtained from Messrs. Williams, I said "Do you allude to the 200 l. being obtained from them?" I do not recollect his answer, for about that time the conversation terminated by the arrival of Mr. Matthews. I think he then, or had previously requested, some one might be sent to the New York coffee-house; for he said there was a gentleman sitting there at the time he was sent, and probably he might be there now. About this time, I think, Mr. Matthews and Mr. Capper, arrived - I requested an officer might be sent for - the prisoner still urged the propriety of sending to the New York coffee-house, but I and Mr. Capper thought it expedient to wait till the officer arrived; who took him there. I and Mr. Capper followed; the waiter, who did not seem to have any distinct recollection of the circumstance, except that there had been a person sitting in the place to which the prisoner pointed. He was kept in custody, and examined before the Lord Mayor next day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he been with you before he said he had received it from somebody at the New York coffee-house? I think nearly five minutes. Mr. Matthews went out at the front door to go to Messrs. Capper, and returned with Mr. Capper, and gave the cheque to me - it has not been out of my possession since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. Did you doubt merely on account of the signature, or because you thought the account overdrawn? A. Solely on account of the signature. I think I handed him the money before I asked where he got it. I rather doubt whether I gave him the money first, but have a difficulty in determining which. There was no variation in his account, only the conversation in the private room was rather more detailed - he urged me twice or more to send to the coffee-house - he left the banking house in custody - if any one had been waiting for him they would have seen that he was in custody. I did not give him the 1 l. 18 s. 5 d.</p>

            . I am clerk at Sir John Perring and Co.'s banking-house. I have heard Mr. Vile's statement. From the manner in which he requested me to look at the cheque I considered that he doubted the signature, and as I wished to do it with a good deal of caution, I merely took a glance at it, and thinking that I saw a private mark, which is usually on Messrs. Capper's cheques, I considered it right; but on looking more minutely at the filling up, I suggested a doubt to Mr. Vile, and told him, in the prisoner's hearing, that he had better not pay it - (There had been a complaint of Messrs. Capper having lost a cheque of a different amount). Mr. Vile said, I had better step to Messrs. Capper's, to inquire if they had drawn the cheque, which I did, taking it with me. They live in Crosby-square. I returned in about a quarter of an hour, and delivered Mr. Vile the cheque, and I think Mr. Capper declared it to be a forgery - the prisoner was present and in hearing - I fetched an officer. The amount of the cheque lost was 61 l. 18 s. 5 d. - the figures being the same as in this, except the figure 2, but I think it was payable to Mr. Bashel, or some such name; it was lost in July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Glancing your eye over it, you considered it correct by a private mark? - A. Yes; it is two lines on the side of the cheque. I have no reason to suppose, that the prisoner ever saw the lost cheque - there was no understood private mark between us; but most of their cheques were so marked, and have a letter and folio, which is wanting in this.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Are you in the habit of paying their cheques? - A. Yes; and believe it not to be their signature; it is a close imitation. I at first looked at it at a distance of full half a yard, and said, it was right; but on taking it into my hands, I immediately doubted.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took him into-custody; he requested me to go to the New York coffee-house with him, which I did; he looked about, and said the gentleman was not there. At the Mansion House he said a person, representing himself as Mr. Purdy, of the Commercial sale rooms, gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 23d of November, in the morning, I went to the Exchange, to have a bill posted for a situation in a counting-house; the porter demanded 1 s.; I went several times in the course of the morning, to see where he had posted it, but could not see it, and at three o'clock the person to whom I had given it was pointed out; he said he had not put it up, not considering the letters large enough - he gave it to me back, and I promised to bring another in the morning. I was reading the bill, and a gentleman asked me if it was my writing; I said Yes - he asked where I had lived: I referred him to Mr. Williams. He said his name was Purdy, of the Commercial sale rooms - that he wanted a clerk, and would employ me; he took me to the New York coffee-house, and questioned me as to my abilities, in the presence of a strange gentleman, and after asking at what time he could see my former employers, he said, "Will you take this cheque to Perring's, get it cashed, and bring the money here;" I went, and received 260 l. - another gentleman came up - they did not like to pay the money; I gave them the address of the supposed Mr. Purdy - the clerk was sent with the cheque; I remained outside the counter for ten minutes, and could have escaped with the money, but I stated how I became possessed of the cheque, and within two minutes repeatedly urged the necessity of sending to the coffee-house. The officer went with me after half an hour had elapsed - there was nobody in the room; the waiter remembered my being there with a gentleman, and that another gentleman was sitting where I pointed. I wrote to Messrs. Perring and Co. to cause enquiry to be made, and they have sent word to the Governor that they had ascertained who the gentleman was, and that he was at my service; it was Mr. Trigoni: it is through the influence of Sir John Perring that he is here. If the porter had stuck up the bill this would never have occurred: it is all owing to his negligence.</p>

            . I am a porter of the Royal Exchange. I cannot speak to the prisoner, but I remember a young man bringing me a bill, which I did not stick up, because I thought his address was not legible enough. The prisoner may be the person. He came in the afternoon, and I gave it him back with the shilling - he said he would bring another.</p>
               <p>Mr. LAW. Q. Is it the nearest way from the Change to this banking house, to pass the New York coffee-house? A. No; the banker's is not a minute's walk.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Lawrence and Co. Watling-street. On the 23d of November I was at the New York coffee-house. I saw a young man there, but had only a side view of his countenance. The prisoner is precisely the same in stature. A well-dressed person was with him, dressed in a drab coat. I was near enough to hear what passed, but my back was towards them. They came in while I sat there, and commenced a conversation - the elder one said, "You tell me you have lived two years with so and so, "(mentioning a name which I don't recollect). The reply was, Yes. He said, "Pray, at what hour shall I call on them, for a reference as to your character." The prisoner replied, "They are on Change now, but if you go at half-past five or six, you will be sure to find them at the counting-house." The other man said, "Very well; I will go, but, in the mean time, Just step to Perring's with this cheque, and bring the money back." He said, "I will;" and left, and in the course of a minute the person went out also, and I left shortly after - I heard of the prisoner being taken up, and thought it was my duty to come forward.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. The person left the room about a minute after? A. Yes; the conversation was in rather a loud tone which induced me to look round once or twice. I was reading the paper in a box near the window, and they stood at the fire - it is a very small room. I believe the waiter was the only person who came into the room; the conversation was in rather a load tone for persons conversing on business - this circumstance did not strike me then, but it has since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it unnecessarily loud, as if it was intended to be heard? A. I think if I had been talking upon business, I should not have spoken so loud - the tone of the elder person was loudest - they called for nothing.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. You were the only person there, and could hear better than if others were there? A. Yes; a moderate tone of voice could be heard - it was not a whisper, nor a very loud tone - they were close to each other; they must have seen me.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner and his family many years; his father worked forty-seven years for mine: the prisoner was clerk to Mr. Williams nearly opposite our house, and bore a very good character, till the late business occurred. I was at the first examination into that matter; my opinion is, that he was innocent, because he was discharged - he left their service then.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What was the nature of the charge? A. Getting 200 l. for Messrs. Williams, bankers, through a letter which came to Mr. Williams the broker - it happened six weeks ago.</p>

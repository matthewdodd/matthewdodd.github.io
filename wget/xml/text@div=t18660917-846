I am in the service of Mr. Silas Tucker, of 234, High Holborn—I know Hiatt's father—he is a paperhanger, at 26, London Street, Tottenham Court Road, and a Customer of ours—on the 28th August the prisoner Hiatt brought this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he said he wanted a quantity of papers on this order—I delivered them him—I did not see anything of Aston—I know nothing of him—Hiatt went away with the papers—I afterwards saw some of them at Mr. Brooker's, 19, Whitcomb Street, Leicester Square—the morning after I saw Hiatt I went to his father—I did not see him till the following Tuesday—I do not know where he is now—I have not received any money on account of the paper I delivered on that order. (<hi rend="italic">Order read</hi>): 26, London Street; August 28 th, 1866. Sir, please send ten pieces of bedroom and seven of lime sienna marble paper to Mr. Tucker. Thomas Hiatt.

I took Hiatt into custody on 31st August, and told him I took him for forging an order for the delivery of paper from Mr. Tucker, of High Holborn, forging his father's name—he said it was a bad job, but he had been led into it by another party—he said he should not bring the other party into it; he should not mention the name—I said, "I don't think there is any necessity for that, for it is your brother-in-law, who is in custody, who has written the orders"—he further said he thought his father could settle it all if he were allowed,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170118"></xptr>
               <p>he was sorry that it had happened—about two hours before I apprehended Hiatt I went to his father's residence—they said he was not in town, and had not been in during the week—he is not here—I saw him on the Mon<lb></lb>day after this occurrence—he inquired for me, and I went up to see him.</p>

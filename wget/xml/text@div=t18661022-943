                  </hi>. On the evening of the 2nd October I was on a visit at Mr. Ellis's, Richmond Road Islington—the place was all safe when we went to bed—at half-past four in the morning we found it open—I was awoke by a scream—I got up—the prisoner was in Mr. Bieswerk's room.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night of the 2nd October I slept in the front bedroom of Mr. Ellis's house—I went to bed about half-past eleven—I noticed that the back parlour window was then shut—we all went to bed at the same time—I shut my bedroom door, but did not lock it—about half-past four I was awoke by a noise caused by some one opening the drawers in my room—I saw some one moving about—I got out of bed and struck a light—it was the prisoner—when he saw me get out of bed he was so frightened that he screamed—he stood quite still and seemed to lose all self-possession—he had no boots on—at that time some one came into my room and asked what was the matter, and called "Police!"—I locked myself in with the prisoner until the police came, which was about two or three minutes—I let the police in, and when the prisoner saw him he took a knife of mine off the drawers and brandished it about as if he were going to stab him—I gave an alarm to the policeman, and he wrested the knife from him.</p>

I first noticed the prisoner about four o'clock on the morning in question in company with another man, and, knowing him to be a thief, I followed them into the Hemingford Road, but lost sight of them close to the prosecutor's house—I waited about twenty minutes and then I heard a scream—some one opened the door, I went upstairs and saw the prisoner in Mr. Bieswerk's room—he had this dagger in his hand, which I wrested from him—he had no boots on, they were afterwards found by Mr. Ellis in the garden—I found three writing desks, a quantity of papers, and other things in the yard—the entrance had been effected through the back parlour window by a small step-ladder—I examined other parts of the house, but they were all safe.</p>

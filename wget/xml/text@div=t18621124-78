                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, at Whitby, in Yorkshire. On 14th November, I was at Rose's public-house, at Wapping—I suppose it was rather early when I left, nearly 2 o'clock—I was not aware it was so late, there were a few friends there—after I had proceeded a short distance two men came up, one at each side, and wanted to know where I was going—I said I was going home; it was rather late—they wanted me to treat them—I refused; I said I did not make a practice of treating people—I walked on a little, and before I knew anything further, the prisoner seized me by the collar from behind, and the other by the throat—he put his arm in the front of my throat, and I fell to the ground from the pressure on my throat—I felt the effects of it at the back of my neck the day after—I felt stunned; and the first I remember afterwards was that this man had got his hand into my trouser's pocket—the prisoner was rifling my pockets—it was quite light where they attacked me, but where they pulled me down it was not such a good light—the prisoner was never out of my sight—I had in an inside pocket a half sovereign, some silver, and copper—I cannot say whether anything was missing or not; I don't think he got anything—after I recovered myself I tried to get away from them, and the prisoner struck me across the cheek and nose, and in the eye, and I fell again—I have the marks on my face now; my nose was knocked all on one side—I made an alarm when I had the chance, but the prisoner put his hand across my mouth, and rather stopped me; I shouted, "Murder!" and "Police!"—I thought I was going to be killed—the other man made away, and got off—I got hold of the prisoner by the coat, and said, "Stop till the policeman comes"—he got away, right facing the police, and they brought him back in a second or two—he left me lying in the road—I did not feel the effects before the Magistrate so much as I do now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was in the public-house, waiting for the Aberdeen boat coming up, and I saw this man drinking there, along with some men and women. I went to the pier head, and coming back I met this man talking to another. He asked me, did I know a place where he could get a glass; I said I did not. He said, "Then, what is the use of you?" making a punch at me, and hitting me right in the face. To defend myself I hit him in the face, and that was all I did; there was no one with me, only myself. He sang out for the police, and the policeman and the watchman came over the bridge, and took me to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had not had much to drink—I had been with my friends—I was as sober as any gentleman in this court; that I swear; perfectly sober—I did not ask the prisoner where I could get a glass; they wanted me to treat them, and I would not—I did not say to him, "What is the use of you?" nothing of the sort—I did not strike him—I did not lose anything</p>

               <p>that I could swear to—I had some loose silver in my pocket, and I fancied there was rather less, but I could not swear—I had no watch.</p>

                  </hi>. 169. At the time this took place I was a police-constable, <hi rend="italic">K</hi>, 84. On Friday morning, 14th November, about 2 o'clock, I was on my beat at Wapping—I heard the cries of "Police" and "Murder"—I went towards Wapping Old Stairs, where the cries proceeded from, and saw the prosecutor lying on the ground—I stopped, and the cries of murder and police stopped for a moment—the prosecutor then began to cry out again—he was then on the ground, and the prisoner was leaving him—the prisoner then said, "If you don't hold your b—noise, I will come back and knock you b—brains out"—I crossed the road and said to the prisoner, "What is the matter?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "I believe there is; you had better come back along with me"—he said, "No, I am b—d if I do"—I said he should—after a good deal of resistance I got him to come back with me, and I took him into custody—he was rather riotous in going to the station, and tried to throw me down.</p>

Q.</hi> How could I try to knock you down, and two of you had hold me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I took you to the station myself, and had a great bother to get you there—you swore you would not come—you were quite sober; and the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not I have a mark on my nose, where it was bleeding? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—you were taken to Newgate the same day.</p>

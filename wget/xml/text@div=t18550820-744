                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer and surveyor, of Coleman-street, City. Pearson was in my employ as an under clerk for about seventeen months; he left in April last—I had him from the service of Messrs. Hammond, of Chancery-lane, and had a very satisfactory character with him—on 16th June last I examined my strong room, and found that a quantity of plate was lost—I have a list of the articles (<hi rend="italic">reading it</hi>); the value of it is from 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—among the rest there was a sugar basket—when that was pro<lb></lb>duced at the Guildhall before the Magistrate, there was a piece of silver upon it, which has since been removed; it was placed just over the initials</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City police. In conse<lb></lb>quence of information I received, I went to Mr. Hammond's, in Chancery<lb></lb>ane—I saw Crawford there, he is in Mr. Hammond's employment—he was not there when I got there; Mr. Eylett, a partner of Mr. Hammond, sent for him, and he came—I asked him if his name was Crawford—he said, "Yes"—I said, "I understand you have been in the country, on a country jaunt?"—he said he had—I then told him I was an officer, and asked if he knew a person of the name of John Pearson, that used to be in Mr. Ham<lb></lb>mend's employ—he said yes, he did—I asked him if he had had any transac<lb></lb>tions with him upon his own account—he said, "No, I have not"—I then told him that Pearson was in custody, and asked him if he had ever bought any plate of him—he said, "No, I believe my wife did"—I said, "Bid he give you any receipts?"—he said, "Yes, I think he did"—we then went to Crawford's lodging, No. 12, Serle's-place, Lincoln's Inn-fields—Crawford went down stairs into the kitchen with a brother officer named Huggett, and came up with these three receipts in his hand—Crawford then said that he remembered the first time that Pearson came to him was at Mr. Hammond's office one evening, after the office was closed, that he asked him if he would buy any plate, which he said belonged to an old lady who was in distress—he remembered one piece of the plate being a coffee pot, and not having much money that night, he advanced Pearson some money upon it; he did not say what amount—he said that after his wife had sold the plate next day, he paid Pearson the rest of the money—he did not say what it was, he said he could not remember the amount—he said his wife had sold the plate somewhere in Long-acre, and he said he would go with us and show us the place—he took us to Mr. Sutcliff, a refiner, in Long-acre—Mr. Sutcliff pro<lb></lb>duced his books, and the name and address of Mrs. Crawford was there—it was her own name, and the address of the house where they were living—Crawford said he thought he had 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for himself; he could not remember the amount he had paid—when we were at Mr. Sutcliff's, the account in the books did not agree with the receipts which Crawford had given me; Crawford could not remember then how it was that the receipts Pearson had given him did not tally with Mr. Sutcliff's book; but next morning, when I took him from Moor-lane to Guildhall, he said, "I now remember respecting the receipt for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I remember a man named Garrett having some spoons or forks, "he did not know which—he thought they were sold at Mr. Sirrell's, in Barbican, for about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. but he could not recollect the amount exactly; and that must have been added to the money that his wife had received at Mr. Sutcliff's to make up the receipt.</p>

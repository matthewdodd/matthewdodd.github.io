            , I am Mr. Stephens' apprentice. On the 16th of December, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked for some ribbon, another person served her; the drawer was on the counter, I saw her put her hand in and take out three pieces of ribbon, she did it at different times; I was within two yards of her; there was another person with her, who was purchasing. She put the ribbon up her sleeve, and afterwards into her pocket; I told my master, and he sent for an officer, before the officer came she was going out of the shop, my master accused her of it; she said, it must be a mistate, and sat down on the stool. She was taken up stairs and searched, but nothing found on her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. I knew her well, I had seen her before. I am sure I saw her do it.</p>

            . I am a haberdasher. I was in the shop, and sent for an officer; the prisoner was going out, when I detained her, and told her she had got some of my property in her pocket; she said, she was surprised at the charge, and sat down on a stool, which was six or seven yards from the drawer. She went up-stairs with me, and wanted me to search her - I found nothing upon her. I went down stairs to see for an officer, and under the stool on which she had been sitting, I saw three pieces of ribbon; I can swear to one of them. I gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. The ribbon would not be much concealed under the stool.</p>

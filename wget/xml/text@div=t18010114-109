               <p>Q. What other lodgers were in the house? - A. A young woman lodged in the front room on the first floor; I don't know whether she is married or not; and a man and his wife lived in the back-room; the articles mentioned in the indictment were all let to her with the lodging; she continued there, to the best of my knowledge, between five and six weeks; she paid her rent every week; she used to pay me at the door.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was she an unfortunate girl that walked the streets? - A. If I must tell the truth, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you other lodgers in the house of the same description? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you took them all without character? - A. I cannot say; there are two working people live in the garret.</p>
               <p>- MARKWELL sworn. - Q. We have heard what sort of a house you keep? - A. This girl, I believe, did walk the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that your other lodgers get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180101140098"></xptr>their bread by prostitution? - A. I believe there is one.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time she came to the room? - A. No; she went away the 29th of November, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she go away with the key? - A. Yes; she fastened the door with a fork on the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Then any body could have gone into the lodgings after she was gone? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the first person that found this out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you found any of your things? - A. Only what was found at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Markwell). Do the sheets go to your other lodgers, as well as to her, after they are changed? - A.

I was watching the pre<lb></lb>mises of Mr. Humphreys, a farmer at Chingford—at 5 o'clock in the morning I saw a light in his barn—I looked through a hole in the door and saw the prisoner taking oats, and putting them in a bag which he put on his shoulder and came through a hole—I stopped him and asked what he had got—he said, a few oats for his horse—I said, "Did Mr. Humphreys tell you to get them?"—he said, "He knows nothing about it"—he said that he expected he had done wrong, and he should be locked up—he was going on towards the yard—the barn door was locked, not bolted.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ—I was called up about 5 o'clock, and last witness had the prisoner in custody—I had not given him permission to take oats—I had been robbed for a fortnight or three weeks—these oats were in an undressed state—I did not feed my horses on oats—the prisoner had food for his own horse in his own bin—I feed my horses on beans, not oats—I knew the prisoner bad feed in his own bin, and he bad the key of it—be came in the morning between 5 and 6 o'clock—the hole he went through is where the rigger runs through of the threshing machine—we lodge a board against it, and we had a bar inside, and that was pushed down.</p>

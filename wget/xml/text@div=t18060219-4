             sworn. I am a warehouseman to Mr. Wrench; I missed several bags at different times, the property of Mr. Wrench, I acquainted Mr. Wrench of it; on Satuday week I missed some more, which I also acquainted Mr. Wrench; in consequence of that the prisoner was taken in custody and searched.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner. - A. He was in the employ of Mr. Wrench. Some of the bags I had marked by the direction of Mr. Wrench, which were misshing.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was he searched. - A. a little after eight, I believe I was not present.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you mark them. - A. With pen and ink; one bag was marked with an H.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. In consequence of that we got an officer, and took him in custody, and in the presence of myself and constable, and one of my sons, we found seven bags on him; he was apprehended at my warehouse, Hawkins the officer brought him to my house; there were other bags found at his house, to the amount of fifteen, my servant knows them better than me, because they are in the habit of using them; he had lived with me about two months. We found one large bag found his body under his waistcoat and the small ones in the lining of his hat, and in his great coat pocket.</p>

            , the men pointed to him, he seemed to wish to put his hand in his waistcoat pocket, I told him he must not do it; I took him to Mr. Wrench's shop, I found one or two bags under his waistcoat next to his shirt, some in the crown of his hat and some in his great coat pocket. Before he went out of the shop, he told the prosecutor, that he had never done any thing of the kind before; he begged to be forgiven. Mr. Wrench said that he had missed bags before, he wished to know where he lived; the prisoner said any person that was willing might go and search his house, they would find nothing there. After he was in custody I went to his house, over Blackfriars Bridge, to search it; I found some bags in the bed room in a cup-board, and some cut up in a child's cradle.</p>
               <p>Q. Now produce that you found round his waist. - A. This large one was round his waist (producing it); some of these little ones were put up quite snug in the crown of his hat.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Prosecutor) Do you know those bags. - A. There are a few marked; other seedsmen have the same kind of bags, I should not wish to swear to them all.</p>

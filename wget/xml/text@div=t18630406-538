                  </hi>. I am Secretary to this Society—the trustees are, Michael Wheedon, appointed in 1854; William Whitehorn, in 1860; and Thornton Hunt, in 1862—I have here the returns made by Clark for 1862, for March and for May, but the name does not occur in either of them; the first time he returns Samuel Gilbert as not paying is in August, 1862, he returns him as owing 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there are twenty-six names in return, and I find eighteen of them were paid. Gilbert and Farraday are not returned in it, but Gilbert is returned as never having paid him anything at all—I called his attention to that, and he said, "I did not like lapsing</p>

               <p>people as long as I thought there was a chance of getting them to pay"—he only sends Farraday's name in once, when he says that he owes twenty-five weeks—he deducts in Gilbert's case twenty-three weeks at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ask him anything about Farraday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember; but I called his attention to all of them being more than the number of weeks that he had any right to deduct—this "amount charged on policies not taken up" would be the amount he would have to account for, if he never received anything—the policy was not taken up—I spoke to dark, who said that he did not like to do anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker and am sixteen years old—my father's name is James Blyton, but these are my goods—I bought them myself. I met with the prisoner at a public-house—we began talking about Leicestershire—I wished to enlist for a soldier—the prisoner said he believed I should do for the regiment, and he said if I would go down he would enlist me then—we went down, and I thought he enlisted me—he asked if I was free, able, and willing to be a true and faithful soldier to Queen Victoria—he told me to stay where I was till the next morning at eight o'clock, and he would call for me—he came the next morning, and we drank a pint or two of beer together—I had a bundle containing these articles, and he wanted to persuade me to sell it—I said I would not—we drank a little more—I then went out to get something to eat, and while I was gone he sold my bundle, which contained the articles stated—when I returned he said he had sold it—I asked him where the money was—he said he had spent it.</p>

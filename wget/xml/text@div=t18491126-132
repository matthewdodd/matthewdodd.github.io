I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was after these supposed payments—I cannot tell that I bad seen the book at that time—when he asked for the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he said he wanted money for wages—on 21st Sept. I gave him 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and notes—I should not have given him these sums, but for the representation that he had paid the sums of money in the book.</p>

I looked at the book, and gave him 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and notes—before I gave him that, I looked at the book—pre<lb></lb>vious to 21st Sept. I found his cash account wrong, and on 21st I made him add up his book and strike a balance—I took the wages-book from him and gave him a new one, and after I had done so, I gave him 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay wages with, that would be due next morning—these payments were all made to pay wages that were to come hereafter.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 4th of this month I was going down Honduras-street, Old-street, I met the prisoner at Mr. Harrison's warehouse door, I went back and put my light out on purpose to see what they were after; there were two of them; I saw one of the two get over into Mr. Harrison's premises and hand out four bundles; I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or the other that went over the premises. After they had handed four bundles over the gate that one come over again, each of them took up two bundles and came into Baltic-street. I stopped the prisoner and asked him what he had got there; he said some rope, it belonged to his father; I told him if Mr. Harrison would say his father bought it it was all well; I took him to Mr. Harrison's door, and the other man ran away, leaving the property behind him. I knocked at Mr. Harrison's door, and asked him if that was his property; he said it was. I then took the prisoner to the watch-house. This is the rope.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have no doubt it is my property.</p>

I was standing at the corner of Golden-lane waiting for my father he was drinking; I was waiting there, a young man came up and asked me to carry this; he said he would give me a shilling; I took some on my shoulder, and he took the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150036"></xptr>other; the watchman stopped me; I said, that is the gentleman that employed me, the watchman let the other man run away.</p>

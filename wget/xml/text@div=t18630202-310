                  </hi>. I live with my parents at 24, Willow-street, Finsbury—on 20th January, about half-past 10 at night, I was in Willow-street, and the prisoner came up and said, "Little boy, will you go for my errand?"—I said, "No, sir"—he said, "I will give you a halfpenny if you will go," and I went—he gave me a bottle, and some money wrapped in paper, and told me to go to the Griffin, and fetch him half a quartern of gin—I went there and gave the paper as it was, and Mr. Smith wrapped up the change in the same paper—I went back to the prisoner, and as he stooped down to take it, he saw Mr. Smith coming, and walked away—I said, "Here is your gin, sir"—he said, "I do not want it"—I went home to my mother, and the prisoner was afterwards brought to me—I knew him directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I was staying on a visit to Mr. Smith, who keeps the Griffin, 9, Great Leonard-street, Shoreditch—I served the boy—he brought a bottle, and a half-crown, wrapped up in paper, and asked for half a quartern of gin—I thought it was bad, and handed it to Mr. Smith, and in consequence of what he said to me, I wrapped the change up in the same paper—the boy left, and Mr. Smith followed him immediately.</p>

I am the landlord of the Griffin—on the evening of 22d January, the last witness gave me a half-crown, wrapped in paper, and I saw her give the boy the gin and the change—I went out after him, saw him cross the road and go to the prisoner, who was standing as if in the act of taking them from him—I crossed over after him; he appeared</p>

               <p>to see me, and walked quickly away—the boy called out, "Here is your gin," upon which the prisoner ran as hard as he could—I went after him—he first walked, then trotted, and then ran as hard as he could—I overtook him, and charged him with sending the boy in with a bad half crown—he said that he did not, and I gave him in charge, with the half crown.</p>

I was going home down Willow-street, when Mr. Smith ran out; he pointed over to me, and said to a little boy, "Is that him?" The boy said, "Yes." I did not run, I walked towards home, and Mr. Smith walked after me. When I saw the prosecutor, I stopped to see what Mr. Smith was running for. I have a good character.</p>

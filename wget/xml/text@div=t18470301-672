                  </hi>. I keep the Prince's Head public house, in Buck<lb></lb>ingham-street, Stand. On Friday, the 19th of Eeb., I saw the prisoner about half-past three or four o'clock—he asked for half-a-pint of beer, and he paid me a shilling—I directed my attention to it—it was a bad one—I sent for a policeman and gave the prisoner in charge, but previous to that I went round and searched the prisoner—I found nothing upon him—I put the shil<lb></lb>ling he gave me on the back counter, by itself—I gave it to the policeman directly, from there.</p>

Last Friday the prisoner came there, a little before nine o'clock in the evening, for half-a-pint of porter—it came to a penny—he offered me a shilling—I saw it was a dad one directly he put it down—I said, "This is a bad shilling, and it was you that passed the other one on my father to-day"—he seemed confused—he took the shilling up, but he did not have it in his hand half a minute—my father snatched it from him—he denied that he had passed one before—he said he had paid a penny the first time—an officer was, sent for and he was given into custody—I had seen the prisoner between five and six o'clock that day—he bought half a pint of porter, and my father served him—he paid a shilling, which was placed in the till—my father gave him change—I found nothing bad in the till but that bad shilling that was taken previous to his coming at nine o'clock—I gave both to the policeman.</p>

"That is the lad that gave you a bad shilling"—I took the last shilling from the prisoner's hand and gave it to my daughter again.</p>

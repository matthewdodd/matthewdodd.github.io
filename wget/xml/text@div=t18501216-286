                  </hi>. I am shopman, in the employ of Robert Buxton Willett, linen-draper, of Great Ilford. On Saturday, 7th Dec, about nine o'clock in the morning, I hung up a pair of cord trowsers outside the shop—I saw them safe about five in the afternoon, and missed them between eight and nine at night—I did not see them again till Lush brought them on Monday—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are very peculiar cord, different to what is generally used in slop trowsers—there is a pin left on them with which the ticket was pinned on—the private mark is gone, but the stitches are left.</p>

                  </hi>. I work at Squire Davis's garden. On Saturday, 7th Dec., between eight and nine o'clock, I was standing against Mr. Willett's window, and saw the prisoner pull a pair of cord trowsers down, which were hanging up by the side of the window; he doubled them up, put them under his arm, and walked down the Romford-road with them—I did not know him before, but am sure he is the man—about a quarter of an hour after, I met Lush and gave him information—I did not give notice to any person in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you in Squire Davis's service now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and have been so nine months—I think this was rather a foggy night—I was out looking after my father, who was coming home from work—I was looking into the shop window ten minutes, stopping for him to come—Mr. Willett has two shops and four windows; I was at the third window, about twelve yards off the trowsers—I thought if I told a policeman it would do just as well as going into the shop.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the shop lighted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, all the windows, and there was a light outside—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man, I did not know him before—I spoke to a man who spoke to the prisoner, and asked him the prisoner's name, and I told the constable—I think that man's name is Palmer—he went away before the prisoner took the trowsers—I met him again, next door but one, after the prisoner had taken the trowsers, and after the policeman had gone into Willett's.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 439). On 7th Dec., between eight and nine o'clock, Mills came up to me, about twenty yards from Willett's shop, gave me information, and I went into Mr. Willett's shop—Mills had given me a description of the prisoner's dress, and after I came out of Willett's he gave me his name—I apprehended him next morning, between eight and nine, at his own house, at Romford—I told him he was charged with stealing a pair of trowsers from Mr. Willett's, and he denied all knowledge of them—I searched the down-stairs room, and was going up-stairs, when he said, "There is a pair of trowsers up there, that I, picked up last night"—I found these trowsers on the bedroom-table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did he not deny stealing the trowsers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he said, "I do not know anything about the trowsers"—he did not say, in his wife's presence, when I first went into the house, that he had picked them up—he did not say so till I had searched down-stairs—I did not know the prisoner when Mills gave me his name—another constable took me to this house—he is not here—he was in the room while I was searching.</p>

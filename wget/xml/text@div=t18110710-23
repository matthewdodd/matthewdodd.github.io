On Sunday the 16th of June Roberts brought the prisoner into Mr. Stokes's kitchen, and called me; I was in the water closet; I came down stairs, I saw the prisoner with the things belonging to me under his arm, I had left on the table in the kitchen two minutes before; I looked on the table and saw the money gone as well as the clothes; four shillings was wanting. I examined the bundle that he had under his arm, he had a coat, waistcoat, and breeches, and four shillings in his hand. I took care of the clothes, and gave them to the officer. I asked the prisoner what he did it for; he said he did it for want. We marked the shillings when we found them.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these things laying on the table so that people passing along in the street could see them - A. No; the table was at the further end of the kitchen.</p>

            . I live in service with Mr. Gappards, No. 8, South-street, Finsbury-square, next door to Mr. Stokes. On the 16th of June, between twelve and one, I saw the prisoner coming down the area-steps of Mr. Gappard's house, he came towards the kitchen door and begged charity; he said he was a very poor man, he wanted a few halfpence to bear his expences that night; I gave him sixpence, with which he was seemingly thankful. One of my masters sons were in the kitchen, he said, Robert, I think he is an imposter, you had better look after him. I went up our area steps, and looked after him; I saw him going down Mr. Stokes's are a steps, he advanced towards the kitchen door, he went into the kitchen; in a minute and a half after I saw him coming out with a bundle under his left arm. I met him on the area steps and stopped him; I took him into Mr. Stokes's kitchen; I called Golding who was in the care of the house; I asked him it that was his property; he said, yes, it was his property; the prisoner had his coat, waistcoat, and breeches; Golding looked on the table where he had left the things; he said, I suppose my money is gone also. The prisoner said here is your money, he had four shillings in his left hand. I then went for an officer.</p>

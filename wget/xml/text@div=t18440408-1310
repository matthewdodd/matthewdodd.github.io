                  </hi>. I live in Little Warner-street, Clerken<lb></lb>well. On the 8th of April the prisoner, a man named <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi>, and Mellson, came to my shed—<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> said he had brought two friends that were just going to begin the cow-keeping line—the prisoner looked at the cow, and asked the price—I said, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—We went over the way, and had a pot of stout together—Mellson said he was the prisoner Thomas Buck master Procter's servant—he bid me 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for the cow—I agreed to let him have it—<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> said, "Come to my house at three o'clock, and take it to this cow-keeper's yard in the Mile-end-road"—we drove it to Mile-end—Mellson met us on the road, and we drove it into a cow-yard—we went to No. 9, Percival-buildings, Percivel-street, to take the money—the prisoner, Mellson, and <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> were there—we all went into the room together—the prisoner said he was disappointed in getting the money, but he would give me a bill—I said I was not in the habit of buying cows for bills, I paid ready money for my cows—<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> said, "It is right for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," meaning Mr. Procter was worth 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in consequence of that representation I agreed to take it—I should not have done so if <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> had not assured me he was worth so much money—he said Mellson was the servant—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. put down to me in gold—Mellson said he would get the bill cashed directly, he would go to a house in the Mile-end-road—<hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> took me there—there was no cash there—I showed Teakle the cow-yard.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 4th of July last I saw Mellson—he stated him<lb></lb>self to be a wine-merchant—the prisoner was with him—he said he was his servant—I had a horse—Mellson asked me whether I would sell it—he left Procter with me to take the horse up to No. 9—he went along with me—as he was going along he said he was the servant, and persuaded me to sell the horse to his master—I cannot tell whether I should have sold it if I had not believed him to be the servant—they both over persuaded me—I believed Mellson was the master, and was a wine-merchant—I got 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and a bit of paper for the horse—I went the day the bill was due—there was no money.</p>

I secured it safe with a spring lock, and a padlock on the outside. The next morning, according to usual custom, the person that went on my errands, sent a little boy to inform me my shop door was open. I went there, and found the hasp belonging to the padlock broke in three pieces; the lock of the door I could not find was at all damaged; I imagined it was opened with a picklock.</p>

The prisoners both denied it before Sir John, and said they knew nothing of Steers. Steers produced three hats there, to see if I knew them: (produced in court, one gold-lace the other two plain) These are the same. I told Sir

            . I am a weaver, and live in White-lion yard, Norton-falgate Some time in November, I believe the 17th, 1762, Hitchins came to me, about 8 in the morning: I was in bed: He told me he had a quantity of hats to sell. I went with him to his house, which formerly had been a house of mine. He shewed me the hats in a chest in a back room: There were fourscore or more of them. He asked me 40 l. for them; we agreed for 30 l. I told him I would meet him the same evening, at the King's head, in Leaden-hall-street, where he said Watson, Lee, and Askur, would be. I went there; they were all together.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220037"></xptr> I paid him 15 l. I gave it into Watson's hands. They said I was very honourable in paying it so soon: That money, to the best of my knowledge, was shared between them. In two or three days after I paid the other 15 l. they were all together then. These three hats here produced, are part of the hats I bought of Hitchins at that time.</p>

On the 9th of December last, I had occasion to go to the Bank to meet a gentleman, with whom I had left seven bills of exchange, to the amount of 229 l. 19 s. This was a quarter after one o'clock: He was to get my bills discounted by another gentleman. He said the gentleman was in a great hurry, and could not give him an answer. He delivered me my bills again; I put them into my pocket-book, and into my left-side coat-pocket. I thought I saw a man like Parsons, the evidence, a little way from me, at the time I put them into my pocket. I came out, and went into Threadneedle-street, and saw a man standing at the print-shop, at the corner of the change, by castle-alley, and another man went up to him; they joined company, and went into Castle-alley together. When I entered the alley, these two men were going about three yards before me; when I came to the bottom of the alley they made a stop by the pitching-block; I turned up on the south side the 'Change, and crossed over to 'Change alley. Just as I was entering '<placeName id="t17640222-48-crimeloc273">Change-alley</placeName>

I got by Parsons. They gave a run by me at Garraway's, and continued before me to Lombard-street. They made a stop at the bottom of 'Change-alley, in Lombard-street, and I past them. I was going to my house in Gracechurch-street. When I got a little way from 'Change-alley, Parsons and the other man were behind me; then Parsons gave a run by me again, and came into the road before me, and went a little farther, and stopt at a post, and set out his backside; I brushed briskly by him, and took notice of him, and thought it very strange a man should stand in that posture. I looked back to see what posture I left him in, and walked forwards, about twenty or thirty yards; then he brushed by me again as before. I gave a look at him; he passed by me again, and about twenty yards he set himself over a post as before; I then gave two shoves before I could get by him; the other man was close behind me at the time. I was a good deal provoked in my mind to think he should stand so twice. He looked down the street, as if he wanted somebody. I passed on, and thought he should not have an opportunity to get by me again. When I got pretty near the end of Lombard-street, there were three or four coaches standing one behind another: Just before I came to the first coach, Parsons brushed by me a third time, in the same manner: The coach stood close to the post, and he placed himself over a post close to the coach: I gave three shoves, and had a great deal of difficulty to get by him. I felt somebody behind me; then, before I had past ten yards, I miss'd my book with the bills in it. I was in a prodigious agitation of mind. I recollected it must be them that had got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you felt it last in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Wright. I had felt it in 'Change-alley. Then I went to the Bank, and told the case; and if they suspected any body, to send for me. On the 14th of December, they suspected a man there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176402220038"></xptr> and sent for me; I took him to the mansion-house, before Mr. Alderman Cokayne: He could give no great account of himself. While we were there, Parsons came to see what was the matter; he opened the door, and put his head in; I suppose he saw me: He shut the door, finding he was likely to be discovered: He ran down the stairs as fast as he could: then I and another pursued him: He ran under the Piazzas: As soon as they brought him out, I knew him: I then told Mr. Cokayne, the prisoner was the man that behaved so and so before me. He was committed; after that he got bail, but did not appear last sessions: He was after that taken up by justice Fielding's men. The justice sent for me there: Parsons told me what he had denied before. He said he was in company with

               <p>Q. Did you ever get your bills again?</p>
               <p>Wright. Yes, a neighbour of mine brought the book to me, and all the bills in it: He said his servant was at work in the cellar, and the book came tumbling down the window. The bills are all now paid. (The book produced.) Parsons is now here to give evidence against the prisoner.</p>

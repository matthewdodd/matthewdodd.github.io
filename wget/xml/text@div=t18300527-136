               <p>GEORGE FOULKES. On the 8th of May, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, my mother had told me to come down stairs, and just as I came down the prisoner put his hand into my pocket in the passage, and said, "There, there, you are dropping your money;" darted out at the door - I said, "I am robbed," I pursued and took him about one hundred yards from the door; he was taken, and 1l. 9s. 10d. was taken from him- he said he had pawned a bed for 25s., but the duplicate the officer found on him was only for 16s.; when we brought the prisoner back to the passage, he said, "I took half a crown for my trouble" - I had a penny-piece, which I took in Crown-street, Finsbury, and I meant to have put it by, had I had time - that was found on the prisoner; he at first said he had picked up half a crown, and then he took half a crown for his trouble - the duplicate found on him was dated the 8th of May; I had been out very early that morning, and met two or three friends - I had something to drink, and got a little fresh- in coming home from Mile-end-road to Kingsland-road I fell against a window, and broke it; some persons came out, and asked for my address - I gave a card; the prisoner was one of them, and he walked home with me - he took 16s. from my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not you state before the Magistrate that you did not know what money you had? A. No - I did not state you robbed me of 1l. 2s. 6d.; I was not all over mud - I had some mud on my coat tail - they did not tell me at the watch-house to go home and get collected; I had drank two glasses of ale and three glasses of wine- I went out early on business, and had not eaten any thing.</p>

            . The prisoner brought my son home- I said, "I am very angry with you for stopping, who is this good man?" he said, "He came home with me" - I said, "I am much obliged to him;" I was persuading my son to come down to tea, and all at once the prisoner cried out, "You are dropping your money" - my son called out,"Mother, mother, I am robbed;" Nonsense, said I, but he ran out, and caught him - the Police-man came back with him; the prisoner then said, "I only picked up half a crown" - my son said he had put his hand into his pocket; they found 1l. 9s. 10d. on him.</p>

            . On the day in question the prosecutor broke my window - he gave me a card, and I asked if that was correct; he then gave me another - the prisoner came up, peeped over my shoulder, and said, "His name is Foulkes, is it not?" I stared, but he said, "I know him very well, he lives in Bath-street;" the card he had given stated another place near there - the prosecutor then said he had removed; the prosecutor went into the house, but did not pay for the window then - he went away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was there not a great mob round? A. There was a number of men and boys - a boy came up with a truck, he tapped the prosecutor on the shoulder, and said, "Are you not gone home yet?" I asked the lad if he knew him - he said perfectly well, and he lived in Felton-street; I then thought as I had three addresses I might find him.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner leading the prosecutor - I watched them; they went into the house, and the prisoner came out in two or three minutes, and was shuffling his hand into his pocket - the prosecutor ran out, and said he had been robbed; I crossed, and took the prisoner back - I found a quantity of silver on him, and asked how he got it; he said he had pawned a bed for 25s. - I found 1l. 9s. 10d. on him; he then said he had picked up half a crown, and it was worth that to take him home - the prosecutor said there was a penny-piece with a particular mark, which he described; I said, "I have found such a one on the prisoner."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Saturday, the 8th of May, I had to make up 22s.; I went to my brother - he lent me three half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence; I pawned my bed for 16s. - there I received two half-crowns, and some penny-pieces; the prosecutor gave me half a crown for bringing him home, and 1s. he gave Mr. Laing's young man for riding on a truck from the Duchess of York public-house - I have asked Mr. Laing about it, but he said the boy denied all knowledge of it; the prosecutor was so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183005270066"></xptr>drunk at the Duchess of York, that the publican would not let him go - we went to No. 31, Felton-street, but he did not live there; he then said he lived in Bath-street, where I knew he did live.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PETER WINSEY</hi>. I am a chemist, of 31, Langdale Street, St. George's—about 12 o'clock in the day, on the 10th April, I was going along Stepney Causeway—I had a florin in my hand, which I was going to put in my pocket—there were eight or ten lads standing on the pathway—they sepa<lb></lb>rated for me to pass through the middle of them—as I passed them Hunt put out his foot, struck me in the side, and knocked me against another one, who gate me a similar blow, and I was thrown down—Donovan took the florin out of my hand, and said "Come away!" and away they went—whilst I was getting up I was struck on the legs with something heavy, and hurt very much—I saw the two prisoners distinctly before they went away—there were seven or eight altogether—they ran away as I was getting up—I spoke to a policeman, and described them to him—I saw the two prisoners about seven minutes afterwards, and gave them in charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This affair took place in a lane, between Brook Street and White Horse Street—there was a public-house near—I had passed that—I should say there were nine boys altogether, or from eight to ten—I did not count them—the prisoners were standing on the kerb; they were doing nothing—I saw them speaking together as I came up—they were not play<lb></lb>ing—I did not say any thing of the twirling anything round—the other boys were older than the prisoners—I should call them young men—I was knocked down by Hunt; he struck me in the ribs—Donovan was on the other side of me then—he knocked me again, and down I fell—Donovan took the florin from me—Hunt gave me the first blow, and that knocked me against the other—I did not full from the force of the blow given by Hunt, but he took up something very heavy, I don't know what it was, I think it was a brick, and threw it violently on my legs, and when I got up I could scarcely walk—I am sure I did not see Hunt twirling anything about—I had not been drinking that morning—I must not drink; I have an affection of the heart, which I have had for the last ten years.</p>

On 10th April the prosecutor spoke to me in the Commercial Road East, near Stepney Causeway—I went with him to Brook Street—he gave me a description of the prisoners—he pointed out the two prisoners to me in Brook Street, and I took them in custody—they both said they knew nothing of the old man, and had never seen him—I found nothing on them.</p>

I am sixteen years old—I recollect the day when this affair happened—it was Easter Monday—about 12 o'clock in the day I was with Donovan and Hunt, and two or three more, near the "White Hart" public-house—we were playing—Hunt had a piece of wet worsted stocking—he hit me in the face with it—I picked it up again, and threw it at him—Mr. Winsey was passing by, and it hit him on the leg, somewhere about the shin—I begged his pardon, and took no notice, and walked straight on—about five minutes after, I went home, and when I came back I heard that the two prisoners were taken—I did not see Mr. Winsey knocked down—all I saw was the stocking thrown; it was meant to hit Hunt, and and it hit the prosecutor on the leg—it took place just outside the door of the White Hart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was nothing in the stocking—it was only wet and dirty—there was no stone or brick in it—this happened about 11.30, as near as I can guess—it was past 11, and nearly 11.45, I should think—I have known the prisoners about six years, ever since I have been in the neighbourhood—they are companions of mine—the other boys who were there had nothing to do with throwing the stocking—they had nothing to do with <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> the thing about, only me and Hunt—when I left, I left the boys altogether—I went away about five minutes after I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the wet piece of stocking—I did not see any kicking or pushing, or snatching of the coin—I know Brook Street, it is only two or three minutes' walk from where this took place—I did not see any brick thrown—there was no brick in the stocking—Mrs. Hunt asked me to come here; she said I saw it all, and I was the boy that did it, and I ought to come and speak the truth—she did not tell me what I had to say—I did not go before the Magistrate, they were committed before I knew anything about it—I heard they were</p>

            . On the 1st of March, I had been to the Nags Head, White-cross-street; a quarter before ten I left my friends; I was within one or two doors of my house, when I lost my pocket-book; and just as I got to my own window, four or five got round me; the prisoner was behind me. I found his hand in my pocket; I catched hold of his hand. I never parted with the prisoner, until I pulled him into the shop. I never let him go until Monk, the officer, took him. In my pocket-book, I had a two-pound bank-note, three one-pound bank-notes, a bill of exchange for twenty-eight pounds ten shillings.</p>

The moment I came up, I heard a man say, I know nothing boy. The prosecutor accosted the prisoner; do you know them boys; the prisoner said no, nor you neither. The prosecutor took the prisoner in doors. I jumped into the house, that nobody should hand the pocket-book away. The prosecutor told his wife to fetch his coat down. She fetched it down he searched the pockets; he said, there is no pocket-book here. He then told the prisoner, he saw him give the pocket-book away. I will give you in charge of an officer.</p>

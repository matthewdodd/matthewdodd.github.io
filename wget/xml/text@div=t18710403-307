I am a metal-worker, of 2, Great Andrew Street, Wandsworth Road—I was in Tottenham Court Road two Saturday nights ago, before 12 o'clock, and Shine came out from one of the side streets, rushed behind me, put his arms round my neck, pulled me down, and I received a <hi rend="italic">thump</hi> on the head—somebody picked me up, and said "Look out for your watch"—I missed it—Shine was then about twelve yards off—my watch and chain were worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not see the woman.</p>

I live at 5, Little Howland Street—on this Satur<lb></lb>day night, about 11.30, I was going towards Haznpstead Road, and saw a crowd at the corner of London Street, and saw Ryan take a watch out of Mr. Sellick's pocket and put it down her bosom, and run away—Mr. Selliok was standing up, and Shine was holding him behind—he continued standing while the watch was taken—I went away.</p>

I did stop him, and thought I could detain him till the prosecutor came up"—when I came up Shine and the prosecutor were eight or ten yards apart—afterwards, in consequence of what a boy told me, I took Ryan at about 1.15, and told her the charge—she said "I know nothing about it"—I asked her if she had heard of a gentleman being knocked down, in Tottenham Court Road, and his watch stolen—she said "No"—after the charge was read over to her, at the station, she said that some man interfered with her and another woman, and Shine took it up and struck him—I reminded her then, that when I took her she denied all knowledge of any affair in Totten<lb></lb>ham Court Road; and she then alluded to an accident, when her head was cut, and said she thought that was what I alluded to—she had a bandage on.</p>

I am a telegraph clerk, and live at 3, Sussex Road, Brixton—about half-past nine on the evening of Chistmas Day I was walking with two others, Fox the messenger and another clerk, in the Station Road, Elephant and Castle, when seven or eight persons, of whom the prisoner was one, came up—I did not see what they did to Fox—they tried to throw us over, but did not succeed—they knocked me down—one of the party, not the prisoner, took my hat and threw it in the air, and then took it away—I followed them, and they wanted a pint of beer for it—I gave them twopence, which I took from my breast-pocket—one of them got his arm round my neck and pulled me backwards, and two more took hold of my legs—the prisoner was in front of me in the road—they took the money out of my pockets, amounting to 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I was nearly down, and they knocked me down—I got up, and they knocked me down again—the blow hurt me, and made my nose bleed—my father went to the police-station—I saw the prisoner's face plainly before they put the cap over my eyes—I ran after them, and called out "Policeman!"—when the prisoner was at the station he said he had been knocked down and robbed of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was blood on the prisoner's shirt, but the police<lb></lb>man could not find out where it came from—I told him it was more likely from my nose than the prisoner's—I identified the prisoner at the police-station.</p>

I live at 41, Southwark Bridge Road, and am a messenger at the Elephant and Castle Station—I have seen the prisoner frequently—I know his voice—I was walking with Gray on Christmas evening—I did not see the prisoner, but heard his voice—he was singing—he was with seven or eight more—I saw these all rush on Gray—they put out their feet to throw us over—they knocked me down and kicked me—I saw one run away with Gray's hat—I told the ticket clerk of it—I told his name.</p>

Hearing of the robbery on Christmas night, and from the description given by Gray, I went into the railway-station, and found the prisoner, and asked if his name was Sweet—I told him I was going to take him into custody for robbery on Christmas night—he said he was drunk—I took him to the railway-station, and he said to Fox, "You know I was drunk, don't you, Fox?"—I took him to the station and placed him with two others, and telegraphed for Gray, who identified him—he then said he had been robbed himself—he was examined at the police-court—I was present—there was no mark on the prisoner then.</p>

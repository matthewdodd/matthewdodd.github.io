On a Friday evening, about four weeks ago, my mother sent me to get some things out of pawn; she gave me a sovereign; I went to the pawnbroker's, and received in change three half-crowns, two penny pieces, and three half-pence farthing; I looked at them in my hand after I got out of the shop, and while I was doing so at the bottom of the street, the prisoner, came up, and said, "Mr. Latter says he has given you the wrong change;" I said, "No, Sir, I have got it right;" he knocked me down, forced my hand open, and took the money out - I was looking at it when he came up; he had a black crape on his hat: when he got the money he ran away - I got up, and ran after him; a witness came out of a house, and asked what I was crying for - I told him, and he followed; I had not lost sight of him - the young man brought him back in about half an hour; I had seen my mother before that, and told her he had a black crape on his hat, and so he had when he was brought back - I took sufficient notice of him to know him again, and think he is the same person; his face looked liked the face of the man, and he had a crape round his hat - he was within sight when I told the young man what had happened; I saw him afterwards before the Justice, and think he is the man; half a crown and three halfpence were shewn to me, as taken from him - there was a new halfpenny among it, and so there was among the money taken from me; it was such a new halfpenny as I was looking at.</p>

            . I work at Billingsgate, and live in Lower Chapman-street. On Friday, the 2nd of October, between five and six o'clock, I was coming out of my door, and saw the prisoner running away very quick; I saw Nagle crying, and asked what was the matter - she said she had been robbed of three half-crowns, and some half-pence; I concluded it was him, by his running so fast - I pursued and overtook him, in about ten minutes, in Fieldgate-street, and gave him in charge; he had joined another person before I overtook him, and they were walking deliberately together - the prisoner is the person I first saw; he had a crape round his hat.</p>

            . I am an officer, and received the prisoner in charge. I found a half-crown, and 3 1/2d. loose in his jacket pocket; the child pointed out a new halfpenny before the Magistrate - her mother said, in his presence, that she had described him as wearing a crape hatband.</p>

When I was brought back, the girl said, "That is not the man who robbed me" - a boy came up, and said a woman was looking out of window, where it was done; he sent for her, and she said it was not me, it was a man in a fustain jacket; the girl said at the office, there were two of us, that I had a fustain jacket, and when I crossed over I pulled it off, and gave it to the other, who put it on.</p>

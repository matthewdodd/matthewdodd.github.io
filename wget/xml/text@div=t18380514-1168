About a quarter past one o'clock, on the 14th of April, I was going down Bishopsgate-street—I had just left my work, at Blue Anchor-yard—the prisoner came and took hold of my collar, and said, "Come along with me"—I told her to go about her business, and at the same time I heard my money rattle—I had four half-crowns and three shillings in my pocket—I cannot tell how her hand got into my pocket—she had not put her hand round me—I found she had the money—I took hold of her, and gave her in charge, and three half-crowns and four shillings were found on her.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the night constable. I asked the prisoner what money she had got—she said, "Only one shilling"—I searched her twice, but found nothing—I told the prosecutor—he said he was positive she had it—in searching her again, in her left boot was this glove, with three half-crowns and four shillings in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a retired constable, and am now in the services of the Dublin Steam-packet Company. On Saturday afternoon, 26th July, I was at the main entrance to the Tower, and saw the prisoner and two others—I watched, and saw the prisoner twice put his hand into a gentleman's right-hand waistcoat pocket, and then pass his hands to his companions, who were covering him closely—I had seen him there the day before with the same parties, and saw him put his hand into a gentleman's pocket—the main entrance to the Tower is closed, on account of there being so many visitors, and they are let in 150 or so at a time, and this occurs at the gate, where the people are accumulated—after the congregation went in, the prisoner moved away—I saw them all three in company an hour or an hour and a half—the prisoner asked me if he could get access to the Tower—I told him he could in a few minutes, but he did not go in when he could—he went away over Tower-hill, and came back in a quarter of an hour, and his two companions shortly after—he then took an orange out of his pocket, and placed his hand into another gentleman's pocket, while his companions were looking down, as if there was something to be seen.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 141). I was with Stebbing on the Saturday, and saw the prisoner separate from his companions—there were about 300 outside the gate, and when it was opened they all three joined company, rushed to the gate with the crowd, and when they got to the gate they turned back, and the prisoner went and stood against the rail, and the other two went along Tower-street, and I could not see where they went to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer and surveyor. on Friday, 25th, I was on Tower-hill; and in consequence of what Stebbing said to me, I noticed the prisoner standing by the sentry-box—he was then joined by another man, and I stood behind them—he then leaned on a gentleman's left shoulder, and moved his left hand towards the gentleman's left-hand pocket—I did not see him put his hand in—he remained so about a minute, then turned round, pulled an orange out of his pocket, began peeling it very violently, and <hi rend="italic">nudging</hi> his companions with his foot—his companions then came and asked me when the Tower would be opened—I said I had no idea; doubtless in a few minutes—he said he had been waiting an hour, and could not get in—I said the gate had been opened frequently in the hour—they moved away—in about two minutes the gates were opened, and the people rushed in, but those two went towards Tower-street—I spoke to the gentleman into whose pocket I saw the prisoner put his hand.</p>

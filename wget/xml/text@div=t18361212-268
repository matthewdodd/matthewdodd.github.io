                  </hi>. I am the daughter of William Arpthorpe—he is a staymaker. The prisoner was eight days in our service—on the 23rd of November she left without any notice—on the following morning I examined some drawers in my bed-room and missed the articles stated in the indictment.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police constable K</hi> 33.) I apprehended the prisoner at a house in Coborn-terrace, in the Bow-road—I went there, on the in<lb></lb>formation of the prosecutor, last Thursday, about one o'clock in the day, and found these articles in the front parlour, the room in which she was, on the table, with a great many more things of her own—on the way to the station-house I told her she had done very wrong by robbing her master—she said she had, but it was too late to think any thing about it—in going to Lambeth-street, she said she never should have done it, if had not been for a young man she had been keeping company with, of the name of Thomas Wilson, for about three months, that he asked her for some money one evening; she told him she had none, and he threatened to kick her for not getting him money, and told her to rob her master and get all she could for him, that he should be back in about a week, and then he would take, it away, as he was going to Dover—she told him she was afraid to the that, she would be found out—he said "Oh no, you will not be found out, nobody will know it but ourselves"—and she said after that she was afraid to carry the property back—I found her at Captain Connelly's—she had been there a week, and intended to leave the same night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stay-manufacturer in Bishopsgate-street, I found the prisoner in service in Coborn-terrace, near Bow—I charged her with the robbery—she said she would not be guilty of such a crime—I persisted in the charge—after some altercation I proposed that her box should be sent for—she expressed her willingness to fetch it, which I ob<lb></lb>jected to, and the box was brought by the other servant in the presence of her mistress—she gave up the keys—the boxes were opened, and the articles produced were part of the contents of the box—I was informed by her mistress, in her presence, that she had been there one week, and that morning she had stated, after breakfast, that she should leave that day—I endeavoured to trace a young woman who had been to see her, and found her in a house in Globe-road, and there found some hymn-books of the church to which I sent the prisoner.</p>

            . I am butler to Mr. Clough. On the 12th of December I paid the prisoner four sovereigns and nine shillings for Mr. Murray. Here is the receipt he gave me (read.)</p>
               <p>COURT to MURRAY. Q. Show us a statement of your account with him on the Saturday after the 12th? A. Here it is; this amount is not down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How came this leaf cut out of this book? A. It was not made out right, and I cut it out - this amount was not entered there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is any amount entered to Clough on the 30th? No; nor on the 23d or 16th - he sometimes paid me monies on other days, but it was put down on Saturday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I paid this money to him - that an I some others were put down on the last leaf, which is cut out; it is a malicious prosecution; it was usual to keep a little in hand for disbursements; his books will show that the accounts are so confused, no one can understand them - I told him I had other entries to make.</p>
               <p>COURT to MURRAY. Q. Where was he when you called the account over? A. At my side; we settled every Saturday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Shew me any one account that is balanced? A. Here is one; I did not allow him to keep money back on Saturday - I at times had cash from him in the course of the week - he kept a small book, and the balance was struck every Saturday - he has paid money for me.</p>

On the 13th of December last I lost an anchor and chain, from a large working barge, that was moored off Chelsea Church; I had seen it the day before, on the 12th, I never saw it again till I saw it at the police office, at Shadwell, which was Wednesday the 21st.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Score, you say you have several barges, I take it for granted these barges get a drift sometimes? - To my misfortune they do, I have lost three anchors and chains before.</p>

            Perhaps this barge got a drift? - It did not; the tide was ebbing, and would have come up to it in about an hour if it had been fastened; my servant got up and fastened it by the working chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Anchors are pretty common by the side of the river, about Chelsea and Shadwell? - I suppose so, most that have crafts have anchors with them.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, Mr. Score, Cluer was taken before the magistrate, and had been discharged? - He was taken the 16th and discharged; I knew nothing of the business till the Saturday following. On the 16th the search warrant was taken out of the police office, and he was taken, and I believe he was then discharged.</p>

On Friday morning between one and two o'clock, I went to the anchor and chain and made it fast about the post at the Church corner at Chelsea, and I locked the other end into the barge, on the beetson of the barge; after that I put the key into my pocket, I went home to bed, I thought the barge would be fast, and between five and six one of our servants came and told me to get up and make the barge fast, or else it would be asloat, and that the anchor and chain was gone; they told me the barge would be a drift if I did not make it fast again;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150178"></xptr>I got up and found the anchor and chain gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the barge have got a drift from between one and two in the morning, to between five and six? - No, she was a ground; if I had stayed longer the flood would have come up and carried her off, and she would have been lost as the other barges were.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find this anchor and chain again? - We found it on Saturday when I attended at the justice's office, at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this barge could not have been deprived of the anchor and chain by accident; it must be taken by somebody? - It must.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Finch at all? - Yes, he lives in Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the place where this barge was moored? - Very nigh a mile; he is a fisherman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the magistrate when he was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing about this anchor and chain, and how he came by it? - I never heard him say any thing till he came to the justice's, he then said that he picked it up.</p>

               <p>I keep the Crown public house in St. Ann's, Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Finch? - I know him by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this business about the anchor and chain? - On the 16th of December last, on Monday, Finch came into my house, between seven and eight in the morning, and asked me if I would give him credit for a penny worth of purl? he said he had been a fishing at Limehouse, and found an anchor and chain, he had caught a chain in Limehouse hole, in hauling up part of his net he hauled up one part of the chain and that he had left his partner with the net to see if he could clear it; and could I tell him where he could sell it? I told him I could not tell him where he could sell it; and that past on, and in some little time afterwards he went out of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the anchor and chain at that time? - No. I went out of the back yard and followed him, and I looked over my wall, and saw the anchor in his boat; my house joins to the river.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you trust him with any liquor? - Not at that time, only his pennyworth of purl. He asked me then what had become of all the rope shops that were about this place?</p>
               <p>Q. Was he able to see you in the back lane? - He was. I told him there was a rope shop next door, that was Thomas Cluer's, the prisoner at the bar; with that he took the anchor and stock and carried it up into Mr. Cluer's warehouse that joins to the house, it is at the back part, covered in, and then went down and brought the chain up out of the boat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the chain? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chain a light one, or how? - I was not nigh enough to know the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen to Finch as he was going in to the premises? - He got up four or five steps and fell down with the chain into the mud.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cluer at all at that time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left your yard and went into the house, was Finch returned to his boat, or was he in Cluer's premises? - He was in Cluer's premises; I lost sight of him there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - I saw no more of him till he came in and asked for change for a guinea; this might be in about five or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150179"></xptr>Q. Did you give him change then? - My father did afterwards. He said he was to have fourteen shillings out of the guinea, as the price of the anchor and chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he went with the change? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. He only paid a penny in your house? - He only asked for the credit of a pennyworth of purl, and after he came in with the guinea he had a pot of brandy hot. I don't know exactly how much he spent in the house, my father took the money; he came back and said that he had had a dispute about the seven shillings, and had got another shilling; he said there had been a mistake in the weight, and Cluer gave him another shilling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You said you did not know Finch before? - I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to you between seven and eight in the morning, was it day light then? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a morning was it? - It was a darkish morning, and wet.</p>
               <p>Q. People were up? - Yes, I was up.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he had been a fishing, and his net caught hold of an anchor and chain in the river? - He said it had caught hold.</p>
               <p>Q. And he afterwards brought up an anchor and chain to you? - Not to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not got it when he asked you where he could get rid of it? - No, it was in the boat.</p>
               <p>Court. It was in the boat when he said that his partner was getting it out of the net? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You told him that your next door neighbour would buy it? - I did not; I told him there was a rope shop next door.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw Cluer at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen many anchors and chains before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You only saw it from your wall in the boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you know is, that was an anchor and chain? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to the police office, Shadwell. I went to take Cluer up the second time, I knocked at the door; as soon as his wife saw me, she smacked the door to again; I then sent the other man that was with me, Colebroke, to the back door, that he should no get out by the water; I then left another person, as soon as I possibly could, at the front, and went round to him to the back door; his wife would not open the door, and we broke one of the pannels out between the house and the warehouse, and accordingly we got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you get in without breaking? - We could not; we broke in between the warehouse and the house, and got in, and went up stairs, and I went out on the lead that is over the house, and from there I got into an adjoining yard, I then went down there into the yard, and there I found Mr. Cluer concealed in a necessary, in the adjoining yard to his own house. Mr. Cluer said to me, you cannot blame me for striving to get away, for I knew what you was came upon, I knew you was come about the anchor and chain. Then I apprehended him, and brought him to the office; and the next day, in company with an officer of Chelsea, I went and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150181"></xptr>apprehended Finch, the other prisoner. Finch said that he never sold Cluer any thing before in his life.</p>
               <p>Q. To Score. Look at the anchor and chain, and tell whether you know it is your's? - My servant can tell.</p>
               <p>Lester. I have been looking at it, it is my master's, there are two rivetts through each flute; I am certain they are my master's property.</p>

            What is the worth of them altogether? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they weigh a couple of hundred weight? - They weigh more than that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you could haul them up with a fishing net, that is used in the Thames? - I am not used to fishing nets.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of the chain altogether? - Between three and four pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you know this anchor by the two rivetts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been used to anchors much? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see an anchor in your life rivetted? - Only this one.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all the mark by which you know it? - There are two twists in the anchor besides.</p>
               <p>Court to Arnold. You say that he carried the anchor to Cluer's washhouse; did you see him do that? - I did not see him put it there, I see him go into the back gate with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Finch. The 16th of last month I was going a fishing off from Limehouse Hole; going a fishing about a quarter of an hour, I catched a fastening under the water, at last it weighed with me, and I found it was this anchor; after I catched, this anchor, I rowed to the nearest public house to leave it, and the man directed me to this man's house; I said I had picked up an anchor and chain, and if any person owned it I should be very glad for the owner to have it; I said I did not want to sell it? I meant to leave it till the next morning, when I would advertize it, then at half past nine I went to the Trinity officers, and asked them if they had heard any body had lost an anchor? they said no; afterwards I went into a shop, a seed shop, nigh Mr. Cluer's, and I was talking about advertizing the anchor and chain; says he, you cannot advertize it, for you have sold it to Mr. Cluer for fifteen shillings; says I, I have not sold it, says he, you have, and I will do Mr. Cluer over, he shall not live in Limehouse, under my roof. We osten have occasion to weigh an anchor for government, we can weigh an anchor of a thousand pounds weight, with a net. I have served his Majesty till lately; I have served under Admiral Hood, in the American war.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cluer. I leave my defence to my counsel; I never was brought under any charge in my life before.</p>

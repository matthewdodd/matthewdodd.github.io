                  </hi>. I am an unfortunate woman, and live at 75, New Gravel-lane, Shadwell—the prisoner lived in the same house—four young girls lived there, and Mrs. Middleton the landlady—I was there with two young men, sailors, and the prisoner last Wednesday—I think it was between 7 and</p>

               <p>8 o'clock at night—the sailors had not long been paid off their ship—I do not know how long the prisoner's young man had been there, but mine had been there two or three days—she got jealous of me and her young man, because he happened to take more notice of me than he did of her—we were both rather tipsy—she pushed me, and I told her if she did that again I would strike her—she pushed me again and I struck her in the face—we both got fighting, and fell down—one of the young men saw it—he is not here, they have been gone a fortnight—we were both down on the floor in the passage—I felt something pricking me, and thought it was my hair pins—I called in Jane Whitlock, and said, "Jane, come here and take the knife away from her, she is stabbing me in the head"—I found myself wounded—her young man came to lift me up—my head bled at the back—I am nineteen years old—there was nobody but the prisoner near me at the time I felt the prick.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at this house. Last Wednesday three weeks I saw the young women begin to fight—they were down—one of the sailors who was standing with a young woman cried out, "She has got a knife"—Thomas hallooed out, "Oh my God, come to me," and complained of being wounded—I went up and found her bleeding from the back of her head—I saw one of the sailors pick up this knife, and a pair of scissors, which formed a <hi rend="italic">stahber</hi> as well—he gave them to the landlady—they were on the floor by the side of the girls as they were struggling—I did not notice whether the knife was bloody—she said she did it with the scissors.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 247). I was called and took the prisoner—she said the knife was meant for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, pointing to Whitlock—I got two knives from the landlady, one of which (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) forms into a pair of scissors—the girls were both drunk—the prisoner seemed in a very excited state.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MRS. MIDDLETON</hi>. I keep this house—the prisoner is as innocent of this knife as you are sitting there—I was cutting some bread and cheese to give away to a poor woman and some children, and laid the knife down just before the riot on the side table in the room where they quarrelled—they upset everything, and therefore the knife was picked up innocently—the prisoner had asked me to lend her the scissors to cut her corns.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called, and found Thomas with an incised wound on her head about an inch and a half long, penetrating to the bone—either this knife or the blade of the scissors would have done it—all scalp wounds are dangerous.</p>

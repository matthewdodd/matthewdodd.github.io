                  </hi>. I am a hay salesman, at Smith field. I have had business transactions with the prisoner—at the beginning of this year I had a claim against him for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have that claim on him at the present time—the last transaction I had with him was on 1st Jan., and that remained through the spring—I commenced an action against him in the Common Pleas—this is the writ; it is dated 30th March, 1853—the trial took place on 29th June—I was present, and heard the defendant sworn and examined—he then stated that on 21st Oct., 1852, he had paid a sum of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he produced what purported to be a receipt for it—the receipt was impounded;</p>

Received payment, E. T. W. ")—he said he did not know whether he paid it to a man or a woman—on his cross-examination, he said he did not pay the sum of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 21st Oct.; that he paid the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a man in the shop, and that the man to whom he paid the money gave him the receipt—the receipt was put in, and it was ultimately impounded by the Secondary, Mr. Potter—I remember, on 21st Oct., the prisoner purchased a load of hay of me—previously to that he had owed me 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he stated that he had some money for me; but being engaged at the time, I desired him to go to my clerk, Mr. Whaley,—he afterwards purchased a load of hay of me—in the interim, I ascertained from my clerk what he had paid, and I told him he had not paid so much as he ought; that his account was too large, and that I would not trust him so many as three loads of hay, I believe were the words I used—he promised to bring me some more money in the course of two or three weeks—he did not pay me anything on 21st Oct.; he paid my clerk 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw him again early in Nov., at his own shop in Union-street—on that occasion I delivered him this account, without a receipt to it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I delivered it at his shop, and, I believe, to himself personally—I requested payment, and he promised to pay me money shortly—I saw him again on 30th Nov., and on that occasion he purchased a load of hay for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had no other person in my employ who had the initials of E. T. W. except Whaley—I know Whaley's handwriting—I believe this receipt is not his writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say, on the trial, this receipt was produced, and he said he had paid it to a man or a woman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he had previously represented to me that he had paid it to Mrs. Davis; that she gave him the receipt, and he saw her write it—it was on 30th March he stated that to me—I have never stated that before, because my examination was not carried so far—I instructed my attorney that that was so, and I think Mr. Clark son has it—I wish to tell the whole truth; I have no reserve—I had no reserve before, but I did not state that because my examination was not carried so far.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But why, as this receipt was produced, did you not tell the Alderman that he stated that the receipt was your wife's writing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was not asked the question—I heard him cross-examined—I did not hear him swear that this receipt was in the handwriting of Whaley—the receipt was said to be no one's particularly, but the man to whom he paid the money gave him that receipt—first he did not know whether he paid it to a man or a woman—these are Whaley's initials, but not his writing—I cannot tell whose receipt it was represented to be—I have no doubt it was intended to imitate Whaley's receipt, but no name was mentioned—I did not tell the Secondary that the prisoner had said be saw my wife write it, because I was not examined to that—I did not say that the prisoner stated that it was written by my wife, because Mrs. Davis was there to answer it—I did not think about it—this is a very good imitation of Whaley's writing—I should not believe it to be his writing—he usually signs his name Whaley, in full—he was then my servant; he is now in the service of a railway company—at the time I delivered the bill of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I delivered it at his shop—I believe I delivered it to Coleman personally—I saw him two or three times, but whether I delivered it to him personally I cannot say—I will not undertake to swear that he was present at the time of the delivery—I saw him two or three times in the early portion of November—whether I had delivered the bill previously to his saying that he would pay me some money, I cannot say—this conversation took place</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185308150081"></xptr>
               <p>early in November—it was either on the occasion of my delivering the bill, or afterwards—it was at his shop—I called two or three times; I might have seen him when I delivered the bill—I delivered it at his shop—he was recommended to me by some salesman in the market, who knew his family and connections—I believe he had before been in the West Indies—I do not know whether he was an overseer or slave-driver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it this Mr. Whaley (<hi rend="italic">reading a card</hi>:) "E. J. Whaley, collector of rents, &amp;c. Debts recovered by legal process. No. 28, St. John-street, Clerkenwell. Security to any amount"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe he had such a card—I believe he was only a few weeks in that capacity—I know he was in that capacity, I had employed him—I believe he did not live at No. 28, St. John-street—I have been there, he had the use of an office there—the prisoner bad left a balance of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the load of hay that he purchased made it 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the prosecutor's employ—I produce the porter's book—here is an entry,—<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—" 4th March, J. George. Bister, coach, King's Arms, H. B. (signifying Holborn-bridge) paid, one parcel"—I can swear to that being in the prisoner's writing—it was a parcel that would be sent out by the prisoner, and the entry would be made by him, in anticipation of its being carried out and paid for—he makes the entry before he sends it out—he would have to give the money to the person taking the parcel—the word "paid" is confined in a space in which I should think it would not be, if it had been put in at the time the parcel was sent—the prisoner should make all the entry, except the sum in the money column, and the signature of the party receiving the money—here are two dots, under the column headed "By whom taken," which would imply, that nothing more was to be written—and beyond those two dots the word "paid" is written—if that had been written at the time, there would have been no occasion for the dots—here is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. entered—the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is blotted—the book was evidently shut while the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was wet, while the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which is in a darker ink and heavier, is not blotted at all.</p>

                  </hi>. In March last I was clerk at the booking-office at the King's-arms, Holborn-bridge. When porters from warehouses bring parcels, they produce their parcel and delivery-book, and we sign the pro<lb></lb>prietor's name—if they pay the booking only we put in 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and if they pay the carriage, we put in the carriage and the booking as well—we have a book, in which we enter what parcels are paid for, but I have not got it here—this entry imports that the carriage was paid, being 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I only received 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been put in since—I signed only to the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the booking—this 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is my own figure, and the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not—if I only receive 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I put a stroke on the left-hand side, and I find that stroke here—1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be the amount charged for carriage to Bister—if I had been paid the carriage, I should have entered 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. myself in the book.</p>

                  </hi>. When parcels were to be paid for, it was the pri<lb></lb>soner's duty to make the entry at the time they were sent out—if it was order<lb></lb>ed to be paid, it would be marked "carriage paid"—it is a most unusual thing for us to pay the carriage, nor have I any reason to believe that the package in question was ever paid for—I am quite satisfied it was not—no carriage has been charged to him in our other books—I am quite sure of that—I should expect the person to whom the goods were sent, paid the carriage—it is usual in all cases, and I know of no reason why he should not have done so in this one case—it is never the practice of the house to pay the carriage, unless it is in consequence of any neglect or omission on our part—if the porter had come back and said he had paid the carriage without being directed, the prisoner had no authority to allow the porter that.</p>

               <p>the parcel out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a column headed "by whom taken;" and here is entered, "by cart"—it was sent by one of our carts—we contract for our cartage with one man, who supplies us every day with five, six, or seven carts, and he would be responsible for any thing wrong with his men, and would have to make it good to us—whatever was entered in the book the prisoner would allow, believing it to be right—the entry of the amount would be made in the absence of the prisoner—I could prove by our journals of the day the man who took the parcel.</p>

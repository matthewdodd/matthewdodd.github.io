               <p>Do not you think this might be the effect of accident; how many people might be about you? - At least three; it appeared evident there was some such intention, I was very much alarmed; there was no carrriage-passing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say you had been drinking? - I do not recollect it, at the same time I was rather fatigued in walking from Brompton than otherwise; I am sensible I was rather elevated.</p>

               <p>I am fifteen the 3d of October. On Thursday the 18th of August last, I was at the corner of Rider's-court, Little Newport-street; I heard the cry of stop thief, I went down Newport-street, through Earl's-court, and across Cranbourn-street, into Cranbourn-alley, and not quite in the middle I kicked something before me; I picked it up, it was a watch, with only one case, my father has it, a great many people ran before me; this is the watch that I picked up in the court, and gave to my father; I shewed it to an acquaintance directly, it was between nine and ten at night.</p>

               <p>Was you near enough to see him push,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179109140092"></xptr>the prisoner? - No, I did not; when I first saw them the prisoner was, I believe, about two yards before the prosecutor; I did not see him push him.</p>

I never let my friends know, being innocent.</p>

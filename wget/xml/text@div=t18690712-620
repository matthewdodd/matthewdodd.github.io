                  </hi>. I am engaged by the Mint in coming cases—on Satur<lb></lb>day afternoon, 12th June, inconsequence of information, I went with Miller, Inspector Brannan, and other officers, to an oil-shop, in King Street, Drury Lane, and saw the prisoner in the back parlour, in Miller's custody—I said, "Mr. Cane, you are suspected of having counterfeit coin in your possession"—before ho had time to reply, Miller said, "He swallowed a lot, sir; I saw him with a lot in his mouth, shillings"—he said, "No, I swallowed some tobacco"—I said, "Where do you live?"—he said, "Nowhere; you must find out"—I said, "We shall take you to 5, Smith's Court, Drury Lane"—he said, "I never lived there in my life; it is no use to take me there"—we took him there to the second-floor front room—Hine called to me from the floor below, and handed me a packet with this counterfeit coin, partly wrapped up, and said, "Come down, we have found the coin in the prisoner's. room"—I went there and found Hine and Mrs. Pickerton, and Hine handed me a newspaper containing thirty half-crowns, thirty-eight florins, and forty-five shillings, wrapped in tissue paper, with paper lapped between—they had undergone the process of slumming with tallow and lamp-black, to give them the appearance of circulation—the prisoner was brought down stairs, and I told him what we had found—he said that he never lived in the room, but Mrs. Pickerton said, "Yes, George, you know you have lived there for the last six months"—he made no reply—Inspector Brannan searched the prisoner, and took from his pocket a piece of paper which cor<lb></lb>responded</p>

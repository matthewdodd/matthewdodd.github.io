                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Powell and Sons, stone bottle manufacturers, of Bristol; we have a branch at No. 27, Endell Street, Soho. I am also a partner in the firm of Powell and Ricketts, glass bottle manufacturers; the prisoner was in the employ of both those firms—they both contributed an annual sum to his salary—it was part of his duty to get orders in London, and to forward them to us; we then send the goods up to him invoiced to the parties, but the invoices passed through his hands; they were made out in the name of William Powell and Sons—the prisoner was authorised to receive money for us, and he used to return a monthly account to us of such receipts—in Nov., 1856,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185710260083"></xptr>
               <p>I sent up some goods for Messrs.

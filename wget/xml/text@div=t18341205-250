I sold to Elizabeth Gower, two pieces of furniture, which were produced at Queen-square and taken to our house, and by some means they were put into our stock and sold; but I have been and got a pattern—I cannot produce the piece—Mrs. Gower bought it on a Monday, in November, I believe; but I am not certain—she bought twenty-eight yards—about three days afterwards she bought twenty-eight yards more of the same pattern and price—about a fortnight afterwards a female came to our shop with two pieces of the same pattern, which I sold—it was the same pattern, and one piece I could identify as the same piece by being unrolled—they are always done very tight, and after that any person who is not in the habit of rolling them up can not do it the same; and the other piece was not unrolled—we had a private mark on it to denote the price—we put the same mark on all the goods of the same quality—I never sold any of that pattern to any body but Mrs. Gower—I cannot say other shopmen in the house have not sold any—I have said it was not the prisoner who brought it to our house—her appearance is altered, and I was deceived—I now say it was a person resembling her—the person who brought it had goods in exchange, black silk, flannel, and black lining, and grey socks—there was a female at Queen-square, who I suspected was a person re<lb></lb>sembling her, and I found it was her own sister—I should not know the things I sold her again—those produced correspond in the quantities—I sold her exactly fourteen yards of silk, and thirteen of lining.</p>

About half an hour after eleven my family went to bed, and I went into the room where my boy lies to fetch the candle away, I saw nobody in the room, but something black by the side of the bed, I looked, and found it to be the Prisoner; I called the watch, and secured him, and he had soot upon his face. I asked him where he was when the boy made his bed, he said he was under.</p>

               <p>Wills. There was a pane of glass taken out of the casement, as I apprehend, with a knife, and then he opened the casement and got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he did not come into your house in the day time?</p>
               <p>Wills. I was at home all day, and I am sure I had no customer in the house but what I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner say to you?</p>
               <p>Wills. He said all that you can do to me is that I must serve the King, and I have served the King before now [the Prisoner is a <rs id="t17450710-1-deflabel6" type="occupation">sailor</rs>

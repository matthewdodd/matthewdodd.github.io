                  </hi>. I am foreman to Messrs. Savill, Brothers, brewers at Stratford—Poulter was a tunman and Bailey a drayman in their service—on the afternoon of 9th February my attention was called to a certain cask which was in the tun-room on the left hand side—the number was 5, 993—I put it down in my book—I have got my book here (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I wrote the number down at the time in the tun-room—the number is 5, 953—it was an eighteen gallon cask—it was then standing against the column in the tun-room—I saw that cask again when it was taken off Bailey's dray at 7.15 in the evening after he had returned—he delivered three nine gallon casks at the landing stage besides that kilderk in—Bailey had been out all day from 8 o'clock in the morning till 7.15 in the evening, and I had seen that cask on the premises all day long—I saw Bailey take it off his van and put it on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187503010036"></xptr>
               <p>the landing stage—I missed that cask from the tun-room about an hour and a quarter before I saw it come on the stage—that would be about 6 o'clock—Poulter would not have any instructions to get a cask ready without any orders—I did not give him any orders to get that cask ready on that day—the empty casks would be delivered in the yard, and the landing stage is about fifty yards from that place round the corner—the draymen should deliver their returns first and then the empties—I saw Bailey's initials put on the cask afterwards when he unloaded it—the night man put it on in his presence—there was no other cask of that same number and size on the premises that day—I am quite positive of that—I said to Bailey "Did you bring this home," in the presence of the night man—Bailey said "Yes"—I said to the night man "Put his initials on it"—I was on the watch—I have never known the same cask to have two distinct numbers on it—this cask was very nearly new, it had' never been coopered—I did not see Poulter do anything with that cask on the day in question—Poulter was under me and took his orders from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were a great many casks in the tun-room where 5, 953 stood—I am foreman of the tun-room—there are about ten me under me, sometimes more and sometimes less—at this time there might have been about ten—I had seen this cask in the tun-room before, at 5 o'clock the same evening—Bailey had been out all day—I missed the cask between 5 and 6 o'clock—I don't know anything about 5, 993—this is the piece of paper I wrote—you will find "Bailey" at the bottom—there is a good deal written on the paper—it was not all written at the same time—Bome is in ink—I wrote the word "caught" at the top—that is in ink—I wrote that after I had taken the number—I did not write that in triumph—that was when I had made up my mind I had caught when I found the cask—I wrote the number 5, 953 at my desk, which was about 10 ft. from the cask—I left the cask and went to my desk—I mean to say that no cask on my master's premises has had two different numbers to my know<lb></lb>ledge—they all run in rotation—I don't know of any casks having two different numbers, one on the top and one on the bottom—I never knew of such a thing—it has not happened to my knowledge, it has no business to happen—the tun-room is separated from the rest of the warehouse by a wall—the empties would be delivered at the door leading into the yard—there are four doors into the yard—the empties are put in front of the cask washing-shed to be washed—the man ought to deliver his returns first that is to say, casks full of beer which have not been sold or delivered, and if there are any empties he ought to bring them round, so that they might be washed before they were re-filled, and they were then brought into the tun-room to be filled again—this cask was close to a column and about 20 yards from the door where the empty casks are placed—carts bringing in empty casks would pass that door—I last saw the cask about 6 o'clock in the tun-room—there is a slide to run the casks in—Bailey has been in the employ about five or six years, and Poulter a little longer than that.</p>
               <p>Alfred Wren. I live at 4, Bow Street, Stratford—on Tuesday the 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> February I was in the employ of Messrs. Savill in the tun-room—I was under Poulter—on that day he gave me orders to get a kilderkin of XK ready—I did so—I shrived it up—when I had done it I told him that it was ready—I can't say to a minute what the time was when he gave me the order, but it was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—that was the time I got it ready, and I told him I had got it ready—he had told me to do so,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187503010037"></xptr>
               <p>about two minutes before that—it was done as soon as I got the things—I left it against the drain in the new tun-room where it was—that is the tun-room which has a door which opens opposite where the empties are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am sure it was at 4 o'clock that he gave me that order—I don't recollect stating that it was after 10 o'clock and before dinner—I did not take any notice of the kilderk in—I don't know what number it was—I had orders to get it ready, and I got it ready—I thought it was not right to get it ready in that place—I should think there are about ten men at work in the tun-room—I shrived some porter and some single perhaps the same day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am sure it was an eighteen gallon cask.</p>
               <p>Arthur Orbell. I live at 56, Hellicar Road, Stratford—on the afternoon of Tuesday the 9th February I saw Wren getting a kilderk in of beer ready in the tun-room between 4 and 5 o'clock—I went and examined it after he had done it—I looked at the number and. took a note of it at the time—it was 5, 953—the cask is here; that is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I called Berry's attention to it—I am sure it was 5, 953 XK—after Bailey came book I saw it was gone from the tun-room, and it was then on the landing-stage—I did not see anything of it after 5 o'clock till I saw it on the stage about 6.45, after Bailey had come back—I looked at it then—I did not see Bailey leave in the morning—he was supposed to leave the yard at 8 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I wrote the number on this piece of paper in the tun-room in ink against the column—I had the ink in my pocket—Wren had then gone round the corner to take some tubs—I did not show him my piece of paper—I have never shown it to him—I called Berry's attention to the cask, and I showed him the piece of paper—he wrote on a piece of paper too at his desk—my master had told me to look out—I was on the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am loading-out clerk to Messrs.

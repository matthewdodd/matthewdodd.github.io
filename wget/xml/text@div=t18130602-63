            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner with me to his lodgings. This paper was handed to my Mr. Blanshard, in the prisoner's room that night.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Blanshard. What does that paper consist of - A. In the first place, here is the history of Henry earl of Westmoreland, and here is a copy of the duodecimo hymn-book which we use; it is a gathered copy ready for the binder. Here is some sheets of a commentary of the bible; the rest consists of unprinted paper, and chiefly whole quires; altogether it is worth twenty shillings. Here are near twenty quires of unprinted paper; it has a particular smell from being bleached. The prisoner begged for mercy for his younger brother, whom he had been the occasion of bringing into that practice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That paper that is there I will call a witness where I bought it; his name is Edge, in Barbican.</p>

             - A. I cannot say I do; I think I have seen him. I believe I have sold such paper as this. I am not judge enough to say I have. About four months ago I sold such paper as this in my auction-room. The person that bought it gave his name Money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you sell it for - A. I cannot swear that; it was not for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he bought it - A. I cannot swear that. The person that bought it gave his name Money. I sell by catalogue. I have a regular license, but not from the court of alderman.</p>
               <p>Q. What number do you live in Barbican - A. No. 44.</p>

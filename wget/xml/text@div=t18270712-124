            . I am Hubbard's sister. I was at Slyfield's; I had been rather in liquor, but got better. The prisoner came in, and asked if he had got his money - he said Yes, and pulled out three 5l. notes and his ticket; she said, "Give your mother one;" he did so - she then snatched the other two, and the ticket, out of his hand; and said neither father nor mother should have them from her till they fetched a constable, to make her give them up; he got one back, with the ticket, and with his trying to get them, her hand went through the glass.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He threw them on the fire - I only took one off. Witness. There was no fire in the room - I went to my sister's room, who lives in her house, but not into the prisoner's room.</p>

               <p>Q. How did the box appear to have been opened? - A.There was a hinge bad; and there was a little trunk that contained two half-guineas, four silver tea-spoons, a salt-spoon, a pair of silver knee-buckles, and a stone hat-buckle set in silver; I dare say I had not looked into it for a month; then I suspected Mrs. Miller, my landlady, because nobody slept in the house but she and me and her husband; and I attacked her with it, and she owned it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or worse for her if she did not? - A. No; I neither promised her nor threatened her; she knew that I suspected her; she said, how do you do; I said, you must needs know how I do; I told her husband she had robbed me, and he said, I might do what I liked; I might hang her, or do what I pleased; she told me she was the thief, and the only thief; I asked her how she got into the room; she said, by a false key; I asked her how she opened the little trunk; she said she had a little tea-chest key that opened it; I asked her where it was; she said she had put it down the necessary; I asked her for the key of the room that opened the door; she said, she could not give it me that day; then she took me into a back shed, and took a shovel and a saw, and dug the mould up, and a key appeared; she dug up again, and another appeared; she dug up four keys; I tried one of them, and found it opened one trunk, out of which I had lost these things.</p>

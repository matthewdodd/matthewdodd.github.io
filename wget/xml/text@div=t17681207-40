For about eight or nine months, he was employed, whilst in my service, to pay every body every Monday morning. He used to shew me the expences of the week preceding, and to bring me the receipts constantly every week from the different tradespeople; butcher, grocer, baker, and others; and he had always money before-hand to pay. When he produced their receipts, I paid him: and the running cash went on from week to week. The receipt in question he delivered to me about the 4th or 5th of May last; purporting to be a receipt from Duncan Watson, the baker. The prisoner likewise signed a weekly account in a book; and this very receipt was also in that account. I had frequently found him very remiss, and had chid him; but finding no amendment, I discharged him about the beginning of October. I went down to my country-house at Berry: there I found I had too good reason to suspect he had been playing tricks there. I came up to London, and desired Sir John Fielding to grant me a warrant, I having been at the butchers and bakers, and found he had forged several receipts. I found he had taken coach to go to Oxford, and from thence to Worcester. I got Sir

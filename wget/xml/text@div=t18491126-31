                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. William Mitchell, of Falcon-square. On 24th Sept., the prisoner came to me—he said his name was Wade, he was in Mr. Crutchley's service, and he wanted a few pencil-cases for himself—he chose half-a-dozen pencil-cases, worth 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he was to return in two or three days or the money, but he did not—it was on the faith of what he said that he was in Mr. Crutchley's employ, that I let him have them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to my brother, a stationer, in Flest-street. The prisoner left his employ on 24th Sept, between nine and ten in the morning—he was turned off because my brother did not consider him honest.</p>

            . I am nurse at the Infirmary at the Prison; the prisoner was there; I saw him pack up his linen to go to wash; I looked into his bundle, and found this Bible, which belongs to the prison; I found a note in it, which Mr. Spencer desired me to put back; it stated that the Prayer-book was at his mother's - the prisoner tore it up the next day; I do not think him in his right mind. - This letter was found in his bundle. (Letter read).</p>
               <p>October 17th, 1826.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding your behaviour towards me, during the time I have been here, I have got better treatment than I met with from you of these late years: which you may depend upon being returned by that behaviour of mine when I come home, which will be on the 11th of November. Now, as I have this to say, that as me and you for these late years past not been agreeable to each other, I will have that explanation, how I am to act, before I leave this place, either from you, as being my mother; but of your actions to me like - my actions, being very bad; but not so, that which you have thought fit to lay them out to - . I have wrote to Mr. Noke, but I have not sent it until I hear from you about this business altogether. I do not want you to settle any thing for me, as I now have got nothing more to settle; the weight of which, with your treatment, having been on my mind for ever since, and of which, as I was told by Dr. Babington here, is sure of bringing on that affliction; and, as I believe, that from your treatment and T. N. has been the whole cause, both of that and my present situation, in this life, and of which being unjustly, I shall hold to the last. I have only to say that I, during the short time I have been here, have had several advices, and all to a right purpoe, which way to go on when I come out, either to your advantage or disadvantage. I will not do any thing rashly, while here, towards you, although in my power so to do; I shall take consideration before acting -. There is a person here who has got two bills of Evans', in Spital-square, which Norman lent to a friend of his, money to the amount, one bill 37l. and 49l., which are put in his schedule as doubtful; but you never knew any thing of them; but you will (if not already) be applied to about the payment of them, therefore you may know which way to answer him. As I am glad I come here, for one point, you may depend I have not come here for nothing, but to learn the most I could while here, which you will see hereafter. I shall expect some money from you, and I am comfortable enough here, if for a year hence. Keep this book clean of mine, and Razors, and Prayer-book, and them things up-stairs from thieves that sleep there, George W. and Geo. Lish, &amp;c. I am, H. CLEAVELAND.</p>

               <p>Street, Spitalfields—at the end of January or the beginning of February the prisoner came and asked for a pennyworth of cheese and a half<lb></lb>pennyworth of bread—I served him—he tendered a florin—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and 4 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—he did not stop to eat the bread and cheese, and as soon as he got to the door I saw him run, which aroused my suspicion—I had tried the coin before he went out, and he said "Don't you like the look of it? I wish I had a sackful of them"—I afterwards found it was bad—I put it in my pocket and gave it to my husband, who put it away directly—I saw it given to the constable—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—on 5th March a constable came for me and took me to Worship Street Police Court, where I recognised the prisoner.</p>

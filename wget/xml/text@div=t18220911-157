Mine is a regular and good house, it was a bad one when I first went to it, but since I have been there I have got rid of the people who resorted there, till within the last month; Purdom has resorted there eight or nine weeks; he laid hold of my hands as I was pursuing them; I had settled with my brewer on the 4th of July, and paid him every thing, which was 100 l.; I was the first person who went into the room. I always kept the key of the box - nobody else had access to it, or knew what was in it; my servants knew money was kept there. Anybody in the back yard could see into the room, as the yard rises - part of the room is over the gateway, and the window is nearly over the gateway. I do not think the box could be seen outside - but they could see me going towards it; they saw me send the copper (which I was counting) to the brewer. I told the officers by name who to take - and went with them.</p>

My sister went immediately to Crawley. I had noticed the window about a quarter of an hour before, partly up. I saw nobody but Purdom that I know. I saw two men, but did not know who; they were walking backwards and forwards for about ten minutes. I heard the cry of Stop thief! afterwards, but did not look out of window.

It was like a frock, which came down only a short way, and was tied, light knee breeches, white stockings, and shoes. The window I was at is on the first floor, over the gateway. I looked down on his head. I did not tell my sister that it was Purdom. I said it was a man; I did not know him behind the cart, but saw that it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110077"></xptr>was him when he had the ladder; it was a lightish night, and I think the moon was about half; there was light enough to distinguish a person.

               <p>Q. You never saw Purdom laid hold of by any body, or brought in by any body before that time - A. No; I had seen him in the house before that time about half past eight, or just before nine o'clock - I did not see him there at the time of the robbery.

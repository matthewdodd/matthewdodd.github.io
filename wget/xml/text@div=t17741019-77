About a week afterwards, I was coming over Black-friars bridge; I saw them attempting to defraud a countryman and a young woman; I did not know what he was doing, but I asked a gentleman coming along if he would please to stay and hear what I had to say to that man; he asked me what; I told him he had defrauded me of some money; I was afraid to go by myself to speak to him; the gentleman crossed the bridge and spoke to him; he wanted me to make it up, and take the money; but he denied that he had ever seen me. I forgot to mention that as soon as I gave the eight shillings and penny to this man, he said we will give the gentleman sixpence for his trouble, and won't you give him nothing? I said I did not mind sixpence; he took the sixpence so freely, it put it in my mind that it was a cheat; they went off directly, and I went a little further into a shop, and asked a man if it was gold or not; he said, no, it was not, but he had no touch stone, but he was sure of that; I walked up again to see if I could see this man, but had no sight of him: it was a week after that I found him on the bridge. When the gentleman spoke to him he slided his hands through the rails of the bridge, and was going to throw a paper into the river, but the wind bl ew it back, and I picked it up; the constable has it; I delivered the ring to the constable,

               <p>As I was coming from the hospital down Ludgate-hill, this young woman overtook me; I could not walk fast being ill; I picked the ring up; she saw it before I did; I had a stick in my hand; I said there is something in a bit of paper lying before; she was going to stoop to pick it up; she cried halves; she said she supposed there was nothing in it; she took it, and looked at the ring, and said it was gold; I was no judge whether it was or not; she said she would have halves; I know nothing whether it was gold or brass.</p>
               <p>Phillips. When I was taking him to the Mansion-house, I said how came you to be so bad to defraud a poor girl of a ring? d - n her, said he, a young bitch, it serves her right, it will learn her to know better another time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a newsvender, and live in Surrey-place, Wands<lb></lb>worth. The prisoner was in my service about six months, to distribute newspapers, and receive money from customers occasionally, which he was to pay to me the same evening—on the 22nd of July he ought to have come at six o'clock—he did not come till two, and then I discharged him—I supply Mr. Feathers of Lansdown-road, and Mr. Hobson of the Quadrant, at Wands<lb></lb>worth, with papers—I did not receive any money of the prisoner for Mr. Fea<lb></lb>thers on the 26th of June—he always kept his money till it was finally set<lb></lb>tled in this book, and then he paid it over to me—that his money might be safe I gave him this little box to keep it in—he did not bring me any money on the 3rd of July, or on the 10th of July, from Mr. Feathers—I asked if he had been paid, and he said no, Mr. Feathers was out of town—he did not pay me any money from Mr. Hobson on the 20th of July—I asked him about it expressly.</p>

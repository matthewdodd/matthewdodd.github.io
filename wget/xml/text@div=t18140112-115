               <p>WOOLF JESEPHESON GOLLIN. I lost four silver table-spoons and a soup-ladle, on Monday the 3d of January. I left my house about eight in the morning; I came home between eight and nine in the evening; I was then informed I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see these spoons and soup-ladle again - A. Yes, on the 4th, the next day, at the office in Worship-street. The prisoner was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH GRIFFITHS. I was charwoman on the 3d of January, at Mr. Gollin's. I saw the prisoner in his parlour; she was a stranger to me; I asked her what she wanted; (this was about two o'clock); she said she wanted to sell a frying pan. Mr. Gollin's house is a private house. The back-door was left open for the lodgers. It is generally left upon the latch. My master's sister catched the prisoner before she went out of the house; the prisoner dropped the spoons and the soup-ladle.</p>
               <p>SARAH WOOLF. I am sister to the prosecutor. I was on a visit to my sister. I saw the prisoner in the back parlour; she left the parlour and was going<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120052"></xptr>away. I stopped her, and took her in the parlour again; she dropped directly the spoons and the soup-ladle. The spoons were kept in the back parlour; I had seen them on the table just before the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>JOHR HAWES. I produce the four spoons and the ladle.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. These four spoons and the ladle are mine; they are worth about three pounds; they would sell for that in weight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite friendless.</p>

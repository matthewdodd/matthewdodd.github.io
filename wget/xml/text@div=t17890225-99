               <p>JOHN HILLS, Esq sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Lower John-street, about seventy yards from where the robbery was committed; on the 29th of November, a little before twelve at night, going through  , opposite the center lamp, on the west side of the square, I was looking towards the rails, and saw two men run from the rails towards me, and they ran so as to divide, and to get both before and behind me; I walked two or three paces, I turned my back towards the extremity of the rails, from the entrance of Mr. Willock the auctioneer, and his lamp which affords the most brilliant light in the square, was about four feet above me on the right hand; a sailor, not the prisoner at the bar, ran with great violence towards me, and pushed the muzzle of a pistol towards my breast, that if I had not been against the rails I should have reeled; he said, your money or your life; I forgot to mention, that when they set off running, the one took a north, and the other an east direction; he raised the pistol to my eye, and the unfortunate man at the bar came up with a pistol, and put it to my right temple, and desired me to make haste; I was very cool and collected, and had drank no more than one half pint of wine in the course of the day; I took out five shillings, which was all the money that I had at the time, and three keys, two of which I have now in my possession, I addressed them thus:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I beg you will not use me ill, this is all the money I have, (presenting the 5 s. and the keys at the time) I am very sorry it is no more; here are three keys that can be of no service to you, and you will oblige me by returning them." The prisoner did return me two keys which I have now in my hand, the other he retained in his fright; for I believe he was much more frightened than myself, and trembled.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was the man that gave you back the keys? - Yes; they told me to walk on, and if I attempted to look back they would fire at me; one of them told me, but which I cannot say, to walk on; I did walk on to the fourth extremity of the square before I looked back, I saw nothing of the men, but heard them running on the other side of the square; I got to my own house about twenty yards from the square, and got a neighbour to go with me in pursuit of the prisoners; I did not find them, but on my return I went to the watch-house, and one of the witnesses, together with the beadle, went round with me about to all the night houses in St. James's parish, but we did not find them that night; nor till the morning of their apprehension, which was the 2d of February last.</p>
               <p>You saw no more of them from the 29th of November till the 2d of February? - No, I was out later than usual, I went home to my house, and I could not get admission; I knocked and could not make them hear; it occurred to me that I would go and look after the prisoner; I went to a night-house called the Red-lion, in Piccadilly; there might be thirty persons in the room, I got into a box, and seated myself as well as I could; after being there about half an hour, I observed the prisoner among the others.</p>
               <p>Court. What number of people? - There might be about thirty; he was quarrelling with a very stout man whom he was going to fight; some of his acquaintance desired him sit down, which he complied with; he sat facing me, and I looked at him, I suppose, for half an hour.</p>
               <p>Quarrelling had drawn your attention to him first? - Yes; but I knew him immediately when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>He sat down facing you? Yes, in an opposite box, I looked at him for a considerable time; I put a question to myself thus:</p>
               <p>"John Hills, is that the man that robbed you?" the more I looked at him,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250128"></xptr>the more I was convinced he was the person; I went from the house to St. James's watch-house, and having got the beadle and the beadle's assistant, I took him myself.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promise at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Nor nobody in your presence? - No, he said before Justice Read that he was not the man, for at that time he was in Newgate for robbing a post-boy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Had you not two men taken up for this robbery before? - The night I was robbed I spoke to a watchman and the beadle's assistant, and described the man that robbed me, and they took up two persons who answered that description; that was an hour and a half after, the same morning they were brought to the watch-house and they were discharged.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure the prisoner is the person? - Yes, for there is a person I know, who resembles him so much, that I have said to fifty persons, that I should have supposed, if the prisoner had been lame, that it had been him; he is a waiter at the ship in Palace-yard; he is lame and could not run, so that it could not be him.</p>
               <p>There was a resemblance that struck you very forcibly between this man and the man that you took? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So much that you could not help to have suspected that man if he could run? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But you have no doubt but this is the man that robbed you? - No.</p>
               <p>This transaction did not take up long time? - Not above a minute and a half or two minutes.</p>
               <p>Did this man look at you at all? - I had a side view of him.</p>
               <p>You are satisfied that he is the man? - Yes, he is dressed now as he was at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These two men were in custody some time, while Mr. Hills was in Wales? - There was a man in custody while I was in Wales, but I never saw him, he was discharged before I came to town.</p>

               <p>The prisoner lodged with me at the time of the robbery, I knew him from a boy; he was a parish boy, and apprenticed in St. James's parish; his wife was a cook in a nobleman's family; the prisoner has been; a widower about two years, and is now; and is a very honest man for aught I know I am obliged to let my lodgings to women, not to men, I assure you, my lord; but I offered him a bed, which he was ready to accept of, and to give me a shilling a week. On Saturday the 29th of November, when the robbery was committed, I am positive he was at home, he was not well, he had been ill a month before, I had company that day.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner confined to his bed? - He was occasionally now and then; he was up three or four hours in the day.</p>
               <p>He never walked out at that time? - I never saw him go out.</p>
               <p>How came you to remember this day of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250129"></xptr>the month? - I consider a false oath as a very bad thing: whether Mr. Hills does or not I do not know.</p>
               <p>You think that was the day of the month? - The 22d was his birth-day, and he invited some friends, and begged the use of my apartment; he told me it was his birth-day two or three days before.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Norfolk-street in the Borough.</p>
               <p>How came you here as a witness? - He asked me to come, because he told me this, that he heard Mr. Hills would stick as close to him as he could; I took some victuals to Newgate two or three days, says he, Mrs. Toosey, I find he is very rigid.</p>
               <p>He told you the day of the month, did he? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Did not he ask you, if you did not remember where he was at the time of the robbery? - No, he told me, I knew he was innocent.</p>
               <p>In what way did he tell you now, he was innocent, did he not tell you it was on the 29th of November? - I read in the paper by accident.</p>
               <p>In what paper? - The Daily Advertiser.</p>
               <p>When did you read that? - I believe it might about three weeks ago, or near a month.</p>
               <p>What was in the paper? - That the man was taken up for robbing of Mr. Hills of five shillings and a key.</p>
               <p>Do you remember what it said? - I cannot say whether his name was mentioned or not.</p>
               <p>How can you tell you got your information by the newspapers, when you cannot tell what was in the papers? - That

               <p>You need have a better memory, for you told me just now that you learnt the night from the newspaper? - By all account the robbery was committed three or four months ago.</p>
               <p>But how came you then to know the robbery was the 29th of November? - I was informed it was.</p>
               <p>I want to know who informed you? - Butcher told me it was committed on the 29th of November, when it was committed he was at home.</p>
               <p>He informed you that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then why did you tell me that he did not inform you.</p>

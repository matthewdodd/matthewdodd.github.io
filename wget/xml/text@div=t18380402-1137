               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020309"></xptr>
               <p>to the best of my recollection, the diamond-ring was the only professional business I did for him before making the codicil to the will—he came to my house at Penross, which is within a mile of Carnarvon, on that business—I did not know of any will made by Mr. Williams of Beaumaris—all I saw was the settlement on the son's marriage, and the will of 1828, and the codicil—he did not mention a word to me of any prior will that he had made—I took instructions from his mouth, as to the alteration he wished to make in dis<lb></lb>posing of his property—it did not appear to me to be rather a new will than a codicil to an existing will—I do not recollect what part of the will was to remain in force—his instructions were, that neither Mrs. Hamilton nor Mrs. Williams should take any part of the unsettled property, or per<lb></lb>sonal property, except 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the one, and 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the other, and every thing else was to go to his son, Barton—he did not tell me whether to prepare a codicil or another will—he left that to me, and I thought it would be more convenient to have a codicil, otherwise I should not have done so—no person was present when he gave me instructions—I do not know where the prisoner and his wife were living at that time—I know Brynbras Castle, it is four miles from Carnarvon—I have known the prisoner a great number of years—he resided at Brynhras Castle in good style, I believe—I was not on visiting terms with him, and never had been so—I should not know Mrs. Williams if I were to see her now—I believe Mr. Williams had ceased to practise as a solicitor for a good many years—he had no clerks or establishment as a solicitor, to my knowledge—when Mr. Barton Panton made his proposals to my daughter, I was aware of the will which his father bad made in his favour—I believe Mrs. Hamilton was at that time living at Chester—after I had made the two codicils for Mr. Panton, I believe I distrained for rent on some tenants of his—that was all I did for him, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Carnarvon, and am a slate merchant. I knew the late Mr. Panton, the testator—I remember the marriage of his son, the prosecutor, with Miss Williams, the daughter of Mr. Rumiey Wil<lb></lb>liams—I had been requested to negociate that marriage—I know the tes<lb></lb>tator was gratified at that marriage having taken place—I know he said before the marriage that he highly approved of the match; and if the par<lb></lb>ties would live with him till the time of his death, that Mr. Barton Panton should have the bulk of his property—I was on intimate terms with the late Mr. Panton from that occasion—there was a sleeping-room in his house called after me; and in the hunting season, I was frequently a guest at his house—he appeared very much attached to his son Mr. Barton Pan<lb></lb>ton—I remember the birth of their little girl—the old gentleman was par<lb></lb>ticularly fond of the child, and very anxious about her safety and welfare on all occasions—I remember in May, 1837, making an engagement to go to Chester Races—Mr. Barton Panton was to have been my companion—the races commenced on Monday the 1st, and lasted the whole week—I in<lb></lb>tended to go on Thursday the 4th, but we did not go; for on the evening on the 3rd, on my arrival at Plasgwyn, the old gentleman expressed his particular wish that we would postpone our visit—he said he had par<lb></lb>ticular business to transact with Mr. Barton Panton the following morn<lb></lb>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020311"></xptr>
               <p>—he said be was not in as good health as usual, and did not appear so—he had a severe cold—I believe he died in the seventy-sixth year of his age—I slept there that night—on the morning of the 4th of May, Mr. and Mrs. Barton Panton breakfasted with the old gentleman, and the little girl was present—on Mrs. Panton and the child leaving the room after breakfast, the testator gave Mr. Barton Panton the key of his library, and desired he would go up stairs in the library, and in the left hand cupboard he would find a roll of papers scrawled or figured on the outside, and he was to bring them down to his father—he did so; and after his bringing them down, the old gentleman took them out of his hand, and then handed them back to him—he said, "Here, Barton, these are Bank receipts for stock (or funds) to the amount of from 28, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 29, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I give you these, and on about 20, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of them no dividend has been re<lb></lb>ceived for ten years, since 1827"—he then said, "Now, Barton, I think you have staid at home to some purpose"—he then told him he gave him all the money he had in the house—all the money he had in the hands of his bankers, Messrs. Douglas, Smalley, and Co., at Holywell and Mold, and in the banking-house of Williams, Granville and Co., at Chester and Carnarvon—he then said he gave him all the arrears of rents due on his respective estates, and all the rents that would accrue due to the time of his death—his daughter was not mentioned in the course of the conversation at all—he then said, "I give you all my share and interest in mining concerns, all my canal shares, all my securities for money, all my plate;" and he handed him the key of his plate-chest—he said, "I give you all my books," hand<lb></lb>ing him the key of the library at the same time—"I give you all the wine in the cellar," handing him the key of the wine-cellar; "and all my farming stock, and personalty of every kind"—he said, "Take great care of all, particularly of Ann and little Missy, as I can't be long with you"—he then said he had desired I would not go in the morning before breakfast, as he wanted me to be present to witness that transaction; and he expressed a wish that I would call on Mr. Rumsey Williams for a parcel which I was to take with me to Plasgwyn the next time I went there; and he said the next time he saw me he would give me his reasons for wishing me to stop over that morning—I called on Mr. Rumsey Williams, but I did not get the parcel—the word the old gentleman used was, "a parcel of his," and I was not able to tell Mr. Williams what parcel he wanted—I called at Plasgwyn on the Monday following—the Sunday was very tempestuous—I was in the habit of going on Sundays, but I put it off—I told Mr. Panton what took place about the parcel, and he expressed his surprise that Mr. 'Williams had not known what he wanted, as it was his will he wanted—he said I should call again on Mr. Williams, and bring the will over the next time I came to Plasgwyn.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this paper—(<hi rend="italic">handing a paper to the witness</hi>)—do you see your name to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I wrote this to Mr. Rumsey Williams, and sent it on the day it bears date.—<hi rend="italic">This being read, was upon a subject irrelevant to the case, but to it was added the following PS. "It was the will Mr. Panton wanted, I am going there this evening, have you any com<lb></lb>mands</hi>?—9th May, 1837."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember having mentioned the will, the testator saying any things to Mr. Barton Panton? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he told him it was the will under which he would take all his unsettled estate, and he said to me, "When you called on me previous to the marriage of Mr. Barton Panton with Miss Williams, I told you if they lived with me to the time of my death,</p>

               <p>that Barton Panton should have the bulk of my property at my decease," and that was the reason he wished me to stay, that I might see that realised—this was on Monday, the 8th of May—on the 13th of May, I received intelligence with respect to the state of health of the tes<lb></lb>tator—I went to his house in consequence—I found him very poorly—I went on the 13th—he died on the 26th of that same month—between the 13th and the 26th, I was occasionally backwards and forwards there, to see the old gentleman, either late or early, I believe every day, till his decease—he did not say any thing to me, to my re<lb></lb>collection, with respect to the transaction I had witnessed—I was at the funeral of the old gentleman—the prisoner was there—he came very late, just as the remains were about being removed into the hearse—he went to the funeral with the rest—I did not see him after the service had been read and the ceremony had been performed, not after he left the churchyard—in Wales, after the funeral of the deceased, it is generally the case, that parties expecting to be interested under the will, go in to hear it read—I went with Mr. Barton Panton and Paul Panton—the prisoner did not go in at all, and in consequence of that the will was not read—I know the prisoner's hand-writing—I have seen him write.</p>

               <p>No. 4.—"The illness of your sister takes me out of the country, and you have refused, on two or three applications, a meeting of those interested is the settlement of you and her father's affairs.

               <p>No. 5.—"Brynbras, Carnarvon, June 6th, 1837. "Sir,—By my messages to you, requesting you to appoint a day to represent your father's affairs, I had no wish to occasion any angry feeling. Naturally, I would be anxious to have that day appointed before I left the country, and your last note puts it off for a few days longer, which will pre<lb></lb>vent me attending the meeting. I do not consider this acting very fairly towards your sister, and I think that your father-in-law will tell you the same, and will also tell you that you cannot; that I cannot allow you to prove your poor father's will, to which you allude in your note of yesterday, to be proved, without its being even shown to the family. Mr. Boggie, during our absence, will represent your sister and myself, and he being an honourable man, will do every thing that is just and fair to all parties; and in respect to the caveat, I did call on Mr. Boggie yesterday, at Beaumaris, after the receipt of your note; that I did not mind the threat of it, and desired him to enter it accordingly; however, appoint an early day, and after hearing from Mr. Boggie, I will tell him what to do, and we will endeavour amicably to carry into effect your poor father's intentions; for whom I had great regard, and he also for your sister and myself.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say whether your father left the house on that Sunday you speak of? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never left the house, he was too poorly—I and my wife were both there—my little girl was unwell at that time—I remember Mr. Rumsey Williams coming to Plasgwyn in a few days after that—I saw him in the room with my father on that occasion—my father called me to him, and gave a large paper parcel, saying it was his last will and codicils, and he told me to take them and lock them up—I locked them up in my dressing-room, and kept them there till after the death of my father—after the death of my father I sent notices appointing the day of the funeral—I appointed the 2nd of June—I sent to all the relatives, and amongst the rest to the prisoner—I was present at the funeral—the parties as<lb></lb>sembled at the house at Plasgwyn, all but the prisoner—I sent over for him to his brother's house at Rhulass, which is a quarter of a mile off—when the remains were put into the hearse the prisoner joined the procession—after the funeral I returned to the house, and so did all the parties but the pri<lb></lb>soner—I did not read the will that day, because the prisoner was not pre<lb></lb>sent—the will was on the table to be read, but the prisoner not being there, and I wished him to be present, I did not read it—I saw the prisoner after that—he and his brother came in a gig on the 5th of June, I think—I do not know what day of the week it was—I saw him, he asked if I had any thing to say to him—I said no, I was busy arranging and looking over my father's papers—he did not say any thing to that—he went off—after that I received the note from him marked No. 3—I after<lb></lb>wards received No. 4, which states that no will should be proved till it had been shown, and he would enter a caveat—I sent an answer to that—after that I received a letter from him, dated the 6th of June—I afterwards fixed the day for reading the will, the 9th of June—the prisoner did not attend—the will was then read by Mr. Robert Williams—Mr. Boggie was not there—Mr. Bulkley Williams, the prisoner's brother, Owen Owen, and my brother Paul, were there—the prisoner's brother came after the will was read—he saw the will and codicils, and took notes of the will and codicils—by that will I was appointed the sole executor, and I took steps to get it proved in the Prerogative Court—I advertised some property for sale on the 26th of July—up to that 26th of July I did not hear from the prisoner, or any one else, that he had a will—he had not made any representation of that sort to me, and Ihad heard of none—it was on the day of the sale that I first heard of any will the prisoner had—that was the first notice I had of it—I gave instruction to oppose the proof of those wills when I heard of them—I think it was about the 7th of February that I first received any information of these wills being written on obliterations of pencil—that was after the commission had been down Wales to examine wit<lb></lb>nesses—I am the prosecutor in this case—these are the stock receipts that I received, and which were put away by me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>—they amount to between 28, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 29, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you know of Mr. Williams having made the codicil in 1831? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know my father went to Mr. Williams that year, but I do not know what it was about—it might be about the year 1830 or 1831, that I first began to show attention and pay my addresses to Mr. Rumsey Williams's daughter—it was before 1830—I had known the family some time—it was known to Mr. Williams before 1830, that I was paying attention to his daughter—I used to go to Penross to visit her—not very often—Mr. Williams sometimes saw me, and was aware of the object of my visit—that was before my father went to Mr. Williams in 1831—I had nothing to do with bringing Mr. Rumsey Williams and my father together—my father did not tell me of Mr. Williams having made a codicil to his will, nor did any one else—I do not know that my father went there to have his will made or altered—be told me the contents of the will under which I now claim, just before his death—he had told me that I should have the whole of his property.</p>

               <p>—he gave it up soon after he married my sister—he had no longer toy establishment as a lawyer—he had not managed any affairs of my father latterly—he used to go up to London, and my father spoke to him about some town property that he had—I do not dink he had the sole management of that property—he might have something to do with it—my father did not correspond with him about it—the prisoner used not to come to Plasgwyn without my sister—my father conversed with him about this town property—I was on good terms with my sister—she was living at Brynbras Castle with her husband in February last, I believe—I knew then that there was a suit going on in the Ecclesiastical Court respecting the wills—I wanted to establish my father's will—there was a commission came down to Carnarvon—I did not attend it—I gave instruc<lb></lb>tions for proceeding against my brother-in-law, soon after I heard of the pretended will—I do not think I knew any thing of it till the 26th of July—I heard nothing about it—about the 12th of February I heard there was another will, and gave directions for my brother-in-law being apprehended at Brynbras Castle—I gave directions for Ann Williams and Ellen Evans being apprehended—I did not give directions that they should be carried to London immediately, I left that to the Magistrate—this was not at Carnarvon—I merely went to the Magistrate in London for a warrant—Mr. Rumsey Williams came to London with me—I cane to get the warrant—I came to consult my solicitor—I came to town on the 12th of February—the examination of witnesses under the commission was closed before then—no one came with me, but Mr. Ramsey Williams—I came to get the warrant executed against Mr. Williams, and Ann Williams, and Ellen Evans—I gave no orders for the prisoner's paper to be seized—they may have been seized—I know that Ann Williams and Ellen Evans have been indicted in another indict<lb></lb>ment, with Mr. Williams, for forging this will—I suppose they were to be tried on that indictment—my father purchased one or two estates for me, which were conveyed to me in his lifetime, perhaps to the amount of a couple of thousands, or more—he did not give me large sums of money besides—when I wanted, he gave me what might be called pocket-money—I am of no profession—my brother Paul was living in Shropshire—my brother Thomas died on his passage home from India—I know my father's hand-writing—I do not believe this (<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) to be my father's hand-writing—it is like it, but the manner of hand-writing is not like his—the forming of the letters is not like his—the "W," the "H," and the "R," are all unlike his, and the figure, and the "P" of Plasgwyn—this is certainly not my Father's hand-writing—I should say I am convinced of it—I have seen the address sufficiently—this is not my father's hand—it is like it—it is a good imitation—I think it is not my father's hand-writing—to the best of my knowledge, I believe it not to be my father's hand-writing, as far as I have seen it—this other paper (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is not my father's hand-writing—this certainly is a better imitation of his writing than the other, but it is not my father's hand-writing—I am positive of it, and will swear it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at this, scrip No. 7? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is not my father's hand-writ<lb></lb>ing, nor any part of it—if this pretends to be my father's hand-writing, it is a forgery—I can take my solemn oath it is not my father's hand-writing.</p>

               <p>which you have shown me, which are marked "9" and "7"—I have seen them before—I have always been of opinion they were forgeries—I saw them be<lb></lb>fore the Magistrate—I never had the slightest doubt about their being for<lb></lb>geries—on the 4th of May, 1837, my father was poorly—he complained of a cold at the time he made the parole will in my favour—I knew of no will whatever, except what my father told me—he did not tell me on the 4th of May, when he gave me the roll, and so on, that he had made a written will in my favour—I knew he had made his will—he did not tell me he had made a will in my favour—he gave me the key of the library, to go up stairs and get this roll, and he gave me the key of the library, with the roll of paper—I offered the key to him, and he said, "No, keep it along with the roll of paper"—I offered him the key directly after I brought the roll of paper down—he then desired me to keep the key, he gave it me along with the roll of paper, and then he said he gave me his books—I was going to thank him, but he stopped me—Mr. Bettiss was there—I believe my wife was in the next room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You employed Mr. Bettiss to remove any difficulty in the way of the match? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as a friend—he is my wife's uncle—he has nothing to do with this prosecution whatever—about the 5th of June Mr. Williams called—he sent for me—I came to him—he did not mention that he wished to see the will under which I claimed—I was up in the library, busy—he sent in to me—I came down, and saw him—he said, "Have you any thing to say to me?"—I told him I was busy, and he drove away instantly—nothing more was said—I saw no more of him for a length of time—I had no communication at all with Ellen Evans or Ann Williams before they were taken up—I knew them by sight, during the time they were in service at Mr. Williams's, but never spoke to them in my life—I have not applied to the Ecclesiastical Court to delay publication of the evidence till after this trial was over—there might have been an application to delay publication—I did not wish to delay publication till after the trial—I was not in court at any time when any application to that purport was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first say that these papers that are marked "7" and "9" were forgeries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said the whole of them were forgeries—I did not allude to one or two—I never had any doubt in my own mind that these two were forgeries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not at first, when Mr. Williams's wills were set up, say that your father was drunk when he signed these papers? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not; I never said that of my father, that he was affected by liquor—I did not say that Ann Williams could not write—I said I thought she could not write—I believed she could not write—I might assign as a reason why the wills attested by her were forgeries, that she could not write—I did so, now recollect, and also said that John Williams could not write—I heard so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR W.

I think that was on the 2nd of March, or at the beginning of March—I examined them all—I think there was one without any traces on it—I do not know the number of it—they would not allow me to take notes, and I forget—I observed one of the foolscap sheets was penciled on the right-hand side, but not the left—I think I can show the one that has not the pencil marks—I was able to trace letters and words—I have seen the papers to-day, and am able to trace and point out with a pen, or any instrument, letters, and words on many of these papers—I could point out to the Jury letters, and figures, and marks, on many of these papers—I have not any doubt that the pencil marks on the papers have been attempted to be rubbed out—it appeared to me that the pencil marks had been rubbed out—I am able to tell what appeared to me to have been in pencil previous to the writing on No. 2, which is the plainest.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JERVIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many years have you been in the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Ten years—I attended two commissions—they were not both the prosecutor's—I got down on the morning of the 5th of January—I went to the Goat Inn, at Carnarvon, and proceeded to open the commission the same morning—there was a mistake subsequently dis<lb></lb>covered in the commission—I did not come back, but I went away from Carnarvon altogether, in consequence of being informed there was a strong jealousy in the family—I went to Chester, and went by the rail-road to Liverpool, Manchester, and some other places—I took all my papers with me, and returned on the Wednesday, and the same day we opened new commission—when I opened the commission I kept my papers in my bed<lb></lb>room, locked up in a cupboard, the key of which I kept in my pocket, and the key of my portfolio also—I left the Goat in order to open the commis<lb></lb>sion, and I am not aware that I left it at any other time with the papers in the house—I might have left it for five or ten minutes—I did not go out to dinner the whole time I was there—part of the time there was no key to the door, and I had the door sealed—I never left the Goat without having the papers locked up, or a paper on the door sealed with my own seal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it less trouble to get the key than to get a candle, and seal the door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had candles burning in the room, and when I went out I took one candle with me, and put a seal across the door, till the lock was mended—it was two days before the lock was mended, but I did not Jeave the Goal—I believe I was on the same floor—I sealed the door because it would have flown open—I do not know that I always sealed it with paper—I might once, but I sent for some tape to do it with—I only went to my dinner</p>

               <p>in the next room but one, and when I returned I found the seals all right—I broke them, and went in—I locked the papers in my bed-room some<lb></lb>times—that door did not require sealing, because there was a lock to the door, and to the cupboard—Mr. Tyrer looked at these papers very casually, and said, "I see marks on these papers"—that was subsequently to the 16th of January, I think it was after the closing of Wadeson's commission. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had your door mended before that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I moved from one room to another, and that had a very good lock—I had made the discovery before I moved—I had got a key to the door before I made the discovery, because that room never was without a key—I required the key to be given to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long had you been there before it was necessary to seal your door? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After the extension of the time, after the commission recom<lb></lb>menced—after the term pottery expired, I came to town, and brought my papers sealed up with me—I finally brought up the scrips in the beginning of February, the 3rd or 4th—they were not lodged in the Court till the 13th, but they were sealed up in my iron safe till that time—I never produced them in Court—I made a facsimile of them in Wales, after I discovered the marks on them—I made it all on tracing-paper—the part that was in ink, and drew the pencil marks distinctly from it—that was after I made the discovery, and during the time the commission was there—Mr. Tyrer obtained the tracing paper at my request—no one helped me to make them, but they were examined after they were made—no person assisted me in making the copies—I am not certain whether or not Mr. Tyrer was present at any part of the time; in met, I think he was present at part of the time—I think it probable he was present during the time I was copying the pencil marks, because I did them by day-light—he examined the copies—I considered it my duty to make these copies—I did not put down all, as there is on one of these scrips "nee," which I did not see at first, and did not put that down—I put down every thing else, I think, as far as I can call to memory—I put them also in the same position as nearly as I could, because I put them in governed by the mode I have named—there may be a little variation in some of them, but, gene<lb></lb>rally speaking, they are correct—I did them in that way—I came to town on the 4th or 5th of February—no one came with me—I brought the fac<lb></lb>similes I made to London—they were delivered up afterwards by direction of counsel at Guildhall, to Mr. Bodkin—I gave them to him by his direc<lb></lb>tion, he stating that it was my duty to do so—I made them for the Court originally, that it might be seen what discoveries I had made on the papers—when I came to town I showed them to various persons, officers of the Court—I attended at Guildhall with them—I went down to Carnar<lb></lb>von again—the commission was over then—my own feeling took me down—I did not go with the officers—they went one or two days before me—I had made the discovery, and was very anxious about it—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect the day I went—I did not go with the officers to Brynbras—I came up with one of the officers and Ellen Evans, in a post-chaise, having taken a place outside the mail, but it was so cold we could not go by it—Mr. Tyrer might have been in another post-chaise with Ann Williams, but I am not aware of it—I never saw him coming up, or in a chaise—I did not see him on my way up—I saw him at Carnarvon, at the Groat hotel—I saw Mr. Rumsey Williams at his own house, at Penross—I did not sleep there—I dined there—Mr. Barton Panton was not there—we most probably talked</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not put many questions to Ellen Evans as you came up with her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Various questions—she was in custody of Dodd, the officer, at that time—I did not tell her she was in custody for forgery—I gave her a sovereign, upon her stating that she had but 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in her pocket, and that was not her own, and she did not know what she should do—that was at the inn, at Oswestry—I did not see Mr. Tyrer, nor Ann Williams, in coming up—I went down with Mr. Rumsey Williams—I gave no directions to Dodd about Ellen Evans's box—it was not at my instance that the pri<lb></lb>soner's papers were seized—the prisoners were all apprehended before I got there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you made fac-similes, did any body else do so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—no person whatever had a copy of these fac-similes—before I gave them to Mr. Bodkin, Ruthven, the officer, had possession of two of them for two or three days—as I was going down from London to Bangor I saw Mr. Tyrer and Ann Williams at Tyn-y-Maes—no one was with me then—Mr. Rumsey Williams travelled with me, but he went on by the mail—I stopped because Ann Williams was there—it is a small public-house, the only place there is there—I went into the house, and remained three-quarters of an hour—I did not see Ellen Evans—I saw Ann Williams, and asked her some questions, and I believe Mr. Tyrer did, and then I went on to Bangor, in a closed car—I slept at Bangor that night, and then went on to Carnanron—I paid my own expenses—I do not know that anybody asked me to go—Mr. Rumsey Williams did not ask me—I went down, both from curiosity and the love of justice—I drew a statement which the Court directed me to give in, in consequence of the state of the papers coming to their knowledge—I drew the statement by the judge's direction—I drew the pe<lb></lb>tition at the request of Mr. French, because I was in possession to the papers—it was for permission to plead—the papers are not before the Court, and it was necessary to state them—it was merely a formal petition to the Court for permission to give in a fresh allegation—the publication cannot pass if a plea is permitted to be given in, but the publication was stopped before I gave that in—I drew it a fortnight or three weeks ago, imme<lb></lb>diately after Mr. Wadeson withdrew his allegation.</p>

ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long hare you been clerk to Mr. Rumsey Williams? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since the 14th of October last—I had been in other service before—I had never acted in a commission of the Ecclesiastical Court before—I had my instructions from Mr. French—I cannot fix the day on which I first saw these scrips—it was after Mr. Wil<lb></lb>liams's witnesses had been examined—the first time I saw them I observed marks on them, and I asked Mr. Jennings if I might inspect them, as part of our case was to prove that one of the attesting witnesses could not write, and I wished to look at the signature—it was merely out of curiosity—Mr. Priest, of the Bank, at Carnarvon, and Mr. Owen Owen, had seen the scrips—when I saw them I immediately saw some marks—Mr. Jennings was lodging at the Goat—I was there every day, and I saw his room sealed up every day during his dinner-time—not more than two days—the papers were only sealed up in one room—that was after the time for the examination had been extended—the door was sealed with a piece of paper put across—I held the candle while Mr. Jennings sealed it—he did not ask me to do it—he only sealed it twice while he went to his dinner, and he dined with his door open—his door was only sealed twice, to the best of my recollection—it was sealed, I think, with paper—I am not aware that it was ever sealed with tape—I dined with Mr. Jennings several days—Mr. Wadeson did not—he was asked, but did not do it—I think I might positively say I dined fif<lb></lb>teen times with him, if not more—we had our dinner, and he immediately returned to his room—I had no conversation with him about the witnesses</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020342"></xptr>
               <p>who were examined—if I commenced the conversation, he refused to answer me—that was two or three times—the moment I saw the pencil-marks, I said, "Good God, there are pencil marks!"—I think he told me he knew what they were, but he did not tell me what they were at that time—I examined the fac-similes with him—he said he thought it his duty, lest any thing should happen to him, to point them out to me, and accordingly he did, and I saw them then—I think that might be a week or more after I had asked permission of him to look at them, and had inspected them—he pointed out to me what he had discovered—I made out "Bishopgate-street," and "Cursitor-street," and parts of some other words, but I had not time to apply to them, as Mr. Jennings was examining witnesses, and at the end he pointed them out to me—I examined the fac-similes with him—I did not at all assist in making the fac-similes—I bought the paper of Mr. Pritchard, the bookseller, at Mr. Jennings's request—I believe it was charged to Mr. Rumsey Williams's general account—I saw Mr. Jennings making the fac-similes from time to time, but I never assisted him in tracing either the writing or the pencil-marks—I am sure of that—I swear it—I was in and out of the room on different occasions while he was making the fac-similes—there was no one else there—the fac-similes were made, I think, mostly at night, and in the morning I saw the greater part of the pencil-writing traced upon the tracing paper, but T did not at all help him—I cannot tell How long he was employed—I saw the fac-similes lying on the table—I am not aware that any one else saw them—I never saw but one copy of them made—I examined them with him—I might be two or three hours employed about that—I think we examined the duplicate and the original first, and then the others another day, but I would not charge my memory precisely with that—Mr. Jennings had the fac-simile lying before him, and, from time to time, he took up the papers which he could see with the naked eye; and when he could not, he used a reflector, and then he traced the marks on the fac-simile—he had the fac-simile before him, and he took up the will, and saw through what part of the letters the marks went—he traced them through the dot of an i, or the tail of a g—he cer<lb></lb>tainly placed the tracing paper over the papers, and with regard to the ink, he traced that over it—he had no pencil to make an imitation of the pencil-marks—I think he did them with red ink—there was a pencil, his own pocket-pencil, but he never applied that to the original will, that I saw—I had a fall opportunity of seeing the fac-similes, and I told Mr. Rumsey Williams what I had seen—I did not tell Mr. Wadeson—he was gone before the fac-similes were made—Mr. Williams attended the commission himself daily—I did not mention to him what I had seen, nor call upon him for any explanation—the fac-similes were finished the day the commission was closed—I then proceeded to my lodging, about a mile from Carnarvon—I did not go to London till after Mr. Williams was in custody—I did not go to procure the warrant—I remained at Carnarvon—I knew the warrants were coming down, but I cannot tell positively who told me—I think it must have been Mr. Rumsey Williams, but I would not charge my memory—I had no conversation with Mr. Jennings about any warrants—I swear that—the officers sent to my lodging for me—I was not there, and they sent to a friend's house—I met them at the gate, and accompanied them to Brynbras Castle the next morning—the officers did not think themselves justified in going, without some one to identify the prisoner—Mr. Williams was at home at Brynbras Castle—he took his papers in his own custody to Lon<lb></lb>don</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183804020343"></xptr>
               <p>—I picked them up for him, and they were taken, by Mr. Williams's desire, to London, to be inspected by his professional advisers.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the officer seize a large quantity of papers belonging to Mr. Williams? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said to Mr. Williams, "We shall want your papers," and Mr. Williams filled one bag with papers, and said they should be taken to London and inspected in the presence of his legal advisers—Mr. Williams, the officer, and myself went to the iron-chest, and Mr. Williams took them out and put them into the bag—that was certainly under the requisition that they should want his papers—I have not detained a great portion of those papers—I do not know of their being detained—Ellen Evans was taken at Brynbras Castle at the same time—I was not present when Ann Williams was taken—I accompanied Ellen Evans to Tyn-y-maes, and there met Mr. Jennings—I was surprised—he and I entered into conversation with Ellen Evans and Ann Williams—I put some questions to Ann Williams—I told them they were charged with forging the will, and then asked ques<lb></lb>tions—I did not see either of them during the rest of the journey—I left and went home—I bad come in a post-chaise with Ellen Evans alone, about fourteen miles, and the officer was on the box—I had some conversation with her, and put questions to her—that was not by the desire of Mr. Rum<lb></lb>sey Williams, but out of my own head—I came to London in the beginning of March—I saw two of the fac-similes in the country with Mr. Jennings—I saw them again on my examination—Mr. Jennings brought the fac-similes when I saw him at Tin-y-maes—he showed them to me—I had two of them in my hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you them at Carnarvon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had two—I showed one to Captain Boyle, and I showed them to Mr. Morgan, at the bank of Carnar<lb></lb>von, now you remind me of it—I went there for money, and I showed them as cariosities—when I was examined in London, I saw the same fac<lb></lb>similes—I have seen Mr. Jennings since I have been in town—I saw him yesterday and to-day waiting outside—I conversed with him as I would with any other person—I have assisted in the prosecution as clerk to Mr. Rumsey Williams—I have conversed with Mr. Flower—I conducted the prosecution in the country in Mr. Rumsey Williams's office, as his clerk—I have communicated but little on the subject with Mr. Rumsey Williams—he would not communicate with me—I brought the witnesses to town myself—I subpoenaed a witness named Jane Thomas, but she did not come under my subpoena, she was on her way to London when I subpoenaed her—I believe she was one of the house-maids—I subpoenaed Owen Roberts—I do not know that he was the gardener—I was not directed by Mr. Rumsey Williams to subpoena them, but by Messrs. Harmer and Flower—I came to town and instructed them—I drew up a brief and gave it them—I sub<lb></lb>poenaed Grace Jones—she is here—I have never said that I was directed by Mr. Rumsey Williams to subpoena these witnesses—I do not know that Mr. Rumsey Williams is employed by any one to conduct this prosecution.—I am not the agent of Messrs. Flower—I have conducted the prosecution as Mr. Rumsey Williams's clerk—I saw Mr. Jennings in London—I called at his house three times to see him, and talked to hirer in general terms about this business—I dined at Mr. Rumsey Williams's house at Penross in company with Mr. Jennings—but I went home—I was not very well—I went in the same chaise with Mr. Jennings—I do not know who paid Mr. Jennings's expenses of that journey—I met Mr. Jennings at dinner at Mr. Rumsey Williams's on the day after the apprehension of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lithographer and fac-similist to the British Museum. I can see marks on this scrip No. 1—I see a capital "D" here written in pencil; and at the top, under the word "Amen," there are pen<lb></lb>cil-marks—I see the double line of a large letter under the second and third lines—I see double strokes of large letters, but I really cannot at pre<lb></lb>sent distinguish what they are—here is "Map" on the left-hand side of the paper—here is "hopgate-street"—on the right of the paper in the same line here is "Cursitor-street"—I see a double-line ruled transversely, im<lb></lb>mediately under the "s" of "Cursitor"—I do not see any horizontal rul<lb></lb>ing—I see two lines under the word "sirname," but they do not go hori<lb></lb>zontally—here appears to be a line from "my sir name of Panton," running through the word "and," and going through the line—if I turn the paper side<lb></lb>ways, I see some more of that kind of writing, double lines in pencil—it seems to me as though there were a capital "C," and I see a kind of final "t," about four inches from the "C"—under the "C," to the right, before yon get to the double-ruled lines, I see some small mark, which looks like a figure—it looks to me like part of a "6"—I cannot speak to any other figures—a little to the right I see some remains of pencil, apparently a "C" and an "O," but I see it more by the indentation of the paper than any colour of pencil—if it is a "C," it is a capital "C"—about two inches down the paper, to the right-hand from "stock all and singular," runs a line, and under that is a small capital "C," as though the words were small altogether—I see parts of three letters between the "C" and a final "t"—there appears to be room for three letters between them, but I really can<lb></lb>not make them out—I see after the "t" a loop—under that word I see more bits of writing, in large letters, but I really cannot make them out—under the marks I see some ruled lines, and under the lines I see a "1," and a "2" after it—that is to the left of the paper—to the right, on a line with the "1" and "2" I see a "3," and beyond it, two lines—below the "3," and near the words "lastly," and "witness," I see parts of figures, it may be a "1," or part of a "4"—below this appearance of figures I see part of a ruled line running in a line with the word "pictures"—I see some large writing, and above that, near the end of "witness" and the "x" of "six," there appears to be a ruled line on which large writing has been—on the left side of the paper I see there is a long word, but I really cannot distinguish it—I see a long continuity of letters—I do not mean that letters continue all the way—there may be two words—now I see under the writing which appears a continuity of letters the word "ground," and in a</p>

               <p>line with the word "ground" I see a pencil-mark across the word "entitled"—it is a letter which I cannot make out—I observe there are figures or letters—at the end is a "6," or it may be a turn of an "0"—just to the left of the word "eldest" I see a long word, and evidently the word "Court" after it—I can see an "s" near the close of the long word, the last letter but one or two—under that long word I can distinguish two small ruled lines across the word "Wales"—below that is the same kind of writing—here is a capital letter apparently—it is the word "Ground" again, but part of this is not double down-strokes—after I pass that word I see "o t," or "o l," written apparently in a hurry; and here is a large flourish of a letter I cannot make out—under the second word "Ground" I set "Devons;" and there is more writing, but I can scarcely make it out—it contains four letters more apparently, and then another capita—I say it is a capital because it is higher than the others, but I cannot make it out; and there appears a final "t"—under the "D" there appears to me to be a "2" and a "3," very large; and about three inches on the right from the "3" here appears a very large "7," with a "6" before it, after it a very small "8;" and then I see the last sweep of a letter, but I could not swear it was a "9"—the letters are uneven, large and small—the principal parts of what I see are the indentations of pencil lines, and not the lead—the pencil has been rubbed out, and was a very bad pencil, but certainly the pencilling was done before the writing—this is the worst kind of paper to write on—there is no indenture on the ink—(<hi rend="italic">examining scrip No</hi>. 2)—here is evidently, in the middle, the word "Map"—a little below it is a capital "B"—I see the word "Bishopgate-street," and in the same line I see "Cursitor-street" in full.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Turn the paper up, and look if you see any ruled line horizontally along the paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, I observe lines in various direction—under the horizontal line is the word "Cursitor," and under that the word "street" and two lines—along the same line is a capital "C," and some other letters, which I cannot swear to—here is "r t"—I should read it "Cursitor-court."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now take No. 3 into your hand, let me direct your attention to the upper part, about the centre division, and see whether you discern any writing upon that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I observe something immediately under the "No. 3"—I cannot make out the first letter distinctly—there is a capital, and a long tailed letter following—then there is a small "e" following it—then there seems a continuation of larger letters, but I cannot distinguish what they are—I cannot distinguish what the capital letter is—it is a capital "A" or "M," or such letter, with the turn they have—the final letter is very much rubbed, and taken away, but I see a "t," and I should sup<lb></lb>pose a long word before it—I cannot make out more that I should like to swear to—under the capital I discern other writing, but it has been so rubbed and smeared, that I cannot see it—there is considerable quantity of marks of writing, before I come to the writing—above the words "Last will," is a small running-hand capital "D," I should say that is all dirtied over—and then "d," and the first part of an "a"—through the word "Last" there appears to me "the city"—it appears like a good round "C," and "ty"—under the word "added," I can see a stroke, and then a "t," and an "e," but I cannot connect them—under the word "and" there is a letter at first sight, I should say it was a capital "B" at the begin<lb></lb>ning—under the words "on or about," in the second line, here is writing again—under the word "or" there is "at"—under the word "about, there is writing which runs into it, but I cannot make out the letters—under the word "the" there is what would appear double "e," or a scrawl—in the 4th line there has been a great deal of erasure above the word "contained," and under it for some considerable space, and there is pencil writing before the "c" of the word "contain," and that continues on, but whether the commencing letter is a "t," an "1," or a "p," I cannot say; and an "A" it may be, "ga" "la" or "pa"—under the words "Jones Panton" there has evidently been writing rubbed out, but I cannot swear to the letters—under the word "intention," two lines lower, I see a capital "I"—I can very well discern that there are letters following it, but I cannot read them—I see after the "I" there is a com<lb></lb>mination of writing for two inches, and then comes scratching out again—under the words "and singular"—I see between the words "and" and angular 'a capital "D," and it runs up between the writing, "a ted"—here is a long stroke on and above the word, "other," in the same line, but I cannot distinguish any thing further—under the words, "and hereby also confirm," in the last line but two, there is the appearance of writing—and over that has been the word "one"—under the word "and"</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now look at No. 4, I would direct your attention to the words "Codicil to?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This is very much rubbed indeed, but I see the traces of writing—over the word "One" in "One Thousand" in the 7th line I see writing—it appears to be a capital letter—the first part of a stroke, which some persons would make a capital "N"—under the "N" of the "thousand" there appears much such a capital as I saw before, which I should make a "D"—there is a short word following the "D," but that has been written through—it appears a "t," and part of an "o"—I should read it "dot," but it has been very much rubbed—the nap of the paper is completely rubbed off—there appears to have been other pencil writing—under the "d" of the word "housemaid" there has been a very great erasure—it appears as though some long letter had been there—over the "yn" of "Plasgwyn" there has been writing—I see writing over the word "confirm"—under the "s" of "said" I see there has been writing, but it has been so completely rubbed that one part of the grease has got into another—under the words "said" and "mentioned," and between those two words, there are faint marks of writing, but I cannot distinguish to make out what the letters are—above the "sand" in the word "thousand," there has been a long word, which appears to me to have begun from the "t" in "thousand"—there is an "o" over the "S" with a stroke to it—it may be "a," or "q," or "g"—these marks were done before the ink-writing, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at No. 5, begin at the centre of the paper, under the 5? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Here appears a very large part of a capital in the same double-lined writing—it may be an "A" or an "M"—the next letter appears a "G," but I cannot make out exactly what that is—at the left hand corner here is "J.

               <p>

               <p>there is some writing continued to the end, and going down a little, as if there was not room for it—in the word "all," there is a letter through the "o," and a long stroke through the "1"—it might read, "at the"—and through "Plasgwyn," also, there is writing—there is an "a" and what appears like an "f" through the word "Gwyn"—through the words "whoever has" there is an "a," an "n," another "n" or an "m"—there is writing also in the next line, under the words "the" and "An<lb></lb>glesey," but I can only see the tops of letters—I think I can make out an "a" there, and the others may be "I's" or "t's"—they are long letters—under the word "property" I do not see any thing but erasures—lower down, under the words "all the rents," there is evidently the word "cove<lb></lb>Dante"—through the word "law," I can see pencil marks—a long stroke, which may do for "f" or "t"—I can see distinctly "and" written through and under the words "my will"—there are letters before it, and after the word "which" I see an "x" distinctly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Look at the words which precede the x attentively? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Here is "six" after the word "and," and before the "s" I can see a "t y," writ<lb></lb>ten up and down in a careless way—now I look at the marks preceding the "ty" I see it is "thirty"—! now read the words "And thirty-six"—in the line immediately above that the last words are, "To draw," and through these words there are long and short strokes—but I really cannot tell what they are—there is "th" and some others—the words "And thirty-six" are apart from each other, and a little downward—that is not the case with the rest of the writing, generally speaking—the lines are more regular than that happens to be—there is a little inclination in the line under "Griffith Panton," but not equal to this—that is not in a straight line, but this is very much out—I cannot trace any thing after the letter "x" in the word "Six."</p>

I remember the Sunday before Whitsunday last year—on the morning of that day my masterwas at Brynbras—we left Brynbras on that morning in an open phaeton—I drove him to Plasgwyn—nothing happened to us on the road—there is—an iron gate near Plasgwyn, near a door—the iron gate is close to the road—it leads up to the front of the house—when the carriage got to the iron gate, Mr. Thomas Williams alighted down, and went to the front—I saw him—I alighted myself to hold the horse's head while he got down—I went to Rhuulas—that is the residence of Mr. Gitten Williams, the prisoner's brother—I took the phaeton there—I saw Mr. Thomas Williams at Rhuulas, be<lb></lb>tween two and three o'clock—we stopped there till the evening, and then went home to Brynbras—I saw Mr. Barton Panton on the road that day, a considerable number of miles from home, and about twelve miles or there<lb></lb>about from Plasgwyn—he met us at Clay-lane, about a mile or so from a bridge called Port Rig, between ten and eleven o'clock, as we were going from Brynbras to Plasgwyn—Mr. Bettis and Mr. Price were with him—Mr. Thomas Williams spoke to one of them—I do not know which—they answered him—that place is on the road either to Carnarvon or Penross—I recol<lb></lb>lect Whit-Monday—My master and I left Brynbras that morning, and went to Plasgwyn—I drove the phaeton on that occasion—the phaeton drove up to Plasgwyn—we went to the iron gate, as we always used to go—I cannot say How long Mr. Williams remained there—he came in the evening, as usual, to Rhuluas—he and I returned that evening from Rhuluas to Brynbras—I saw my master alight at the iron gate at Plasgwyn, and go through the gate towards the front door.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of the late Mr. Jones Panton, for nearly nine years, down to the time of his death, as upper-house maid—I occasionally attended upon him—there was no other servant that attended upon him more than myself—he was as kind to me as a master ought to be—he has often said I should not be a loser by his death, many times—he said that about a month or three weeks before his death—I used to rub his legs every night, they swelled very much—he made use of that experssion often—on Thursday he was taken poorly, he was worse on Sunday; he had complained of a cold on Thursday, but went out that day; he was very ill on Whit-Sunday—I saw Mr. Thomas Williams at Plasgwyn a few days before that, Thursday, in the hall, going across the blue parlour—I cannot tell what day of the week it was—the blue parlour is on the ground-floor—my master received people who came to see him there—he did business there—the pen, ink, and paper, were always kept there—Mrs. Barton Panton was up in the nursery when he first came in—I saw no more of him, except going through the hall towards the blue parlour—I saw him well—I can positively swear I saw him on that occasion—I cannot exactly tell what time of the day it was—I saw Mr. Thomas Willams again at Plasgwyn before Mr. Panton died, that was on Whitsuntids Monday—I had seen him go across the hall a few days before master was taken ill—he was taken ill on the Thursday before Whit-Sunday—Mrs. Williams was along with him on Whit-Monday—I saw them both—I can<lb></lb>not say the hour—I cannot say where they went to from Plasgwyn—they saw Mr. Panton on the Whit-Monday—I was not present—they did not go up to his bed-room, he was in the blue parlour—he did not keep his bed at all for the whole day, before he died—I saw Mrs. Williams there again—I do not recollect seeing Mr. Williams—I do not recollect seeing her there on any day before his death, but on the 24th—I have seen Mrs. Williams and Mr. Panton together often—it appeared to me that he was very fond of her—he used to go and visit Mr. and Mrs. Williams often twice a-year.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you give us any notion about what time of the day it was you saw Mr. Williams at your master's house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say what time—Mr. Panton generally dined from a quarter to twenty minutes past five o'clock—I cannot tell whether it was before dinner or after—I beg pardon, I made a mistake—it was before my master's dinner, but I cannot say How long—I cannot say who let him in then, or on Whit-Monday—it was a few days before my master was ill on Thursday, that Mr. Thomas Williams came to Plasgwyn—that was the day I saw him going across the hall—I do not remember seeing his little chaise it the door—Mr. and Mrs. Williams came on Whit-Monday in their pony-car<lb></lb>riage—they drove up to the door, I was told—I cannot tell what time they came, nor How long they staid, nor who let them in, nor who let them out</p>

               <p>—I do not know where Doctors' Commons is—I was examined in London within this fortnight—Hugh Thomas, the butler, generally lets people in and out—Richard did so very seldom—I did not speak to Mr. Thomas Wil<lb></lb>liams, as I saw him crossing the hall—he did not see me—I was crossing the best stairs—I did not hear a doable knock at the door, nor a loud knock or a ring, just before I saw him—the hall-door is sometimes shut and sometimes not—I cannot say particularly whether it was shut on Whit-Monday, when my master was ill—my master always behaved like a gen<lb></lb>tleman to Mrs. Barton Panton—I cannot say whether he was very fond of her—I cannot say whether he was cross when he was ill, and could not bear the sight of the child—I never saw him take it on his knees—I cannot say that he was particularly fond of it—I did not give my master his medi<lb></lb>cine—sometimes Pritchard did, sometimes Henry Brereton—I never gave any—I was not often present when medicine was given to him—he very often told me I should not be a loser by him—no one here ever heard him say so—I have been nearly nine yean in the service altogether—I lived with him about two years before he mentioned that at all—and he fre<lb></lb>quently told me so for the last six or seven years—when I first went he was so bad as to require his legs to be rubbed—the last time he said I should not be a loser, was three weeks or a month before his death—I have never said since his death that I did not expect he would leave me a legacy.</p>

ATTORNEY GENERAL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Used there to be any person present when you rubbed your master's legs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was upon those occa<lb></lb>sions he used to say I should not be a loser by him—at Plasgwyn the front door was sometimes open, or ajar, so that a person could come in without ringing or knocking—I was subpoenaed on the part of the prosecutor as well at the prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner about thirteen yards from the prosecutor's - he and another man were carrying the tub of butter; they let it fall and ran away when they saw me - I ran, and took the prisoner about three quarters of a mile from the place- I know he is one of the persons; he had some butter on his hands and on his hat; there were 90 lbs. of butter in the tub.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take the butter? A. No - I saw you both carrying it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw a person with a firkin of butter on his shoulder - he let it fall, and I picked up part of it; I then went to the top of the street, and the officer took me as I was standing there.</p>

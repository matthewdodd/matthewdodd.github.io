                  </hi>. I am clerk at Westminster Police Court—I was present when the prisoner was brought up on a charge of stealing the child on Saturday, May 2nd—Mrs. Scrivener, Miss Stewart, Dent, Sparville, Mrs. Ireland, and Sherlock were examined, after which the prisoner made a state<lb></lb>ment, and' she was remanded for that day—the evidence not being comp<lb></lb>leted, she was not cautioned on that occasion—it was only a remand; the evidence had not all been given, but the Magistrate asked her if she wished to say anything, and then she made this statement—I took it down in writing to a particular point, and then the Magistrate said "You have said nothing about the child"—she then made a further statement, which I took down in writing—it was after that she was remanded on the charge of stealing the child till the following Friday—I have got my note-book here.</p>

I told her I was tired, and asked to be let sit down awhile. When I came back she said 'For gracious sake, go back with the child; I've met Mrs. Scrivener, and she's got a letter, and is going to put it in the hands of the police.' Before she went out, I said 'Don't let them know I'm here.' I decline saying anything' about the child. Me and my son</p>

                  </hi>. I have one partner—we live in Ashby-street, Clerk-enwell—the prisoner was my apprentice—on the 25th of May, we looked into his box at dinner time, seeing what gold he had, and saw something like 14dwts. of gold cuttings—in the afternoon we asked for his cuttings, and said we wanted to melt them up—he gave up 3dwts. twenty odd grains, and said that was all he had—when he left at night the boxes were all brought in—the foreman asked me to look into the prisoner's box to see if these cuttings were there—they were not—I told him to look into his drawer, and they were not there—I watched the prisoner out, and said, "John, I want you; where are those cuttings out of your box?"—he said, "I have got no cuttings"—I said, "You may as well tell the truth, and pull them out of your pocket"—he said he had none—I called the foreman—he said, "Where are the cuttings?" and he pulled out this tin box, with the cuttings in it weighing 1oz. 11dwts. 12grs.—they had no business in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Yes—I had no premium with him—he was turned over from a brother of mine till he is twenty-one—we always weigh out the gold, and weigh it again, so that we know what we use—I never charged him with robbing us before—I said it would be better to tell the truth, either before or after the foreman came in.</p>

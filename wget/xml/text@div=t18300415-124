               <p>MR. WHITTINGHAM. The prisoner lived with Mr. Stokes, next door to me; I missed property, and on the 19th of February I went with the officer, and was present when the prisoner's room was searched; under his pillow was a pistol loaded with bullets, and in his box two pairs of gaiters and a black velvet waistcoat, which are mine, and in the pocket a set of buttons, which I am quite positive are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it was his bed-room? A. He was there, and his master said in his presence that it was; he did not contradict it - Lancashire slept at my place; how the property got away I cannot tell.</p>

            . I accompanied the prosecutor, and saw the prisoner in the shop - I went up to his bedroom with him; his master pointed it out - I found these things in his box; I asked whose they were - he said they were his own; that he had the gaiters from his mother.</p>
               <p>Mr. WHITTINGHAM. I am positive these articles are mine, but cannot state when they were safe; they were never sold.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How can you tell that? A. By my books. My foreman and the boy occasionally serve; if they sold them they ought to account for them - I have no private mark on this waistcoat; I missed one - I had had three or four like it, and I know these buttons which are in the pocket.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How can you undertake to identify the buttons? A. Only from having some similar. I will not swear the waistcoat has not been sold; we sometimes sell buttons - I know the gaiters, and they are wanting in the stock; they have not been worn - I can swear to my workman's work; I believe he works for no other people.</p>

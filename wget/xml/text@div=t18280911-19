On a Wednesday in July, about nine o'clock in the morning, I bought some provisions, and was going home with them; and in Whitecross-street I was taken suddenly ill; the prisoner Smith came up and said, "You seem very poorly, you had better go in with me and have a cup of tea as I only live next door;" I was standing against the wall, with my head on my hand; I had taken one glass of gin to make me better, but it did me no good - I went with her all the way down Glos'ter-court and Chequer-alley, into a house, where I found Booth making tea; Smith said go and sit down; she sat between me and the door. Thetford got out of bed, and said, she never laid in bed but when there was nothing to be done, but she saw there was some business to do to-day - she got out of bed; she was not dressed - she snatched my basket out of my hand; I said "Ayn't I to have my basket?" she said "The basket is not your's, 't is mine, and all that is in it;" she told Smith to keep the door shut, and put her foot against it; when she saw what was in the basket, she said "There is not enough here to buy us gin enough;" one of them then took my shawl off, and then I missed Booth out of the room; I begged of them to let me go, and I would not molest them, as they said if I made a noise they would smother me; they said "There was something else they wanted;" I said I had nothing more; they asked me to unpin my gown - I began to be frightened, and said I could not go without my gown - one took me by one arm, and the other by the other, and told me to take it off quietly, or have it done, for it would be best for me, as that was their business, and they would have it, or would smother me; they took it off - I lost my senses; when I came to myself, my boots were taken off; also my bonnet, my handkerchief from my neck, and another from my head; I said "Now you have got all my clothes; if you will let me go, I have only got my stays and petticoat, I will go as I am;" they said "You will go home, but not yet; you shall go home if you are quiet;" I burst out crying, and they told me to go and lay down, and I should be better; I laid down somewhere in a corner - I do not know whether it was on a bed, for I was so ill. and hardly in my senses; when I came to myself, I asked Booth where my clothes were gone; she said as she was going to market, two strange women took them from her; I remained there till five o'clock at night, from nine in the morning, I was so frightened - I had no refreshment; at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110022"></xptr>five o'clock, Booth put me on an old bonnet without a crown, and an old coat to cover my nakedness; she called it her coat, and got a man to help to assist me home to my husband - I was not able to walk, for I had been sadly treated; Booth found the man by the way, and asked him to assist me home, and she went with me to my husband, and told him, "Here is your wife, who I fetched out of the street from a pack of boys who were ill-using her;" my husband laid hold of me; I could neither stand nor speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say she had brought you home drunk? A. I do not recollect; she asked for her coat; my husband told her to stop, as he should like to know where she fetched me from; she stopped; he shut the door, and left somebody there while he fetched an officer; Booth was outside the door - she and the officer went together to her place with my husband; I remained at home, and was not out of bed for two days from their ill-treatment - they dragged and pulled me about in a very shameful manner.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the Monday after this happened, the prosecutrix came to my next door neighbour, who is a grocer - he came to me; I requested the prosecutrix to come into my shop, and she then said she had been robbed by three women, and illused; in consequence of what she said, I told her to go out and I would follow, and told her to look into the person's face well as she went down the street, and stand before any one she could point out, till I came up; she was not out long before she stood before Booth, who was selling fruit in the street, and said that was one of the women - I immediately took her - Thetford was standing by her; I observed her drop her head, and turn round - I took particular notice of her face, and know her again; I saw her in Chequer-alley some days after, and took her; on the way to the watch-house, I said "Where do you lodge?" she said "Where do I lodge;" I asked her twice, and she gave me the same answer, but the third time she told me - I went by her direction, but she never lodged there; I returned to the watch-house, and said "Where did you say you lodged?" she said I was to go to Mrs. Timms, in Ball's-yard, Golden-lane, and she would take me to Mrs. Ellis, where she lodged, as she had said before; I afterwards found she lodged with Booth. When I apprehended her, I sent for the prosecutrix, who said she was the woman who jumped out of bed, and took her basket; I was in pursuit of the other prisoner some time; she was taken on another charge; I looked for her in consequence of the prosecutrix's description of her person: and the prosecutrix saw her locked in the same cell with four other women; she was calling for a light for her pipe when the prosecutrix entered, and said "Oh! that is the woman by her voice;" and when I fetched her out, she said she was the woman; Smith said "Yes, I know you;" I searched the house four or five days after the robbery, but found nothing.</p>

            . I was in Richardson's shop when the prosecutrix came in; I followed them, and when she pointed out Booth, she exclaimed, "Oh! my - I did not do anything to you - I did not ill-use you;" the prosecutrix said, "No, but it was in your place it was done;" I was left in charge of Booth while the officer went to search her place: Thetford stood by her and said "I am sure Booth knows nothing about it" - I said, "Why you must know something about it - you must be an accessary;" she said "Oh! my - I was not up till eleven o'clock - was I Booth?" Booth made no reply: Thetford was not taken for two or three days, and then the prosecutrix identified her as having taken her basket, and when Smith was taken she identified her - Smith said, "I know you - I know you;" and began to make some frivolous excuse, which I cannot recollect. I was once a watchman of White cross-street - I know the prisoners well.</p>
               <p>PROSECUTRIX. My husband is not here; the man who walked home with me is in custody for felony - I have not found my things; I went to complain to Richardson on the Monday after it happened, which was Wednesday.</p>

            . I saw the prosecutrix at the Green Man wine-vaults, in White cross-street, very much intoxicated - it was about the 26th of June, I think, and about eleven o'clock in the morning; I begged her to go home, and said to the landlady, "My heart alive, that gentlewoman has got quite top-heavy;" there was nobody with her; she was dressed in a dark gown, and dark shawl - I did not observe any basket; she was leaning on a cask by the side of the door: it was in June, and about eleven o'clock, when I remarked about her being drunk - the woman said she had but one glass there. My husband is a jobbing gardener, and lives in White cross-street; I know the prisoners by seeing them sell fruit in the street - I have known one of them ten years by sight, and have seen the other in the street with fruit; I know nothing of Smith: the prosecutrix left the prisoner about eleven o'clock - she had been there from nine in the morning, as the landlady told me; she is not here.</p>

I was subpoenaed this morning by the husband of the woman - I was sent for by the prosecutrix's husband to see if I could find anything, and when I got to the house, I saw this good lady sitting down in the passage - Booth stood at the door; I asked the prosecutrix if she should know the woman if she saw her; she nodded her head - I said, "Do you think this is the woman?" she nodded to say Yes - I did not know what to do about taking her; the husband said it would be a great deal of trouble, and he would have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that Booth was at the door when the prosecutrix was brought home? A. Yes; Booth took me to her own house, and said she knew nothing at all about it - she gave no account of the matter.</p>

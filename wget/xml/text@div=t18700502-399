                  </hi>. I live at 36, Canal Road, Shoreditch, and am sister to the prisoner, and widow of the deceased James Rutter—on Saturday evening, 12th March—the prisoner came to my mother's house, 36, Canal Road, about 9 o'clock—my mother and I were in the room when he came in; he had been drinking; he was talking to mother about money affairs, and was about to pay her some money—I interfered, and he said something to me about paying my way, and got into a temper, and so did I—some angry words passed between us, and I struck him, and said if he did not be quiet I would fetch my husband—I went out to look for him, but he was up<lb></lb>stairs the whole of the time; when I came back he was standing at the door—I did not say anything to him about the quarrel—he saw that I had been crying—he went to a <hi rend="italic">lead</hi>, at the Ship, in Bacon Street—the prisoner left the house—I went out some few minutes afterwards, and at the top of Bacon Street, I saw my husband and the prisoner—I heard my husband say some words when they met on the steps of the public-house, I can't say what the words were, and I saw him strike the prisoner, and he followed him across the road, and there he knocked him down on his knees—my husband was rather a bigger man than the prisoner—I ran towards them—while the prisoner was on his knees he said "Jim, if I have done anything wrong, listen to what I have to say?"—upon that my husband made use of bad language, and said he would listen to nothing, and hit him again</p>

               <p>when he was on his knees, with his fist—the prisoner got up, and went across the road, to get out of his way, and my husband followed him, and hit him again; that was the third time—and on that I saw the prisoner strike my husband—he said he was stabbed, and went into the public-house—I don't know what became of the prisoner—I afterwards went into the public-house and saw my husband; he said he had been stabbed, and put his hand up to his chest—I did not see any blood—he was laid down, and afterwards taken off to the doctor's—shortly afterwards I saw him dead.</p>

I am a wood-chopper, and live at 3, York Road—about 4 o'clock in the afternoon of 12th March, I was with the prisoner—I came out of the yard with him—I work with him in Wharf Road—I went with him to his mother's house a little after 9 o'clock—I was with him from 4 till 9 o'clock—we had been drinking—there was a quarrel between him and his sister—I saw the prisoner go to the cupboard—I can't tell what he did there—after that we went out together to go to a public-house—we in<lb></lb>stended to go to the <hi rend="italic">lead</hi>—on our way we saw Joseph Rutter and his brother, and to avoid them we went into a shop—when we came out we saw them again in a fish shop, we went past them and missed them as they were going down Hoxton—we afterwards saw them in front of the bar of the Ship public-house, in Bacon Street—as soon as we got to the public-house, we stopped sudden, outside, we did not like to go in—Rutter came out and struck the prisoner a violent blow, he staggered across the road and Rutter struck him again, followed him up, he fell down, the second blow sent him down—when he was on the ground he said "Hold hard, Jim, let me have one word, hear reason"—Rutter replied "Get up and fight!"—the prisoner replied "No, Jim, you are too good a man for me"—he then got up and ran across the road—Rutter ran after him and hit him another blow, and knocked his head up against the wall—on that I saw the prisoner retaliate the blow, I mean, he struck him, I can't tell with what, I did not see any<lb></lb>thing—Rutter put his hand to his chest and said "I've been stabbed," and he staggered into the public-house—he remained there a short time and came out again and fell—the prisoner was standing in the middle of the road—he came up to me and got his cap and said "I must go, I think I have killed my brother-in-law," and he went away, walking rather sharp—before we met Rutter, the prisoner said "I wish I had a white-handled knife that is at home, I would stab him; I have frightened him before with a poker."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Rutter was a much stronger man than the prisoner, was he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; and taller—when we first saw Rutter, the prisoner suggested we should get out of his way—the third blow Rutter struck knocked the prisoner's head against the wall, he could not get any further back—he struck him in the face with his clenched fist—it was immediately after that, that the prisoner struck him.</p>

I stepped against a wall for a certain occasion of necessity; the prisoner came up against me, and said, how do you do, my dear; I said, what is it to you. She kept close by my side, and took my watch. I did not feel my watch go from me. When I felt for my chain, I missed it. She went away, and said, I am York over you. She is a Yorkshire woman. When I missed my watch, I then understood what she meaned. I pursued her; it was quite dark. The watchman took me to Blue Anchor-yard; there we found the prisoner; we took her to the watch-house. No property was found on her. The watchman took the prisoner out of the watchhouse to search her apartment. In about a quarter of an hour, the watchman returned with my watch, and gave it to the constable. I described my watch to the constable; he said, he was satisfied. The watch was then produced; it was my watch.</p>

            . I am a watchman, in the parish of St. John's, Wapping. On Saturday, the 23rd of April, the prosecutor came and told me he had been robbed. I took him to Blue Anchor yard; there we found the prisoner. We took her to the watchhouse. She was searched; no property was found on her. She took me to her lodgings, and acknowledged taking the watch. She took me up two pair of stairs; there were two children in bed. She said to the children, give me that article. One of the children put her hand under the bed, took out the watch, and gave it to the prisoner. This is the watch I took from the prisoner.</p>

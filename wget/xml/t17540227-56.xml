             was not at home, and my mistress was out crying old cloaths, and no body in the house but my mistress's young child, about a year and half old, the prisoner, and I, the child was asleep on the bed. The prisoner called me down to fetch a pint of beer; I fetched it, and put it on the table in his room; then he took hold on my shoulder, and flung me down on the bed, and put his hand to my mouth, so that I could not speak, or hardly breathe, he pulled up my petticoats, and unbuttoned his breeches, and put what he had in his breeches into me where I make water, and I felt something come from him wet, and it hurt me there sadly. I struggled to get away, and strove to call out but could not.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>A. Barnard. I cannot tell the day of the week, it was about a week after Christmas last, I told no body of it the first time, but I was sore, and grew worse and worse, so that I could hardly walk upright; he served me so again about a week and two or three days after this, when they were all out, I think that time was on a Thursday or Friday. He got me to fetch him a pint of small beer, which I did, and put it on the table, and I was got about half way up stairs, when he pulled me down, and flung me on the bed, and served me as before, only he did not stop my breath, and he did not hurt quite so much; something came from him wet in my body, quite warm, that within me I did not know what it was, but it felt like flesh. He lay on me about a quarter of an hour the first time, and not quite so long the second, and said if I told my mistress or any body else, he would cut my throat.</p>
               <p>This was the substance of her many broken answers to many questions put to her, as to the fact.</p>
               <p>She farther said, that the first person she told of it was

             came into our room, and desired us to make it up; they proffered to pay the doctor, and for the girl's loss of time, and they would let her lie in their bed: the prisoner put his hands together, and said Jemmy, Jemmy, I am undone, for I was in liquor when I did it, and did not know what I did. He also begged of us, if we did get a warrant for him, not to take him up when he was on duty, (he is a soldier) but in the dead of the night. My husband went and acquainted the girl's friends with it, and she was put into the workhouse: After this she told me of the second time he lay with her, and that he said he would stick her with a knife if she told me or any body else of it. I remember the child's shift was yellow, and of an ugly colour. About nine days before I knew what had happened, I asked the girl what was the matter with her, but she made no answer; I thought it had been her petticoats that had cut her side, and so it past off.</p>

               <p>E. Rickets. Her linen was as other women's were when they lose their maidenheads. That is all she said to me. She did not complain of any force. [Here the witnesses prevaricated; first, she said, the child said, he had ruined her; then she denied she said such a word, and that she laughed, and did not cry, when she told her.] The girl is a very impudent girl in playing with boys and pulling men by the cloaths.

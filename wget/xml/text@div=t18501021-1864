                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. John Spooner, a coach<lb></lb>maker, of 4, Cannon-place, Whitechapel. On 18th Oct. the boy Fox was in our service—I left the premises that day about half-past four o'clock to go to tea, and when I returned at five Fox was gone, and I missed this axletree—cap and two nuts (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I sent two men after Fox, he was brought back, and in consequence of what he told me I went to the prisoner's house—he keeps a marine-store shop—I asked whether he had bought any brass—he said he had—I asked him to let me look at it, and be gave them to me from off a box by the side of the counter—I asked what he had paid for them—he said 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "I will give you the 4<hi rend="italic">d."</hi>—he said, "No; you have lost enough already, I will be at the loss of them"—these things would not be of any use to any one without the axletree—they are worth 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound as old brass—if we had got to replace them they would cost 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—all of them have been used—they are Mr. Spooner's property.</p>

BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe Fox bad only been a few hours in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he only came about ten or eleven o'clock—the prisoner was very well acquainted with my master, but Fox would be unknown to him—my master has known the prisoner these twenty years, and considers him a perfectly honest man—this cap is broken, that would destroy its value—I went with Fox to the prisoner, and I asked how he came to bring them there, and asked the prisoner what he had said when he came—he said, "He told me his father had sent him, and he lived in Northampton-street, and that his father was very ill, and wanted the money immediately"—Fox admitted that—the prisoner then turned round to him, and said, "You young vagabond, how dared you tell me this?"</p>

                  </hi>. I went to work at Mr. Spooner's on 18th Oct.—I left between four and five o'clock—I took with me this brass cap and two brass nuts, and went and sold them to the prisoner—I had gone to two marine-store dealers before I went to him, but did not sell them there—when I went to the prisoner I put them in the scale, his wife was there, and he fetched her out—he asked me who sent them, and I said my father—that was what he said to me—nothing else passed—he looked at them, and gave me a fourpenny <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> for them—they were in the same state they are now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> But they were not in that state when you stole them, were they? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; they were complete then—I tried to sell them at two places in that state, but they would not buy them, and I then broke them up and took them to the prisoner—I thought he would not buy them if I did not break them—I spent the 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I forget what I bought with it.</p>

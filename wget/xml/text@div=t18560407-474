                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Francis Roman, as shoe manufacturers, at No. 25, Skinner-street. The prisoner has been in our employment six years—he was the head of the women's rough stuff depart<lb></lb>ment—it was his duty to superintend the preparation of the soles of women's shoes—he had nothing to do with any of the other work—he had no right to take any portion of the property away—on 16th March we gave him into custody—we had only known for three or four weeks of his carrying on business on his own account, and then we at once set officers to work—after he was given into custody, on 6th March, I went to his premises—some goods had been produced to me by an officer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot maker, of No. 22, Cleveland-street, Fitzroy-square. I have bought boots and shoes at different times of the prisoner—I bought these three pairs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of him, but cannot say whether at the same time—he represented himself to me as a chamber master—I bought from fifteen to twenty pairs of him—the last time was, I think, about 25th Feb.—I am sure these pairs are three of the pairs I bought of him—I did not know that he was in Mr. Homan's employment.</p>

Homan have claimed of me—there are similar patterns in almost all houses, I do not know that they are peculiar—I have dealt with the prisoner about eight months—he used to come with a basket on his back, and offer them to me for sale—he had a general assortment of goods, and I used to look out from three to six pairs a week, for eight months, as I wanted the sizes of them—he always gave an invoice in his own name—I went once to his house for goods—I do not know how many pairs, which I had purchased of the prisoner, were there when Messrs. Homan came to look over my stock—chamber master's wives and daughters throw their own work in and assist them in binding—I have given the prisoner orders, which he has executed.</p>

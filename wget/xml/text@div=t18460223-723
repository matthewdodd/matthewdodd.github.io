                  </hi>. I live in Grange-walk, Bermondsey—on the night of the 15th of Feb. I was crossing Tower-hill—the prisoner came up to me and said, "Here, young man, I want to speak to you"—I did not say anything—I went on—she came again, caught hold of my arm, and put her hand into my waistcoat-pocket, where I had half-a-crown and a penny—she said, "Are you coming home with me for to-night"—I said, "I don't want anything to say to you"—she ran away to a gin-shop—I put my hand into my pocket, and my half-crown was gone—I ran after her into the gin-shop—she was there, pour<lb></lb>ing something out of a measure, and there were two or three girls round the bar—I called for the policeman—the prisoner ran out of the other door, and another girl with her—I came out—she ran back again, and the other girl stopped me, and said, "Here, young man, come to me, I will tell you all about it: she has not got your half-crown"—I said, "I never said a word about a half-crown"—I put her aside, and ran and caught the prisoner—I gave her to the policeman—she said she would give me half-a-crown and the handkerchief off her neck if I would let her go—I am sure I had the half-crown in my pocket.</p>

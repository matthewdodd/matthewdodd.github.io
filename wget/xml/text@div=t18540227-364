                  </hi>. I am agent for the Patent Wadding Com<lb></lb>pany. The name of the firm is William Bates, jun, and Co.—they have three establishments; one at Walworth, one in Knight Rider-street, and one at Manchester—the prisoner came into my service on 5th Oct. last—he had previously been in my service—he was a junior clerk—he occasion<lb></lb>ally collected orders—he had authority to collect money—he was to account for it to my brother Henry, or to Mr. Butler, the manager—there was no one else to whom he could have accounted—he left my service on 27th Oct. of his own accord—he had not given me any notice—we did not find this out till the 28th—I know his handwriting (<hi rend="italic">looking at the bill</hi>)—I see his writing on this bill—there is no date to it—the words "H. N. Overton <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> W. W. Co." are the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">this being read, was made out to Messrs. Hitchcock and Co. as debtors to Walworth Wadding Company, for goods supplied</hi>, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">discount</hi>, 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">total</hi>, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Paid H. N. Overton, pro W. W. Co.</hi>)—the "W. W. Co" stands for Walworth Wadding Company"—after he went away, on the 27th, he was apprehended—I afterwards saw him in Newgate; that was at his own request—I made no promise to him, or held out any threat—that was before his last trial—he said he wanted to see me, to ask me to be as lenient as possible to him on the trial—I cannot remember the exact words he made' use of—the substance of it was, "Will you do all you can to get me off?"—I asked him whether he had received any other accounts—he said he had—he gave me the particulars of them, which I took down at the time—the amount in question is among them—I have got it down, "Hitohcocks, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he told me that he had received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Hitohcocks'; he also said he had received 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Ensoll—he did not say what he had done with the money—I asked him what amount he had received—he hesitated some time, but he eventually gave me the amounts—he stated that he had been in bad company, and that was the cause of his having taken the money—he stated who the bad company was—he named the person—he said he had been with one of our men, that he had led him astray, and that he had appropriated the moneys which really belonged to us to his own purposes—I am quite sure he told me that—he never accounted to me for the money.</p>

               <p>studiously avoided it—the statement he made to me in Newgate was perfectly voluntary—he has been tried before, not on one of these cases, but upon a case that he mentioned to me—he was convicted, and relieved on a point of law—if he had not applied for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would not have been again prosecuted—he is not married—when I speak of his family, I mean his mother and brother—he does not support them, nor does he contribute to their support.</p>

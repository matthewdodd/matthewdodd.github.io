            . I am a dealer in potatoes, and live in Oxford-street. There was a large quantity of potatoes consigned to me by Mr. Rogers, and on the Sunday he directed me to search the barges after they were unloaded - they were unloaded on the 31st of October; Brandram then had the care of the barges - his master and I went and examined them; we went into the cabin of one barge, and found a quantity of potatoes in a drawer - they were similar to those I had received; there were about 2 cwt. or 2 1/2 cwt. found altogether, and about 2 cwt. of them I can swear to - Mr. Gore lifted up a seat in the cabin, which formed a sort of locker, and found a quantity of potatoes in a sack, marked with Mr. Rogers' name, and Iver on it; we found in the forehold about 1 1/2cwt. in a sack, marked Lovegrove, of Reading - I have no doubt that they were all of the same sort and quality as mine, and the soil which clung to them appeared the same- there was another man in the other boat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Do you know which boat Brandram went in? A. He was on board the one in which the potatoes were found.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did he say any thing about them? A. He said he bought them of a man; Mr. Gore and myself both asked whose man it was - he said one of Mr. Rogers' men.</p>

I apprehended Brandram; what has been stated is correct: I produce the potatoes, which Brandram said he bought of one of Mr. Rogers' servants, but he did not know what he gave, as he was drunk at the time - I saw the potatoes found; they appeared to me to be stowed away with care.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Were you sober? A. Yes, I was pretty near; I had been working in the fields sometimes, and sometimes in the barges - I did not go to the cabin, nor carry any potatoes; I did not attend before the Magistrate, but a person did who is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carman to Messrs. Green and Clark, wharfingers. I have known the prisoner five or six years—I employed him to help me to unload my wagon, and gave him 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and part of his victuals—I paid him with my own money—on the 26th of October, about five or six o'clock in the evening, I told him to go to Mrs. Edwards's, of King's-cross, with five sacks of flour, and to bring back the money, 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or the flour—I thought he was a long while gone—at last I went to look after him—he had taken the horse and cart and five sacks of flour with him—I left him with them by Barclay's brewhoase—I saw the hone and cart about ten the same night, in the Borough-market, by itself—I did not we the prisoner again till he was in custody—I then said to him, "Good morning to you, you are quite a stranger"—I did not tell him it would be better for him if he told me any thing, or worse if he did not—he said a harness-maker down the Kent-road had persuaded him to keep the money, and that the harness maker was looking through a beer-shop win<lb></lb>dow at the time—he asked me if I knew the harness-maker—I said I had seen him—I had seen him the same night the prisoner went away—next morning I went to the harness-maker's with a policeman.</p>

Clark and Green's service three years—the prisoner was known to them before that—he was never employed by them to my knowledge, only by me—I sent him to Mrs. Edwards's with the flour, because I was rather poorly—we were in the Borough-market when I told him to take it, as I had the cart and flour with me—I was to have gone to Mrs. Edwards's myself, but I went home</p>

               <p>—I had a pot of beer with the prisoner, and gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the beer did not affect me—I had taken nothing else—I had not been well for a month or six weeks—if he had received the money and paid it to Clark and Green that would have been sufficient, but I was his master, and I have to give it to them—I gave the prisoner a delivery-note to give to Mrs. Edwards—I received that delivery-note from Clark and Green—I told them the prisoner had not given me the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Edwards, a baker, in Vernon's-buildings, St. Pancras. On the 26th of October, some flour was brought to me by a young man—I cannot say it was the prisoner—it was a much younger person than generally came—I had never seen the person before—he looks better than he did then, if he is the person—he brought me a note with the flour—it was written on the back that he was to take the money back with him, and I paid him 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he wrote on the note, "Received 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., John Cook"—I put it on my file, after<lb></lb>wards took it to Union-hall, and have since lost it—I have looked for it every where.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect whether the name of Green and Clark was on the note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it was—I have plenty of their notes—I only saw one person—I did not notice any one else come in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Wednesday morning, the 2nd of February, I was on duty in the London-road—the prisoner came up to me and said he wanted to give himself up—I said, "What for?"—he said for stealing 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that he was intrusted by Cook <hi rend="italic">to</hi> deliver fire sacks of flour at a baker's shop over against King's-cross, Battle-bridge, that he had received 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and absconded, that he turned the horse and cart adrift—he said he was induced to do it by some harness-maker of the name of Hand fast, I believe, that he had given him a part of the money, and had spent the remainder—I said, "Recollect what you tell me, I shall have to state against you before the Magistrate"—he said "I have only told you the truth; you will find it is the truth; I have been to Bristol; I have done no work since; I am in a state of starvation; I I might as well be transported as be out of work, starving about the streets."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You recollect his saying he had spent some of the money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he said the harness-maker induced him <hi rend="italic">to</hi> keep the money, and he had given 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the harness-maker—I did not take particular notice of the word "spent"—I will not be certain that he used the word "absconded," but he said he went away, and had spent all the money except what he had given the harness-maker.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner received a good character.)</p>

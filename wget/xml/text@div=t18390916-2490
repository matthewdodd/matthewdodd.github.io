                  </hi>. I live in Upper York-street, and am single. On the evening of the 2nd of September, a little boy, five years old, who was with me, had a bundle containing the articles stated, which I was going to take to the Western railroad—the bundle was lost between Fisher-street and Praed-street—I afterwards went to a house in Pearsall-street, and saw the prisoner Molton—I asked him for the bundle—he said he had picked it up, but had not got it, a little boy had fetched it.</p>

I am the wife of Joseph Halford—on the evening of the 2nd of September, between six and seven o'clock, I was going down Praed-street, and saw something white at a distance—I came up to it—it was a small bundle—I was going to take it up, when Molton said, "Hey, Mrs., that is mine, I dropped it"—a white necklace fell out of it, which he took up, and put in again, and ran across the road with the bundle—be went into No. 9, Pearsall-street—I went on and met the two children (the prosecutrix and the little boy)—I took them to the house that Molton went into—I saw a woman there—I asked her where the man was who came in with a bundle—she said there was no man in the house but her husband—she made Use of very low words, and was going to strike me—I was going away, when a person came down stairs, and said, there was a person in the water-closet—I waited, and Molton came out—I asked him where the bundle was that he had picked up—he said, a little boy had fetched it.</p>

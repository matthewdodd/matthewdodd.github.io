            . I am in the prosecutor's employ. On the 23rd of November I saw the prisoner take one pair of shoes from one of the cases, and put them in his bag; I said nothing to him but told the street-keeper in about two minutes; he apprehended him and found three pair of shoes in his bag; I do not remember what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was you when you saw him take them? A. On the cellar stairs there is a door which was shut - it is bolted at the side; but I looked under the bottom, where the floor is worn away, there is a space of about an inch or half an inch; I stood down the stairs - the cases where about two yards from the door; he was standing up.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. Martin told me to stop the prisoner, and bring him back, when he came out of the shop, as he suspected he had robbed his master I stopped him, and asked what he had got in his bag; he said he had his work - I put my hand on his bag, and felt a pair of made up shoes; I said, "Have you got any made up shoes?" he said No - I said, "There is a pair here;" he said, "Yes, there is; I am going to take them to a customer in Tabernacle-square" - I then asked if he had got any more made shoes; he said No, and on feeling I found two more pairs - I took him into the shop, and he voluntarily said he had done it, but he did not know how he came to do it; I heard nobody say he had better confess; if it had been said I think I must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you say, if he confessed you would do all you could with his master not to hurt him? A. Not at the shop - in going to the Compter, I said the best thing he could do was to give his master information, as he had lost a deal of property; this was after he had said what he did.</p>
               <p>MR. MACLAREN. I cannot say, in my confusion, whether I made him any threat or promise - I have no mark on these shoes; they were made for me, but I cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Many shoes are bought from depots? A. If these are mine they came from a depot - I cannot swear to them, though I know they are mine.</p>

            . I cannot say whether either of them are the pair I saw him take - he was stopped about four doors off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen him all the time he was in the shop? A. Yes; I did not see him go out, as I was down stairs - I only saw him take one pair; another young man was in the shop, but his back was turned - he was about a yard and a half from him, writing; the prisoner is an excellent workman - there is no jealousy between us.</p>

            . I saw him come out of the shop, and and took him within three doors; he went no where.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to show Mr. Maclaren a last, with part of my work fitted on it, for a lady I had a pair of shoes to make for; I had my bag under my arm; I remained in the shop a quarter of an hour, and brought the same things out in my bag as I had taken in - I got about seventy yards before Parker came to me; I told him I had shoes, and that I was going to take them to King's Head-court, White-cross-street.</p>
               <p>MR. MACLAREN. He showed me a last for a lame foot; I had lost 230l. worth of property, and set a watch - I cannot say whether his bag was under his arm; I never suspected him.</p>

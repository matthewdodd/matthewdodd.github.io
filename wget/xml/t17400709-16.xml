            . On the 6th of June,1739, the Prisoner was coming by our Shop; a Woman met her, and asked her where she was going? the Prisoner told her she was going to sell a Waistcoat and Breeches,(which she had fetch'd out of Pawn) in Order to raise Money to pay her Brother's Fees at the Gatehouse. I heard this, and asked her what she would have for them? We bargain'd for 12 Shillings, and I afterwards sold the Waistcoat. But the Breeches hanging out of the Window, tho' the Gold Buttons which were on them were cut off, and others put on, yet Mr Riddle coming by the Shop, knew them, challeng'd them, and said he had lost a Waistcoat with them; and upon this I discover'd the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Husband * brought them to me and told me he had bought them: but they not fitting him, I first carry'd them to pawn, and afterwards sold them to Jackson.</p>

            . I liv'd with the Prisoner almost 4 Years: Her Husband used to sell black Balls about the Streets. He brought the Waistcoat and Breeches home, one Day, and said he bought them to wear on St Patrick's Day. He afterwards gave them to her to pawn, and then order'd her to sell them. <rs id="t17400709-16-verdict90" type="verdictDescription">

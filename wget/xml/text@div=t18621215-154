                  </hi>. I reside at 16, Bedford-place, Commercial-road, East—on the evening of 2d December, at twenty minutes or a quarter-past 8, I left my house to visit my mother—I was going along the Commercial-road, near Richard-street, and on going down Richard-street the prisoner seized me, and struck me a violent blow on the side of the face—he made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at my neck, and broke my brooch, which I have here—I had a dress and lining in my hand in two separate parcels—I was very much confused, and dropped the dress, and the prisoner took it away—he struck me before he took the dress—when I recovered myself I saw him running through the court—I ran after him, and told the sergeant directly I met him—I ran through the court, and down James-street, and then into Walberg-street—I cried out, "Stop thief" all the way, and when I got to the bottom there I said, "I can't run any further," and some people said, "Yes, come along, we have got him"—I came up, and found him in custody—I identified him as the man who had struck me—I only lost sight of him just for a moment as he ran down James-street—when he was taken I saw the dress that I had in my hand before—that was the same parcel that I had before.</p>

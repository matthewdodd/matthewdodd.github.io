"—he produced a fourth, which I cut—I said, "Have you any more?" and he pulled out a broken one, and Steinwood said that it was offered at the boat pier for payment of the fare from London Bridge to Hungerford, and they were told that if they had got anymore they would get locked up—he said that they had got no more about them—I</p>

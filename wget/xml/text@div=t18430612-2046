                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live at No. 43, Feather-stone-street, St. Luke's—I keep a van and two horses—I know the two pri<lb></lb>soners. On Tuesday, the 25th of April, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, Reardon came to me and asked if my van and two horses were at home—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Put them to, for my master wants you"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "On Saffron-hill, Mr. Cohen's"—I immedi<lb></lb>ately put the horses to, and away we rode together to Cohen's house—I stopped there about ten minutes—Cohen said, "Go along with these three men"—I saw Walders there, and two other men, who I do not know—I have not seen them since—Reardon staid behind at his master's, Cohen's house—I asked them where they were going—they said, "To Great Suffolk-street, overthe water"—I said, "I don't know Suffolk-street"—they said, "If you will go on, we will tell you which way to go"—Walders jumped on the top of my pony, and rode all the way over till we came to Suffolk-street, nearly to the bottom—when we came to the yard, they told me to stop—Walders told me to go and get something to drink, and they would pay for it—I did not go to the public-house, but stopped to look at a picture shop close by—I did not go into the yard then, but stopped outside in Great Suffolk-street—while looking at the pictures, Walders came and called me, and told me to bring the van up the yard, and the two horses—I did not see any difficulty in getting into the yard at first—it was open—there were no gates to it that I saw—I took the van and horses into the yard, and backed the van close to the warehouse ladder, by Walders' direction—I have since learnt that ware-house to be Mr. Mahon's—when I backed the van I saw the two men up stairs in the loft of the warehouse, chucking bundles of paper down to Wal<lb></lb>ders, who helped to load the van—when I thought they had nearly enough for my two horses to draw, they put a bag of paper, tied up in small parcels, about the width of my hand, on the tail of the van—the other paper was se<lb></lb>cured in bundles about a quarter of a hundred weight each—I should judge by my springs that there was near upon two tons of paper put into the van</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184306120256"></xptr>
               <p>—they also put in some scales, ropes, and a beam, from the warehouse—they were large scales, similar to warehouse scales—I immediately put my pony to the van, and we drew out of the yard—just as we got out of the archway one of my traces broke—Walders assisted me to mend it, and during the time there was a cart waiting to come up—I pulled my van out into the main road to let the cart come by—when we mended the trace, we came on—this was about half-past seven or a quarter to eight, between seven and eight—I did not see the other two men—they did not join the van any more—Walders kept me company all the way over the bridge till we came to the Old Bailey—he told me to stop at a public-house there—I said, "No, I don't want to stop here, because it is up a hill for my horses"—he said, "Stop and have half a pot of beer"—I stood outside, and had one drink, and away I came—I saw the two men in that public-house, who were in the loft <hi rend="italic">chucking</hi> the paper down—they drank after me, and Walders also—Walders and I then came on across Smithfield, up Thomas-street to Saffron-hill, to Cohen's house—the other two men did not come on with us—we got to Cohen's house at half-past eight or a quarter to nine—Cohen and Reardon were outside the door—I did not see Walders and the other two any more that night—Cohen, and Reardon, and a little boy, whose name I do not know, helped me unload the van—it might be some strange boy about there—the paper was unloaded, and put into the cellar with the scales, beam, and rope—after the van was unloaded, Cohen asked me how much—I looked at the time, and said, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. an hour—he changed a half-sovereign at the bar, and paid me—next day, Wednesday, between twelve and one, Reardon came to me, and said, "My master wants you"—he was going to wait till I put my horses to—I told him to go on—I overtook him facing St. Luke's church, in Old-street—he was along with one of the other men that had been along with me over night—that man was drunk—they got up into the van, and I drove to Cohen's house—when I came there, Cohen <hi rend="italic">blowed</hi> him up, and said he would kick his backside for stopping so long—some of the paper was put into the van—I should think sixty or seventy bundles, and the rest in bags—it had been put into bags since the over night—Cohen told me to take them down to a yard down the hill, and be and Reardon accompanied me to the house—when I got there it was an empty room in Pump-court, Saffron-hill—Reardon, Cohen, and a lot of boys about there unloaded the van into the room—I then went to Cohen's house again, and Reardon asked me what was to pay—I said 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stationer, carrying on business in Blackman-street, Borough. I have a warehouse in a stable-yard in Great Suffolk-street, where I mostly deposit waste paper, done up in bundles and bags, a variety of millboards and rags—in the years 1839, 1840, and 1841. I had deposited about thirty tons of large bundles of paper, which I purchased of the Excise—about a week before Wednesday, the 26th of April, I saw that paper in my warehouse all safe, except a portion that I had removed myself—I am not in the habit of selling the paper in the state of that produced—that is the state in which I buy it—in consequence of information from Oliveira, I went to the warehouse on the morning of the 27th, (I was not at home on the 26th)—I missed about seven tons of paper, and very near two tons in bags—I missed my scale-beams and rope, a quantity of linen rags and millboard—I had the paper in stacks according to their size—there was seven large stacks, and one or two dwarf ones—there was about three tons and a half gone out of one stack of one particular size, and others out of different stacks—the value of the whole seven tons I consider to be about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the bags about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., averaging 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a bag, the rags about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the scales and beam about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have since been shown by the officers some paper, said to be found in an unoccupied room in Pump-court—it was part of the paper I lost—my ware-house is in the parish of St. George-the-Martyr, Southwark—it is called St. George.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it purports to be accepted by James Dunt, but it is not my writing—I believe I owed the prisoner 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at that time—I at once stated that it was not my hand<lb></lb>writing—I never gave the prisoner or any other person authority to write my name on that bill—I saw the prisoner two or three days after seeing the bill at Mr. Jones's, and I told him there was a bill for 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the hands of Mr. Jones that I knew nothing of, and that it was made payable at Mr. Ford's, of Camberwell—he said he would see Mr. ford about it—I told him I had been served with a writ on account of it—I never heard anything more about it from the prisoner—I saw him again four or five days after, and he still said he knew nothing of it—I then lost sight of him until I saw him at Greenwich.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner in his defence stated, that he applied to Dunt to accept the bill, though Dunt might have forgotten it; that he sent it to him by Farrant, one of his workmen, who had since gone to Australia, and that Farrant brought it back accepted; that he had no doubt of its being Dunt's acceptance: he also stated that when Dunt was sued on the bill, he paid the costs</hi>.)</p>

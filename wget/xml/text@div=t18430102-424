                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Britannia-street, City road. I had a great deal of wearing apparel in a room at the top of the house—the coat and breeches produced were in my husband's box in that room—I had seen them about three months before—this coat was in a deal box in the room close to the door—I lost my best shawl, and bonnet, and handkerchief from another box—the prisoner and her husband came to lodge with me on the 12th of Oct.—I unlocked the door of the room a few days after she came, and went into the room with her—I was obliged to go down, and she afterwards brought the key down to me—I did not go into the room afterwards, till the fire—I never tried the door to ascertain whether she had locked it—I had the key in my pocket ever since—on the 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi> of Dec., there was an alarm of fire—I went to the room door, put the key into the lock, but could not unlock it—it was forced open by Holmes—I groped to the window, and as soon as the smoke cleared away, I opened my hus<lb></lb>band's box, which was broken open—every box was broken open—I missed five coats, one shooting-jacket, two pairs of breeches, six silk handkerchiefs, six aprons not made up, one pair of sheets, five pillow-cases, five piliows, a bolster, a prayer-book, and Bible—I cannot tell the value of them—my shawl cost me 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

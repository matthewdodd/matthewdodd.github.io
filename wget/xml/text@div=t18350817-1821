                  </hi>. I am a sailor. I came on shore the 6th of August, at Shadwell, and there found the prisoner—I had a sovereign when I came ashore—I changed it, and walked up the street with two or three acquaint<lb></lb>ances—I came down, and fell in with some more acquaintances—the pri<lb></lb>soner was not one of them—she was not at the Coach and Horses, in my company—I was tipsy—I cannot tell where I lost my money.</p>

                  </hi>. I went there for half a pint of beer for my mother. The prisoner was there with another female, and the prosecutor came in, and would go to speak to the other female—he then came back, and went to the prisonerr again—she put her hand on his shoulder, and turned his pocket out, and took our something, what I cannot say—the witness said, "That man is robbed"—she put her hand into her bosom, but what she put in I cannot say—the witness went out for a policeman—I came out, and the prisoner came out and ran home—I went and showed the policeman where she lived.</p>

In consequence of information I went to 14, Paragon-row, Locks-fields, Walworth, with other officers—I knocked at the door, it was opened by the prisoner—it was about 1 o'clock in the day—he said, "What do you want?"—I was in plain clothes—there were two officers in uniform—I said, "I believe you have stolen property in your house and as such I mean to search your house"—he said, "Very well"—I asked him who occupied the house?—he said, "I do"—I went in and tried to open the door of the front parlour—I found it locked—I said, "Who occupies this room?"—he said, "A lodger of mine, named Williams"—I asked if Williams was in—he said, "No; he is not"—I said, "If you have not the key of the room, I must break the door open"—he said, "Don't do that, you will find nothing there"—I broke the door open and opened the shutters to admit the light—in that room I found 1,200 and 3 and a half skins—I said, "How do you account for the possession of these?"—he said, "The only ac<lb></lb>count I can give is that they belong to my lodger"—I said, "If that is the only account you can give me of them, I must take you to the City; I believe them to be the produce of an extensive robbery that took place in the City on 1st September"—he replied, "Very well;" I took the leather that was in that room and other officers searched other parts of the house.</p>

I am a detective officer—I went with the last witness and other officers to the prisoner's house—I went into the parlour—the prisoner was without his clothes—he went up stairs to dress and I went with him—there were two or three boxes in the room which I requested to look in—he gave me the key and I opened them but found nothing in them—there were one or two cupboards—one cupboard was behind—the bedstead was completely in front of it—I requested him to open it—he appeared very ner<lb></lb>vous and confused and said, "There is nothing there"—I said, "I must look in the cupboard"—he said, "If you will wait till I am dressed, I will move the bedstead and you shall see"—I did wait—he moved the bedstead and opened the door, and took out six rolls of skins, each containing twelve—he threw them on the bed and said, "Is that what you want?"—I said, "Yes; that is what I was looking for: how can you account for the possession of this property?"—he said, "It was left here when I was out; I know nothing about it"—I said, "You must know something about it"—he then said, "If you must know, it was left here in my charge.

I went up to the Drawer and found my Money was gone: She was going away and had made up her Cloaths, and amongst them I found one of my Shirts, and I tax'd her with it and she deny'd it. While we were searching of her she had about Piece of small Money wrapp'd up in a Paper which she endeavour'd to throw behind the Clock .

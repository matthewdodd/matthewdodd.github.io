Simmonds, of Westminster—a very respectable firm—I had some three times of the prisoner; I did not see the prisoner till November after I left Cheltenham-there was no other dealings between me and the prisoner, except about the flour—I had nothing to do about rent—he brought a paper to me, saying if he could go to his uncle he could get some money; and I put my name to it—I did not read the paper—I cannot read, and that is the truth—my wife can read, I believe—I can write but very little—from November till this present time I have seen the prisoner many times; I have drank with him—I paid part, and he paid part—I have lent him money on previous occasions—on this occasion we drank two pints of beer, and then this subject was introduced, and this paper was introduced; he asked me to lend him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on this I O U—I lent him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the money was to be returned on the Wednesday—I think I gave the prisoner in charge on the following Monday fortnight—I believe that was the date—I required him to put his name on the back of the I O U after he first said so; I refused to lend the money till he put his name there.</p>

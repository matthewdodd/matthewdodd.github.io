I keep the "City of London," York Road, St. Pancras, about 150 yards from the "Copenhagen Arms"—on 22nd March, about 6.30, I served the prisoner with a half-pint of porter—he took out a half-crown and a florin, hesitated, and then put the florin down hard, so that I could not tell, by the sound, whether it was bad or good—I examined it, and told him it was bad—he said "It is a bad job, I did not know it"—I said "You ought, for it is bad enough"—I asked him if he could account for the possession of it, and if he had any more money—he said "No," but afterwards paid with the half crown—he said he was a cabinet-maker, and had been to Hornsey for work—he asked for the florin back, but I declined to give it to him; I bent it, and gave him in charge—he refused his address.</p>

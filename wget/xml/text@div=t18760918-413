                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Garrett, of 6, Vernon Place, Fulham, a plumber—the prisoner and her husband lodged with us and occupied the two parlours—on the morning of 29th June, about 9 o'clock, the prisoner called out "Mrs. Garrett are you at home"—I never answered, but was going up to her—she stood at the top of the stairs and said "What shall I do, I have cut my baby's hand off?"—she had the baby in her arms; I took it from her—there was blood all down her dress—I went off to Dr. Spall, who attended to the baby and I took it back—it has died since.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They came to lodge with me last November—I never saw her otherwise than a kind affectionate mother to her child—she was excited when she called to me—she is subject to fits, she sometimes has them frequently, and sometimes at longer intervals—she goes about and does all sorts of ridiculous things as though she did not know what she was doing—she moves about her room unconsciously—she burnt herself and the child too in one of those fits shortly before—the child is I think six months old—the breakfast things were on their table.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 47, Hammersmith Road—on the morning of 29th June, between 9 and 10 o'clock, the last witness brought me a female infant, aged about four months—its left hand had been recently cut off—I dressed the wound and told Mrs. Garrett to take it to the hospital as I thought the mother might be taken in custody and that secondary hæmorrhage might come on—if it had not been surgically attended it must have bled to death—it has since died.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and have been upwards of forty years in practice—I am physician to the Hospital for Diseases of the Nervous System, and a great many of these cases come under my notice—I have made notes of 600 or 700 cases—the prisoner came tinder my observation as an out-patient in July, 1871, and I have since seen her occasionally—I have made special notes of her case as being something remarkable; it is very unusual for these acts to be performed during epileptic fits, but is a recognised form of epileptiform disease, they are purely automatic acts, the patient is perfectly unconscious—it is so far complete epilepsy that there is an entire suspension of mind—in this special case, and the greater part are similar, the fit comes on with a perfectly quiescent condition; this poor woman, I understand, has always a livid appearance, and after she has been in such quiescent state a few minutes, she gets up and will occupy herself in household work, putting things away, perhaps, but she does not know it herself, and she eventually comes out. of the fit with a certain, amount of headache and lassitude; symptoms which resemble those of a regular epileptic fit—the first account she gave me was that after a mis-carriage in 1871 she had one of the attacks, and in 1872 she had four attacks, all exactly alike—I made a note of her special case, but I have not got my note-book here—I have not a doubt but that she was absolutely un<lb></lb>conscious of what she was doing—I have no doubt but that it was a purely automatic act—she had the child in her hand and was going to cut a piece of bread and butter—I think that is quite consistent—it would not take much force to cut off the hand of so young a child if the knife was applied at the wrist—this is not convulsive epilepsy, we have no name for it in English, but the French call it <hi rend="italic">vertige epileptique</hi>—the complaint is not</p>

               <p>characteristic of insanity in the slightest way, the patient may be perfectly sane and fall into that condition, there is. neither homicidal or suicidal tendency, out any act which is begun before the fit may be continued—that is from my general knowledge, and also from the prisoner's special case—it is not looked upon by the profession as insanity in any form—I have made it a study.</p>

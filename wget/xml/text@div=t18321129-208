On Sunday, the 18th of November, about ten minutes after nine o'clock at night, I put my coat behind the counter on a barrel of ale, folded up - I have seen the prisoner at the shop several times; he was sitting on the opposite side of the counter at this time - I missed it in about ten minutes, he was then gone; somebody said he had seen the prisoner go out with it - I took a person who had sat by his side to the station-house, and in consequence of what he said I sent the Policeman to No. 24, John-street, Brick-lane - he found the coat, and brought it to the station.</p>

            . I was at the beer-shop, and saw the prisoner there; and a few minutes after nine o'clock I saw him walk out with the coat under his arm - it struck me afterwards that it did not belong to him, and I gave information, as I missed it from the barrel; he was taken in an hour.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was at the station-house - a man was brought there on suspicion; I went and found the prisoner at No. 28, St. John-street - I knocked at the door and asked if Buck lived there, which name was given me at the station-house; I went up to the front room first floor, and found the prisoner there - I told him I took him for stealing the coat from the beer-shop, and found it laying under his other clothes, in a chair at the foot of the bed; Palmer claimed it - the prisoner said afterwards, that had he not been drunk he should not have taken it.</p>

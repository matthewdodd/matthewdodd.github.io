They are carriers in connection with the railway—Ford was in their employment as a porter—his duty wai to sleep in the office nightly, and to assist generally throughout the day—Taylor was a sort of stable man, not in the employment of the firm, but assisting the foreman in the yard—when parcels are delivered at our office for the purpose of being transmitted by rail, they are placed in different partitions allotted to certain lines of railway—those partitions are not on the counter, but at the further end of the office, not open to persons coming to the office; they would be open to a man in Ford's position, and to the servants there—the compartment under the counter was for the Eastern Counties' parcels—forty-seven parcels ought to have gone by Howard on the 17th April; he only collects for the South Western—on the following day he called to say that he was a parcel short, and on the second day Mr. Mott's assistant called, and then I learned what the parcel was—it was known to be missing the next day when Howard called, but I made it officially known to all the persons in the office on the Saturday afternoon, including Ford—I mentioned that it contained a ring—I do not think I mentioned the lockets—I am certain Ford was present.</p>

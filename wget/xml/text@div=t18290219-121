               <p>COURT. Q. Were you beaten, or thrown down? A. I do not wish to say any thing to injure them; I was knocked down by a blow on my chest, from a hand - perhaps I might receive more than one blow; I am not quite certain, I believe I was protected from a blow at my head, by my hat - I received a blow on the back of my head, and a blow on my breast; I came on the ground from the effect of the blow - I was kept down by my shoulders and arms, and my watch taken out of my pocket; I saw one of the party that stood over me take the watch out of my pocket, and hand it over to another of the party - I saw the watch plainly; they all left me - I was stunned with the fall, and cannot say which way they went; my watch was a very valuable gold chronometer, for which I paid forty guineas; the chain cost nine guineas - one seal cost three guineas and a half, and the other two guineas and a half; the key, one guinea and a half - I have never seen the watch since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing to you during the time they were with you? under what pretence did they join you? A. I was not particularly in liquor, but they supposed I was in liquor; I had only two tumblers of punch, and some ale.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were not in liquor, how did you allow them to take your arm? A. One of them, I presume, pretended to be in liquor, and wanted my assistance; it is impossible for me to say why I allowed them to walk with me; I did not wish them to walk with me, but they wanted to assist me home - I do not recollect what they said; I never asked their assistance - I have no doubt but they asked me where I lived; I do not recollect it - I might have said I was going to No. 45, Kirby-street; I perfectly recollect telling them I was going to my lodging, No. 45, Kirby-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you when you got up? A. I went to the corner of Kirby-street, and told the patrol, or watchman, I do not recollect which; the watchman came up, having Langham in custody - he was the one who had hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you saw him, did you know him to be the man who had hold of your arm? A. I was considerably stunned and alarmed at the time; I said at the watch-house he was one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him, did not the watchman ask if he were one of the men? A. Being knocked down in that way, and I was so trampled upon, your Lordship may suppose I was confused; I did not say he was one of them, till I got to the watch-house - I told the watchman I had been knocked down, and robbed of my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, "That man you have got hold of is one of the men?" A. I was not asked the question: I was called upon to give charge against the man at the watch-house, and I gave the charge - nothing passed till we went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively swear these are four of the five men who ill-treated you on that night? A. I am positive of it; it was a very clear, moon-light night, nearly as light as day - I am certain they are all the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you now? A. I am in no business; I am merely a man - a gentleman; if you had been in the House of Lords on the 25th of July, you would have heard a case of mine decided; I had never seen the prisoners before - I dined between five and six o'clock; we dined at the Union public-house, Bucklersbury, then went to the King's Arms, till, probably, seven o'clock - then, having business to do, we went to the Fleece public-house, Threadneedle-street, and remained in conversation till after eleven o'clock; people are in the habit of going there - they make a particular sort of punch; it is not very strong - it is a small quantity of genuine brandy, and acid; we went to talk on important business regarding me - we remained there till twelve o'clock or half-past; then one of my friends was going towards the Tower - we went to the King's Arms, and had a bit of cheese, and certainly not exceeding three pints or two quarts of ale; I think there were six tumblers between us three, at the Fleece - I will swear we did not drink twelve glasses; it might be about ten - it is impossible exactly to tell how much I drank; as far as my recollection serves me, we did not drink twelve, or ten, glasses of punch - when we left the Fleece, we were perfectly sober and collected; as far as I recollect, I paid about 3s. 6d. - I might pay 5s.; I cannot recollect what I paid there, or at the King's Arms; I do not think I paid any thing there - we had clubbed together</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to represent you were not very much in liquor when you say this violence was used? A. I might be; of course I was rather in liquor, but I had my recollection - I am positive I told the watchman I was robbed of my watch, when he came up to me, at the corner of Charles-street; I do not recollect whether, when I got to the watch-house, the constable of the night asked me whether I had lost any property - I told him I had been robbed: I have no recollection of saying I had lost my watch three hours ago - I am certain I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190051"></xptr>robbed when I was lying down; I am perfectly certain of that - I went to the watch-house about twelve o'clock next day, and asked for the man who had been locked up; I was not then aware that the other party had been taken; I might ask if any more were taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon did you hear of any more being taken? A. In the course of the Sunday, but I did not know how many.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you were told three were taken, did you not say, "What, are there four of you then?" A. I have no recollection of it; I think two were presented to me - I was not told till next day that four were taken; I have been to a public-house this morning, in the Old Bailey, and merely had one glass of peppermint - nothing else; perhaps I might have two glasses of peppermint - nothing else.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is your memory so imperfect, you cannot recollect what happened a few minutes ago? A. I merely drank two glasses; I have had nothing else since ten o'clock this morning, to my recollection - one of the patrols was with me, but he would not drink; I merely called for two glasses of peppermint - I paid 4d.; I offered to treat the patrol with a glass of porter, but he declined.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Hatton-garden. On Saturday night, the 18th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was at my mother's door; she is housekeeper at the Sewers' office - my mother was up cleaning - she went over the way to get some beer; I and my brother stood at the door till she returned: while I staid at the door, I saw Mr. Munro, and five men coming up the street with him - there were five besides him; they came up from the corner of Holborn - Mr. Munro was a little in liquor, for he talked to the men rather too freely; he walked very steady - the prisoners Birmingham and Redgard had hold of his arms; they had hold of him, and Langham walked first - Kelly, and the one who is not caught, walked behind; when they passed our door, they stood at Mrs. Jones's, next door, No. 8, and then Birmingham put his hand into Mr. Munro's pocket, behind, and took out a handkerchief, which he returned again - it was a cotton handkerchief, I think, by what I saw; Birmingham, and the man who is not caught, then bid Mr. Munro good night, crossed the road, and went up Holborn, in a different way to what the rest went: Langham then took hold of Mr. Munro's arm, and went up Hatton-garden, towards Kirby-street - I know nothing more; I lost sight of them - my brother left me, and followed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What kind of a morning was it? A. Very fine; I am not usually up so late - I was not afraid, as my mother had only gone a little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a cap put on Birmingham's head at the office, before you swore to him? A. Yes, there was; it was put on after I went there - he wore the cap on the night of the robbery; I swore to him by the cap, and by his dark clothes: I did not identify him till the cap was put on; I said I knew the cap, because there was a little hair off the front of it - I saw Kelly put the cap on Birmingham's head; I had no opportunity of seeing his face, and should not have known him, except from the cap and dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Munro appeared in liquor, because he was talking so freely to the men? A. Yes; they were at the next door - he was bidding them good night; he shook hands with one of them; I do not know which - it was the one who is not taken: I heard nothing else; he did not mention his name when he bid him good night - I did not know any of them till their hats were put on; it was not by their faces that I knew them: it was a beautiful moon-light night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You would not have been able to swear to them, but from their dress? A. No; Birmingham wore a cap, and Kelly a hat, on that night - Redgard had a leather apron, a fustian coat, and a hat; the other had a white flannel jacket, and a hat - I have no doubt of their being the men.</p>

            . I am brother to the last witness. I was at my mother's door with her, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning of the 19th of January; I saw five men coming up Hatton-garden - Mr. Munro was with them; the man with one eye (Birmingham) had hold of his arm - I observed at that time he had only one eye; I could not tell what colour his dress was - he had a cap on; I am quite sure he is one of the men who had hold of Mr. Munro's arm: I observed Langham behind Mr. Munro; he had a white flannel jacket on, as he has now - I did not see his face; I knew him by his jacket: he had a hat on, and was walking behind Mr. Munro, when I first saw him - I saw Redgard, and one who is not here, (he had light trousers on) walking in front; and Kelly was walking in front: they kept in this position all the time, till Birmingham and the other, who is not caught, wished him good night, and both crossed over the street: Langham then laid hold of the gentleman's arm, and they went on till they came to Charles-street - then they went to Kirby-street; then Birmingham, and the one not taken, met them again, joined them, and then they all surrounded Mr. Munro, and all got round him; Langham then went over the road, to see what number he lived at, and before he got half-way over the road, the others knocked Mr. Munro down: I could not see which, for they were all round him; I did not see any blow given - I saw him lying on the ground, and before he was on the ground, I saw his arms pinned back; then he was knocked down, and some man swung a watch round to another man - then Langham crossed over the road, and seeing him lying in the road, he went up Kirby-street; I followed him, saw a watchman, and told him to take him - the others ran down Union-court.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after they swung the watch round, did they run away? A. About five minutes; they went down Union-court, which is not far from Kirby-street, before Langham came back - they all ran, and one of them fell down; Langham walked because he saw me - he crossed over to see the number, and was not there when the watch was taken; I told the watchman, and he took Langham; the others got out of sight - before the robbery took place, Birmingham asked me twice what I wanted; I said, Nothing - I was then following them, where they were crossing over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Birmingham near the prosecutor, when he asked you what you wanted? A. Yes, and so was I; I did not state about his having only one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190052"></xptr>eye before the Magistrate - what I said was read over to me; nothing was read about his having one eye - I have talked to my sister about this, but not very often; I learnt the names of the prisoners at the office - they were pointed out, and their names told me, by a gentleman; he did not point out that Birmingham had only one eye: I did not mention about his having only one eye, at the office, nor till now, but I observed it that night, and knew him by that - the Magistrate did not ask how I knew him; I saw both Mr. Munro's arms pinioned - I was across the raod, and did not like to go up, as they asked me what I wanted, but I saw them behind him, with his arms pinioned; it was while he was standing up that I saw the watch swung, and when his hands were pinioned - the watch was swung round, just as he was knocked down, and then they ran; I cannot tell whether he was on his legs when I saw the watch swung - I am certain two of them bid him good night; they were then next door - I do not know whether my sister had gone in then; I did not see either of them do any thing then.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. He had hold of his arm when he bid him good night? A. No, Langham took his arm then; I was about six yards from them when they bid him good night - neither of them shook hands with him, that I saw; I am going on for thirteen years old - I was not sleepy; I generally go to bed about eleven o'clock, but my mother was up washing.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw Francis O'Hara, as I was crying one o'clock; Langham passed me, walking, and O'Hars stood at the end of Kirby-street, when he heard me calling the time, he hallooed out to me, "Stop that man watchman!" I said,"What has he done?" he said, "He, and four more, knocked down a gentleman in Kirby-street;" Langham was near enough to hear it - I said, "Where is the rest of them?" he said, "They are gone down Union-court;" I turned back - followed Langham, and brought him back - he never offered to run, or any thing; I brought him back to Mr. Munro, and asked if he knew any thing of that man - he said, at first, that he did not; he was standing up, with his back to a post, when I got up - I said, "Come to the watch-house;" Langham was searched there, and nothing found on him - Mr. Munro, when we got to the watch-house, said he was one of the party, and we locked him up; Langham said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He could hear the boy tell you he was one of the five who knocked a man down? A. Yes - I was not within ten yards of him; he kept walking on, till I laid hold of him, and did not attempt to run away - the constable of the night asked Mr. Munro if he had lost any property; he said he had lost a watch, value 40l., besides the seals and chain - I did not hear him say it was three hours ago; he might say so, without my hearing him - he was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>ROGERS. I am a watchman of Saffron-hill. On Saturday night, about half-past eleven o'clock, I saw Birmingham and Kelly at the bottom of Saffron-hill, they spoke to me; at that time Birmingham had a cap on and Kelly a bat; I saw them again about a quarter or half-past twelve nearly on the same spot, and then Redgard was with them; he was dressed as he is now - Birmingham spoke to me then - they went down Field-lane together; at that time Birmingham had the cap on and Kelly the hat - they went down Field-lane together, I saw no more of them till a quarter-past one o'clock, when I saw Birmingham and Kelly in West-street; at that time Birmingham had the cap on and Kelly the hat - they passed me, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I received information that a robbery had been committed in Kirby-street, and the little boy described the prisoners to me - I said I knew them by the description, and in consequence of that description I apprehended Birmingham, Redgard, and Kelly, with the assistance of another watchman - Kelly had then got the cap on and Birmingham the hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Mr. Munro before? A. No.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I assisted in taking Birmingham, Redgard, and Kelly, from the description given by the boy - we took them in West-street; there was another man with them who got away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prosecutor? A. Not before; he went into a wine-vaults in the Old Bailey this morning, alone; I followed him in; he had a small glass of gin and peppermint, there was very little gin in it; I only saw him have one glass - I remained there till he went out; he only had one glass, he wanted another, but I persuaded him not; I said, "We must go over;" he said, "I am very faint, it won't hurt me;" I told him the trial was near coming on, and we must go over; I think he paid three halfpence - a friend who was with him had a glass which made it 4d., but what he drank did not come to 4d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BIRMINGHAM. I should like to ask whether the boy told the watchman I had but one eye, because the watchman came to me and told me he did not think he knew me - and he told the watch-house-keeper he did not think I was one of the men.</p>
               <p>- ROGERS. I do not recollect the boy mentioning to me that one of them had one eye; I told the watch-house-keeper I had seen him twice that night at a quarter-past twelve o'clock, but the robbery was at a quarter-past one, and I could not tell what he had done in that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BIRMINGHAM. Q. When you heard of the robbery you never offered to take me into custody when the other two prisoners passed you? Witness. They all three came down the street together, and another who is not taken - they all came out of Black Boy-alley, West-street; that is some distance from Union-court.</p>
               <p>REDGARD's Defence. On the 18th of January, having taken home some goods to Monument-yard, I went back to my father's, and stopped till about ten o'clock, and went to bed - my wife was taken very ill: I was obliged to get up - I got up about half-past eleven, and put on my clothes, without tying my shoes or stockings; I saw Birmingham and Kelly walking down West-street - I came out of Black Boy - alley, where I live, to go and get a quartern of brandy for my wife, and I was taken; I asked what for; and was told a gentleman had been robbed in Hattongarden; I was in bed at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>LANGHAM's Defence. When the watchman took me I could have got away if I wanted - I know no more about it than the child unborn; the gentleman said I was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190053"></xptr>the man, and when he got to the watch-house, he said he had lost his watch two or three hours ago.</p>
               <p>KELLY's Defence. At the first or second examination we had, the boy said he did not know me; when the girl came at the third examination she swore to me.</p>

            . I said I would not be sure of him at the first examination, but when I saw him with his hat on, I knew it was him; they had changed their caps - that was a week after; I was then satisfied he was the man - I described him before he was taken, as having a black coat and hat; the man who had but one eye had a cap.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BIRMINGHAM. Q. Did you tell the watchman at that time I had but one eye? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner KELLY. On the morning when the girl came to Hatton-garden, she swore she saw me take a cotton handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and it was a beautiful moonlight night; she was asked what the colour of the handkerchief was - she did not know; and when the cap on my head was put on Birmingham's head, she said it was him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner REDGARD. When we went to the Magistrate, the boy said he did not recollect us - and at the next examination they brought the girl up.</p>

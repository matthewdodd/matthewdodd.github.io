I am a goldbeater, residing at 3 and 4 North-side, Bethnal-green—the prisoner was in my service some years ago, about twenty-five, I suppose—on 28th October the men came to work in the morning—I had seen all the things brought and put in the counting-house over night, and I saw them safe—when the men came to work, their boxes, their tools, and their gold were missing; the gold upon which the men had been working: I believe the value was about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have seen a portion of the tools since, the gold I have not—these skins (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) are my property—I never dis<lb></lb>pose of these skins—I received a note from a person named Kinohkoff, in consequence of which I went, on 14th November, to 1, Guildhall-chambers,</p>

               <p>Basinghall-street, with police-sergeant 48 K—I waited there till the pri<lb></lb>soner came—when I saw him, I said, "Your name is Killbam"—he said "Yes"—I said, "You have robbed me before; where did you get these moulds from?" pointing to these, which were on the desk—he said, "I met two men in the street"—I said, "Was there any one else?" he said, "No, two men in the street"—that was all the information I could get from him—he asked me if I would go out in the street and he would show me the men—I did not go—I sent the policeman, and he brought in two men from a public-house—one of them has since been discharged, the other I let go at the time—I did not know him—the other man was in my service—he left for dishonesty on 15th September—I then gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

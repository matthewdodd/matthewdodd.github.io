               <p>Had he demanded the money of you before? - Yes, he insisted on the money; he swore and made use of bad expressions; I am sure the prisoner was the person; it was not so dark but I could discern him; after Briscoe struck at him, he staggered backwards and ran into a field; I got out and pursued him along with Briscoe, who encouraged me to pursue him; he made a little stumble and I gave him a blow; he then begged for God's sake that we would forgive him; we brought him into the road and gave him to a constable; he said he was very sorry for what he had done, and did not make any resistance, nor offer to get away.</p>

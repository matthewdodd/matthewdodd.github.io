             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. The prisoner was taken up by a warrant: from the Lord-Mayor: I went with Mr. Wigzell with a search-warrant to the prisoner's cellar under a hair-dresser's shop in the Minories; at the first entrance into the cellar the first thing Mr. Wigzell saw was a trett stuck in the cask; (producing it;) it was produced before the Lord Mayor in the presence of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was not Mr. Newman, the clerk, taking it down in writing at the time? - A. Mr. Newman was writing, but I cannot say what he was writing.</p>
               <p>Court. If he was writing, it must be supposed he was taking the examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. So this was stuck fast in the cask in the cellar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not secreted, or put away any-where? - A.No.</p>
               <p>Q.So that any body might see it that went into the cellar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Then if any body might see it the prisoner might see it? - A.Certainly.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you know this trett? - A. Yes, it bears my initials; and besides that there are marks underneath; about six years ago I had occasion to put a new worm into it; it was necessary to put the head of it into a vice, and there are the vice-marks upon it; I have not the least doubt in the world that it is mine; I have had it ever since I have been in business, and been in the habit of seeing it; I accompanied Church to the prisoner's cellar on the Monday, I think the 3d or 4th of January; I stated to the prisoner that I missed several tools, and among the rest, this trett; he said he had never seen any thing of it, and did not know any thing of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I have no doubt but the thing in your hand, be it what it will, is your property? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it other persons in your employment used it? - A.They might.</p>

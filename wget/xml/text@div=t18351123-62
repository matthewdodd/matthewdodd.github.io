                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 47.) On the 8th of November, at a quarter-past seven o'clock in the morning, I was in Bow Fair-field, near the church—Mr. Ratford's premise are there—he has a homestead, and barn there—I saw the prisoner about forty or fifty yards form the barn, coming form it—making his way into Old Ford-foot-path in the meadow—he had something under his arm, and something in his right hand—I thought it strange, and went towards him, to meet him—as soon as got to the end of the field, he looked at me, and threw what he had over his shoulder—he ran, I pursued, and sprang my rattle, and he got over a bank, I then lost sight of him—he was taken about eleven o'clock in the morning—when I saw him in the morning he had a cap on, and a flannel jacket—I knew him before—I picked up this sack over the first bank, where he had jumped over—when I was called to the station-house to see him at eleven o'clock, I said he was the person, but there was some alteration in his clothes—my inspector ordered me to take one of the shoes he had on, and one form those he had at home—I went to the marks where he got over—I placed a boot on the track, it fitted the marks in all respects,</p>

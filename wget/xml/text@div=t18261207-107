            . On the 23d of October, in the evening, I was on duty in the Harrow-road, and saw the prisoner near Mr. Bowran's farm; he passed me with an empty cart, and stopped in the road, about one hundred yards from Bowran's place; two loads of hay came out of the yard, and directly they passed, he went to the yard - a man came out, and I saw them put three trusses of hay into the cart; the prisoner went on in the cart with them; he did not take the hay out of the yard, but was in the cart, and received it. I went and asked if that was Mr. Bowran's cart; he said. Yes; I said I did not think it was; he said it was - I said, "Why then did not you come out with the teams?" he said he had been to Kensal-green; I said he had not been out of my sight; he then said he came from the Red Lion public-house - that they wanted some hay, and he had been for it; he asked if I would go there; I said perhaps I might - he said if I would there was any thing I choose to drink at my service. I then took him to the watch-house. The name of R. Miller was on the cart - he is hostler at the Red Lion. I took the prisoner next morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A man came and said he wanted my horse and cart for an hour; he did not say for what; he took me along the road, and threw the hay into the cart - he told me to go on, and he would catch me before I got to Paddington.</p>
               <p>MR. BOWRAN. I think my foreman, who has absconded, did it, and that the prisoner is innocent; two of my men have absconded - I suspect both.</p>

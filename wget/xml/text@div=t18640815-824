                  </hi>. I am an excavator, and live with my father at 9, Railway-grove, New-cross—the prisoner also resides there, and is an excavator—on Saturday, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> July, he came to me and asked me to get him employ<lb></lb>ment, and I went to a place near the Lewisham-road, where he was working, to tell him he could go to work with me on the following Monday—I went there about a quarter past 2 after I had got my wages—I don't know whether he had got his—I was not the worse for drink—I had over 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me—I knew what I was doing—I had nothing to drink till I went back to Deptford, when I had a pint of beer with a man—I then went and paid for three pints of beer for the prisoner, and lent him a shilling at his request—he then said, "You are not in a hurry to get home, <hi rend="italic">Ned</hi>?"—I said, "No; I don't want to go home"—he said, "Then go back to my work along with me, and wait till I go home"—I said, "I don't mind; I will," and I went up to his work—I laid down talking for about five minutes—he gave me his coat and his tin-bottle, and I went to sleep—I said to him first, "Don't go away without me," and he said, "I will not"—I woke about 6 o'clock, and found he was gone—his coat was there—I sat up, put my hand in my pocket, and only found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 21/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left—other money was gone—I then went down to the Crystal Palace beershop, and found the prisoner sitting behind the door—I said, "Southgate; here is your coat and bottle"—he would not look at me, but held his head down—at last I took hold of his chin, held his head up, and said, "I am going to accuse you of robbing me, or of helping those who did"—Mr. Gibbons, the landlord, then came round, and the prisoner said, "I had it"—the landlord said, "It was not done in my house, but I shall turn you out"—he got hold of the prisoner and turned him out—after he was outside I repeated my accusation, and he then said he had not had it; but he saw a dark man standing over me—I then hit him, and he ran away—I followed him—as he was going a policeman came round the comer—I held up my hand, and said, "Stop him"—I got up to him, gave him into custody, and he was taken to the station—I am quite confident I had the money when I laid down to sleep.</p>

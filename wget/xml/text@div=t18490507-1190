                  </hi> I am a smith. On 3d April I was in the employ<lb></lb>ment of Mr. Hussey, of Red Lion-street, St. Saviour's—the prisoners and another brother, Matthew, were in his employment also, and were discharged at eleven o'clock that day—George is only nine years old—they came to the workshop that afternoon, between two and three—William and Matthew were the worse for liquor—William came up to me, and said, "You think you have got my job"—I was at work on a small ring—that was not his job at all—I told him I had not, and if he thought so, to go to Mr. Hussey and see whether I had or not—on that he asked me to fight—I told him I did not get my living by fighting—he then caught hold of a hammer, and said he would sink it into my head—I put up the Ting and the tongs, which I had in my hand, to ward off the blow—he took the hammer and knocked the ring and tongs out of my hand, and immediately on that Matthew seized hold of me—we got into a scuffle, and fell on the forge together—George seized hold of this piece of iron, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) which we use as a candlestick, and William called out to him to strike the b—over the head, and he struck me over the head, and caused a wound—I fell to the ground, was stupified, and Matthew</p>

The prisoner came to my house, about five or six in the evening, on the 6th of December; he sent for me out of another room, and wanted to speak with me. When I came to him he desired to know if I had got a horse to left to a gentleman of his acquaintance. I said, I had not. Then he desired me to make him six pennyworth of brandy and water. While I was about to do it he went out into the street, came in again, and desired to know if I could give him silver for a guinea. I was then at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in your house at the time?</p>
               <p>Whitley. There were several people. I took out some silver from the till, and was telling it over on the bar. He said, lend me 4 s and 6 d. and immediately took up some money from the bar; I don't know whether he took more or less, but I suppose he took what he ask'd for, and went out of the house directly. I had not counted it over, if I had I should have known what he had taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you agree to lend it to him?</p>
               <p>Whitley. No, I did not; he had taken it, and was gone before I could get up the rest of my money, or speak a word to him about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said to me, Mr. Brown the butcher is in the next room, will not you go in and see him? Please to ask him that.</p>
               <p>Whitley to the question. That was before he ask'd me to change a guinea. I had seen him with Mr. Brown before several times, and at first I thought he was come to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he produce a guinea?</p>
               <p>Whitley. I saw no guinea he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you acquainted with the prisoner before this?</p>
               <p>Whitley. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Whitley. I can't tell what he is; he used to go very gay.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether or no you have not frequently brought a silver tankard to the door, and trusted me to drink out of it at night time?</p>
               <p>Whitley. If Mr. Brown was with him, to be sure I would have trusted him with any thing. I don't know that ever I trusted the prisoner alone with a tankard.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take the prisoner up?</p>
               <p>Whitley. He was not taken up on my account, but on some other, and committed on the 9th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Has any body desired you to prosecute me ?</p>
               <p>Whitley. No. I was told the prisoner was a very bad man, and I should do justice to the publick if I did do it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I had a porter to send for some things of mine, and I wanted change for a guinea; so I desired him to lend me 4 s. and 6 d. for the porter to carry with him. I took it, and went away, having some business with a gentleman, and did not come back again. I did not in the least suspect but what he would credit me.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he a house-keeper?</p>
               <p>Gwyn. He was; it was a tavern I think they call'd it; there were grapes hung out at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What has been his general character?</p>
               <p>Gwyn. He dealt with me, and paid me very honestly for every thing that I did for him.</p>
               <p>Q. What character have you heard of him?</p>
               <p>Gwyn. I have heard that he was a person that played a little, but I never inquired into his character.</p>

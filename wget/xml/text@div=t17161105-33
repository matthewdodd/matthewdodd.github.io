The Prisoner said in his Defence, he was indeed at the Nonjuring Meeting, but only out of Curiosity; and that there being a hurly burly among them, he rose up hastily, and found his Sword some way intangled by a Seat, and that he did clap his Hand upon his Sword, but did not draw it against the Prosecutors. He brought several Persons to testifie he was no way disaffected to his Majesty King George and Government, but on the contrary a hearty Well-wisher to them; and that he had often drank King George's Health, and other loyal Healths in their Company, with all the Heartiness imaginable. And one of the Evidences said, had he not been well assured of his good Affection towards his present Majesty, tho' he was his own Brother, he wou'd not have said one Word in his behalf. Upon the whole is appeared to be a Mistake in the Prosecuter, they not knowing the Occasion of his clapping his Hand upon his Sword.

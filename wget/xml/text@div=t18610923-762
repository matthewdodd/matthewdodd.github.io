                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller, living at Forest Hill, Kent—on 18th September, about half-past 7, I was in Arthur-street, London Bridge, felt something at my coat-pocket, turned round and saw the prisoner running away—I missed my handkerchief—he was immediately behind me—he ran about 100 yards—I caught him, and he pretended not to know anything of it—he laid down behind a piece of timber—I pulled him out and asked him for my handkerchief—he pretended to be asleep—I told him that would not do, he must find my handkerchief—he said that he had not got it—I said that I should give him in charge—he said he was very sorry, he hoped I should forgive him and let him go—he slipped his coat and waistcoat off and tried to escape—a man then came up and said, "Here is your handkerchief; I saw him drop it," and gave it to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 516). I received information, and saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner, who was given into my custody for stealing a handkerchief—he said that he had not done it, he had been lying down behind a piece of timber for the last three-quarters of an hour, fast asleep—I took him to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my service as warehouseman, and was so in May and June—he was not the housekeeper at that time—I deal in scarfs—this scarf produced is of a quality that I have been in the habit of keeping—I am not myself able to say whether I have missed any—I believe I am the only individual that has this sort of table-cover except the manufacturer—it is a peculiar article, made for the China trade, and I bought it as a job lot—it is not a thing we generally deal in—it is made of a sort of ladies' cloth, and was imperfect in the die, and it was afterwards printed into table-covers, and was cut into various lengths—it is the only lot of table-covers I ever had in my stock—it is not an article that would be found in any warehouse in the City—I can confidently say that the same article was never made before—it was not properly made for table-covers—these cloths have a very great peculiarity; they have got black stripes in the list, which are called Spanish stripes—there is a great deal of similar cloth, but not made for table-covers—the cloth itself is peculiar, and the printing it for table-covers is an additional peculiarity—I have not the slightest doubt that this is part of my property—I did not print them myself—I bought them of the manu<lb></lb>facturers, as a job lot—my number happens to be on the waistcoat-piece—it is a piece of the quality that I had on my premises—there are two marks on it that I can speak to; my own mark, and the mark of the party from whom I purchased it—he is considered the manufacturer of it, inasmuch as this is a registered article—the material was manufactured in the north of England, and afterwards printed at Crayford, in Kent—the peculiarity of the printing is so well known in the trade, that if it had never been in my shop I should know whose printing it was—we enter everything by progressive numbers—this number is 919—that is my number—the number of the party from whom 1 bought it is No. 1, and a figure 8 after it, which would denote eight yards—that is not my writing; I cannot say whose it is—I never mark off goods</p>

                  </hi>. There is no mark on this scarf, but it is an article which Mr. M'Gregor keeps in his stock, and from this lot we have three missing—I have ascertained that by searching through the book—that book is not here—I have the book relating to the waistcoating; it is kept by a young man in the counting-house, who Mr. M'Gregor has on purpose to write off the stock as it is sold—when we receive a quantity of goods from a manufacturer's we have the invoice, and the manufacturer's number is put on it from the invoice, which we call the progress number, and our own number also, and both numbers are entered in our book—this has had the manufacturer's ticket taken off—I produce the book and the original invoice of the goods—I am not in the habit of seeing the entries in this book as soon as they are made.</p>

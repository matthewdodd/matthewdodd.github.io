                  </hi>. I am Post-master of Woodford. About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 2nd of March, I gave the prosecutor a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—I have not got the numbers of them—one of the endorsements was the 5th of February, and one the 26th of February</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Castle at Woodford, about three o'clock on the 2nd of March—the prisoner came in and had some beer—I saw something lying on the table like a packet of papers—I took it up, thinking it was a bit of waste-paper—one piece of it fell down—I looked at it, and it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—soon after I picked up another piece and found that to be a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I handed them round the room to see if any one owned them, but at that time no one did—the prisoner was in the room at the time—I should fancy he could hear me ask for the owner—there were only four persons in the room—he pulled a key from his pocket, and I observed what appeared to be another note, squeezed up in the same manner as the other two were—he said, "Has any one found anything?"—I said, "I think I have"—he said, "I have lost some money"—I said, "What have you lost?"—he said, "A 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and a 5<hi rend="italic">l,</hi> note"—I said, "Then, they can't be yours"—he said, "Perhaps there may be two five's, I am not positive"—I said, "Do you claim this as your property?"—he said, "I do"—and I immediately handed them to him—he was drunk.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Castle, at Woodford. The prisoner came to my house about four o'clock on Wednesday, the 2nd of March—he asked for some beer and tobacco—I brought it in—he asked if I wanted the money for it—he said he could not pay me, would I let him have it upon that, and gave me this 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note as security for the beer—he said a relation had died and left him the money, and this was the first instalment. <hi rend="italic">cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 331.) I received information from Mays, and went to the public-house where the prisoner was—I asked him where the notes were which he had taken from Mays at the White Hart public-house—he said they were in his pocket, and pulled out the notes—I asked him to give them to me—he said he would not—I said I must have them—I took hold of his hand, and took from his hand two notes, one was a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I asked him where the other one was—he said it was all right, Mays had given him them to take care of—I cautioned him not to say more to me, as it would be made use of before the Magistrate—in taking him to the station, he said Mays had lent him the money, and would lend him more if he wanted it.</p>

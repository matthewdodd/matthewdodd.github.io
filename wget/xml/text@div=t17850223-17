               <p>On Monday the 13th of December last, about ten minutes before nine, I was robbed by six or seven persons of which the prisoners were two; I know the prisoners, I was at <placeName id="t17850223-17-crimeloc91">St. George's in the East</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor said, he did not know who the persons were that robbed him, he wished he did.</p>
               <p>Now was you always in the same story? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. Were there any lamps by you? - It was light, for there was a woman sitting selling sprats, over the way.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it not dark night? - It was, but there was a woman sitting with a candle very near the place, so that it was as light as it is now.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178502230064"></xptr>Court to Whiteway. When were they apprehended? - The first of this month, I think it was, the prosecutor came to me, and said, he had seen one of these lads in Rosemary-lane, and I went with him, and picked him out, he mentioned Johnson; and when Oliver was apprehended, he cried, and said, it was very hard one should be hanged for all the rest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor had not money to carry on this prosecution, and Whiteway offered him money to carry this prosecution on, says he, keep up your spirits, never mind it, I will gammon for you.</p>
               <p>Whiteway. I do not mind what they say. there never was any such conversation passed.</p>

               <p>What time was this that he told you so? - About a fortnight before Christmas, I know nothing of the prisoners, but by sight, I know one by sight, because his mother deals in Rosemary-lane, the same as I do.</p>

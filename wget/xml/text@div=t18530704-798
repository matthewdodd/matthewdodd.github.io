On Saturday afternoon, 25th June, about half past 4 o'clock, I was with Bassett, on the Surrey side of London-bridge, and saw the prisoner who I knew; we followed him into the City, he went down Arthur-street, King William-street, and East Cheap—there was no one with him—I and Bassett spoke together, in consequence of which I</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Jannings, a hosier. On 25th June, about half past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came and asked to look at a black handkerchief with embroidered corners—I showed him some, but we had not got exactly what he wanted—I went to the other end of the shop to inquire if we had anything likely to suit him, leaving him at the counter, and the handkerchiefs before him—I returned to him, and said those were the nearest we had got—he then asked to look at some white embroidered waistcoats—I took him up stairs, but not having anything likely to suit him, we came down again—he asked me if I could get them for him—I said I would endeavour to do so, and he said he would call again on Tuesday, and asked me for a card of the shop—he made no purchase—I know these handkerchiefs, they belong to Charles Jannings; some of them have his private mark on them—I did not miss any till Haydon brought the prisoner to the shop, but when we were shown the handkerchiefs we knew them to be our goods—I cannot positively say how many were gone, but we found that the stock was short.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> What is the value of them all put together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> 2 I observed no bulk about the prisoner as he left the shop—Haydon came about half an hour afterwards, and I said I had not missed anything; but directly I saw them I identified them—I only identify positively these three with the private mark on them—I cannot say whether Mr. Jannings keeps a stock book; I have never seen one; I have been there five years—three young men and a youth serve in the shop besides me—I remember that these handkerchiefs were in stock the day before, and I have made inquiries, and found they have not been sold—we mark all goods with a private mark, but it occasionally gets off—the mark is in Mr. Jannings' writing—he is not here—I know his writing; these tickets are his writing—we never leave marks on handkerchiefs when we sell them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Artillery-lane. The prisoner was my domestic servant, and worked by the week—I came down on the morning of 24th April, and she was gone—I cannot say whether that was the end of her week—she had not given me warning—I missed a pair of boots that my wife had taken off the night previous, and her shawl—the prisoner had left her own petticoats in the bedroom, and put on my wife's—I could not find the prisoner, but she came on the evening of 17th May, asked for my wife, and said, "I suppose you have been in search of me, I am come to throw myself on your mercy"—I sent for a policeman, and gave her into custody—at the station she said she had taken all but the shirt.</p>

I took the prisoner on 17th May; I took her to the station—she confessed that she took the shawl, boots, and the petticoats, but the shirt she had not seen—the female searcher found on her a duplicate of a shawl, which she had pawned in Wales.</p>

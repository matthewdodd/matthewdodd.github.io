                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, while you remained in or about the court, that you knew he had spoken untruly, because you were at Gravesend that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect saying I was at Gravesend that day—I said to Mr. Wood, I believe, that he (Spicer) had committed perjury, and I thought he had conspired to do so, and if I could bring it home I would—I might have said I was at Gravesend that day—I will not say whether I did or not—I was in the habit of going to Gravesend on Wednesdays and return<lb></lb>ing on Thursdays—I will swear I did not say he had spoken falsely <hi rend="italic">because</hi> I was at Gravesend that day—I do not recollect making any observation about Gravesend at all—I might have said I was at Gravesend that day, but not that he had spoken falsely <hi rend="italic">because</hi> I was there that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say you knew he bad spoken falsely, for you were at Gravesend on that 15th of August, or words to that effect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I will not swear that—I will not swear whether I did or did not—I might have been at Gravesend that day, because I was in the habit of going down occasionally on Wednesday and returning on Thursday—I had a recollection, while at the Court, that such might have been the case, and I might have said so—I had a recollection that I went down occasionally, and it might have been that day—I will not say whether or not I said I was at Gravesend on the 15th—I do not recollect whether or not I said anything about Gravesend—I said if there was a possibility of bringing it home, as the man had perjured himself, I certainly would do it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had Mrs. Pridmore offered you the money for this rent before she left? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—that I swear—she never tendered me any money since she paid me the last quarter's rent—she did not give me notice to quit—I gave her notice—she quitted before the quarter day—she had given me a verbal notice three quarters of a year before—she gave me notice, about Christmas, that she intended to go in March—she might have gone if she pleased—I did not care whether she went or stopped—she was ill at the time that quarter expired—I did not say, as she was ill I would not turn her out, and she might remain in—I swear that—she remained till the quarter af<lb></lb>terwards—I might have told her she might remain as she was ill—I will not swear whether I did or not—very probably I did, but I do not recol<lb></lb>lect—I must have given her leave to stop, but I do not recollect having any conversation with her about it—I did not give her leave to pay by the week or month, and go when she was well—I never gave her leave to go when she liked—I do not recollect whether I agreed to take such rent as should accrue due for the time that she remained—she paid the March quarter, and the next to that—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid into Court was for the time after that—it ought to have been paid up to September—the sum due was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I claimed a quarter—I do not know that my solicitor has taken the money out of Court that was paid in—I do not know whether Mrs. Pridmore was ill at the end of the June quarter—I very seldom saw her—she did not before she left offer to pay me the money due for the time she had been there, nor did any one—I swear that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter and glazier.

                  </hi>. I am now living in Great Ormond-street. My husband was defendant in the action of Harris against Pridmore—I lived at Mr. Harris's, in Percy-street—I was very ill for a length of time, and stopped there after the full quarter, as a weekly tenant—Mr. Harris and all my friends knew that—when I left I went to Mr. Harris's room, and of<lb></lb>fered him the money that was due up to the time I left, and he refused to take it—he said he would not take it—I asked the reason—he said because he would go and see what damage had been done to the rooms, and I gave him the keys, and left that same evening—Mr. Harris knew the whole of the time that I was stopping as a weekly tenant, because my husband was in the country, and of course he knew that directly he came back, and I was able, I should move—it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I offered him, which was the amount of the weekly money up to the time I left—Mr. Harris, my brother, my</p>

               <p>husband, and I had been on visiting terms—Mr. and Mrs. Harris some<lb></lb>times spent an evening in our apartments—if Mr. Harris has sworn that I never offered to pay him any money it is certainly not true—I offered to pay him, and when he refused to take it, I left that same evening, Mr. Pridmore then directed his attorney to pay Mr. Harris the money—my husband is here—Mr. Collier is our attorney, and Mr. Wood—I believe they had been concerned in my husband's affairs before—he kept a public-house in Tottenham Court-road, and they settled our affairs when we left—I left Mr. Harris on the 5th of August—the quarterly rent was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I never paid a whole quarter's rent to Mr. Harris—he always received it by instalments—there was an account between us—Mr. Harris sometimes borrowed money from us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You know Mr. Collier, do you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I have seen him—I cannot say when I first saw him—I suppose it is a year ago—I knew Mr. Wood first—I have known him about the same time as Mr. Collier—I do not know exactly how I first became acquainted with him—he transacted business for Mr. Pridmore—it is a year and half ago that my husband was a publican—he has not always been a publican—he was an independent man before that—he had private property, and we lived on an estate of our own—he took to the public line—he did not fail, but we lost a good deal of money—the public-house had no name to it, it was a wine vaults—we were there between two and three years—he has not been in any other business—he was in the fanning and grazing line—he is not any thing now—he has apartments in Frith-street, Soho—I have boarded and lodged with Mrs. Warne, in Ormond-street, ever since I left Percy-street—I cannot say how my husband gets his living—he would he very happy to get into some occupation—I do nothing for my living—I am living with a friend at present—I do not live rent free—I have not paid her any rent yet—I suppose as soon as my husband can get some occupation he will pay her—my husband has been out of business ever since we lost our property in Tottenham Court-road—he has been distressed in circumstances since then—it is very different to any thing we have been accustomed to—we have not been able to keep a home of our own for some time—I havenot any money, but I board and lodge with Mrs. Wame, and consequently I do not require any.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. come from which you tendered to Mr. Harris? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From Mr. Pridmore—when he came from the country he brought money to pay expenses that had been incurred—he was at the lodging for some time before I left—he brought the money to the lodging last August, and I offered it to Mr. Harris—my husband did not see me offer it—he said as I had had the transactions with Mr. Harris in paying our money, I had better do so then—he might have seen Mr. Harris if he liked—I wished him very much to do so, and wished him to offer the money to Mr. Harris.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. THOMAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the time you were in Percy-street, was he a good while away in the country? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know whether he has property which he expects to obtain—he has some—he sent me money occasionally from the country while I was in Percy-street—he did not come up till he came in August—he had some business to settle down there which detained him.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184002030016"></xptr>
               <p>the prisoner—I heard him cross-examined by Mr. Burton—I saw Mr. Harris there—I never saw him in my life before—I recollect Spicer being asked in cross-examination whether he would swear positively to Mr. Harris being the person to whom he tendered the money, and I believe he said to the best of his knowledge he was the man—after the trial was over Mr. Harris came up to Mr. Wood, and said, "Is your name Wood?"—he said, "Yes," and Mr. Harris said he would indict Spicer for perjury, for the day he said he tendered the money, he was at Gravesend—that was all that passed that I heard—I should not know Mr. Harris again if I were to see him.</p>

                  </hi>. I managed the cause of Harris and Prid<lb></lb>more—I know the prisoner—I employed him to take the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the plaintiff, Mr. Harris, on the 15th of August—it was about three o'clock, to the best of my recollection—he was to take it to a person named Harris, at No. 7, Percy-street, Tottenham Court-road—the action was brought in October—the rule was issued on the 1st of October, and appearance en<lb></lb>tered on the 14th of October—Mr. Pridmore called on me on the 7th—I heard Spicer examined at the Sheriffs' Court, and cross-examined by Mr. Burton—Mr. Burton said, "Can you swear positively that is Mr. Harris?"—Spicer said, "I can't swear positively, but I believe him to be the man"—I remember that distinctly, and you called my recollection to it at the time, if you remember, in the Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you after this pay him for doing that business of tendering the money for you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After he had gone with the tender, and brought the money back, not after the trial—I should say I paid him three or four days afterwards—it was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I think he brought me the money back the same evening—to the best of my recollection I said, "You tender this money, and make a note of it"—I am almost certain he brought it me back the same evening, for I was playing at billiards at the time under the office—I did not pay him the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that day—I did the following day, I think, or a day or so after—I did not expect any thing would be brought up about it or I should have made a note of it—I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into Court—the difference of expense in paying the money into Court, and pleading a plea of tender and payment into Court is about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is not the price of a writ—a writ would only be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a sum under 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you may pay money into Court without pleading a tender.</p>

               <p>Wood's offices"—it has been latterly, for this last six or nine months—it was altered six or nine months ago—Mr. Collier has another clerk, named Howell—I have been his clerk four years—I have never practised in my own name—I may have put my name to a brief—you have had many a brief from me, and therefore you take it from that—I was sitting by the side of Mr. Thomas to-day when the witnesses for the defence were sent out of Court—I was not a witness in the brief at that time—I was not aware at that time that I was to be called as a witness—I found out from your in<lb></lb>troduction to the Jury that I was to be a witness, but I did not know I was to be called on; besides, there was no one but myself here to conduct this case or to instruct Mr. Thomas—Mr. Collier is at home—I have known the prisoner four or five years, or it may be six; not more—I became ac<lb></lb>quainted with him by his repeatedly calling at our office in Chancery-lane, and meeting him at various places—I knew him when he kept a public-house—I did not go to his house—I know he kept a public-house some<lb></lb>where over the water—I cannot say how long he was a publican—I have employed him several times to serve writs—I never employed him to attend at the Judges' chambers, or to take out summonses—I have seen him once at the Judges' chambers—that was at the time this cause was pending, it was about going before the Judge about a summons to get a rule of Court for the following term—I have once before called him as a witness on a trial; never but once—that was about four or five months ago, in the cause of Haley and Burton, in the Sheriffs Court—he did not prove a ten<lb></lb>der in that case—he proved an acknowledgment of a debt which he had to collect—Haley is brother-in-law to Spicer, and he brought an action against one of his customers, who would not pay his score—Spicer was authorised to get it in, and he was merely-called to prove that—he does not keep any shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Recollect yourself, and tell me whether he did come back to you on the night of the 15th with that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think he did—I have no doubt about it, now I come to recollect—I think he came back between ten and eleven o'clock at night—he said he had been to Mr. Harris's, and Mr. Harris said he would not take the money—that was on the evening of the day I had given it to him—I desired him to make a memorandum of it—I should have tendered the money myself, but in consequence of several people being in the billiard-room I went down to have a game, and sent Spicer—I have not kept the note he made—he entered it himself in one of his own books—he brought it to me, and showed me the entry—there was no "four o'clock" on it, to my recollection—I heard him state when he was examined that he was there at four o'clock—I did not appear as a witness myself—I made an affidavit to oppose the summons before the Judge—there was no occasion to make one to oppose the new trial—it would only have been throwing money away—the affidavit is filed—I am certain I re<lb></lb>presented that I handed the money to this man to tender—I swear I did give him the money to tender.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say so in your affidavit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was not the question at all then—I have repeatedly employed this man to serve writs for me, per<lb></lb>haps twenty times—I cannot tell the last time—he went to serve a writ in Haley and Burton's case four or five months ago, but he repeatedly calls at Chancery-lane, and if a notice is to be given he can get 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by it—he calls nearly every day I believe—he calls three or four times a week—he never sits in Mr. Collier's office—he has sat there when I have any thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184002030018"></xptr>
               <p>for him to do—he has no writing there, except he writes a letter in the way of his own business—he never filled up any law papers there—I do not think he is fit to do that—I swear he never did in my presence, nor have I ever seen any filled up by him—he lives in Tower-street—he sometimes comes three or four times a day—I will not say that he comes five or six times a day.</p>

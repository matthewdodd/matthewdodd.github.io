I could see nobody whom I suspected, and in about half an hour, two officers accosted me in Newgate-street, and shewed it to me.

            . I am an engineer of Clerkenwell. I saw Mr. Brunton at the North-gate of St. Paul's, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from his right hand pocket, put it under his apron, and go away as quick as he could through the crowd. Colton took him in my sight, and took the handkerchief from him. I met Mr. Brunton in Newgate-street afterwards, and he claimed it.</p>

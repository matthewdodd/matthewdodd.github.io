            . I had put one Pint Porringer with 12 l. and a Paper with 6 l. into my Drawers. I called her up Stairs, to give me a clean Pair of Rolls out of my Drawers, to roll my Legs, for you must know I am pretty weighty, and my Legs are apt to swell. As soon as she had given me the Rolls, my Cook called out, Come down

            , and pare the Turmips. So down she went, and my Son came up, and the Drawers being open, he saw they had been cut. I was afraid I had lost all my Money; however, the Pint Porringer was safe, but the 6 l. in the Paper was gone; and by and by she came up again to lace my Scays. I told her the Paper was missing. Lord, bless me, says she, I wonder who could do it; but at last, upon examining her closely, she confess'd that she had taken it, and given it to a young Fellow, who persuaded her to it. She said he pulled out a Knife and swore he would kill her, if she did not get my Money for him; and that when she had given it to him, he said, Ye Bitch, this will serve me but a Fortnight. We took the Fellow up, but he brought several to his Reputation, and so they cleared him.</p>

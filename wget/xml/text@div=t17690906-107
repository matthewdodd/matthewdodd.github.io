I keep a little cart, and used to do jobs, I wanted a horse, so I went to Smithfield on the third of March to buy one. I went up to the rails, and saw a strong bay mare. I looked at her head, and asked the price of her. They asked nine guineas for her. I said she is blind of one eye. I looked about the market some time, and observed some gentlemen were looking at her as a man was riding her about. There came up a man in company with the prisoner at the bar, who said, Are you buying her? I said, Yes. He said she is a strong mare, but will not do for you: she is blind of one eye, and almost blind of the other, and has got a touch of the scurf upon her heel. I said, There are some gentlemen about her; I shall see if she stumbles. I concluded what the man said to be true, as she stumbled. He told me there were two very good ones, that were a little worked down, but the man would not sell one without the other. The one was for riding and drawing, the other for only riding. I told him I should be obliged to him to see them. He said he should be glad that I would. He said it is almost four o'clock, and the man would be here with them soon. He went about Smithfield with me, and seemed not to know the place where the house was. He carried me to the

             in Cloth-Fair, and said to the landlord, Has the man been here with the two horses that I was with last night? The landlord said, No, Sir, he is not come yet. The man said he was to come at four o'clock, and as it is almost four, he will be here soon, according to promise. He asked me what I chose to drink; I said, what he liked, I liked. He bid the landlord bring six-penny worth of brandy and water. There was a little room where a curtain was. He said, We will go in here, if there is no company. We went in. There sat the prisoner on one side the fire-place, and a man that they called a breeches-maker with something in a handkerchief, which seemed like a pair of breeches. He sat by the other corner. The prisoner had a bowl of punch before him. The man said as we went in, I hope you are not about business. The prisoner d - ning said, No, we are not; you may sit down if you will. We sat down and drank our liquor out. The prisoner was swearing many oaths; he passed for the captain of the Hawke Indiaman, and the breeches-maker called him Captain. The Captain said to me and the man that picked me up; You can't eat lobs couse; that we were poor farmers. Presently he takes a purse out of his pocket with something that looked like guineas, and threw them upon the table: then he snatched it up again. After that he took some real money out of his pocket, and went out at the door, and came in presently after. This man that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060076"></xptr> went in with me said, Our liquor is out, let us play for six-penny worth. I said with all my heart, that will not hurt us. The Captain came in again: then the man with me said, I'll do you over for six-penny worth. The other said, Aye. Then he pulled out with his six-pence some guineas and some half guineas. We won six-pence at hiding under the hat. I put the halfpenny under, and my partner lifted up the hat and looked at the halfpenny. Then he said to the Captain, What do you cry, a man's head, or a woman's head? The other said a woman's head. It was not what he cried. Then we won. The Captain then made a great talking about whores, that it was a great expence, and he did not mind money, saying, he had been among a parcel of butchers and had lost 50 l. The breeches-maker said, Sir, if I had not been there, you would have been almost killed. Then the Captain kept swearing and talking to him, and said, Here, you was a good fellow, here is a guinea for you, and laid a guinea into the breeches-maker's hand. The breeches-maker said, Sir, I don't desire it. Said the Captain, You was a good fellow, when the butchers won my money, take and keep it. Then the man put it into his pocket. After that, the Captain went out: he had got his pocket filled with liquor and came in with it, and we took share of it. Then he said, Have you a mind to play for forty, or fifty, or one hundred pounds? Said my partner, Do you think you can do him over? No, said I; I have not got any such money to play. I have but seven guineas, and that I intend to lay out for this horse that I wait for. Said he, Let us have a stroke at him for about a five-and-three-pence or half a guinea; that will not hurt us. The horse will be worth the money. So I did. We put the halfpenny as before under the hat, and my partner lifted it up, and looked at it, and said, Captain, what do you cry, a man's head or a woman's head? Then the Captain with an oath cried one of them. The Captain lost. This was for half a guinea. After we drank up our liquor, the Captain went out and brought in half a pint of brandy, and sat down on his chair again. The man that was my partner takes the pot, and pours his liquor into our bowl, and said, Drink heartily. I took it and drank, and he drank after me, and gave it to me, and I drank again. I then found myself quite intoxicated. I said the horse will not come, and I should lose my market, as it grew tish. He said, No, no, the horse will soon be here; you have no occasion to be in a hurry. Then he said to me, How much money have you got? I said, I have got but seven guineas. Then he said, What do you think of this fellow? (meaning the prisoner.) I said, I think he is a foolish fellow. The prisoner kept swearing and damning, that he did not value money; for what was money to him, he could go on board a ship and get money. Then he threw his purse upon the table again, and his guineas scattered about. He said, There, you may take some if you will. I said, I do not want your money. My partner said, He does not mind his money; you and I may as well win twenty or thirty of him. I said I have no such money to play. Then my partner pulled out a pocket-book, and took out a note drawn upon some banker for twenty-nine pounds, odd money. They looked at it, and called it a banker's cheque. Said he, You fool, if you lose, you shall not want for money; I will go and change this note, and get cash for it. He said, It is all nonsense to be afraid; we are sure to win. I said, If I should lose, I should not be able to get the horse. He said, No, no, do not fear, for I will get cash for this note, and let us play for twenty. I said, No, I can't. Said he, You have got seven guineas, and your watch value at three pounds, that is ten: let us drink again, and have better heart. So I drank, and being confused, I laid my watch and money down: the prisoner pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket, laid his purse in the handkerchief, took my watch and money, and wrapped all up in the handkerchief, and laid it on the table: then my partner said, Do not be dishearented, take a halfpenny out of your pocket. I did, Said he, Lay it under your hat. Then he took up the hat every time, and looked at the halfpenny, and said to the prisoner, What do you cry now, a man's head, or a woman's head? The prisoner, with an oath, said as it happened to be. He was to guess three times out of four for the whole money and watch. He guessed three times right. Then he takes and sweeps the watch, money, and purse and all, into his pocket. I then said to my partner, You will change your note. He said, Stay a bit, and I will. (I had tied my horse to the rails in Smithfield.) I said I will go and see if my horse is safe. I hope you will be honourable enough to stay till I come. I went, and when I returned they were all made off. I said to the landlord of the house, Where are the gentlemen that I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176909060077"></xptr> was with? Said he, They have paid their reckoning and are gone. I said, Do you know them? No, said he. There was a man with a whip in his hand, and a pair of boots on, said, They are gone into Smithfield after you. I rode into Smithfield as hard as I could, and came back again. There were two or three men said, they believed I had lit of a parcel of sharpers, and said they were gone the other way. There were several people came out and said it was a house of bad fame, and that bad people used it, but they said they would endeavour to remedy me. They told me to go my Lord Mayor, and acquaint him about it. (Since that the man of the house has left it.) I have been after the prisoner several times, but never could find him. I happened to be at Blackheath fair, and there I saw the prisoner standing close by me, dressed very grand, with ruffles on. I took hold of him, and charged him. The people said, I was going to rob a gentleman. I said, If I do wrong I must suffer; but I will tell no body till I come to a justice of peace. I got him by the collar, when two men came up and offered to strike at me with sticks, upon which the prisoner got from me, and ran in at the Green-Man. I ran in, and caught him by the collar again. Some people were for me, and some against me; but with assistance I took him before Justice Russel. The man that rescued him walked by me several times. When the prisoner owned before the justice, that he parted with my watch, and had had my money, one of the gentlemen that seemed to take my part, and the officer, were sent in pursuit of the men that cleared him from me, but they could not find them. As Mr. Nightingale's servant had found false money upon his man, I desired the justice to give me leave to search him. I pulled off his shoes, but found nothing upon him, but a pocket-book. Then the justice told me, as the fact was done in the city, I must take him before my Lord Mayor. I sent my horse and cart home, and brought the prisoner up by water. I brought him to this Session-house, the day the Sessions ended, the Sessions before last; he was committed to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. Did you not ask me to play?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>As I was sitting in the room, there came in the prosecutor and another man, they asked for a person; the landlord said he had not been there yet, but he expected him. I pulled out a guinea to pay my reckoning. The landlord returned it, and said it was too light. I pulled out seven or eight, and said he might take which he liked. These men were for playing a game at whist; the prosecutor said he did not mind three pence; he went out and called for brandy and water, and a pack of cards. The landlord said he allowed no cards: then it was agreed to toss up. The prosecutor said, That was all one, the landlord would hear us, and come in and prevent us. He was for hiding under his hat. They were to guess the best two in three. I won six-pence of the prosecutor, and when I went out at the door, he came after me and said, The gentleman has got a good ten or twenty pounds. I said, I never would play for ten or twenty pounds. Said he, Do not be afraid, you are winning. I said, What shall I do? I shall be ruined for ever. Said he, Do not be afraid, if you lose, I will make it up to you. Then I said, If you will be as good as your word, I will. He did not play with me at all, the other man and I played for seven guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Whether you did not come out of the room to persuade me to play?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never went out of the room till I had lost all my money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. His partner struck me.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. My partner was quite complaisant with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They both talked together, as if they had been acquainted seven years.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never saw the man before in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was just come out of the country: I never saw one of them before. I lived with my mother. She gave me twenty-nine guineas, when I came up from her.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw him shake the bag, a little money came out, not all. I imagine the false money was fastened in.</p>

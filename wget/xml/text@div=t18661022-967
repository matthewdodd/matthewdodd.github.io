E.—I paid it in on 5th June, and it was returned to me on Wednesday marked, "No effects"—I sent for Collins—he came, he said he was very sorry and he must pay it—I said, "You have endorsed it, and of course I look to you for it "—he has not paid it—I called at 163, Strand—there was no one living there of the name of Neate—there were brass plates out-side the door with Neate &amp; Co. on them.</p>

We don't want a constable in uniform. I believe what you state is correct, that you are a constable"—he then walked quietly with me to the station—Allen came up on the first examination, and gave evidence on behalf of Collins—he said he received the cheques from Neate, as an agent, in payment of salary, and that he got Collins to cash the cheques for him, and that after he had</p>

I was, at eight o'clock at night, or a little after; I had been drinking some beer, I was quite sober; I had two bundles with me, they were laying on the tap room table; I brought one bundle out of the city and the other out of the City road; the bundle contained things for my wife to wash; the bundle that I lost was two shirts, two waistcoats, and a pair of nankeen trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there - A. The prisoner was in the house drinking there; she was sitting at the same side of the house as I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you much acquainted with her - A. No otherwise than she lived in the same parish in Islington. I cannot say where she lived then.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she sit by the side of you - A. I cannot exactly say; she went out several times during the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What stay had you yourself made in the house before you got up to go away - A. I might be there an hour or two; it was about dusk when I came in, and it was a little after eight when I got up to come away; the prisoner was not there then.</p>
               <p>Q. On missing this bundle what steps did you take - A. I made but little enquiry that evening; the next morning I went after her and found her in Dyot street with part of the property wrapped up in her apron. I had no information that led me there; but going round to the pawnbrokers, I stopped the prisoner and asked her where the remainder of the property was. I found upon her a shirt and a pair of nankeen trowsers; I took them from her; she said the remainder was in pawn. She went to Mr. Hinckesman with me, and there I found the remainder of the property - two waistcoats and a shirt.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in company with the prosecutor, drinking with him at the Bluecoat Boy. I left my prosecutor and went out; I was met by a young man in Holborn with this bundle; he asked me to go and pledge the things, which I did; part of the property which I had on me he left me; when the prosecutor met me I gave it to him; he asked me where the other part of the property was, and I told him.</p>

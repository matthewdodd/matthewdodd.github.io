               <p>Mr. Taylor. Mr. Evenden came over to me, and told me he had mistrusted his servant of wronging him; that he had missed two shillings and sixpence out of three shillings and sixpence that he had marked. The Prisoner was going to make a holiday that day, I said he had better examine him now, and he called him into the comptinghouse, and said, I think I lost some money last night, and I insist upon seeing what money you have; and I saw the money taken out of his pocket, and he owned that he took it, and had kept it, and had taken twenty shillings more.</p>

               <p>"Where the deuce is that piece of pork gone?" I saw the prisoner was then standing behind the man - I went towards her; she went to go out of the door, and fell down - I went, and found two pieces of pork in her apron; I took her to the back of the shop, and found another piece of pork on her - she had not bought any thing; she had been there two or three Saturday nights with that man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not I ask you the price of the pork? A. No, she did not ask the price of any thing; I was going round to her, as I had some suspicion of her - one of the pieces I took from her apron was the particular one I had missed, and when I got her up the shop she dropped another piece; I did not push her against the counter - she had not bought any thing nor the man either; I saw no money.</p>

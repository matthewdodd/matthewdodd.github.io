            . I am a housekeeper. On the 14th of October I sent for the prisoner, who was my lodger, but had left me the day before, and owed me 4s.; when she came she asked how I was - I said," Very poorly;" she said, would I have some rum or gin? I gave her a shilling to get some gin - she then said would I have some rum or brandy? I had eight sovereigns in my pocket - I did not miss any till I was told by Spicer; I then missed three - I was in bed at the time.</p>

He gave me a sovereign to get half a pint of gin - I got it; I gave him the change, and he put it into his waistcoat-pocket - I went home to tea; before I drank the second cup he sent for me again -I went, and said, "What do you want?" he said, "To speak to you in particular;" there were five or six people in the room drinking gin - all those people went out except one, and then he sent for 3d. of brandy; he took it with some warm water, and had his bed made - Spicer afterwards came to me, and said Allen wanted to speak to me; I went to him - he gave me a shilling to get three quarters of a pint of gin; he then put this money into my hand, and said, "Keep this till to-morrow morning" - I said, "Allen, I don't wish to have any thing to do with it;" he said, "Take it, if it were 20l. I should not be afraid to trust you with it;" he was very much intoxicated- he had been drinking all day; next morning he met my husband, and said, "Fox, your wife can clear herself at Queen-square if she will say but two or three words - tell her to say I gave her that money to sleep with me last night."</p>

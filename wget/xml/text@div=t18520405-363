                  </hi>. I keep a beer-house, in the Fulham-road. On 28th Feb. the prisoner came, about ten minutes before 9 o'clock at night—he asked for a pint of beer, and put a shilling down on the counter—I found it was bad—I ran round to shut the door, and called to my husband to fetch a policeman—the prisoner said, "What is the matter, I can pay you for the beer"—I said, "You should have done that before you knew what you were giving me"—a policeman came, and the prisoner was given in charge—I and gave me six bad shillings in two pieces of rag—I gave them to the officer.</p>

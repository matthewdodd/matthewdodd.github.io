                  </hi>. I am a potter, and live at Plumstead, in Kent. The prisoner was my wagoner, as a regular servant—on the 16th of August, I sent him to Wood's, the nurseryman in Old Kent-road, with some flower-pots—he returned in the evening, and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said it was not convenient for Mr. Wood to pay any more—he ought to have received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—on Thursday last I sent him to town again, and gave him direc<lb></lb>tions not to call at Wood's, as I wished to speak to him—he came back in the evening, and I sent him to the house—he said he was summoned to Union Hall, for driving with rope reins instead of leather—I asked him what the fine was—he said "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I thought it was a very heavy fine, and asked him if it was all for the fine of the rope reins—he said the officers charged him with abusive language, and the charge was extra on that account—I asked him how much—he said 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I should inquire into it to see if it was correct—he told me that he went to Mr. Wood and got the balance, and paid it to the informers in the passage of Union Hall—he said he made up the difference himself, and the informers told him it would be less expensive than going before the Magistrate, and they divided the money between them—according to that he was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nurseryman. I remember the prisoner bringing the flower-pots—they came to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I paid him the whole sum on delivery—he gave me a receipt, which I have here—these are the words, "balance of account, "as it appears scratched out—it is as he gave it to me—he did not write it in my presence—here are twelve paint pots which were not paid for—he called on me last Thursday morning, and told me that after he had delivered the goods, he had had the misfortune to run against a chaise, and had to pay the damage out of the money he received of me; and he had told his master I had paid him the difference on account of the garden-pots, that he had got the money saved up at house, and intended to pay it to his master that evening—he begged of me to tell his master, if he should call that day, (which he thought very likely,) that I had paid the balance that morning, instead of the time the goods were delivered, as he was fearful he should lose his situation if I did not—I told him rather than he should get into trouble, and lose his situation, I would tell his master so—Mr. gates called in the afternoon, and asked for his small balance—I told him that I had paid his man that morning—I merely told him so rather than get the man discharged—I did not hear about the story of the fine.</p>

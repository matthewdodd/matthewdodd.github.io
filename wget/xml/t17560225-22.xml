I missed my handkerchief. I called to him, and saw my handkerchief in his left-hand. I push'd him into a pastry-cook's shop; and after that a woman pick'd up my handkerchief, which he had drop'd at the door (produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that was your handkerchief which you saw in his hand?</p>
               <p>Benson. I am as sure as a man can be to a handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Benson. It was light enough to see it, and I felt his hand in my pocket. I saw no body so near me as he was. I don't know the woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going along by the prosecutor, he catch'd hold of me, and said I had stoln his handkerchief; a boy ran directly from the side of me across the way. A woman pick'd up a handkerchief, and said don't accuse the man, I believe he is innocent, for I saw a boy run across the way.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Nichols. I have known the prisoner two years and a half. I never heard any ill character of him. I have lent him a guinea at a time, and he always paid me very honestly.</p>

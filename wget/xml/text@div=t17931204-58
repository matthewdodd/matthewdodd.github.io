               <p>I am a constable to the West India merchants; Wood called out, and I went to him, and found this sugar on the prisoner, there is fifteen pounds of it in all, it is raw sugar, I went to an hogshead and found the head part of it taken out, and I found a great deficiency in the hogshead, there was a great deal laid along side of the hogshead and scattered about.</p>
               <p>Q. It must be recently taken? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Wood. When I went to him he slipped down behind the hogshead that was broke open.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been at work on the keys about four hours for one man, and I was rolling the hogsheads along, and I picked these bits of sugar up, and then I went to work two hours more for another master, and when I had done I laid down by the side of the hogshead, and this same man came and took me.</p>

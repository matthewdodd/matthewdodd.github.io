BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you say to either? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Cole had admitted to us that Gordon's warrants were in the same condition that he had stated his own to be in; therefore when we met on this occasion it was to inquire the extent of the warrants of this kind, which we had of theirs as security.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Well, Cole having admitted something to you in the absence of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200063"></xptr>
               <p>Gordon, You afterwards saw Gordon at your counting house; now what did you say to him? <hi rend="italic">A. In</hi> the state of mind I was at that time, I should gay I said very little or nothing—I addressed myself to the point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Five minutes ago you said there was a good deal of conversation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No doubt there was, because it occupied a good deal of time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Cole had told you that his warrants were good for nothing, or doubtful at all events? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we had a notice that Gordon's war<lb></lb>rants were as bad—it is very likely that when I saw Gordon, I may have said to him, "Mr. Gordon, is there any foundation for this?" or some<lb></lb>thing to that effect, but there was no mystery about it—it was admitted, the conversation proceeded on the basis that there was nothing attaching to the warrants, that the goods had been separated from the warrants—(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">again objected to this evidence</hi>)—it is not difficult to explain it, if I might go back to the conversation with Cole.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You must remember the effect, at all events, of what passed between you and Gordon and Cole, on that occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Most decidedly; the effect was this, to satisfy me that we had been defrauded of an immense sum of money—I do not say by whom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just bring your mind to the time when Cole, Gordon, Boyce, and yourself were together, and state what then passed between you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What really and positively passed between us it is impossible for me to say, but I have no difficulty whatever in bringing to my mind the sub<lb></lb>stance and the result—in order to make you understand it, it is necessary, as I said before, to explain what had passed with Cole—I must tell you at once, that Cole had admitted to me in the morning that he had lent to Gordon these warrants, and that finding he could not get the warrants back again he had taken possession of the metals himself—now I am quite clear and I can proceed—I then met Cole and Gordon with the knowledge of those facts before me, and proceeded to discuss how we stood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you say to Gordon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing of any personal remark that I made to Gordon—it is said that I said Gordon was a thief—I do not believe I ever did say so, and it is not consistent that I should say so—how could I say Gordon was a thief at the time when Cole had previously taken the whole thing upon himself?—I really cannot recol<lb></lb>lect any personal words that I said to Gordon, nor can I tell what he said to me—I have no hesitation in telling you, because I have got it down in writing, in substance, what Gordon told me, which was this, after I had satis<lb></lb>fied myself of the extent of the fraud we had suffered under, I do not say who by, I proceeded then to consider what had become of the property, and from Gordon I got the history of the distillery, which I took down in writing, and have here present—I took it down upon the spot in my own handwriting, and the remainder my clerk took—I took down a very full and particular account of the property he had, as far as the distillery was concerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is important to us to know what Gordon said on the subject of these warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have nothing about that, it was no interest to us either one way or the other—I am not aware that Gordon said anything at all about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then am I to understand you as pledging your oath not to know whe<lb></lb>ther Gordon said anything about the warrants or not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly, you are to understand what I have said, that the conversation upon that was upon the admission that the goods had been separated—we were not aware of Gordon giving us positively to know either one way or the other.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200064"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then not being aware, probably you wanted to find out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we did not indeed, it was quite enough for us to know the calamity that had happened to us; we had quite enough to know at such a moment as that to hear that such a thing had overtaken us, without indulging in any personal animosity—I take it for granted that Gordon came there in consequence of my conversation with Cole, though I cannot positively say that—I sent for him, as anybody else would, to know how he stood in relation to his affairs with us, and to these warrants—I sent for him to know how he stood in relation to these warrants, that he might know from Cole what Cole had stated to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Having sent for him to ascertain how he stood in relation to these warrants, what did you say to him about these warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I proceeded immediately, as I said before, to know the depth of our involvement in these warrants, and then to know what had become of the property—I did know the depth of our involvement too soon, from Cole, who certainly was present, and told us that, as to the whole of the warrants which we held at Hagan's Wharf, the goods were not there to represent them—those were warrants to the amount of 80,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., some of which Gordon had deposited with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you ask Gordon any questions about that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not believe we did, simply because Cole had admitted that he had lent them to Gordon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Gordon admit or deny, or what did he say about the genuineness of the warrants? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember a single word having passed from Gordon on the subject—I then proceeded to learn from Gordon the history of the distillery, which I have taken down—I did not on that occasion take a promissory note, nor have I ever had any communication with Davidson and Gordon about that promissory note—I have not taken any promissory note whatever from Davidson and Gordon direct—we have a promissory note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I hold it in my hand, and there is the envelope in which it has been kept from the time we received it to the pre<lb></lb>sent time—I am afraid it is not necessary for me to answer whether it has been paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I see this is a note for 120,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on demand; "We promise to pay to Messrs. Cole Brothers, or order, the sum of 120,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; signed, Davidson and Gordon;" do you know whose handwriting that "Davidson and Gordon" is? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I do not know their handwriting exactly—I have no belief, I cannot answer that question, my clerk can, no doubt; I really cannot say whether it is Davidson's or Gordon's—there is no doubt it is one of them—I took this note drawn by Davidson and Gordon, endorsed by Cole, to sym<lb></lb>bolize the money which Cole said had been obtained from us, and lent to Davidson and Gordon, and I have kept it ever since—on the following day we received from Cole some deeds connected with the distillery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. The deeds must be produced, of course. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I shall be very glad to be examined on this, if you please, because a very great misunderstanding has gone abroad; it will not affect Davidson and Gordon in the least.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had any arrangement been made upon the sub<lb></lb>ject of the deeds while Gordon was present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly not; they had not been alluded to in the least degree—I have never, to the best of my knowledge and belief, exchanged a single word with Gordon about the deeds—I took down from Gordon all the particulars about the distillery on the 13th, and I have got it here for your information.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185508200065"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you expect the deeds to come next day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not the slightest idea they existed, certainly not—no conversation whatever took place between me and Gordon upon the subject of the lease of the distillery, so far as I know—when I received the parchments from Cole, it was not in accordance with any arrangement with Gordon previously—they remained in our possession, but we never took them as security, or asked for them—they never were sent to us as security, but when Cole became bankrupt, we returned the papers to the assignees—in the first instance they went to our solicitors, and then they were returned to us, and remained with us till Cole's bankruptcy—it did not turn out that Cole had no right to part with them—we did not ask for them—we gave them up to the assignees of Cole—our solicitor did, I believe in July, 1854.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the owner of the distillery at West Ham—I think I executed a mortgage deed to Davidson and Gordon in 1851, and they acted upon that mortgage in 1853—I was not in communication with them down to their bankruptcy—I saw them frequently—I was in commu<lb></lb>nication with them until they took possession of the place, and it was then arranged that they should pay a composition to the creditors of West Ham that was arranged with Gordon—that was properly carried out—I was not in the habit of seeing much of them, very little—I was over there occasionally—I recollect seeing Gordon in Oct., 1583—I saw Davidson in the first instance, I saw Gordon afterwards—that was some time in Oct.—he told me that he had told Chapman everything—I do not know about what—he merely said he had told Chapman everything—I asked him what he meant by everything—he told me that he had had large advances of money from Overend and Gurney upon warrants, and the goods belonging to those warrants were not paid for, and the party those goods belonged to had stopped the delivery—he told me this, by the bye, that he was obliged to acknowledge that he owed Cole 120,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him if he did, and he said, "No"—I then said, "What does Mr. Chapman say to all this?"—I must tell you that Mr. Gordon was evidently very much hurt—he told me that Mr. Chapman had said that he had always looked upon him as an upright man, and he was sorry to find that he was otherwise—there was nothing further that I know of—he then put on his hat and walked out—this was at my counting house—he said that Mr. Chapman had said that what had then taken place was not to be mentioned.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you sell the distillery for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not sell the distillery at all—the amount of the mortgage was 48,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were to pay a composition for me—I believe it was in this way, half a crown in the pound paid, and two bills at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—I was indebted to them to a large amount; that is, the distillery was—it is perfectly impossible to say to what extent when they took the distillery, it was nothing like 150,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I believe—I cannot rive you an idea—it is perfectly impossible—I can say it was not 180,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because the demand</p>

Was the sum demanded, and 90,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not in that account—that would not make 270,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. demanded—180,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was demanded—there was the demand in the first instance, and after that the account was rendered—it is a perfect impossibility to tell within 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. what I owed Davidson and Gordon, and I will tell you why; Messrs. Harding and Pulling, the accountants, have been engaged at the accounts some months, and they cannot find out what it is, not within 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot tell you anything further than I have just stated—the course of business was this, that Gordon and David<lb></lb>son received all money on my account, and paid all accounts—the book were kept at Davidson and Gordon's—I had my own books at home, as to the working of the distillery—before they had anything to do with the dis<lb></lb>tillery they had made advances to a large amount—I say there was a very large amount due to them, and then they took to the distillery—they said the amount of the advances was 180,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I am the Excise officer at the distillery at West Ham, and was so on Saturday, 17th June—I received this cheque there from one of the clerks—it was enclosed in an envelope and addressed to me—it is for duty to the amount of 2,070<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for spirits they were to send out that morning—the Excise cheques are paid through the Bank of England—I sent this cheque by that morning's post to the Bank of England, with a letter of advice—these other cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were not given to me—I know the amount of duty that was due to the Excise on 19th June, that is, from documented—these are the documents, but these were given in another course of business, these were paid to the collector—distillers pay their cheques to the supervisors for the facility of carrying on their business; perhaps they want to send spirits out very early in the morning, and the Board has authorized me to receive cheques to the amount of 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in any one day, provided the cheque is given to me so that it can be dispatched to the Bank of England by the first post in the morning—this cheque was given to me and dispatched to the chief cashier of the Bank of England by</p>

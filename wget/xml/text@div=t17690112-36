               <p>Q. Did you know him before?</p>
               <p>Moore. I never saw him before in my life. He finding I had more gold about me, seeing it in my hand, he asked me to let him see the pieces. I took and laid them down upon the table. I had given him one guinea, and there were eight more on the table. He took the eight up and put them in his pocket, and said he would act like an honest man. I asked him for them again; he said he would not give them me. When he would not return me my money, I took him before Justice Spinnage, the same evening. He told the Justice he had no money of mine. I told the Justice he had in his right hand pocket, and they were taken out of his pocket. They have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you any medicine?</p>
               <p>Moore. No. He offered me some, but I would not take any.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine and spirit-merchant, in Bishops gate-street. The prisoner was in my service about the middle of last March—I took him as a commercial traveler—I afterwards employed him to receive money on my account—I received this letter from him on the 29th of May—I know it is his handwriting—he sent it on Sunday—I gave direc<lb></lb>tions to have him apprehended the next day—there was an account due to me from Farr and from Furnaval—the prisoner has never accounted to me for the sums due to me from them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You agreed to give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week as salary, from my saying that 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was as little as I could do to travel on, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to live upon; you did this when I had been a fortnight or three weeks in your service, in presence of your wife; you applied to me to apply to the Gua<lb></lb>rantee Society for security for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but my two referees being out of town, I declined it, but I offered to procure you security for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from friends; your answer was, "Never mind, there is no occasion for it." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I wanted security, and they would not be security for him after making inquiries—I only agreed to give him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and said in a month or two I would raise him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, till it came to three guineas.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter read)—"</hi> Dolphin, Long-alley, 29th May. Sir, with feelings of true repentance, I make another appeal to you. I, on the other tide, give a faithful account of what I am due to you, from a consciousness that I have acted wrong. I hope you will this time forgive me. I have a friend who will be my security for the amount, if it be repaid, by instal<lb></lb>ments; if you will give me another trial, all shall be right for the future. I shall not absent myself, for the sake of my family. I hope this time you will be lenient. I shall be at the warehouse to-morrow morning, at nine o'clock. With all humility, and hopes of forgiveness, I remain, &amp;c.

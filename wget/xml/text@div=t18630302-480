                  </hi>.

Harding—I do not think he told me from whom he had obtained the bill—when bills are brought to me I am in the habit of examining the name of the firm on them—I do not know that I looked at the name on this one—I don't think I examined the accept<lb></lb>ance—I do not think I do so in the case of a person for whom I have done the same thing before—I did not make any inquiry of him as to whether this was the writing of the firm of Harding and Son—I saw him next day, and told him it was a forgery—he began to tell me the extenuating circum<lb></lb>stances that caused him to do it; that he was a ruined man, and had an execution in his house or something to that effect, and that he only wanted the money for two or three days, and I should only have had his bill in my hands for two or three days; something to that effect.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Messrs.

I beg to assure you, gentlemen, although the act was most blameable, I was innocent in intention of wronging your position commercially in any way. Knowing Mr. Passey most intimately, I felt convinced, under the most pressing circumstances, the particulars of which he has, that the temporary accommodation I required could be obtained from him without inquiry or exposure; the result, unfor<lb></lb>tunately, is too well known; my character, the maintenance of my wife and family, is entirely in your hands. I beg, gentlemen, that you will withdraw any steps you may have taken in the case, and in allowing the matter to rest without exposure you will confer a lasting favour on your most obedient servant, W.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 498). On the night of 20th July I was on duty in Bow-churchyard—I heard a noise about 10 minutes past 12 o'clock—I called the attention of my brother officer to it; it was but a few steps from the passage into the churchyard—the passage is about twenty yards from the corner of Bow-lane—I told my brother officer to go and see if all was right, and I stationed myself at the corner of Bow-lane—I saw the prisoner run out from the passage down Bow-lane, through Watling-street, and into Queen-street—he was stopped in Queen-street—about two yards from him I picked up this life preserver—I took the prisoner into custody—he said, "Don't hurt me, I am ill"—I said, "This is a <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> tool for a sick man to carry"—he said, "If you will believe me, I never saw it since 4 o'clock this afternoon"—I took him to the station, and left him there—I came back to the premises, No. 2, Bow-lane.; I saw the counting house of Mr. Clark and others—an iron bar had been removed from the inside of the window, and three squares of glass were broken, and one removed in the skylight over the counting house; I found a hammer, a dresser, and a chisel there; I took them to the station—the prisoner said, "I did not bring the hammer, nor yet the dresser"—I pressed the bar down with my hand.</p>

I was on duty in Queen-street that morning—I heard a cry of "Stop him!" and saw the prisoner run towards me—I stopped till he came to me, and then I caught him—when I took hold of him, he put his hand behind him, and threw something away, but I could not say what it was—he said he was very sick—I took him a few yards back, and Hilps came up—the prisoner then put his hand behind him again, and I saw this life preserver drop on the pavement; Hilpe picked it up, and told him it was a curious weapon for a sick man to carry—the prisoner said he had not seen the weapon since 4 o'clock that afternoon—I gave him up to the witness, and I went back on my beat—about half past 3 o'clock I picked up these four keys in a paper, in an area, where I first caught the prisoner.</p>

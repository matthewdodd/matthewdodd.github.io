On Saturday morning, the 26th of June, I was at home - a young man came into the shop, and wanted to be measured for a suit of clothes - he went into the back part of the shop, and tried on a waistcoat; and while I stood behind him, tying the waistcoat behind, I saw the prisoner come in, and saw him leaving the shop directly with a piece of cloth under his arm; he was not in the shop above half a minute - he had taken the cloth off the counter, for I had seen it there shortly before he came in; he walked away with it. I ran out, and stopped him six or seven yards off with it. I asked what he was going to do with the cloth - he said it was his own. A young man stood by; I asked him to assist me; the prisoner then dropped it, and ran away, down Whetstone-park, but was taken before he got out of my sight - I am quite sure he is the man. The shopman was in the parlour, attending to the man who came in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You were engaged tying the waistcoat - A. Yes. My attention was directed to that till I saw him going out; several persons ran after him. He has always said that I am mistaken in his person that he was in pursuit of the thief.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say that you saw him come into the shop - A. No; I saw him go out with it, and saw him drop it. I brought it back to the shop. I only saw his back as he was going out. I am certain it was him.</p>

               <p>"You have got my cloth." A person stood by me, tying up his shoe, and he dropped the cloth and ran away - thinking I might be charged with it, I ran after the lad down Whetstone-park; I was taken, and he said I was the man.</p>

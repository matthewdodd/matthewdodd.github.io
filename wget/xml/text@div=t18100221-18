On the 17th of February, about two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in and purchased a small quantity of print; she paid for it; she went away and took the print with her. On being informed by a lady that a woman was going up the street with a piece of flannel in her arms, I immediately pursued the prisoner, I came up with her about four hundred yards distance,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210012"></xptr>she had hid herself in a court, she had the flannel with her, I apprehended her and took the flannel from her. I gave the flannel to one of our people, they mixed it with the others, it was impossible for me to pick it out; I knew it to be my employer's property, it had our private mark on it, I kept it in my possession till I went to Marlborough-street; I then identified it, and then I gave it to the boy; he put it among other flannels. I had seen it half an hour before it was taken away; I am certain it was our flannel, it had our private mark which I had made myself; it was placed about eight feet from our door; there are twelve pieces of flannel placed at the end of the counter. At the time the prisoner took the flannel, there were no other customers in the shop besides three or four young men that belong to the shop and me. At the time that I took the flannel from the prisoner, she was in the utmost distress of mind; she has a husband and four children. I am confident in my own mind, that nothing but the utmost distress could have drove her to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are any of these young men here that were in the shop with you. - A. No, I am the only witness in this case, I value the flannel at twenty shillings.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

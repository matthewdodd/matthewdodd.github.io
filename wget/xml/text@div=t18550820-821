                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police at the Eastern Counties Railway, at Stratford. On 4th July, about 8 minutes past 9 o'clock in the evening, my attention was attracted to the prisoner—the passengers were changing from the Fenchurch-street train to the Shoreditch train, and the prisoner stood before the door, and prevented the passengers getting out or in—he was alone, I went and asked him what he wanted to stand against the door for—I took him away from the door, and in about half a minute I saw him against another carriage door in the same position as he was the first time—that was at the Shoreditch train that was standing there—it had been cut off from the other train—the prisoner was standing with one leg just inside the door, and his hand extended in the carriage—I took him away from the door and said, "This is the second time I have caught you against the carriage door, and there is not room for the persons to sit down; why do you stand before the door"—I saw him a third time go to a carriage and seat himself, and a woman immediately called out that she had lost her purse—she was standing against the carriage door, she pointed to the pri<lb></lb>soner and said, "That is the man"—I took him out of the carriage, and gave him in charge of two porters—another female who was sitting with her back to the prisoner handed me a parcel, which contained this purse wrapped in paper.</p>

               <p>was on the platform of the Eastern Counties Railway, at Stratford, just after 9 o'clock—I saw the prisoner take his hand from my pocket, while I was standing to get into the railway carriage—I put my hand to my pocket, and found my purse was gone—I said to the last witness, "That young man took my purse from me"—the prisoner heard that, and he put his band in his pocket and took the paper out, and passed his hand across where he was sitting—there had been 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my purse—my purse was picked up in the carriage—this is it—there was nothing in it, when it was picked up—I know that it had been safe in my pocket two or three minutes before—I have no doubt at all about the person who took his hand from my pocket—I had seen the prisoner as he walked along putting his fingers against the females' dresses, before he came to me.</p>

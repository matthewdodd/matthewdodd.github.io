                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, V</hi> 42). I took Phillips on 27th February—I said, "I shall charge you with stealing seven sheep, the property of Mr. Coles, on 4th December last"—I took the other, Hustwaite, next morn<lb></lb>ing—I said, "I shall charge you with receiving the seven sheep from Phillips, which were stolen from Mr. Coles"—he said he knew nothing whatever of them—he knew nothing about Phillips at all—he said, at the Stepney railway station, when he was walking up and down, "The b—sheep are dead, and won't come to life again, and who can identify them"—I saw him again at the Portland-town police-station—he then said he had seen Phillips, and that was all.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, James-terrace, Poplar—I was a sheep-marker—I was employed by Hustwaite on Saturday night and Sunday morning—I left the beginning of October—I have seen Phillips twice at Hustwaite's shop, talking to him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Phillip's Defence</hi>. Mr. Cole said he did not know Whether they were Downs or crossbreds—he knows his sheep are mixed, and he does not know which he lost. He leaves his sheep alongside of a country road, without any enclosure or anything to take care of them but a boy. If he left a boy with them he must have seen the sheep taken. The sheep might go where they thought fit. Isaacs is acquainted with Mr. Coles. He said before the Magistrates he caught the sheep and separated them from the drove, now he says he saw no marks on these sheep; he is the man who must have known these sheep, John Cross never came to recognize me till three months after the sheep were stolen. He never came to recognise me at the</p>

               <p>police-station, and when he gave his second evidence he did not know the day of the week or the day of the month that he saw me driving them, it was put into his mouth. I called the policeman and the prosecutor to order, and they got turned out of Court. One of the witnesses was driving on his near side of the road, and he told me to keep on mine. Adelaide-road is at least, by the wide turning on Primrose-hill, 30 yards wide, and if he and I were both driving on our near sides what opportunity had he of taking such particular notice of the marks on these sheep? I was brought here on another concern. I am innocent. I know nothing about driving sheep—Hitterchey, who is a returned convict, knows all about it. It is through a case that was tried here two sessions ago that I am brought here.</p>

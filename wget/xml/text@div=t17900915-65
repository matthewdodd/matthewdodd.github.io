               <p>I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased on Saturday morning after the accident: I found him laying on the bed in a state nearly delirious; that is to say, that he answered rationally to my questions, but occasionally at random: when I asked him any question beyond the first idea, I could get no answer: I asked him as to the accident, and he said he was struck by the man at the turnpike gate: I then examined his head; and while I was about it, he complained of great pain withinside his head: I found no fracture, but a vast deal of contusion about both eyes: the left eye particularly was very black indeed: the right eye appeared to have lost the sight: I found he could not see: I apprehended some injury to the brain: he was treated by every means that we can suggest on such occasions; and on Wednesday morning he died. On Thursday the coroner desired me to open the head: I wished them to send for another gentleman: they sent for Mr. Bliss, the surgeon of the work-house: I opened it alone: he came in at the latter end of the operation; and we found in the pasces of the scull, the bottom immediately above the orbit of the eye, a quantity of congealed blood, the consequence of his death, and the loss of sight, it must have been evidently occasioned by some external injury.</p>

               <p>- BARNEY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon, at Sudbury. I attended this man after he came from the hospital: he came to me on Sunday, the 11th of July, with a large wound in his leg; from his mode of behaviour, from his conversation, and in a word, the whole line of his conduct, it was such, that I judged him at that time, a lunatic: I continued to see him daily from that time: but the 17th, when I found there was no doing any thing with him, and that he was a dangerous man to society, I recommended him to be got into St. Luke's: and till then to be conveyed to Mr. Harrison's private mad-house: that I would fill up certificates, and get a friend in town to sign them, and to take them with him: the certificates were, that in my judgment, he was a lunatic: after that, he was a little more peaceable for a few days: his father, I understood, was out on business, and there was no conveyance for taking him: his leg got better, and he continued under my care, in order that he might be got into St. Luke's: he continued with his leg getting considerably better, till this accident happened: but I have no doubt in the world of his being a lunatic: for I had filled up the necessary certificates ten days previous to this.</p>
               <p>Court. When was the last time that you saw him? - I saw him on the Sunday and Monday before; the day before.</p>

               <p>You then judged him to be in the same state? - Undoubtedly; and I particularly recommended his being taken to the madhouse;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150085"></xptr>and I desired his friends to take every care of him: in his conversation he was perpetually threatening them, particularly his mother.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, if I saw the least reason in the world to hesitate about this, I would go on: but I think it is such a clear case of lunacy, I think we may with perfect confidence rely upon it, that he was a lunatic at the time the fact was committed; if so, it is to no purpose to continue it.</p>
               <p>The Court ordered the prisoner to be detained till an order for removing him to a proper place.</p>

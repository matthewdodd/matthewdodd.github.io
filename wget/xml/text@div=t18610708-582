                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Flynn, of 11, Gun-square, Houndsditch—I knew Catharine Daley a few years back—on 6th June I met her about 11 o'clock, and went with her to a public-house to give her a pint of beer—the prisoner and her husband were there before we went in, and a lot of people drinking—we drank the pint of beer, and the prisoner's husband asked the deceased if she would have a glass of stout—she said, "Yes"—he said, "Kitty, how many years since you and I slept together?" she said she never slept with him, but when she slept with a man it was a good man, and it was in a foreign country—a few words occurred between the prisoner and Daley, and the prisoner struck her with a quart pot, across the nose, and said that she would do the same to any person who would take her part—Daley staggered and went over by the wall—she bled fearfully from the nose, about a quart of blood—I said, "It is a shame to see a woman bleed to death like that, and the barman came out and helped me out of the bar with her—I am quite sure the prisoner was in the public-house before—the deceased did not say, "What authority have you over the man; but they called one another names for about five minutes—I did not hear the prisoner tell Catharine Daley he was her husband; she knew that, because they had known one another for years—the prisoner called Catharine Daley a whore first; and she said she was none, she was a married woman, and her husband had gone to gaol—that language continued for about five minutes before she took up the pot.</p>

I am barman at the Blue Peter, Rosemary-lane—my attention was not drawn to the parties before the quart pot was used, and I cannot say what passed; but I saw the pot taken from her hand after the blow was struck—I do not know whether the prisoner was in the house before the deceased—I could not hear what was said, but I have no doubt it was aggravating language.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon to the London Hospital—on Friday morning, 7th June, about half-past 1, the deceased was brought there with a compound fracture of the bones of the nose—there had been a great deal of blood lost, and she was still bleeding—we checked the hemorrhage and sent her to bed—she died on Monday night at half-past 8, from delirium tremens: produced by the blow, acting on a drunkard—I consider that she was tipsy when brought in, and I judge from her appearance that she was a woman of intemperate habits—the bone was not only broken, but it projected through the skin—the wound in the flesh was caused by the broken fragment of the bone—it must have been a violent blow—the bones are rather strong there, because they are arched—if she had been in good health, it would probably not have killed her—a quart pot is not a more dangerous thing to strike with than any other blunt instrument—they are not all sharp at the bottom.</p>

            . The Prisoner brought this Coat to sell in Rosemary-Lane. A Man that lives there agreed to give him 8 s. for it, but was dubious about his Property in it; I being present, the Prisoner said, if I would go with him, he could satisfy me about his Character; so I went with him to one Bigs's against St. Giles's Church, but he was not to be spoke with; then he carry'd me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173704200013"></xptr> me to another Place, and at last to his Father's, and his Father came back with us, to the Man that was to buy it; but he not liking the Men, would have nothing to do with, so they had it away again. Some little Time afterwards, Mrs. Myers came to the Shops in Rosemary-Lane to enquire after such a Coat; I found the Prisoner out and got him committed; this is the Coat.</p>
               <p>Myers. This is Uriel's Coat.</p>
               <p>Uriel. This is the Coat I carried Myers to clean.</p>
               <p>Defence. I went to Rosemary-Lane to buy a Coat, and as I was going along, I met a Man with this upon his Arm, and I bought it; 'tis a great deal too little for me indeed, but as it came cheap, I bought it; I gave 6 s. and a full Pot of Beer for it.</p>
               <p>Q. This is a good Defence; can you call your Witnesses and prove it?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, I have no Witnesses. <rs id="t17370420-21-verdict107" type="verdictDescription">

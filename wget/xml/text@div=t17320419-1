Now you must know, my Lord, that I was robb'd last Monday was a Fortnight, and so thinks I this may be one of the Rogues, and with that I took a Candle to see how it was, but as I went cross the Yard, the Wind blew (my Candle out; however, I went on, and Tugg'd the Boy (the Prisoner) out of the and found he had got a couple of Cheeses. I ask'd him how he came by them? and he asked me What Business that was of mine, and presently up steps a little whissling Creature, and says, Damn your Eyes, you Bitch, what's that to you where he got them, they are none of yours. Upon that I made my Husband fetch a Constable, and so we secur'd the Prisoner, but the other Boy got away; and then says the Prisoner it was that Boy that stole the Cheeses from a Shop in Middle-Row, and I was only going to sell them to Mr. Winniat the Brandy-man, and was to have half the Money for my Pains.

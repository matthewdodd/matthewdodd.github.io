On 12th June last I went to Mortlake with Mr. Jones's clerk, and the messenger of bankruptcy, to see Bishop—at that time Hopkins had made some statement to the assignees—we told Bishop that we had received information that Park-farm was bought with Swan the bankrupt's money, and requested him to give possession of it to the messenger, who was there with his warrant of seizure—he made no reply—I put the question again, he still continued silent—I handed him the warrant, and told him that the assignees having received that information, it was their duty to come and take possession of the property, and he had better give it up quietly—he made no reply—I said, "You had better look at the warrant of seizure, and see the nature of it"—he took it, and read it through very slowly—he was long enough to read it twice through—I put my hand on it, and said, "You have seen enough of it now," and handed it to the messenger—he said, "I have no property belonging to Swan; this is all my property here, and I defy Swan or anybody else to take it away from me"—I again requested him to deliver it up, and told him if he would act honestly, the assignees would remunerate him, and he should have the benefit of the poundage which would be allowed, if he would do his best to assist the assignees—the messenger repeated the same thing, in other words—I said, "But has not the bankrupt advanced you the money to buy it?"—he said, "Whatever has passed between the bankrupt and me has nothing to do with the property here."</p>

                  </hi>. I am wife of last witness, and know Bishop—I have frequently been present when he and my husband were together-Bishop inquired of my husband if he knew of a farm, and when he had taken this farm, he came and told my husband so—he said he was taking it for his <hi rend="italic">governor</hi>—he said he was a draper, and the father of the children Mrs. Bishop had to nurse—he said he was to manage it—he said it was the person Hopkins carried the goods for—I recollect seeing him on Sunday, 31st Dec.—he said the prices were very bad at market, and he was afraid he should not give his <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> satisfaction if things went on like that—I heard from him that he had won money at a Derby sweep—it was on a Saturday evening, at the latter part <hi rend="italic">of</hi> 1846, I met him and congratulated him on his good fortune, as he had been out of work some time—he said, "Yes, it will enable us to pay a few bills"—I believe he said something about a doctor's bill, and that his daughter had been out of her mind.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is Hopkins a friend of yours and your husband's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, we only knew him by living at Bishop's—I was not examined at the Bankruptcy Court—I have not seen any reward—my husband is not to have 5 per cent, and Hopkins the other 5, that I know of—if he was, I am sure he would have told me—this is the first I have heard of it—I never heard Hopkins was to have any reward—I heard my husband say, when he went to the Court, he saw it written up or printed—he was summoned to the Court</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, at Walham-green. I let Bishop a cottage, in a field called Farm-lane—he came to me before Christmas, to pay the rent—I said I understood he was going to Richmond, and asked him if he should require the cottage now he had got another situation—he said he was not certain whether he should continue there or not, his wife was there, keeping a nursery of children, and he should retain the cottage for the benefit of his family.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> How long had be occupied this cottage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Since 1844—he always paid his rent regularly—he had lodgers—when he took the farm he let the cottage to a person named Tillyer, who is there now, but he continued responsible for the rent; and paid it—I never knew anything to his disparagement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brewer. I was the former proprietor of the Park-farm—there was a valuation made of the farm and stock before Bishop came in, altogether it was 349<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Bishop had the valuation paper (<hi rend="italic">John Edward Largess, clerk to Mr. Jones, proved the service of a notice left at the office of Mr. Price, the prisoner's attorney, to produce this paper, but this notice was held not to be sufficient</hi>)—Bishop paid me 349<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, a few days before Christmas I believe, and the rest, 299<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at Christmas, or a day or two after—Mr. Fricker, the auctioner who drew up the writing, was present when he paid it—Swan was on the premises, but whether he was in-doors or not I could not swear—I believe I only saw Swan once before the purchase—I was not present at any conversation between Swan and Bishop about the farm or about the money—Bishop did not tell me anything about who he was purchasing it for, neither before or since—Bishop came two or three times, by himself first—I once saw him and Swan together, before the purchase—I do not know that Swan interfered at all about the farm—Bishop talked to me about it, he asked me if I would let it, that was when Swan was present—Bishop never told me from whom he received the money to purchase the farm—I was not examined before the Commissioner</p>

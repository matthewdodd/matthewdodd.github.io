               <p>Q. Were you in the shop at the time this dowlas was taken away. - A. Yes, the dowlas was kept in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it taken. - A. Yes; about five o'clock the prisoner came with two other boys, and asked for a pair of gloves, one came with him and the other staid at the door; I shewed him some, he said they were too little, and the boy that was with him, called him by his christian name, he said chuse them large enough. There was nobody serving in the shop besides me; the boy that was with him seemed to press to the window where the dowlas was laying; I kept on this side of the counter, in order to guard the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect that they were about something of this kind. - A. I did, when he said choose them large enough; I handed the prisoner another sort of gloves; while I was doing that, the second boy put his hand behind my back, and snatched the cloth from the window; I saw it, I had not power to stop him, he ran immediately off. I detained the prisoner on suspicion of being an accomplice; I cried stop thief, my lodger was in the parlour; he pursued the other, he could not catch him; my cloth was lost, I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped this boy, did he offer to stir from the place. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the boy who stood at the door. - A. He ran off with the other. This boy wanted to pay for his gloves and go, he had fixed on a pair; he was searched at the office before the magistrate, he had money enough to pay for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this seventeen yards of dowlas. - A. Twenty five shillings. The prisoner denied knowing the other boy; the other boy calling him by his christian name, that is the reason I detained him. They knocked at the door and all three came in company together to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. When he called him by his christian name, did he seem to be familiar to him. - A. Entirely so.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen this boy before. - A. I never did; at the office he gave his name

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Poplar, and am a draper. The prisoner was in my service-in consequence of circumstances I marked a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence, on the 16th of July, I gave it to my wife, and directed her what to do with it—I went from home about two o'clock—I came home about half-past five o'clock, and then called the pri<lb></lb>soner—I desired him to empty his pockets, and when he put a portion of the coin on the table I saw one shilling, marked with the letter "L"—I went for a policeman, and a half-crown was found on him, and a sixpence, all stamped with the letter "L"—that was the money that I had stamped and given to my wife.</p>

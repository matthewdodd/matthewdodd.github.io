            . I am clerk to Mr. Wynne, of Cambridge-street, Hackney-road, coal-merchant. I lodged at Mr. Newson's, in Cumberland-street - the prisoner also lodged there. On Thursday, the 10th of January, I had some conversation with him in the evening, in the course of which he showed me a bill - (looking at the bill) this is it; he showed it to me, and remarked that he would pay my landlord, Mr. Newson, the amount of his bill if he could give him change for a 100l. bill, he then put this bill into my hand - I read it over, and remarked that it was drawn out in a very unusual form; he answered that it was drawn out by a lady - this was about ten o'clock at night; on seeing him next evening, when he had reached the stairs leading to his bed-room, I called after him, and asked him if he had got his bill cashed - he returned to me, and said he had no knowledge of having shown me the bill, and said he had not got it cashed, but he should get it cashed in the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You remarked on the extraordinary nature of the bill? A. Yes; I never saw one begin in that style before - it is the clumsiest performance I ever saw; I cannot make the name to the acceptance "Coke" - it does not purport to be endorsed by Bloom; I never saw an endorsement begin with "Messrs."</p>

On Thursday, the 10th of January, he came home about ten o'clock at night, and appeared to be in liquor - he asked if I could give him change for a bin; he owed me about two guineas - I asked him the amount of the bill; he said it was a 400l, bill - I did not read it myself; it was shown to Mr. Woodcock in my presence; he had lodged at No. 26, in the same street, previous to coming to my house; he was not lodging there in January.</p>

On Saturday, the 12th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140081"></xptr>of January, I came to business at ten o'clock in the morning, and found the prisoner waiting in my counting-house - I believe him to be the man, but did not take much notice of him; I learned from him, that he came to make inquiry about a bill - he said the bill was at Barclays' - he said he was clerk to Messrs. Oxley and English, and was sent by Messrs. Barclays to make the inquiry about the bill; I do not recollect his saying why he was sent - he did not say why it was necessary to make inquiry about the bill; I told him I knew nothing about it - Mr. Samson Hanbury, my uncle, was not in town that day - he only comes to town on a Thursday, once a week; I said nothing to the prisoner about Mr. Samson Hanbury; while I was talking to him my attention was called to a letter addressed to Mr. Samson Hanbury - this is the letter: it was brought to me by one of the clerks from the letter-box, unopened - on inquiring about the bill, one of the clerks said, in the prisoner's hearing, that there was a letter from Barclays' which might refer to the subject, and this letter was produced - I opened it in the prisoner's presence, read it, and said to the prisoner, "I will inquire about it;" he immediately left - I gave him no letter to take to Barclays', nor was any given him by my direction; I have a clerk named James Young, but no

            . I am one of the City Police. In consequence of information on the 12th of January, I took the prisoner into custody at Barclay's bank; I searched, and found a key on him (looking at several letters and papers); I found all these on his person - in consequence of something I observed on the letters, I went to No. 26, Cumberland-street, and saw Mr. Purchase who brought me a box, which I tried the key to, and it opened it - in the box I found several papers and letters, in consequence of the directions on some of them, I went to Brisley, in Norfolk - I found some letters there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you knew him when he lived in the country? A. Yes; he was about nine weeks at my house - I have known him altogether about five years; he bore the character of a respectable honest man - he was formerly a schoolmaster, but latterly kept a new beer-shop.</p>

            , ESQ. I am one of the firm of Hanbury and Company of Brick-lane0. (Looking at a letter with a post-mark dated the 23rd of November, No.3) this is my hand-writing; there is something under the signature which is not my writing; I wrote the letter in consequence of an application for assissance from R. S. No. 26, Cumberland-street, Hackney-road - (looking at another letter, No. 1;) this is not my hand-writing, not one word of it - the name is something like my signature; I do not think it much like the signature to the letter, I wrote; the same characters are used; the letter, was not written by my authority at all; the endorsement Samson Hanbury on the bill is not my hand-writing, nor written by my authority - I never saw the bill till it was shown to me after the prisoner was taken.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the banking establishment of Messrs. Hammersly. I am acquainted with the hand-writing of Mr. Coke, of Norfolk; this acceptance is certainly not in his hand-writing; it is an attempt to imitate it, but a very bad one.</p>

            . I am a partner in the firm of Oxley English and Oxley, of Lynn, Norfolk. The prisoner was never a clerk in our house; I have no reason to suppose this bill was ever in possession of our house - the endorsement is not our writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The firm is not properly described on the bill? A. Yes; it is English and Co.; we do not endorse bills in this way with "Messrs." before the name, nor write Lynn under it. I see many bills in the country drawn as clumsily, and should not object to take such a bill if I knew the person; I know nothing of the prisoner - Lynn is about twenty-five miles from Walsingham.</p>

               <p>SIR, - As you request a line from me, in reply to your letter of yesterday, I beg to say, it is not agreeable to me to interfere in the affairs of a stranger. S. HANBURY.</p>
               <p>At the bottom of this letter several attempts had been made to imitate the signature; other papers were found on the prisoner, which were produced, upon which were written the name of" F. Joke or Coke" several times; also the words "accepted and payable at Mr. Gurney's bank, Fakenham;" the form of a bill for 447l. on

            Coke, Esq., Walsingham, and various attempts at making an acceptance, and the signature of J. W. Joke.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. I have seen a great deal of Mr. Coke's writing; he writes the first letter of his name rather carelessly - it is something in the shape of a C.; I cannot say it never resembles any other letter.</p>
               <p>MISS BLOOM. I have been at Walsingham very frequently: it is a village - there is no Coke, Esq. there but Mr. Thomas William Coke.</p>
               <p>The prisoner handed in a paper, simply declaring his innocence, in addition to this, he made the following:</p>
               <p>Defence. Gentleman. I was perfectly aware I should be taken into custody at the banking-house, because I was aware that Mr. Hanbury was there; is it probable, if I intended to commit a fraud I should have suffered more than two hours to elapse between the time of my going to Mr. Hanbury's? or that I should return to the brewery two hours after, and inquire of Mr. Hanburys servant, at what time he would be at the bank? they said his usual hour was about two o'clock; I told them to tell Mr. Hanbury I would meet him there - I went and waited outside till Mr. Hanbury went in, and we both went in at the same time; I was labouring at the time under an abberation of mind, certainly I was not in a sane state at the time; is it likely I should have made two people acquainted with the bill under circumstances which would lead to immediate detection? if I had even got the proceeds of the bill; I stated to Woodcock that I was going to Mr. Hanbury's next morning, which he must recollect; the reason I went to Mr. Hanbury was, it was said the bill was sent in a letter, saying the owner would call in the course of the day, but I did not call, as I thought very probably, if I went, they might have offered me the cash, but that was not my object; I went in the morning and informed Mr. Hanbury of it; he said he was going into the City, and would call; now, if I had intended to get the money, should I not immediately have gone to the banker's, instead of waiting till I had been taken into custody? is it feasable that a man in his senses would have done that?</p>
               <p>MR. BEVAN. The prisoner must have been in the bank before Mr. Hanbury came in, for I had the letter in my hand, when he came into the room.</p>
               <p>MR. HANBURY. I understand he went and asked what time I generally went into the City; I do not recollect them telling me the prisoner would meet me there; I generally go into the City about one o'clock, but went earlier than usual, suspecting something.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live in Phoenix-street. On the 23d of August I was talking to two friends about having some porter, the prisoner came up, he pulled a table spoon out of his pocket, and said he had a spoon, I said it was too late in the evening to have a spoon to get something to drink with, he left us, we went into the public-house, he came in after us and offered me the spoon if I would pay for a pot of beer for him. I kept it till I came out, and then seeing a crest on it, I gave it to Kennedy.</p>

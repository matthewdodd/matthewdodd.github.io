I keep the John Bull, Tower Street, Lambeth—in eon<lb></lb>sequence of an advertisement in the Morning Advertiser, a young man appeared before me who gave the name of Thomas Phillips—I made this memorandum of my conversation with him, and went to the Golden Cross, Long Acre, about 4 p.m.; Young was behind the bar, and I said to him Has there been a young man living here of the name of Phillips?—he said "Yes, there was one"—I said "Is Mr. Young in?"—he said "Yes, I will go and call him"—he went into another room, and came back with Goddard—I said to Goddard Good afternoon, Mr. Young"—he said "Good afternoon"—I asked him if a young man named Thomas Phillips had lived there, and if he could gave him a seven months' character—he said "Yes, I can give him a good character; he can get up and open the house at 5 a.m., and I trusted him with money"—I told him that Phillips said he had left for no reason, only that his brother-in-law was out of a situation—Goddard</p>

               <p>pointed towards Young, and said either "my brothe" or "brother-in-law"—the name of Smith was over the door, and I said "What is the reason you have not your name over the door?"—he said "No one has interferred with me, and Smith's name is so well known I have not altered it"—I then left—Young could not help hearing what Goddard said; he was only seven or eight feet off—Phillips called on me on the 26th, but I did not engage him.</p>

               <p>Harper. I don't know, but I have heard them say he lives in Houndsditch, for only Morris went in with the things, and he met us afterwards at the Plaisterer's-arms in Duke's-place - this was about nine o'clock at night, there were three other Jews looked over them before the Prisoner, but did not bid so much for them by a guinea.

               <p>Harper. I can't say that, but he sat and drank three or four pots of beer with us afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner discourse with Morris before you about buying of them?</p>
               <p>Harper. No otherwise than between themselves; I saw Morris and him go out of the house together, Morris had the plate in his pocket, and the rest of the things in a handkerchief when they went out; Morris said he had got nine-pence a yard for the cloth, four shillings and six-pence an ounce for the silver, and twenty six shillings for the cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the Prisoner give the money for?</p>
               <p>Harper. I can't tell, only as Morris informed me, to be sure he would not give us the money for nothing; Morris said he wished he had money enough, and he would have bought them himself, for he thought them worth more money.</p>

I found he was for turning back, and I took fast hold of him, and took hold of his breeches, and said, Lawrence, cock your pistol: Lawrence said, I design to do it; Levi took hold of me, and tore my waistcoat and shirt almost to pieces; then one of the women took hold of him, and we secured him. <rs id="t17441205-36-verdict234" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, R</hi> 114). I am stationed at Woolwich—I know the prisoners—on Saturday morning, 28th June, as near 1 o'clock as possible, I saw them in company in the High-street—they came from the direction of the Steamboat Pier—they were 500 or 600 yards from it, and. about half a mile from Mr. Sparrow's, going towards it—they went into a public house—about a quarter to 3 o'clock I saw them together again at Rolf's Steamboat Pier—I was in plain clothes—Anderson was carrying this bag on his back, which I have had ever since, and Wilmott had these two umbrellas and stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his right hand—he took two tickets for London—they then had fifty or sixty yards to go to the dummy—they went on board the boat for London, and I followed them—they went to the aft part of the boat—Anderson set the bag down, and they stood and talked together, they then went to the fore part of the boat—Anderson carried the bag again, placed it down, and they both Rat down together—Wilmott put the umbrellas by his side—I went up and asked them where they had been to-day—Anderson answered, "What do you mean, sir f"—I laid, "Have you been to the barracks?"—they said, "No"—I said, "What have you got in this bag?"—Wilmott replied, "What do you mean, sir?"—he was then in the act of getting up—he went across towards the gangway, and ran out on to the dummy—Anderson was about to follow him—I laid hold of him, and called, "Stop thief!" after Wilmott, who was running up the steps—one of the captains caught hold of him and brought him back—Wil<lb></lb>mott asked me what I was taking him for—I told him for having taken two umbrellas—he said, "I never had them"—with some assistance I took them and the bag to the police station, having tied their hands together—when we got to the station I undid the bag and asked Anderson how he accounted for the possession of the property—he said, "I never had it"—the bag con<lb></lb>tains a writing desk and fourteen pairs of boots and shoes, the name, "J. W. Sparrow," on it—I found on Wilmott a counterfeit half-crown and a skeleton key merely to open a latch; but I do not think it was made for any particular latch, and fourpence halfpenny in money, and on Anderson,</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Sparrow, a solicitor, of Wool<lb></lb>wich. On Saturday, 28th June, the family left home, about 10 minutes before 11 o'clock, and I was left alone in the house—there are two offices where the business is carried on, one of them opens from the street, and then into the inner office—if a person goes into the house from the street door they can get by the passage into the office—there was nobody in the office—this desk is Mr. Sparrow's—I saw it that morning, after I was left alone in the house—it stood behind the door in the back office on a little shelf—this bag was in Mr. Sparrow's house that day, but it does not belong to him; a considerable quantity of boots had been sent for for the children to try on, and eight pairs were left in this bag, in the back office—I put it there myself—these things were all safe after the family left, on Saturday—about 3 o'clock a policeman came, and took me to the station, where I saw the things, and claimed them as my master's—I do not know their value—my master is not well.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When had you seen the umbrellas? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw them every day, because I had to dust them—the family had gone into the country, but only for two days; it was very fine, and they did not take the umbrellas—Mr. Sparrow left at 10 minutes before 9 o'clock, and Mrs. Sparrow, and the child, and nurse, at 10 minutes before 1—there were no clerks and no boy in the office—I and the nurse are the only domestics—I had not missed the articles before the policeman came—I bad not left the house—I went into the office just after Mrs. Sparrow left, to put the books on a ohair for the man who was to call for them in the course of the after<lb></lb>noon—there are papers and other articles in the office, none of them were disturbed—I noticed the umbrella stand when I went past it, because I put a cotton umbrella into it which was down stairs, out of its place; that umbrella was left, and is there now—I can swear to these umbrellas, this one has lost part of the top, it had a round knob about the length of the, silver.</p>

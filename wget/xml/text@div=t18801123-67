                  </hi>. I live at Fairlock Road, Leytonstone—on Tuesday, 9th November, I was in the Fairlock Road, by the Railway Station, about 11 o'clock, standing by the palings—I saw a cab about twenty yards off, and a man standing by it—I could not swear to him—he came from the cab and took my watch out of my pocket and my chain off, and ran and jumped on the cab, and the cab drove down the road as fast as he could—I was not in time to catch the horse's head—the man who took the watch was on the box of the cab, and no one else—I complained to the police on the Friday evening—on the Saturday evening, between 6 and 7 o'clock, Banks, an officer, and the prisoner drove to my lodging—Banks spoke to me, and I went away with him in the cab which the prisoner was driving, to Mr. Writher’s, a pawnbroker, at West Ham, Stratford—I went into the shop with the detective—the prisoner remained outside—he got off the cab—I saw my watch and chain—I said, when I got outside, "I give this man in charge for stealing my watch and chain"—he said that I could please myself but he did not do it—he wan perfectly sober—he drove away to the station at Plaistow, the detective riding on the box with, him—it was a four-wheeler—the prisoner stopped the cab on the road, jumped off the box, and opened the cab door—he looked round, and said to me, "For God's sake do not say anything more about it for the sake of my poor wife and child"—I said, "It is in the policeman's hands; I will go through with it now"—the detective, who was still on the box, said, "Come, jump on your box, and drive on"—the prisoner drove off again—he put his head right in the cab to say that—he said it pretty loud—afterwards he opened the front window of the cab, put his head through the window, and said the same words—I said, "If you had said that to me when on the box, I would have looked it over if you had owned to it, but now it is in the policeman's hands"—that was after the last public-house that we had stopped at—we had stopped at another public-house between the first and second conversation.</p>

I believe you railway porters know something about it"—I only know the porter by sight—the prisoner said he had bought the watch of a tramp, who was a man in light clothes; that was when we were going to the pawnbrokers—he</p>

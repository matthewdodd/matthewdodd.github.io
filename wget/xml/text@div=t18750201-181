                  </hi>. I am managing partner of the firm of Hammel &amp; Putz, chemical merchants of Cullum Street—I had a transaction with the prisoner about September last year—I bought some anthracine of him, according to samples—after purchase I took delivery of those goods and sent them away to the Continent to our customers—a claim was subse<lb></lb>quently made of 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the goods not being equal to sample—in con<lb></lb>sequence of that I communicated with the prisoner by letter, and after that I communicated with my solicitors—my impression is that we wrote to the prisoner—I think we wrote a letter making the claim—he then came, but I don't know whether he exactly said he would settle; but at all events he did settle the claim by sending the bill with this letter—this was dated September 28th, 1874, and stated:—"<hi rend="italic">Gentlemen, I feel exceedingly sorry that 'the goods should have turned out so badly. I can't make out how it is. I enclose you draft for the amount." The bill was for</hi> 127<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d., payable two months after date, dram, by Arthur J, Dickinson, accepted by</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Leonard Dickinson, and endorsed Arthur J. Dickinson.</hi> The bill was presented in due course and was dishonoured—I had had one letter from the prisoner's brother, and when I received the bill I believed the signature to be the signature of his brother, Arthur John Dickinson—it was presented at the Bank at Forest Hill, where it was made payable, and it was said there were no funds, and the defendant had left the locality—I then put the matter in the hands of my solicitors—I have compared the signature of the bill with the signature of various letters of the prisoner's which I have; X find it is the same handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This was the first transaction I had had with this young man—he sold the goods to me—I saw his brother in Fenchurch Street before the bill became due, and I asked him whether it was his sig<lb></lb>nature—at that time I had reason to believe that it was, from informa<lb></lb>tion I had received from various quarters about the prisoner—his brother said he would not answer any questions then, but when the bill became due he would—I don't think I told him what the amount of the bill was—I said it was a bill which his brother had handed over to me with his signa<lb></lb>ture—I never asked him whether his brother had authority to use his name—I did not communicate with the prisoner after what his brother had said—I might have seen him, but I don't distinctly recollect that I did—I know I met him after the bill was not paid, and I told him that it was a very bad case that the bill was not paid, and if he did not come and settle said it would have very serious consequences to him—that was after the bill became due—I might have seen him between the interview I had with his brother and the time the bill became due—we threatened to take criminal proceedings against him in reference to the anthracine because it had not come up to sample—after the bill was dishonoured I placed the matter in the hands of our solicitors—I went to the Mansion House to obtain a warrant—I saw his brother after the bill became due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I think it was about three weeks or a month after the goods were delivered that we found they were not according to sample—the delivery must have been some time in September—we found out we had been defrauded—we gave the prisoner notice, and after that we com<lb></lb>municated with Messrs. Pilgrim &amp; Philips, our solicitors—they wrote a letter—I said nothing to the prisoner about the bill being a forgery until after it was dishonoured.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's brother—I am a manu<lb></lb>facturing chemist at Deptford—my brother was in my employ and left about fifteen months ago, and started in business near me—I have seen this bill—it is not drawn or endorsed by me—the prisoner had no authority to sign my name to that bill, or to sign my endorsement, because he never mentioned it till afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My brother was nineteen last August—he was office boy with me at first, and looked after the men and signed orders and delivery notes when I was out—he had authority in the general course of business to sign my name to orders and bills of lading, and all those sort of things, when I was out there was no one else but him to do it—I was bound to trust him to that extent-<hi rend="italic">I</hi> have a great opinion of him, as I should have now—I never said anything to him about signing bills of exchange, but of course the bankers would not honour them—in all business transactions short of that, he had authority to use my name—I know that previous to this transaction he actually signed my name to bills of exchange, and they</p>

               <p>were paid at maturity and I never heard anything more about them—I recol<lb></lb>lect having an interview with Mr. Putz before this bill became due—it was in Fenchurch Street, I think in the doorway of 155—he asked me the ques<lb></lb>tion he has told you, and my answer was "Wait until the bill becomes due"—I did not say anything more than that, I felt very irritated, because he pulled hold of me by the collar—I knew of the bill before Mr. Putz spoke to me—my brother told me what he had done, and said it would be all right—he said he was in a mess with Putz, and he told me Putz's business—I was in hopes that he would pay it, and that the thing would blow over, because I considered him a fool—I found he was living beyond his means and I gave him a jolly good jacketing, and I lost my temper and went out of the house, and I did not go near him for some time because" I considered he was a young fool—he told me distinctly it was all right, and I should not have to pay the bill, that he would pay it, and that he had got some good staff going into Mr. Putz, and he said he had received 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Putz, and they said the stuff was all wrong—he was crying at the corner of Mincing Lane, and I was going to lend him money to pay his wages on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I only heard of the other bills incidentally—I did not give him authority to sign them—I heard they were paid at his bank—he was the drawer—I never knew anything about those bills of exchange, so I could not give him any authority to sign my name to them—I did not give him any authority to sign the bill in question—I did not know it till be came and told me after he had done it—he said "What am I to do?" and I said "Why did you go and commit forgery?" and he said they were going to prosecute him, and he began <hi rend="italic">blubbering</hi>, and I said "You are a young fool," and so he is—he had authority to sign bills of lading when he was in my employ—after he left me he used to come a short time in the day and look after the vans—he was assisting me till my other brother came up from Plymouth.</p>

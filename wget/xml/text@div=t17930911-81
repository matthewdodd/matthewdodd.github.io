               <p>I am a constable. On Friday the 16th of August, Mr. Duberley came down to the office at Bow-street, he wanted an officer, he suspected the porter had robbed him, to search his box; I went with him; he was seated in the room, and I asked if he had any objection to have his box searched? he replied, no. We went up into the garret, and we opened the box, found this piece of linen first, and in the box was found these two keys; these two keys being in the box, Mr. Duberley asked him where his box was he suspected he took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110135"></xptr>it? after a little hesitation he said he would go where it was; this was a box belonging to his master; he went with him to his lodgings, where he used to lodge, at one Mr. Godfry's, Castle-court, Castle-street, Oxford-market, and when we went there we asked for the box, it was brought out, and all the other articles in the indictment was found in that box; the box is here. (The articles produced.)</p>
               <p>Madgewicke. Here are eight pair of shoes, four pair of them marked with a K. and 7. four of them with a W here is a remnant of fine scarlet that I cut off the piece myself, it was laid in the counting house, and I did not know which way it went; here are a pair of flannel drawers, I can swear to them by the particular lining; I believe all the things to be Mr. Duberley's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing more to say than that I am innocent of it.</p>

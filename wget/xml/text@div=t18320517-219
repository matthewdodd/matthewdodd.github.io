I brought them up to town with me when his father sent for me - I worked for him seven years, and then for his widow, when this prosecutor turned her out of the house; and now he wants to get me out - he has reduced me to four days' work in a week; I used to live in the house. Witness. I had a spare room, and I let him have it - he said, when those things were found, that he brought them from the country; I cannot say any thing about the hammer and fuller, but I lost such things.</p>
               <p>HENRY HUDSON. I work for the prosecutor. There were two pairs of callipers there, and this pair I can be certain of; I have known this these twelve years - this hammer I am certain of, the prisoner made it himself.</p>

            . I work for the prosecutor. I have known this hammer for eighteen months, and this fuller I can swear to by some marks on the neck of it - it is the prosecutor's; the prisoner knows that he made another a size larger, because this was too small for some work.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About four years ago this man was discharged for stealing a hammer, and I got him in. Witness. I was discharged, but I never knew what for.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL FREEMAN. I have worked for the prosecutor, and have known the prisoner twelve months. A few weeks ago he came to do some work at my place; he brought some tools, and said they were for his use; he threw them down, and said he would b-y soon alter them; this gave me suspicion, and I told the prosecutor; the prisoner came one morning just as I opened my shop, and took the tools.</p>

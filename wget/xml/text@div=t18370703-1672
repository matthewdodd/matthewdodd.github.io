                  </hi>. I lived in the service of Mr. Robert Dixon, of Fins<lb></lb>bury-square, at the time this robbery took place. On the 8th of June, about twelve o'clock in the monring, the prisoner came to the door, and asked to see Mr. Dixon—I said he was not at home, but if he returned at about two o'clcok he would be at home—he came again about twenty minutes after one, and asked to see him—I said I expected him at half-past one o'clock—I gave him a chair in the hall—he sat down there—I went throught the hall several times while he was there, passing and re-passing him, and noticed that he had removed his seat—he was there nearly ten minutes—the cloak hung up at the further end of the hall, and the coat on the next peg to it—I went into the pantry, and came into the dinning-room, and found he had moved to a chair, which had a full view of the dinning-room door when it was open—I went down into the kitchen, and returned in about five minutes—he was then gone, and the property also—I saw nothing more of him till I found him in custody on the 16th of June—I know he is the person—he left the street door open—I had left it on the latch—I went out in pursuit, but saw nothing of him—I am certain of him—I spoke to him every time I went throught the hall, and he stared me full in the face—the things have not been found.</p>

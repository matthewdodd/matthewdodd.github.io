               <p>JAMES DAVIDS. On the 12th of May, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was minding my child in the court - She was about nine yards from me; the prisoner went up and spoke to her, and I saw her put her hand into her pocket, and offer the child something, I could not see what it was. She was with it above a quarter of an hour - I suspected her; she then took the child up in her arms and walked away very fast; I was on Holborn-hill watching her. I called my wife out, followed her, and stopped her opposite Field-lane; I asked her where she was going with the child? she said she was going to take it to its mother. I asked her where its mother was? she said, "Its mother is down there;" pointing towards Fleet-market-which is in quite a different direction from my house. I told her I was its father, took the child from her, and gave her in charge. It had the clothes stated in the indictment on at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The child was playing about a shop window - I kept my eye upon it; she was not out of my sight. The child cannot speak.</p>

            . I lodge with Davids. I went down stairs, hearing that he suspected somebody was taking the child. I saw the prisoner and child-it made towards me knowing me. The prisoner caught it up. The mother screamed out - I went to her assistance, and saw nothing more of the transaction.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Arnold, who is a cheesemonger, and lives in Oxford-street. I saw the prisoner pulling things out of her pocket, and offering them to the child - She kept kissing it, She was full twenty minutes enticing it; she then snatched it up, and went away down Holborn-hill. I joined in the pursuit, and overtook her by the church. The prosecutor stopped her. She said she was going to take it down there, pointing towards Field-lane. I had stood and watched her for twenty minutes, as I suspected her.</p>

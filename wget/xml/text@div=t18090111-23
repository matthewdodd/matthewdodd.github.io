               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your service - A. He was an <rs id="t18090111-23-deflabel138" type="occupation">apprentice</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you attend to see him that night on the watch - A. I did, between nine and ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon the next morning did you see your craft - A. I did not see it the next morning; the lug boat had gone her journey by another man.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had discovered that James was in custody upon this, did you bring back the trunks again - A. I did, myself; I went to Blackwall and got it before it was received into the ship out of my own lug boat, the trunk No. 8.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found it had been unpacked, and repacked - A. Yes; it was so well done I could not discover it; when I came to open it I found fifteen pieces of muslin, and upon the top of it were stumps of brooms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these fifteen pieces fill the trunk - A. Oh no, not much above half; on the muslin were stumps of brooms and the birch, to the amount of two brooms, I suppose.</p>
               <p>COURT. It filled up the vacancy - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. And done so neatly that your eye could not discover that it had been unpacked - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You and your partners are responsible for these goods when they are delivered to you - A. Yes; the trunk is here.</p>
               <p>Q. to Macqueen. Is that one of the trunks that you packed - A. It is; the mark at the bottom is PD No. 8.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the sort of goods that you packed for Mr. Davis - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed to Thompson. Have you mentioned all the names of your partners - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. When the trunks were delivered to you, were they delivered to you in person - A. They were not.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you did not make the mark PD - A. No. There were twenty four trunks put in the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to say that the trunks that were put in the lug boat, that is one of them before you - A. I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q. They were covered up in matting - A. They were so; this side of the trunk is left outside; the merchant gave me the numbers; we prick them off; the matting does not go round, it covers the top; the mark is on the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this man was an apprentice of your father's - A. Yes; I believe he had been out of his time in November.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the lug boat was, it was not in the river Thames, but in one of the creeks - A. No, it was in the Thames.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You yourself received them on board the lug boat, and you are quite certain they are the same - A. I am quite certain they are the same.</p>

Between four and five in the morning I saw four men come out of East Smithfield, down Butcher row; two of them kept on the side I was on, and two crossed over on the other side; the first was the prisoner at the bar, he had a bundle under his arm; I crossed over; the hindmost man I elbowed, and thought he had nothing; I followed the prisoner into a dark entry, I was about five or six paces behind him, when he put the bag down by the corner of a house in the dark entry; I went up to him and asked him what he had got there. he said nothing; I put my stick to the bag, and at the same time I kicked my foot against it; I went to put my hand to lay hold of him, at the same time I kicked the bag farther away; he made a spring and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the bag contained any thing in it - Yes; I ran after him; before we got out of the dark entry a man in a blue coat got between us; I made a blow at his head in order to knock him down, but I missed it; I continued pursuing the prisoner; he ran into my partner's hand at the top of Dean street; he was stopped at the top of Dean street by Adams. I never lost sight of him before he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this dark entry where you left the bag to where the prisoner was taken - A. About one hundred and fifty yards or two hundred yards; I told Adams to take the prisoner to the watchhouse. I went back to the dark entry for the property. I found the bag contained five pieces of muslin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. How long is this dark entry - A. About twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far behind the men that was running from you might you be at any time - fifteen yards from him - A. No; I think I should have got hold of him if it had not been for the man that ran between him and me.</p>
               <p>- ADAMS. Q. You are another patrol of East Smithfield - were you on duty on the morning of the 27th in East Smithfield - A. Yes. The prisoner was running up Dean street as hard as he could run; the last witness was close to him. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Q. Then on the 27th you began the night by going to sleep - A. It is impossible for a man to be up sixteen nights upon a stretch without some sleep</p>

               <p>Q. Have you told all that passed - A. No; you have not asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. The first thing that was said to you, was, shall we go to work - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood it at once - A. I did, because he called the trunks Peters himself before; in taking in the goods, he said here comes the Peters. I did not know what the Peters were till he told me.</p>
               <p>Q. You being a watchman did not know what Peters were - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a strange term - A. It was a strange term.</p>
               <p>Q. You understood it at once it was to break them open and steal the contents - A. That is without a doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the term Peter being a strange term to you and you understood it immediately - it did not occur to you to take him into custody immediately - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not Long a man that you knew perfectly well - A. He was not, I never had any connection with him whatever.</p>

                  </hi>. Early in April, I took the prisoner to work as a journeyman at my business of a watch and clock maker. About the day before I gave him into custody, about 14th July, I missed some pivot turns, and numerous other tools—I lent the prisoner a time piece, which be asked me for the loan of—he did not come to work on the morning of 15th July—he had kept from work all the week, with the exception of two half days—I went after him to his lodging on 16th July, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning—I did not see him there, but I saw him leave the house—I followed him up the Lay ton stone-road—I did not overtake him—I afterwards went with an officer, and found him at his lodging—the officer searched him in my presence, and found on him a pair of pliers, a pair of tweezers, and seven or eight different articles, some of them belonged to him and the remainder to me—I then went with the officer to his lodging, and found numerous tools belonging to me hidden behind the stove, and in different parts of the room—he had no right to take them—I had lent him none whatever—these are the articles found on his person, these two I know to be mine—these others were found in the room—these are all mine.</p>

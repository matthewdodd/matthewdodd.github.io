On the 28th of February, after breakfast, my son went into the barn, and gave me information. I then went to the barn, where I had a large heap of oats, and considered that two bushels or more were taken - this was soon after eight o'clock. I had seen them the day before. I charged Nevill, who was at work close to the barn, with taking them while the barnman was at breakfast. I asked what he had been meddling with the heap of oats for - he said he had not. We searched different sheds, and at last went into the stable, where there is a large chaff bin. I saw footsteps in the bin - my son found a sack there with two bushels of oats in it, and found a sack buried deeper in the same bin, containing four bushels. We deliver oats from the granary cleaned and mixed with other corn; these were not clean, and correspond with the heap in the barn. Littleford returned from where he had been, I asked why he stole the corn - he denied it. I said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use to deny it, for I have found it in a place where you must know of its being put." He then said,</p>
               <p>"We did not steal them - they are oats I have saved out of my allowance for my horses." (Nevill was not present.) I said, that could not be, for they were not cleaned, and endeavoured to convince him of the consequence of such conduct, I had him into my room, endeavouring to get an acknowledgment from him, but am sorry to say I could not. The conduct of Nevill was shameful.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Not withstanding all you said, he had nothing to confess - A. He would not confess. I give the horses food in proportion to their work. I gave him five bushels of oats for his team, and as much chaff as he liked - they mix it together; this was not cleaned, but it had no chaff with it. They would have been seen if they had carried it off the premises before the men were gone. Littleford was not near the barn - he could not take it that morning, for he was not there.</p>

            . My father's account is correct. I saw the heap in the barn all safe the day before; next morning some appeared to be gone. I found two bushels in a sack under the chaff, and four bushels burried deeper. We give the oats out cleaned and mixed with beans, but they mix it with the chaff. I did not hear the conversation with the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What quantity of corn was in the barn - A. Nine or ten quarters. I did see that it was disturbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not common for men to save part of their oats to give to their horses in the spring - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look at the oats found - A. Yes, and am convinced that they are part of the same bulk.</p>

            . I am the barnman. I left at eight o'clock - the heap was all then done up. When I returned it was disturbed. The prisoners were working at a dung cart when I went to breakfast.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not they breakfast at the same time - A. No, at six o'clock. I never quarreled with Littleford. It is difficult to miss two bushels out of ten quarters.</p>

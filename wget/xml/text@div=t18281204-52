The prisoner was in my employ - I caught him in my potatoe-bank on the 15th of November, with some potatoes in a sack; I asked what he thought of himself - he said it was the first time he ever attempted such a thing; it was about half-past one o'clock in the morning, and being rather an awkward time I let him go to London with his team - he came back again: he could have nothing to do with those potatoes in the course of my employ.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. When was he taken? A. The same afternoon, but he escaped, and came back on the Tuesday for his wages; I owed him 1l. 9s. 4d. - the potatoes were worth about half a crown: when he came back I asked him if he was not ashamed to see me again - I did not tell him to get out of the stable. nor any thing to that effect; he asked me for his wages - I walked out, and said, "You shall have your wages;" I went out and got the constable to take him - I paid him his wages before Mr. Hardy three days afterwards; he has borne a good character.</p>

               <p>MR. CHURCHILL to MR. PALMER. Q. Was the constable waiting for him on the Saturday? A. Yes - he was not there on the Tuesday; the prisoner came for his wages, and I went for the constable.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you send for the constable before he returned on the Saturday? A. Yes; the prisoner said,"Let me see the master," and then he went, and I saw no more of him till the Tuesday.</p>

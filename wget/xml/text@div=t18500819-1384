                  </hi>. I am a gutta-percha manufacturer, of Gracecburch-street. The prisoner came to my shop on 11th Jan.—I was in the back-parlour, and was fetched out—I went into the shop—there was a gutta-percha watch-stand in the shop, and an old gold watch in it, which was mine, and worth about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner wished to purchase the watch with the stand—I told him it was not for sale, I would not sell it at any price—he took the inside of the watch out—it was a single case—he laid the works down on the counter, looked at the case, and pretended it was of no value, and pretended by his gestures to throw it into the street, but I saw him pass it into his pocket—he stood close by the door—he then came back to the counter, and said he would take the stand at the price I asked for it, as I was not willing to sell the watch—I asked him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the stand—he said, "Put it in paper, I will go in next door," and went out—I hastened round the counter to follow him into the street—I lost sight of him—I did not see him again</p>

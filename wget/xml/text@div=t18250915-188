               <p>ANTHONY COOPER. The prisoner lived in my service about three weeks, and was about to leave me on the 24th of August. I desired to see her clothes, to which she said she had no objection, for it was the usual practice in places where she had been. We opened a bundle, but she said she had lost the key of her box. I took it up and opened it. I sent for an officer, and we found in it two pelisses, a gown, some sugar, some soap, and a habit-shirt, belonging to me - she begged for mercy.</p>

            . I am a laundress, and live in Beaufort-buildings, Strand. I have known the prisoner seven years; she has been an honest industrious girl; she was greatly affected at the death of her brother; and as she was in St. Martin's School they would not let her go and see him buried. I believe it has affected her mind.</p>
               <p>Two other witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150071"></xptr>character, one of whom stated that he would again take her into his service.</p>

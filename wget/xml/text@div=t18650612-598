I am a gardener, of Church-street, Hackney—on 6th May, I was at the Rod Cap, and saw Brown come in—he had some drink, and paid with a bad shilling—Mrs. Corbett took it up, and Alton took it from her—Brown left, and I followed him, and saw him join the other prisoner at the end of Thomas-street, near the Archway toll gate—that is five or six hundred yards from the Red Cap—Brown stood still till Smith joined him—they stood together a few minutes and then came past the Archway Tavern, where I stood—I saw a policeman coming, spoke to him, and followed the prisoners towards Finchley—they paid the toll-gate, and went through—I followed them behind a dung-cart, went across a brick-field to the Birkbeck Tavern, and found Brown inside drinking, and Smith outside, about five yards from the door—as Brown came out at one door, I went in at the other and saw the landlord, who came out with me, and we went after the prisoners, who were together in Jackson's-lane—I called out, "Hay!"—Mr. Hiscock laid hold of Brown, and Smith put his hand in his pocket and tried to throw something over the hedge—it was in whity-brown tissue paper—I laid hold of him and picked up two bad shillings close to his feet, and gave them to the policeman.</p>

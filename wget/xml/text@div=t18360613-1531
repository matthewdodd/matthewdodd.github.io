I have got the receipts for these sums of money—the prisoner never accounted to me for them—I cannot say the day he left me, but it was in the middle of the week—he went away because I said, that the last time I was at the Old Bailey, I heard a case of embezzlement, where the prisoner was transported—he went away without giving notice—and then I discovered the whole of the bills had been paid.</p>

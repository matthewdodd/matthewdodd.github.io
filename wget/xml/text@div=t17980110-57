               <p>LYON BACKROW sworn. Q.What is your business? - A.Getting a shilling as well as I can, by going of errands. On Saturday, the 30th of December, in the evening, between six and seven o'clock -</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100076"></xptr>Q. Was it light or dark? - A.Moonlight. I had a summons to deliver to Mrs. Richards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that any relation to the prisoner? - A. His wife, I am told; I went to the bar, and delivered it to Mrs. Richards.</p>
               <p>Q. At what bar? - A.In the Fleet-prison.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a summons do you mean? - A. For wearing hair-powder without having a licence. When I was coming out again, I heard somebody cry, stop him, stop him; I did not know what they meant; and immediately they seized me by the collar -</p>
               <p>Q. Who took you by the collar? - A. Mr. Richards, that man there; he said I must come back along with him; and I refused, I said, what for; says he, you shall come back, and you shall see what for; and I refused again; and he catched hold of me by the collar; I refused going back; and several more came up to assist him; he dragged me, against my will, along through the passage, till I came to a place where there were some stone steps going into a yard; I said, Mr. Thacker knew me, that was that gentlemen there; and Mr. Thacker said, yes, I know him to be a d-d informer; they took me to the pump, and pumped upon me for three or four minutes, as long as they thought proper, and I resisted.</p>

               <p>Q. When you say they, do you mean the prisoners? - A. Yes, both of them; Mr. Richards never left my collar; after they had done pumping upon me, I do not know who it was, but somebody threw a pail of water over my face; my clothes were all torn; my breeches were almost torn from me, and my waistcoat was tore to pieces; I missed out of my pocket, all the money I had, a half-guinea, a seven-shilling piece, one shilling, and a sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. And you charge these prisoners with taking your money? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find any of your money upon them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all you have to say? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, There is an end of this indictment; it was very improper conduct, but cannot possibly be the subject of an indictment of this sort. From the circumstances of this case, it appears very plain what they were about, by the expression, informer, and their conduct may be punished in another way; there was clearly no intention of taking his money; his money, very probably, might have dropped from his clothes.</p>

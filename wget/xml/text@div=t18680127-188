                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 125). I went with Carney to Type Street, and saw the elder Peltret there—he said he only had one room, the one he was in—I helped to search the place, and found a quantity of property—he was asked whether the property could be brought into the house without</p>

               <p>his knowledge—he said at first it could not, and then he said it could, as he did not sleep in the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you said that before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I made use of the words, but it might not have been taken down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Nicholls's Defence</hi>. I was standing at the top of Mr. Palmer's factory on the 20th December with George Peltret. I asked him for twopence; he said, "Here is a ticket of a guernsey; get it out and wear it."I had no money to get it out. I took the ticket and said I should sell it. I saw Mr. Harris, and asked him to buy the ticket; his son afterwards came to me and said he would buy it for nine pence. I said no, and he then offered me a shilling. I gave it to him. I spent sevenpence. I heard that Mr. Harris was taken up for buying the ticket. I said I knew nothing about it, and I was told to go to the station to clear myself. George Peltret gave me the ticket in the presence of four or five men.</p>

Between two and half-past on the Friday before Christmas I was passing the factory, and saw Nicholls and Peltret talking—I heard Peltret say, "I have got a ticket of a guernsey I can give you"—I knew him by working in a brickfield last summer—I did not hear any<lb></lb>thing else or see any ticket.</p>

I am a discharged soldier from the 53d Regiment—on Thursday-evening, 6th December, about 8 o'clock, I went into the Uncle Tom's Cabin beer-shop, at Woolwich—I went into the top room—there were some civilians there, and some females—the two prisoners were there—I had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my pocket—I called for something to drink in the lower part of the house, but when I went up stairs I was asked to treat the females—I put my hand in my pocket—a sovereign was the first thing that, came to hand, and I gave it to the barmaid to pay for the drink—she gave me the change quite correct—I drank about half a glass of ale, and was knocked down <hi rend="italic">unsenseless</hi>—I do not remember anything more—when I came to my senses I had nothing in my pocket, and was left in a most dis<lb></lb>graceful state—there were no persons in the room when I woke up—I have been robbed twice since I came from India.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waitress at the Uncle Tom's Cabin, beer-shop—on the evening of 6th December I saw the prosecutor and two prisoners there; first of all down-stairs—the prisoners enticed the prosecutor to go up-stairs—he called for some ale and some rum, and gave me a sovereign to pay for it—I took him the change up—some little time afterwards I went up again into the room to put some coals on the fire, and I then saw the two prisoners with their hands in his pockets, one on each side—the prosecutor was lying down with his head resting on one of their shoulders—I did not see them take anything out of his pocket—I went and told my master, and he went up-stairs—the prisoners were then gone.</p>

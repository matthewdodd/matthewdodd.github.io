                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 203.) On the 30th of January, about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock in the day, I and Moore were near the railway bridge at Hanwell, and saw the male prisoner pass along with a bundle—I asked what he had in it—after some hesitation he said he had meat—I asked where he got it from—he said he had brought it from home—I asked where his home was—he said if I would go with him, he would show me—I said I should not do that, I should expect he would tell me without my going there—after some little further hesitation, he asked if I wished to see it—I said I wished to see the cloth it was tied up in—he laid it on the ground—I untied it, and saw the name of the Rev. J. A. Emerton in full on it—I then told him he must go with me to the station—I opened the bundle there, and it contained the articles stated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of the Rev. James Alexander Emerton—he is a clergyman—Moore came to me—in consequence of what he said, I went to Mr. Emerton's cottage, and saw some meat there, said to be taken from the male prisoner—I compared a piece of the pork with some more on the premises, and found the fellow piece to it—we had killed a small pig about a week before, and I am sure that produced by the officers was part of that pig—I have some of each here—they correspond—I also saw three apples, which appeared to me the same sort as Mr. Emer<lb></lb>ton had—I always had the sending in of the apples to the female prisoner who was the cook—I cannot speak with any certainty to the beef.</p>

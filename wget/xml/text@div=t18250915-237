            . On Thursday evening, about eight o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Islington-green, and saw a young man come running toward me very fast; there was an area close by me, and he threw over the rails a handkerchief; I put my hand through the rails, and took out this handkerchief - I am quite certain the prisoner is the person, he was stopped directly after; I had not lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you ever see the man's face? A. No; he was stopped before I picked up the handkerchief, scarcely twelve yards from where I was; about half way towards the watch-house; there were, I suppose, half a dozen people running after him.</p>

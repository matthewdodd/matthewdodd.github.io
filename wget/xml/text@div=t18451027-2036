                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Brown. We are wholesale goldsmiths and jewellers, in Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell—the prisoner had been in our service for many years—he worked on our pre<lb></lb>mises—the men work at a board which is put against the window—each man sits at a hole in that board, and has a skin in his lap, in which he puts his filings—their cuttings are always put on the board—the foreman goes round twice a day and takes up what we call the limmel, in an earthen pan—the men are all quite aware that they have no right to touch the filings—I had removed the prisoner from the lower to the upper room, where a man can be more readily observed, and watched than in the lower room, as it is under my immediate eye—on the 26th of Sept., about half-past twelve o'clock, I received information from Garrett—I went to the bench where the prisoner was at work—I desired George Taylor, my fore-man, to bring the prisoner's drawer from the work-board to the counting-house, and desired the prisoner to accompany me there—when we got into the counting-house, I ordered Taylor to open the prisoner's drawer, which he did in his presence—it contained these gold filings in a tin box belong<lb></lb>ing to the prisoner—the value of them is more than 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they weigh one dwt. and a few grains—I know the work in which the prisoner was en<lb></lb>gaged—there can be no doubt that these filings are my property—it is contrary to known rules that any workman should take up his own filings—they should have remained in the skin for my foreman to take up—I accused the prisoner of stealing them—he said nothing—he did not deny it—I sent for the policeman, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the prosecutor's service for many years. My seat was next to the prisoner's—on the 26th of Sept., about noon, I saw the prisoner sweep up the gold filings in his skin with a hare's-foot, put it into a tin box, and put it into his bottom drawer—I thought fit to watch him—after he had done that he went on with his work—I knew that what he had done was against the rules altogether—Garratt went to communicate it to my master, and in a few minutes Taylor and my master came, and the drawer was taken out—I did not go into the counting-house—I afterwards saw the filings—they were filings of such gold as the prisoner was at work on—there is a pin comes to the table, and a skin under it, and as the man files the filings fall into the skin.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the prosecutor's ser<lb></lb>vice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Four years—there were about thirty-eight men working in that shop—the prisoner worked about the fourth board up—it was hardly pos<lb></lb>sible to see what he was doing—the workmen can see each other's faces—I do not recollect any instance when the foreman was ill or out of the way—I never knew any of the men assist in collecting the gold—I know the prosecutors have made charges against other parties in the establishment—the clippings do not fall into the skin—the filings do—I could see to find anything in the skin by daylight—if I lost a small rose diamond I should have to look into the skin for it.</p>

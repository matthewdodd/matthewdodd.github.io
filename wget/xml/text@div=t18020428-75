               <p>Q. Did he say it was his hat? - A. He owned to it, and took it; I said to the prisoner, you are a carpenter, are not you; he replied, yes; I said, how came you to do such a thing as this; he said, I had better do that than worse, they can't hang me; they can only transport me; says I, if we let you go on this way, you may get at my house; he said, no; you know the gutter is not so easy got at there: Going down Oxford-street, he wanted me to let him run away, and tried several times to get from me; but I kept hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the lead? - A. It was not taken off the premises; it is rolled up, I suppose, about two foot at each end; it was begun at both ends, but not cut, the whole length of the middle gutter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it separated from the building at all? - A. No.</p>

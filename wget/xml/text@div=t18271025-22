On the 16th of August, about five o'clock in the morning, I came down stairs, and remained in my parlour till after six; I then rang my servant up, and finding that she was stirring I went up to my room - I had not been there long before I heard a scream, and found a person had dropped from the parlour window - I had opened the window myself when I first came down, and thrown up the sash, and left it open; when I came down I found the clock gone, which had stood on the side-board in the parlour; it cost twelve guineas thirteen or fourteen years ago; two silver salt-spoons were also missing.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Greig. On the morning in question, at half-past six o'clock, I came down stairs, and went into the kitchen. I opened the shutters, and saw two men fall, as if from the parlour window; I ran up stairs, missed the clock from the sideboard, and the spoons off the dumb-waiter; they were safe the night before. I could not swear to the men - it appeared to me be a stout man that fell from the window, the same size as the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a smith, and live in Bellplace, Westminster. On Thursday, the 16th of August, I was about fifty yards from Mr. Greig's house, and saw his parlour window was open - as I went along the square I saw Barnett and the prisoner together, lurking about opposite Mr. Greig's house; I went along as far as the end of the square, stopped a few minutes, and presently saw Barnett go up the front garden, and receive a parcel from the window. The prisoner was waiting outside; a person came out of the window, and all three ran off together. The prisoner was close outside the railing when the bundle was thrown out - I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I am a letter-carrier at the Post-office. On the 16th of August I got up to go to the office about half-past six o'clock - I live in Bell-street, near the prosecutor's house; there is a court almost opposite my house, and half way down that court Barnett passed me, and at the end of the court he pulled his jacket off, and stopped - I stopped, turned my head round, and the prisoner came up with the clock under his arm; Barnett immediately covered it with his jacket; before that it was covered with a handkerchief or cloth. I am quite certain the prisoner had the clock - they escaped at the time. I afterwards saw the prisoner in custody, on another charge, and identified him.</p>

It appear'd by the Evidence that the Prosecutor lost his Box in Westminster Hall, near the Court of Exchequer, and missing the Box, the Prisoner being the only Person that stood near him, he taxed him with the Box; that the Prisoner said he had taken up a Box, and return'd it to the Prosecutor. That when some Gentlemen went to seize him, he ran away, ran into a House, and ran down into the Cellar, and hid himself behind a But. The Prisoner pleaded he found the Box, and when the Prosecutor enquir'd for it, he return'd it, and as to his running away, and hiding himself, it was to secure himself from being thrown into the Thames.

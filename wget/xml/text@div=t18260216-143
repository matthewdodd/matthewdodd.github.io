The prisoner had been in my employ for about a month prior to the 4th of February; I marked 2l. 6s. 6d. in silver, which I put into the till on the 30th of January, and the next morning some of it was gone. On the 3d of February, there was 2l. 7s. in silver in the till, and on the evening of the 4th there was 2l. 7s.; but I can positively state I had put two shillings in on the morning of the 4th - I put more in, but I can positively swear to two shillings, which I took in my surgery and marked; the till was only locked at night; I went for a constable, who searched him in my presence - I said I had lost money out of my till - the prisoner said he had no money about him; the officer found three shillings on him, which had my mark on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What mark is it? A. It is a small oblong mark below the chin of the head; the prisoner's family is respectable; I am not aware that he broke any tumblers in my house which he had to re-place.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to search the prisoner; I asked if he had any money - he said, No; I saw his hand go to his pocket - I took hold of it, and found three shillings in a bit of paper, with paper between them; he was a very respectable boy till this time; he has been to a Sunday school, and was much respected.</p>

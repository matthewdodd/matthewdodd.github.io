I rent the two bottom floors; it is let out in tenements, and the landlord does not live in the house; I pay my rent to Mr. Ward, of Water-street; my shop is on the ground floor. On Saturday, the 1st of May, between twelve and one o'clock, I went to bed, and was the last person up - I fastened my shop door, and the street door was fastened; I awoke about six in the morning - it was day-light. - I went down stairs, found the shop door broken open, and missed six shirts, four shifts, a hat, a handkerchief, two aprons, a frock, three petticoats, two shawls, a pair of shoes, a gown and three pinafores; which were in the shop when I went to bed - they would form two bundles and are worth 4 l. 7 s. 6 d.; I found an old hat in the shop which did not belong to me. I have known the prisoner some time - his family lived in the same house some time ago, but not at the time in question; I had not seen him for twelve months; I have found nothing; the door was forced open, and the lock broken - I missed a new hat.</p>

            . I am fifteen years old. I have known the prisoner five years. I live at No. 8, Holiday-yard, near Mrs. Fox's. On Sunday morning, the 1st of May, I got up about half-past four o'clock; I go out every Sunday morning at six, and got up on this morning at half-past four; I saw the prisoner at ten minutes or a quarter past five on St. Andrew's-hill, about twenty yards from Mrs. Fox's - it was day-light; another young man was with him, and each had a bundle under his arm; the prisoner's bundle was larger than the other - he had a new hat on his head; it appeared quite new; I had seen him a week before - he then were an old hat; they went up Bristow-street, which leads into Water-lane; I was telling Mrs. Fox of it and saw an old hat in her shop; I cannot say whether it was his; I saw him in custody on the Tuesday following, and am sure of his person. I believe he lived with his father in Water-lane.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on the evening after the robbery (Monday) in a coffee shop, in Hart-street, Covent-garden; I told him the charge, he said he was never near the place, and that he slept in a stagecoach at Westminster that night, by himself; he said it was down a street to the left; I understood him to mean the New-cut; he had a seal skin cap on.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, complaining of the officer attempting to prejudice his case, denying that the hat belonged to him, or that he had seen the witnesses for a month before.</p>
               <p>JURY to JARVIS. Q. Did you know the hat by any particular mark? A. Yes, by its being sewn round the rim, and on the side behind.</p>
               <p>JOHN SCOTT. I know it by the sewing behind.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. George Jones, an auctioneer. On the 14th of August a lady's gold watch was brought to me by Mr. Benjamin's boy—it had an enamel of a female's head at the back, and a row of pearls round the rim, and the enamel was broken a little—I locked it up, as we generally do, till about three o'clock in the afternoon, when I took it out and put it behind the counter, and covered it over—I went to look after it the same afternoon, and missed it about five o'clock—it has been since found at Mr. Archbutt's—it is not here.</p>

               <p>rooms to be sold, and on the 15th I was informed it was stolen—it was a flat gold watch, with a lady's head set round with pearls—my boy who took it to Mr. Jones's is not here—I went afterwards to Mr. Archbutt's shop, and he showed me the same watch—in about a week afterwards Mr. Jones gave me the money to redeem the watch, as it was worth more than it was pawned for—I have parted with it since.</p>

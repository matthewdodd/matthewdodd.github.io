                  </hi>. I live with my brother, at 1, Wellington-place, Paddington, a bootmaker—on 16th January, between 4 and 5 o'clock, the prisoner came and said something about kid-reviver—I said, "We do not want any; we have a very large stock"—he said, "I wish for a bottle"—I served him with one—the price was eightpence—he said he did not think it would do, as his ladies always used eighteenpenny bottles—I said, "This is of the very best quality"—he said, "If you can recommend it, I will take it"—he gave me a sovereign—I put it in a desk where there was no other sovereign, gave him change, and he left—my brother afterwards sounded it on the counter, and it was bad—I bored a hole in it, put some oxalic acid on it, and afterwards gave it to a policeman—on 12th February, I was at the shop of another brother of mine, James Welstead, of 9, Cambridge-terrace, and saw the prisoner going out—I spoke to Mr. Frampton, one of the assistants, who went out and returned with the prisoner and a constable—I said, "You are the man that gave me the bad sovereign at 1, West<lb></lb>bourne-place"—he said, "I never saw you before"—I said, "I am sure you are the man; do not you remember buying a bottle of kid-reviver?"—he said, "No," and that I must be mistaken—I said, "Who could forget such a face?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to James Welstead, of Cambridge-terrace—on 10th February, about a quarter to 4 o'clock, the prisoner came and asked me for a half-crown bottle of Edwards' varnish, a stone bottle—I showed him a bottle of kid-reviver, and asked him if that was what he wanted—he said no, he wanted varnish—I showed him an eightpenny glass bottle—he said that would not do, he wanted a stone bottle, a half-crown one—while I was in conversation with him, Miss Welstead came up, and he left the shop very hastily—in consequence of what Miss Welstead said, I followed him, and brought him back with a constable—I have heard what Miss Welstead said—it is correct.</p>

On Tuesday, 10th February, I saw Frampton on the canal-bridge, following the prisoner, and went with them to the shop, where Miss Welstead said that the prisoner had passed a bad severeign to her on 16th January, at Westbourne-place—I took him in custody—he denied all knowledge of Miss Welstead or the sovereign, and said he had only been a fortnight in London—he first said that he lived some distance beyond Highbury, and afterwards he said near the Angel, Islington—I found a purse and 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I asked him how he came to go into the shop for the varnish with only 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in his pocket—he said that the varnish was for a friend, who he was going to meet at the bottom of the road, a groom living at a gentleman's house at Highbury—he had an orange to his mouth, the skin of which he threw away.</p>

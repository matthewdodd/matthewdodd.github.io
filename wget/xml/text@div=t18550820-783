               <p>On the afternoon of 19th Juno, about half-past 3 o'clock, I was near Westbourne-terrace, and saw a crowd—two men were fighting; they fought for four or five minutes, and one of them left the other, went to some buildings, and brought the prisoner, who acted as second to the man who was afterwards taken into custody for fighting—I saw Mr. Austin there trying to prevail on the men to go to their work; he had hold of one by one collar, and the other by the other—at that time the prisoner was standing directly opposite me speaking, but I do not know a word he said, as it was not English—he left me, crossed over the road, went to some elevated ground where some rubbish had been shot, picked up a stone or a brick, and threw it into the <hi rend="italic">mob</hi>—it struck Mr. Austin on the back of the head behind the ear—it was about one-third of the size of a brick—he was about five feet from him—he then ran away—Mr. Austin fell, and I saw the blood gushing from the wound, and likewise from his face—I saw the prisoner a fortnight afterwards at the Police Court, Paddington-green, and recognized him—I am certain he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of No. 4, Stanhope-terrace, Hyde-park. On 19th June, I was sent for to attend Mr. Austin, and found him very, ill suffering from a blow at the side of the head—he had been at<lb></lb>tended by another medical man first—he was in an alarming state of danger, and continued so about a week, after which he gradually improved—the wound was not very large, but it was the concussion of the brain which was serious—it was a triangular cut, such as might be produced by the corner of a brick, or something of that kind—his hat had a triangular cut, which corresponded with the blow on the head.</p>

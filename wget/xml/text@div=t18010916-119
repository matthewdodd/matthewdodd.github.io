             sworn. - I am foreman to Mr. Chapman, a carpenter, who was employed to repair the house: On Saturday the 1st of August, I went to look over the premises, and heard a noise in the cellar; I found the place where they shoot the coals down in the passage open; I looked down and saw some wet, which was not there the day before; upon looking further, I found the pipe was broke; I went down stairs, but could find no person there; I called down the prisoner's master, but we could not find the prisoner till eight o'clock, and then I found him concealed in a closet, lying down in the bottom of the closet; I kicked him, but he did not stir, till I threatened to throw bricks at him if he did not come out; he then got upon his legs, and I took him by the collar, and brought him out; he had the lead in the closet with him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180109160067"></xptr>the closet is not more than two yards from where the lead was taken from; I fitted the lead, and it corresponded exactly; it was fixed to the dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I did not cut the lead.</p>
               <p>Annesley. It was broke off so that he could not stop the water; when I found him he was all over wet from head to foot. <rs id="t18010916-119-verdict616" type="verdictDescription">

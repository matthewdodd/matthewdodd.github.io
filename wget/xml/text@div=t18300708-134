On the 25th of February I was in the kitchen with the prisoner; there was a dispute between the prisoner and the porter, who was an old man - I saw Burns strike Lindley with his fist; it knocked him down I am positive Lindley had not struck him before that - he was able to get up by himself; I did not perceive whether he was much hurt - he was not taken to the hospital for three days after, as it was not supposed he could be injured; he lived fifteen weeks after that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe the prisoner very kindly assisted the poor man to his lodging, as far as he could after this? A. Yes, and he seemed very sorry - I knew the deceased, and believe he was rather inclined to drink.</p>

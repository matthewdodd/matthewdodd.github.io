            . I am a clergyman. I was chaplain to the Prince Regent, and live at Chelsea. In May last I saw an advertisement in the Times newspaper, in consequence of which, I went to No. 3, Whitefriars. Goddard was in the stable there. I told him I came to see the horses which had been advertised in the Times; he said,</p>
               <p>"These are the horses;" he was cleaning them. I asked whose they were - he said they belonged to Captain Barber, of the Inniskillen dragoons; that he was his groom, and had been so two years, from the time he left Mr. Roberts, the Bank Director; he had had the care of the horses two years, during which time Captain Barber had had them - that they were sound and young horses, under age, and he was very sorry his master was going to part with them - and was only sorry he was not going with them; that his master was going abroad, which was the only reason he parted with them; that they had been regularly hunting in Warwickshire, with Lord Milton's bounds; and sometimes had been in harness; that they were half-brothers, and were both bred by Mr. Swan, of Warwickshire;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110073"></xptr>he said he had been in the habit of having the care of them, and sometimes of waiting on Captain Barber as his servant, and was very sorry to leave the horses, and would be glad to go with them. I said I should want a a person to take care of them, and would consider of it. While we were in conversation, the defendant Barber came in; I said,</p>
               <p>"Is this Captain Barber?" he (Barber) said,</p>
               <p>"I am, and these are my horses." Goddard was present. Barber said he had had the horses two years - that they were very good and young horses, under age - the one six, and the other seven years old, and no more; that he had hunted them regularly with Lord Milton's hounds, in Warwickshire, all the last season, and had driven them. I had known Lord Milton, and we talked of him and his affairs. He said he was a man of that county himself, and that his father and family lived at Harl-lodge, Stratford; that he bought the horses of Swan, who bred them; and that they were half-brothers. He asked a hundred and ten guineas for them, and said that Goddard had been his groom for two years. I afterwards asked him Goddard's character - he said he was an excellent groom, and understood horses very well - and he would warrant the horses. I saw Goddard again next day, by appointment, to examine them, as I had not seen them out of the stable. I found him in the stable alone. My son was with me, and a rough rider. Goddard spoke in the same way about the horses - that they had never been lame, and that nothing had ever been the matter with them. I asked him what his wages had been with Captain Barber - he mentioned about thirteen guineas, and 20 l. a-year for clothes, and 12 s. or 14 s. for board wages, and more when he travelled. I said his terms were higher than I usually gave, but I should prefer a man who had been acquainted with the horses, and mentioned what I would give. Captain Barber came into the stable, and spoke in the same favourable terms of the horses - and that they were just the figure of horses I wanted. In the course of the day, I shewed him a sort of warranty which I thought it would be proper for him to send me by post, and he said he would sign that - (looking at it) - this is it. I saw him sign</p>

            , Harl-lodge, Stratford-on-Avon;" and I added to it what he said would be his address in town, until he should go to France,</p>
               <p>"No. 5, North-street, Lambeth;" he described the defendant Goddard as an excellent servant. I said I gave 25 l., and should not object to 20 l. a year for clothes - he said he gave more. He agreed to take five guineas off the horses, and give me the horse-cloths, &amp;c. into the bargain. I was to give him a hundred and five guineas. I saw the horses out that day, but it poured with rain, and he was afraid they would catch cold, and was anxious they should not be out long. I said I thought there appeared a little lump on the fore leg of one horse, and that he went a little stiff with it. He said on his word of honour as a gentleman and an officer, there was nothing the matter with them, or he should have told me. He said his servant frequently waited on him in company, and had regularly had the care of the horses. I said,</p>
               <p>"Upon this warrant I will have the horses" - he said,</p>
               <p>"Then if you please to make a deposit, if it be only 5 l. so that nobody whatever shall see the horses." A pen and ink was sent for. I wrote a draught on Messrs. Coutts and Co., for 5 l., and delivered it to him - I drew it payable to Barber, and most likely to Captain Barber. I went again next day and saw Goddard, and agreed with him to be my servant, and to accompany the horses. I was to give him twenty-five guineas a year, twenty pounds for clothes, and twelve or fourteen shillings a week board wages; unless I boarded him myself. Captain Barber came in again, and I spoke to him on the subject of his servant becoming mine - he agreed to it, and that he should accompany the horses. I asked for a pen and ink to write a draught for the remainder of the money; he said,</p>
               <p>"If you will go into my hotel, we will settle it there;" he took me to the Sussex hotel, and asked me to take some refreshment, which I declined. I wrote the cheque for 100 l. on Messrs. Coutts and Co. I had no sooner written it, than he took it up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Well, as you have given my servant half an hour to get the horses ready - I will go and hasten him, that he may not be later - I will return almost immediately." He took the cheque with him. I stopped half an hour; he did not return - I was tired with wating - I had some conversation with the waiter, and then went out into the stable to see for the parties - the stable was shut up, nobody could be seen. I could see neither of the defendants - the horses were found in the street with a man named Jones on them, whom I think I had seen in the stable as helper - they were opposite another hotel in the street. I mounted the horse that had a saddle on it, and Jones rode with me to Messrs. Coutts's banking-house. Barclay had left me half hour; one of the clerks said they had not paid the 100 l. cheque, but they had the 5 l. I went to a stable near my own house, and left Jones with one of the horses, while I rode to Mr. Bloxham, a veterinary surgeon of the Horse Guards, to shew him the horse I suspected. He saw it, and in consequence of what he said, I sent a letter to Barber, addressed at No. 5, North-street, Lambeth; which letter was afterwards returned by the post to me; I never received any answer from Barber; I went back to the stable, and found Jones was gone. I had him apprehended. Goddard never came into my service; I have not seen Barber since, till to-day; I parted with my cheques, depending on his honour, and on the representation of both the defendants; I advertised them, offering a reward, and went with Mason to the Red Lion yard, Tottenham Court-road, and saw Goddard leap out of a window, and run away.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You paid the draught at the second interview - A. Yes; I took my son and the rough rider. I am a little skilled in horses, but I did not particularly examine them, it was so wet a day; I do not think the rider was as experienced as I then thought; I only had them once up and down the street, and expressed a wish to have a longer trial, but I relied on his word of honour as an officer. He said he would return to me in the coffee-room immediately - I gave him the cheque about one o'clock. I kept the horses about a month, and then sent them to Tattersall's. The saddles, &amp;c. were worth about 5 l.</p>

            . I am veterinary officer to the 1st regiment of Life Guards. On the 8th of May, Mr. Lee shewed me one horse, and next day I saw both - the first was lame in the fore leg, and the second lame in both fore legs - they were decidedly not recent maladies. Had they been sound, they would have been worth a hundred and forty guineas; but they were lame, and six or seven years old. I do not think any thing had been done to their mouths. There was a considerable obstruction of the limbs - the pair are not worth above forty or forty-five guineas. They frequently hunt lame horses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They were lame, as if they had been a good deal worked - A. Yes; they were unfit for the streets - they were grand horses, if you cut off their knees.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of instructions from the prosecutor, I made several searches in May last for Captain Barber, but could hear nothing of him. I had a second warrant handed over to me, by which I found him living in the rules of the Bench.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIOT. I keep the Red Lion, Tottenham-court road. I keep the stable yard. Goddard lived with me for sixteen months - he left me in May last. He acted as groom or servant to a gentleman whom I did not know. I have seen the gentleman come into my yard on his horse; the prisoner Barber is the person. They were with me a week and three days, with their horses, and then they went away. Goddard paid the bill. The last time I saw Barber was a fortnight or three weeks before Goddard left; they had two horses at my stable - they were never changed - not the last horses; but I believe they brought horses to me three different times - they never stopped above a week. A gentleman came to look at the horses twice. Goddard was sometimes at home, and sometimes not - he was in and out of town. Sometimes he was absent four or five days, or a week, but never longer together. He would stop at home three weeks or a month - he had no horses there. I do not know how he was employed - he was always dressed as a respectable man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. His wife lived sixteen months with you - A. Yes. Barber never lodged with me, but has put horses up at livery with me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Goddard tell you he was a gentleman's servant - A. I never asked him. I considered him as a groom, as he brought horses - he brought horses before he came to lodge with me. I considered Barber as his master - he called himself Captain Barber. Goddard always ordered the bills, and I made them out to Goddard.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were you at home when Mason and Mr. Lee came - A. I will not say I was at home. Goddard left me because his wife wished to live in a public street. I did not see him after the officers came. I did not see him jump out of a window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mark Hammond, and live in Chapman-street, Commercial-road, East. The prisoner lodged at my house for three weeks and three days—he occupied a furnished room, with his wife and two children—he left on the 23rd of March—I missed three sheets and a table-cloth from the room—I afterwards saw the prisoner—I charged him with having taken them—he said he had taken them and pledged them, and said I should have them returned—I said, "It is impossible I can take your word, I have waited nine days, in consequence of a note you sent me"—he did not let me know where he had gone to—these are the sheets.</p>

I will send you the rent with them."</p>

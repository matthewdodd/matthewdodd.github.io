When he perceived that I noticed him behind the carriage, he got from behind the carriage, and went to some little distance from it; in about a minute and a half after, I was in the same street, when I see him get up again, he for there till I went about a quarter of a mile, and I came round to the corner, and he was behind the carriage still, and he had pulled the coat over his arm, and at last he pulled it quite over his arm, and he went off with it.</p>

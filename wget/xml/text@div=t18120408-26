               <p>MARY GARDNER. I work for Mr. Courtney in the Old Jewry. On Saturday evening the 7th of March the prisoner came to my place, and said between Mrs. Smith's house and mine, she said some person threw these things out of a window, she heard them fall on the stones; there was an S upon the spoon, it gave me uneasiness for fear it should belong to Mrs. Smith. On the Tuesday I found out it was her mistress's property.</p>
               <p>MR. KING. I am a constable. I was sent for on Tuesday to go to Mr. Smith's house, these things laid on a table a silver spoon, a pair of stockings, and a necklace; Mrs. Gardner produced them; I was desired to take the prisoner into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Gardner. What did the prisoner bring to you besides the spoon - A. She brought a few things which she said her mistress threw out of a drawer; the stockings were there, and the necklace she gave to my little girl; I took them all to Mrs. Smith; she said some person threw the tea-spoon out of the window, she heard it jink on the stones.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith. They are all mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Smith did not behave to me like a mistress, she behaved very dirty to me indeed. I was nursing the child, the child dropped the spoon out of the door, I picked it up and put it in my pocket. I did not know that the child dropped it.</p>

I am the wife of James Bangle, of 10, Little North Street, Whitechapel—on Saturday night, 6th July, I had been out late to market, and about 11.50 I was talking with Mrs. Chivers on her doorstep—I heard a noise coming from Nelson Court, 2 or 3 yards across the road—we went to the entrance of the court and saw Mr. Greyburn standing against Cantor's door, and Mrs. Greyburn against the wall—Mrs. Cantor was up at her first-floor window; her front door was closed—they were abusing each other—we stood there four or five minutes, when the prisoner came into the court and asked Mrs. Greyburn what all this disturbance found the house was about—she said his mother had been calling her bad names—he said "I dare</p>

               <p>I am beadle of St. Martin's, I was going my rounds about a quarter after one, on the 7th of this month, and I heard the call of watch, and the woman crying murder! I heard where the voice came from, and I found the prosecutor with his hat off having hold of a woman, and he charged her with robbing him; I directly laid hold of her too, she said, she had no watch about her, I searched her and found the watch between her shift and her gown.</p>
               <p>Look at that watch? - I do not know the maker's name nor number, the seal was a Wedgewood seal, nothing more than a chain and key.</p>

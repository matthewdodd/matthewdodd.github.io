            . I am the watchman. On the 11th of last month, I saw the prisoner running down Stratton-street, where there is no thoroughfare; I saw the prosecutor stop her; I walked up to them, and laid hold of her. The prosecutor accused her of taking his watch. I took her to the watchhouse; she was searched, and nothing found upon her. We thought she had dropped the watch some where about the place were we took her; I went back, and found it.</p>
               <p>MR. GREEN. I am the constable. There were two women brought to the watchhouse; I searched them, and found nothing. I sent the watchman and the prosecutor to go and look for the watch; they came back with it, and said they found it on the area steps. This is the watch.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It is my watch.</p>

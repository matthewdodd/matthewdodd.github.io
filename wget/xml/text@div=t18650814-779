I am the wife of David John Cassington, a lighter<lb></lb>man, and live at 75, Fore-street, Limehouse—on Wednesday morning, 12th July, I was in Ropemaker's-fields, and was going with my brother, Thomas Murphy, into the road—it was between 12 and 1—I was going through a court, and as I arrived at the bottom, there were three persons sitting on a window-cill; two men and a woman—they saluted me in the most disgust<lb></lb>ing manner—I did not notice them, and one of the men said, "Go and give it to the—"—I don't wish to repeat the words—the prisoners are the three persons—the female came across in front of me, and up with her fist, mid hit me right in the face—there was a constable there, and I asked him for protection—he said, "Oh, go on!"—I said, "I want protection"—I was then attacked a second time—the woman caught hold of me, and knocked me right down in front of a gentleman's house—I said, "Whatever are you attacking me like this for?"—she said, "I will give it to you"—I said, "You had better let me alone; I don't wish to have any bother with you" when she knocked me down, the man Clark came up, put his knee in my stomach, and held me by the throat—as soon as he released me I screamed "Murder" and "Police—and Mr. Rothen sprang a rattle from the window—I had my hair pulled out of my head—Brunning came up, and kicked me at the same time on my right leg; my brother tried to assist me, and he throw him into the road, and tried to tear his coat off—I had my clothes all over my head—I believe they took my bonnet and shawl; the woman tore them from me, and I stood naked without a bit of anything to go home in.</p>

I am a chimney-sweep, and live at 25, Ropemaker's-fields—on the night of 12th July, I heard screams in the street—I got up and looked out of window—I saw a desperate scuffle going on; there were two men and a woman; they had got a woman down on the ground, and they seemed to be kneeling on her—they were very much ill-treating her—I sprang my rattle, and as soon as they got clear of the woman, they wheeled round, and went through White's-rents; one of the men took the woman round the waist, and I heard him say, "Well, you gave her a basting."</p>

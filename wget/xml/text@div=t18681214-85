                  </hi>. I am an interpreter, and live at 19, Charles Street, Euston Square—I know the prisoner; he called on me some time ago, and showed me a letter which he said he had received from his agent at Dunkirk, that he expected a bill of lading, and he had confidence in me to undertake the landing and sale of the cargo, which was about 100 tons of potatoes—</p>

               <p>he then said "Will you be so kind as to advance me some money till my ship comes in?"—I said No, I should go over to Dunkirk and see if the ship was there—he said "All right, you can go"—I went to London Bridge to take the boat to Dunkirk—the prisoner said "It is no use to go there and spend 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you had best stop till to-morrow, and the ship will be here"—so I did not go—this is the bill of lading he showed me—I said "If the ship will be here to-morrow, I will give you 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and I handed him 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold: that was on the faith of the bill of lading—next day I went to the Custom House to inquire if such a ship, the <hi rend="italic">Mary Adelaide</hi>, had arrived—I did not find her—I telegraphed over and got a reply—I never saw the ship at all—I saw the prisoner four or five days after, and gave him into custody, but the inspector discharged him because I had not evidence enough—when I charged him he said, "Oh, I am my ship's captain, you must not be so fast, the ship will be here to-morrow or the day after; it is very bad weather there, and it is a sailing vessel, you can't expect it to a moment."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipping agent, of 1, Water Lane, City—on 24th October the prisoner came to my office—I had never seen him before—he said he had arrived the previous day from Dunkirk, where he had loaded a small sailing vessel, the <hi rend="italic">Reine Victoire</hi>, with potatoes for the London markets, and that he had been recommended to apply to me to take charge of the cargo and obtain the sale there of—I told him I could do so—he then produced this bill of lading—you can buy blank forms of these things at any port, and fill them up as you choose—I asked him if that was his name, "De Bac," as the shipper—he said it was, and he signed that name at the back of the bill of lading—it purported to be signed by R. Pinto; captain of the French vessel, <hi rend="italic">Reine Victoire</hi>, of Dunkirk, for 100 tons of potatoes, to be delivered to London to the order of Vincent De Bac—it is dated 22nd October, 1868—I observed that it was dated the 22nd October, and said, "I suppose it will be up to-morrow"—he said, "To-morrow or Monday"—I went with him to the potatoe market and introduced him to several buyers—he then told me that he had bought a lot of potatoes in the North of France, that they were going to Boulogne to be shipped—and he should</p>

               <p>go over to Boulogne to get a vessel to bring them—he left this bill of lading in my hands, so that if the vessel arrived I should take charge of it; he said possibly he might not have sufficient money to pay the charges at Boulogne, if I would let him have 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on security of the bill of lading it would be rendering him a service—I told him I should have to advance the freights when the vessel arrived, it was not my business to lend money, and I would rather not do it—he said I had plenty of security for my money, and subsequently, to oblige him, I gave him two 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—after a few days, finding the vessel did not arrive, I wrote to my correspondents at Dunkirk, who made certain inquiries there—the prisoner never came to me any more—on 5th November I met him in the street—I said "Well, Mr. Luco, what about the ship that you said was coming?" and he said, "Oh, she sprung a leak before she left the port, and was unable to start"—I took him to my office—he then said the potatoes were coming by a steamer—I told him, from the inquiries I had made, I was satisfied he had been endeavouring to swindle me—I told him bills of lading were never signed unless the goods were actually on board—he said "Oh, the goods were on board, but they were discharged on account of the vessel leaking; I am an honest man, I don't wish to defraud you, and I will prove that to you by returning you the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he did not do so—I sent my clerk with him to enable him to get it, but I never got it, or the potatoes, and no such vessel exists.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Did I seem astonished when at your office that the vessel had not arrived? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No—you told me you were not De Bac, but captain Luco, that was when I said I would give you into custody; you then said you would explain the affair to me—my clerk was with you for three hours—I believe you said you had not benefited by the money, that you had given it to some other person.</p>

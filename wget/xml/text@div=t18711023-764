I went across the road, and asked what was the matter; somebody said "This is the man with a blue Guernsey." The policeman said "I know you by your Guernsey; you know what is the matter." I know no more about it than you do, I was never near him. Three gentlemen came up to the Police Court, and three men were taken, and people came to the Police Court and said that I was not one of the men.</p>

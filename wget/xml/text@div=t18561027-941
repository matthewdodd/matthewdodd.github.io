                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, residing at Chard, in Somersetshire, In 1814 I was clerk to a Mr. Clark, a solicitor there—he died long since, and I succeeded to his practice—I have lived there upwards of forty-six years—I have been mayor of the town three times—I am concerned for four noblemen, and three or four county magistrates—in Nov., 1814, in conse<lb></lb>quence of a message coming to Mr. Clark's office, I remember going over to the residence of a person of the name of Hood—Mr. Clark was not in the way—I found that Mr. Hood had died that day, suddenly—the message that came was from a Mr. Phelps, in whose hands the will was, and who lived in the neighbourhood—I think he was a little farmer, or something of that sort—Mr. Hood was a gentleman of fortune—when I got there Mr. Phelpi gave me the will of Mr. Hood—it was sealed up—I opened it, in the pre<lb></lb>sence of several persons, and examined it to find who were the executors—I saw that Mr. Holman and Sir William Hood were the executors, but the property was given to Sir Alexander Hood—the executors were mere exe<lb></lb>cutors in trust for him; the bulk of the property was left to him—the following day I went to the house of Sir Alexander Hood, which was about thirty miles from Chard—I kept the will till the following day, when Mr. Holman, one of the executors, came to Chard, and took it from me—I gave it to Mr. Holman, in the same state that I received it—I was not then pro<lb></lb>fessionally concerned for the executors; Mr. Pratt, of Glastonbury, was; he is since dead—it was sent by him up in the ordinary course, to be proved at Doctors'-commons—I afterwards understood from Mr. Pratt that an affida<lb></lb>vit was required with respect to some erasures that appeared on the face of the will, and, in consequence of that, I made an affidavit, which is annexed to the will—I think two affidavits were made in reference to that, one by me, and one by Mr. Phillips—this is mine (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the other was to prove that the alterations, or the erasures, were in the testators own handwriting—the object of my affidavit was to prove that I had delivered up the will in the same state that I received it—those alterations do not affect the disposition of the property in the least—(<hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi>+ It is all a forgery together)—I had seen Mr. Hood write—I believe the whole will to be in his own writing—I had seen him write on one occasion, but I think I had received notes from him also, but it is so long ago I cannot charge my memory—I certainly believed it to be his at the time—with the exception of making that affidavit, I had nothing whatever to do with the proving of that will—I never admitted to the defendant that I had uttered that will, knowing it to be forged, or to any person living; impossible; it cannot be a forgery; it is the testator's own handwriting—I never admitted that, or any<lb></lb>thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185610270007"></xptr>
               <p>like it—(<hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It is false, you did, both in Exeter and London)—no property whatever of Mr. Hood's ever came into my possession; I never saw any gold watch, nor did I ever interfere with any trees—I have not got 130,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Bank of England, nor one farthing—Sir Alexander Hood took possession of the estates and property, and continued in possession till his death, in 1851—the succession has gone on in the manner pointed out by the will—Mr. Phelps, from whom I received the will, is dead—the wit<lb></lb>neffles to the will are William Clark, Peter Park, and William Phillips—there is a codicil republishing the will, to which are the names of Samuel Phelps and Peter Park—they are all dead—Park was a farmer in the neighbourhood, of whom I have received rent for a gentleman to whom I was steward—the prisoner first began to annoy me with his claims in 1841 or 1842, and he has continued to do so ever since—he has produced great excitement in the county of Somerset by his lawless proceedings—very great expense has been incurred in defending the property—he has been in prison twice—I know that he has twice taken the benefit of the Act.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You say great excitement has been caused in the county of Somerset, and great expense? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do—I have found it neces<lb></lb>sary at one time to have 100 people to protect the tenants' property from being forcibly taken away; on one occasion he did succeed in driving to London a quantity of bullocks—I am the solicitor employed by the present possessors—he has distrained on several occasions—in the first instance, he remained in possession of a portion of the property for a considerable time—we replevied in the first distress; subsequent distresses we resisted by force—we were advised to do so by counsel—I was twenty-two years of age in 1814—I was then a clerk to Mr. Clark, not an articled clerk—I think I had been in the office four years—I was articled about twenty years ago—I was managing clerk to Mr. Clark; there were several other clerks, but I think I was the principal clerk in 1814—others had been in the office longer than myself, certainly—I had leaped over their heads—at the time I opened this will, I recollect that Mr. Fowler, one of the principal farmers in the parish) was present, and I believe the clergyman, Mr. Bragge—I am not quite certain—I think the two Mr. Fowlers were present—I cannot tell who else—I believe the whole of the will is in Mr. Hood's handwriting—I recollect seeing him write his name onee to a mortgage when it was paid off—that was at Chard; it may have been a year or so before his death—I have never made an affidavit that I believed this to be his will—I think I became engaged for the parties who now hold the pro<lb></lb>perty when the prisoner first commenced these proceedings, in the year 1842—I recollect meeting the defendant in Holborn on one occasion, he came and said something to me in the street—I did not make any appointment with him—I am quite certain of that—I should think our conversation lasted about half a minute; that was the only conversation I had with him—I think I also saw him once when he was down making these distresses—I have certainly not spoken to him above once in London, and that was only for half a minute, or less—I think I saw him at Exeter, when our cause came on for trial—I had no conversation with him then, none what<lb></lb>ever—I only know from what he says himself, that he has taken out letters of administration, from letters he has written to me—the trial I refer to was when the first distress was made—Sir Alexander Hood replevied—the case was brought down to the Exeter Assizes, but he did not appear; he vent off, and he was afterwards put in gaol for the expenses—I have seen Mr. Phelps write—I do not know whether I should, or should not, know</p>

               <p>his handwriting; probably I should—he lived a good many years after Mr. Hood, but I saw very little of him, for he lived in London—I should think he lived in the neighbourhood of Chard three or four years after Mr. Hood's death, but I am not certain—<hi rend="italic"> (looking at a paper</hi>) I am not certain that the signature to this paper is Mr. Phelps's; I think it is very likely it may be—I could not swear it, I believe it to be his writing—I have seen a printed copy of a declaration made by Phelps at the Mansion-home in 1844—it is to the effect that he declares that the signature to the will in not his—that was not an affidavit made in any proceeding—he was a very old man then, living in London—that was a voluntary affidavit—I remem<lb></lb>ber seeing a copy of it, upon which I called upon Mr. Phelps, and asked I him how he came to sign such a document—his answer was, "I have looked I at the will, and I should say it looks exactly to be like my handwriting but I don't recollect ever witnessing the codicil, and therefore it cannot be"—that was the explanation; and that was the very person in whose custody I the will was, and who gave it to me—lie was not benefited by the will, he was disappointed—he expected a legacy, and did not get it; he told me so himself.</p>

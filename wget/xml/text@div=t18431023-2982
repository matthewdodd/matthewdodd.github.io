                  </hi>. I am foreman of the tea-warehouse No 1, in the Import Dock at the East and West India Docks. At half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 21st of Oct., I was in the warehouse, and saw the prisoner standing against a package or small chest of tea—he was taking out the paper parcels in which the tea was enveloped—he apparently took out two or three at a time—he then moved from the chest, and stooped down—I afterwards saw a mat in which he placed the packages of tea—I passed him, and returned again—he was still there—I had not lost sight of him—he had no business to remove the tea from the chest—he was an extra labourer in the dock—before I returned the officer had taken him, and five packages of tea fell out of the mat, which was then examined, and three more packages of tea found in it—there is a Chinese mark on them—the chest was full of them, and on examin<lb></lb>ing it I missed eight—he said he knew nothing about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer. On the 21st of Oct., about eleven o'clock, I was in No. 1 tea-warehouse—I saw the prisoner tying up the bundle with the mats—such tea as this would not be considered rubbish, that he was to tie up—I said, "What are you after?"—he said, "I am going to tie up this rubbish, and throw it out"—I said. "These are not rubbish, they are what belongs to the merchant"—I took the mats, and out fell five packages of tea—they were then examined, and out fell three more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Every day I had to chuck the rubbish out of the loop-hole for other people and myself to take it away; when these fell out, I said, "How came they there?" There are two officers at every gate; I could not have</p>

Mr. Stevens sent me to do this rubbish.</p>

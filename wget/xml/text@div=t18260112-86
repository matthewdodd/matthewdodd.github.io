On the 5th of January, about eleven o'clock at night, he came into the tap-room, and asked for a Welch-rarebit - I said it was too late; he sat down in the tap-room for nearly half an hour; when I called him to go to bed, he said, "Very well." I then went into the parlour behind the bar to finish my supper. I and my wife both fell asleep there - she awoke me - it did not then want more than five minutes to one o'clock, and I saw the prisoner standing near one of the doors which was open - he asked me for his candle; I said it was on the table, and he took it and went to bed; I then looked at the two tills in the bar, one of which had 10 or 11s. in it, and the other more; I had seen the money all right about five minutes before I told the prisoner to go to bed; I missed about one pound from one till, and all except one sixpence from the other; the Hollands bottle had been taken from its place and put on another shelf, and I missed some other bottles. I went for a constable, and we went into the prisoner's room, found some money in his pockets, and a bad sixpence in his waistcoat pocket; we found a bottle in which I had kept gin, but it was then full of gin and hollands mixed together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Was any of the money marked? A. No. It was in half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences; I had not counted the money, and cannot speak positively to the amount, but I think there was about 30s. in one of the tills at first, and about 1l. was gone; when I went to the prisoner's room, he had been up stairs about an hour and a half - I knocked, but got no answer; I then got in by violence - he was undressed and in bed; I found 31s. or 32s. in his pockets, in sixpences, shillings, and half-crowns; there had been a counterfeit sixpence in one of the tills, and there was one found in the prisoner's waistcoat pocket; he had thrown a bottle of vinegar into the street, which stood in the bar.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went into the prisoner's room; I found him in bed, and this bottle with the liquor in it; I found 11s. and a bad 6d. in one of his pockets, and 21s. 6d. in another, nine penny pieces, a half-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182601120039"></xptr>penny, and a farthing. I asked how much money he ought to have, and he said 24s. or 25s; this is a part of the vinegar bottle that was thrown in the street; he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was coming home I purchased a bottle of whiskey; I fell asleep on the table, and when I awoke I went to the water closet on the second floor - I then recollected that I had not taken the key of my bed-room; I went down again, and Mr. Moore started, and asked what I wanted, I said, "The key of my room;" he said, "It is on the candlestick." I took it and went up to bed, and soon after four o'clock I was awoke by the officer - he asked me what I had in my pockets - I told him as nearly as I could, that I had received 1l. 15s. the day before, and paid Mr. Moore 4s. or 5s. for the week's rent; the whole of the bar is surrounded with glass, and it is morally impossible that a person could go into the bar and pour liquor from one bottle into another, and then come to each till and take the contents of them without Mr. Moore's awaking.</p>
               <p>COURT to MOORE. Q. Were there two bottles, one with gin and one with Hollands? A. Yes; the gin bottle was taken, and the Hollands bottle was left, but nearly emptied; when he was asked about the money taken from the till, he said he had taken change of a sovereign at No. 305, Oxford-street, and had received 15s. for some lessons.</p>

             re-examined. When I went into the room I asked where was the money he had taken out of Mr. Moore's till - he said he had no money. I then took his clothes, and asked how much money he ought to have - he said he had received a sovereign and 15s. for some lessons; he thought there ought to be 24s. or 25s. remaining.</p>

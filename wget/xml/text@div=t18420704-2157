                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Bodle, and live in Fisher's-lane, Greenwich. About eleven o'clock on the 29th of June, I was in a passage, to which my door leads—the prisoner's house is in this entry—she came out with a poker in her hand, and struck roe with it between the shoulders, in the back—I followed her to take it from her—I struggled with her in her own room, and while struggling for it, the presented a knife, and stabbed me with it in the back—I had had no quarrel with her before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. She came in and beat me in my own room. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No, not till she struck me, when I tried to get the poker from her—I did not go into her room till after she struck me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I was called to attend the prosecutrix—I found an incised wound about the middle of the back, in a line with the spine—it was about an inch and a half in length, and a quarter of an inch deep—it is quite well now—it appeared to be given by a sharp blow with rather a blunt knife—the spine was inflamed—the spine prevented the wound being deeper—it could not have been given by the poker—there were some marks of bruises besides, but rather slight—I do not know whether the inflammation proceeded from the blows with the poker.</p>

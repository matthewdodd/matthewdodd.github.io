                  </hi>. I am a goldsmith, and live in St. James's-walk. On the 20th of June, the prisoner called on me—he applied for work—I had never seen him before—I said I had none for him—about a quarter of an hour afterwards I missed a parcel containing a gold guard-chain, a brigade-chain, and a seal-key, worth about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had just put it down on the counter when he came in—on the 24th of Oct., I was spoken to by a female—in conse<lb></lb>quence of what I heard I gave the prisoner into custody, I went with the policeman to a house in Field's-terrace—the policeman there found a declara<lb></lb>tion, which he took possession of—the prisoner was not there then—I went there twice—the first time I saw the prisoner in that room, he said it was his—he was working at Mr. Norman's, in Wyngate-street—this is the curb gold guard—this is the brigade chain and seal-key—they are all mine, and they I were all in the parcel.</p>

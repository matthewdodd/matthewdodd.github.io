                  </hi>. I am a cement merchant, and live in Basing-place, Waterloo-road. The prisoner had been my servant about five weeks—I had some elder wine in a cask in my cellar, and some sherry—I had missed some wine—on the night of the 27th of April she was tent to fetch some beer, and when she returned we saw some marks on the jug which we found to be wine—my wife went into the cellar and found some elder wine had been drawn from the cask—the prisoner then went towards the dust-bin, in the back premises, and we called the policeman, and found some bottles of wine there—we missed about ten gallons of elder wine and some bottles of sherry—the prisoner said she had taken some wine for her own use—the key of the wine-cellar was kept in a secretary, and she could not get it unless she had some master-key which would open that secretary—I always found the cellar locked—the key may have been left in the door during part of the day—no one lives in the house but my wife, myself, and the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 41.) I was called in on the night of the 27th of April—I found one bottle of elder wine and one of sherry in the dust-bin—the prisoner said she took it for her own use, because she got none from her mistress—I asked her where her box was—she would not tell me—I told her where I had heard it was, and asked her for the key—I said if she did not give it me, the magistrate would order me to break it open—she then said Mr. Keene could find it in his house—I went and got it—I went to where the box was, and opened it with the key—the landlord pointed out her box—I found this table-cloth in it with the name of "Morgan" on it, a green silk handkerchief, a smelling-bottle, a shift, some ribbon, and some other articles, and some glasses were on the mantel<lb></lb>piece—that place was not three minutes' walk from her master's.</p>

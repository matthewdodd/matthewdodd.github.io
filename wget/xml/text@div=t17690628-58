I had been out on the Thursday before Whitsunday, and when I came back I missed my watch from a nail where it used to hang. I asked my boy who had been there; he said nobody but a boy (meaning the prisoner) with a piece of lead to sell, and that he had staid in the shop about ten minutes. On the 29th of May a man came and asked me if I had not lost a watch; I said I had, and described it to him. He said he saw a boy, which was the prisoner, have a watch which he sold to a man that is gone out of town. I got a warrant of suspicion, and took up the prisoner. I took him before a magistrate. After the justice had talked to him he fell a crying, and said, A man threatened him if he would not steal my watch; that he did steal it, and sold it the man for half a guinea. I found that man went into the country that very same 29th May, and I went as far as Fenny-Stratford after him. As my watch used to hang, the boy might see it through the glass door when in the street. The watch is in pawn in Nortonfalgate, at Mr. Delforce's: I saw it there. My errand boy is but nine years old.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took up the boy at the bar; going to the justice he denied the fact, but when before the justice he confessed, that one of the men, where the boy works with his father, (carpenters) gave him a piece of lead, and bid him go into the shop and sell it; but the master not being at home he left it. The man asked him if he had brought the watch; he said, No. The man said, Go again, and give the errand boy a button out of your sleeve for some tin, and while he is stooping run away with the watch. He went again, and said, Here are two or three pieces of tin, I will give you these buttons for them, and while the boy was stooping for the tin, he went and took the watch, and the man offered him half a guinea for it. The boy said that was too little for a watch. The man said, If you do not let me have it, I will tell your father. Then he let him have it; but was so frightened, that he went and threw the half guinea into the river Thames.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Coppell, of No. 79, Hughes's Fields—on 14th October I was at my mother's house—my brother-in-law was asleep on the bed with two little boys, and my sister-</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186611190116"></xptr>
               <p>in-law was in the same room with me—there had been a little disagree<lb></lb>ment between her and her husband, in consequence of which she refused to go home, and slept on the floor, and her husband slept on the bed with the two boys—when I was going to lie down, my sister-in-law said, "There is some one looking through the shutters"—I looked, and saw that the shutters were open—my sister-in-law ran and opened the street door—she then came in and said something, and her husband went out in his drawers and stockings—after he came in I went to the street-door and saw the prisoner run to the corner of an alley opposite—he called "Chums" three times, and two young men came out of the alley with him—he crossed the road with his arms raised towards the door—I was standing just inside it—I put my hands up, thinking he was going to strike me in the face, and he plunged a knife into the side of my stomach—he said as he came across the road that the first one he came to he would give a bit of steel to—the blow sent me staggering into the passage, and he came into the passage to draw the knife out—there was a light on the table, which shone full on his face—he is the man.</p>

I am brother-in-law of the last witness, and was in her mother-in-law's house—my attention was called to somebody having opened the parlour shutters—I went out into the road to see who it was, and reasoned with the prisoner, and asked him what he was looking through the shutters for—he said something which I did not understand, and I hit him with my open hand—he then hallooed out, "<hi rend="italic">Chums</hi>," twice—I ran in and put on my trousers, and while doing so my sister-in-law went to the door—I heard her call out that she was kicked, "In fact," she said, "I am stabbed"—she was then on the threshold of the door—there was then a kicking at the door, but I do not know who it was—I know the prisoner is the man who was looking through the shutters—I have seen him on several occasions.</p>

I was at Mary-le-bone Pplice-court—Shrimpton had been bailed—I saw Morgan at the bottom of the court-yard—I recognised him as the man that had been carrying the bed—I went after him down the passage into Paradise-street—I lost sight of him—I went into a public-house, I believe the Queen's Arms, and found him in there drinking—he saw me, and walked out—I followed, and laid hold of his arm—I said, "I went you for a robbery in Westbourne-grove, Paddington"—he mado no answer—I then said, "I take you in custody for a robbery in Westbourne-grove, Paddington"—he turned and said, "Very well, you have got me"—he gave his address, 35, Union-street, Middlesex Hospital—I went there the same day—on the night he was carrying the bed, he had a brown cost on, and on going to 35, Union-street, I found this brown cost—I believe it is the coat he had on the night he was carrying the bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Great Portland-street, and am a master-tailor. I know Morgan—he has been in my employ about six months—he has had goods if mine to a considerable amount—I have always con<lb></lb>sidered him a steady, industrious youth—I am willing to take him again into my service—on Friday, 10th Dec., I went to his father's house—he worked at home with his father—I gave him coat to get ready to try on to a gen<lb></lb>tleman, at ten o'clock on Saturday morning—it was few minutes before five o'clock, or a few minutes after, on the Friday evening, when I took the coat—It was completed by ten o'clock the next morning, and was delivered to me—it was a job that would take time—it must have been done by working very late and vary early in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's father a tailor, and live at 35, Union-street, middlesex Hospital. I recollect Mr. Walter coming to me on 10th Dec., with some work—I and my son did it, and George, who could do very little, because he had not been many months at it—the prisoner was at home all that day, and never was out that evening—he assisted me to get the work done—he went to work again in the morning—he was not out of the house till Saturday night.</p>

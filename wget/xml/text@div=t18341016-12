I was left in care of the shop on Wednesday, the 10th of September, from a quarter after seven o'clock in the morning till eleven o'clock: during that time I placed this silk on the counter - it was in one piece - Mr. Moore and I had occasion to look for it, and it was gone - it was brown silk for covering umbrellas, with a tobine border - it was lutestring, twenty-seven inches wide - there were ninety-eight yards, and it was worth 20l. - I had placed it on the counter in the morning to clean out the shop, and missed it about ten o'clock, when Mr. Moore came to town; there was nobody in the shop but me - before that I had occasion to go out of one shop into the other, and I suppose in the mean time it was taken - I had but one customer there all the morning - it was a large roll of silk - I went round to a great many umbrella makers and pawnbrokers, and told them of our loss - next day we heard it had been offered for sale, and I saw that day a pattern about two inches wide at Mr. Wilson's, in Crown-street - the pattern is exactly like ours - it has a tobine border - I have not seen the piece itself since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you examined before the magistrate at the first examination? A. Yes - Lloyd was examined as a prisoner - he was not desired to tell all he knew that day - he said he would cause the person to be brought forward who gave him the silk - he was the only person in custody then - that was on the 11th - he said he had received it from a person, and he would do all he could to get the person into custody - the next examination was next day, Friday - Lloyd had been asked to find bail to appear if the person was taken - he at first said he thought he could find bail, but he did not - this was at the third examination - at the first examination he gave an account how he got the pattern - he was asked who he received it of - he was not asked to find bail at the first examination - he was taken by his own desire to a coffee-shop, for the purpose of finding Bradley Potts - he expressed his readiness to discover the person for whom he received the pattern - he gave a full account of what he had to say on the subject - he was not sworn - on the third examination the magistrate asked Lloyd if he received the silk from Potts - that was on the Tuesday, and that was taken down, I believe, in writing - he was treated as a witness on the part of the Crown at that examination, and he seemed to render every account he could of the pattern, and from whom he received it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. It was after Lloyd was in custody on this charge that he gave this account? A. Yes - he did not give more than one account of it in my presence - he said he received it from Bradley - he did not make use of the name of Potts - I do not recollect that he gave any address - I was in my master's shop on the 10th at a quarter after seven o'clock in the morning - I had one customer come in about nine o'clock in the morning - I missed the silk about an hour or an hour and half after the customer left the shop - when the silk is rolled up it would make a parcel of twenty-seven inches long- there was a wooden roller in it - it could not be doubled up.</p>

I have known the prisoner Lloyd about six years - he was formerly in the house of Morrison and Co., silk-mercers - after leaving them he was in business for himself in Fore-street, City - all I know of him for the last three or four years was his calling on me to ask for relief - on Thursday, the 11th of September, between two and three o'clock, he called and showed me a pattern of silk, and asked if I could purchase it, and what was the worth of it.</p>

             re-examined. I have no doubt this is the pattern - the prisoner showed it to me - he asked if it was worth 2s. 6d. a yard - I replied, that I could not buy under these circumstances - I must see the manufacturer - he replied, that he would bring the person to me who had the piece - I said that would not be sufficient, I must go to his house to know that he was the manufacturer, having my doubts of it - he said there were about one hundred yards, and afterwards he said it was exactly one hundred yards, and the manufacturer was Mr. Taylor, of Gee-street, Goswell-road - I said I would keep the pattern - he urged very much to have it back - I then told him I suspected it was stolen - he said he knew nothing of it if it was stolen - I said, having known him when he was respectable, I hoped he had not lost his character, and would give what information he could, as he declared he was innocent of any thing - he said he met a man named Bradley, in Bunhill-row, and that he would bring him to me next morning at ten o'clock, as he had appointed to meet him next morning at a coffee-shop in the City-road - he wished to bring him that afternoon, but I told him I should not have time to attend to it - he then left - after he went away I made inquiry, and discovered a piece of silk had been stolen from Mr. Moore the day previous - between five and six o'clock that evening, Lloyd called again, and inquired if I had heard any thing more about it whether it was stolen - I told him what I had learnt respecting it, and asked him if he could produce the person directly from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160018"></xptr>whom he had it - he said not until ten o'clock in the morning - I desired him to give me every particular respecting it - he said he had had it from a man named Bradley, whom he met in Bunhill-row - that Bradley had asked him if he knew any umbrella maker where he could sell such a thing, and that he replied that he did, and had come to me with it, being the nearest - I asked if he had any objection to go to Mr. Taylor's, in Gee-street, who he said was the manufacturer - he said it would be of no use going there, for Bradley had sold it since he had seen me in the morning - he said he was to sell the silk for 2s. 4d. a yard, and what he got more he was to have for himself - I sent for a constable unknown to him - when the constable came, I had advice how I ought to act - Mr. Moore's brother afterwards came, and gave him into custody - I suspected it was stolen, from the price he offered it at - it was worth about 4s. 6d. a yard at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. If he had asked a reasonable price, perhaps you would not have objected to purchase? A. I should, unless I found he had bought it honestly - I never suspected him before - I told him my suspicions the first time he called, when he wished to have the pattern back - he returned to me the same evening, to know if I had ascertained whether it was stolen - I do not think he has varied from the account he first gave - I told him I believed he had become the dupe of somebody who had come improperly by it, and I believe so now - I was before the magistrate four times - he appeared ready to give every account of the transaction which he was able - it was in consequence of what he said that the other prisoner was taken - he was told by the magistrate he must find bail for his appearance or be committed, that justice might be brought home to the person from whom he received it - I believe he was treated as a prisoner until the last time he was brought up - Potts had been taken into custody on the Saturday night before - he was told at the final examination that he must remain in custody to bring the case home to Potts - he was asked what he had to say, and it was taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the magistrate say he felt convinced Lloyd was innocent, but he must remain in custody till Potts was tried? A. He said he thought so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. All you know is, that his statement was taken down? A. Exactly so - the statement was not taken down before the magistrate the last time - it was done in a private room by the clerk, and after the examinations were taken down, Lloyd was asked what he had to say - I understand Potts gave himself up - Morrison and Co. are in a great way of business.</p>

            . I am a police-sergeant. I was present on the Thursday when Lloyd was brought into the station-house, in Featherstone-street, City-road - he said he had been employed by a man named Bradley to sell some silk- I asked if he knew where Bradley lived - he said he did not, but believed somewhere about Islington or the City-road - he could not tell exactly where - he said he promiscuously met him that morning at a coffee-shop in the City-road, where he asked if he knew of a customer for the silk, but he had no idea that it was stolen - he was taken to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160019"></xptr>Worship-street office, and there stated, if he was allowed to go to the coffee-shop in the City-road in the morning, Bradley had appointed to meet him there; and, by direction of the magistrate, I took him back to the station-house that night, and with other officers, all in plain clothes, we went to the coffee-shop in the City-road - Lloyd was sent in with another officer - I and the others waited outside - I suppose he was in there half an hour or three quarters, but nobody coming answering the description he had given, I sent him back to the station-house - I believe nobody whatever went into the coffee-house all the time - after their coming out, I went in and waited about half an hour, and then went away - Lloyd was taken to Worship-street again, and from information he gave me there I sent two officers to Lambeth next morning, (Saturday,) and about seven o'clock in the evening Potts was brought in by Clarke, one of the L division, who was on duty in that spot - I told him a man named Lloyd had been apprehended offering a pattern of silk for sale, which had been stolen - he said it was all a lie, he knew nothing about it - I asked if he had not met Lloyd on the Thursday morning at a coffee-shop in the City-road - he said he had, and gave him a breakfast, as he had often done before - that Lloyd was a d-d vagabond, and he supposed this was the way he meant to serve him out for it - he denied all knowledge of the robbery whatever, or the silk.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the Saturday in question I was on duty in Lambeth-walk - another officer, (G 140,) gave me a description of Bradley; and between five and six o'clock that afternoon Potts came to me and tapped me on the shoulder, and asked me if I wanted him - I told him I did not particularly want him myself, but there were two young men, who I believe were down at High-street station, that did want him - I asked him to go there - he said he would go presently - I asked him a second time, and he made the same reply - I then told him I wished him to go along with me, and asked him his name - he said that was immaterial - we went down to the station-house in High-street, and they could give us no information concerning it - he went with me to Featherstone-street station-house, and Beresford identified him - he was detained - he perfectly answered the description given of him by G 140.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. When he came up to you did not he say that two policemen had been to his house in his absence? A. Not till he asked me if I wanted him, he then said so.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM KURTON re-examined. I have always said there appeared to be two rolls in the bag - I said so before the magistrate.</p>

            . I am a watch-jeweller, and live in Little Mitchell-street, St. Luke's. I know Potts very well- I remember his being at my house on the 11th very well - in the afternoon - he left a great coat at my house, and carried it away in a dark bag - as far as I can recollect this is the bag (looking at one) - I helped him to put the coat into the bag - there was a small parcel in it, which he said was tea - when the parcels were in the bag it presented the appearance it does now, only it stood more upright - I have been out of Court during this trial - he took the bag away with him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far do you live from the City-road? A. Not quite a quarter of a mile - he came to me between one and two o'clock - he took it away about four or half-past four o'clock.</p>

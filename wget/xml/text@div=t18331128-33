            . (police-constable C 91.) I took the prisoner; I only found some money on her; she and her companion had left the shop; they had walked on to Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was not I standing by a woman who was selling combs? A. No; you were walking on; I said I wanted them for stealing some lace; they said,"Very well, we will go."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). I asked a friend of mine to go with me to buy a little bit of lace; when we went into a shop, I fixed on a piece which measured three yards; I took my money out to pay for it, and at that moment, one of the shopmen took my friend into another room, telling her she had some lace about her; they searched her, and nothing was found upon her but money; they then told me to come, and they would search me, as they said I had got some under my shawl, but nothing was found but the money in my hand; they told us we had better go; I then asked for the lace I had bought, when he said we should not have it; we then accordingly went, and in Bond-street, were buying a comb; and while there, the shopman and a policeman came and told us we must both he searched; they took us back to the shop, but nothing was found upon us; they took us to Marlborough-street, and then I was committed. My Lord, I do declare I was sitting in the shop to pay for the lace I had bought.</p>

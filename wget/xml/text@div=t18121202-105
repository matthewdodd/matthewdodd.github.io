             had to go through my room to get into her room. I only was there one night, I went to bed about eleven o'clock; she came up about one. She took my things and put them on I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the prisoner came through the room - A. No. I did not miss my clothes untill I got up, about eight o'clock. I heard the door go about one o'clock. I heard some one come in and go out. I did not see the prisoner. When I awoke at eight o'clock all my things were gone. I have never found my clothes again. She was taken up at one o'clock at a public-house near there. She had none of my clothes then about her.</p>

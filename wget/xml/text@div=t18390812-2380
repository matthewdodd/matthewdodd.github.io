                  </hi>. My husband is waiter at Nichotas Orchard's eating-house—he was ill, and I was attending for him on the 8th of July—the prisoner and an elder person came in together and asked for tea, which they had in the parlour, down stairs—after tea the prisoner asked me to allow him to go into the dining-room, to wait for another friend—the dining-room is up stairs—I allowed him to go—he sat down in the back-room—Heft the knives and forks safe in that room, in a knife-tray—I went there again in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and missed them—he had then left about five minutes—nobody could have token them besides him, as nobody could have gone up stairs without my seeing them, and nobody else went up—none of them have been found—the knife-tray was removed into the front-room when I went up—I had</p>

                  </hi>. I am cousin to Mrs. Orchard. I was sitting there at the time—I recollect the prisoner and an older man coming in—they went into the back-parlour—the prisoner afterwards went up stairs—the knives and forks were in the back-room which he went into—he was sitting on a chair in front of them, close to the tray—I was sitting in the bar, and saw the prisoner go out at the side-door, very slowly—I saw his back, and am cer<lb></lb>tain of his person—he had come down stairs very softly—I did not hear his footsteps on the stairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in London-street, and was called on to take the prisoner in charge for this—Mr. Orchard said he was the only person who had been in the room, and the knives were missing before any body else went into the room—he denied taking them—the third person who was in company with him, the prisoner said he had met coming home from Fairlop-fair, and he became acquainted with him in consequence of an accident which happened to a fly—I found a sovereign and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on him.</p>

               <p>He lay in the shop; when I got up, I missed the shoes; he was brought back to my house on Tuesday night by some neighbours apprentices. I charged him with the shoes : he confessed the taking the things in the indictment, and took me to three pawn-brokers, but I found none of them. I said, if he would confess, I did not want to hurt him, or do any thing at all to him; I carried him before a justice next day; there he said he sold the shoes in Rag-fair.</p>

He said, no; he sold them to the people going about with cloaths on their arms, and that he sold all of them for 4 s. 6 d. and said he put dirt on the bottoms of them, to make them look like old ones.</p>

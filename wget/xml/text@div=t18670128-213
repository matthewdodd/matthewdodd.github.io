                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 14, Southampton Buildings, and have been so for the last ten or twelve years—in Sep<lb></lb>tember, 1865, the defendant was introduced to me by a solicitor Mr. Jenkins—he came to my office with the solicitor—I first had an interview with the solicitor—he came for the purpose of borrowing 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he wanted 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on security of some money which was then in the hands of the Accountant-General of the Court of Chancery, which he was entitled to in right of his wife; that the sum was something 'like 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but, it then being the long vacation, he could not get the money, or the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186701280009"></xptr>
               <p>money could not be got out of Court until after the vacation—he said the money was required for business purposes in connection with two news<lb></lb>papers which he had—he named those two newspapers—that I might know exactly how he stood in the world, I took down on a piece of paper the amount of his liabilities from his own mouth, the exact titles of the two papers, the <hi rend="italic">South London News and Croydoni Free Press</hi>, and other necessary information for me to judge whether he was involved or not—upon that I agreed to lend him the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at ten per cent. per annum, pay<lb></lb>able at the end of three months, but I said, inasmuch as the amount in the hands of the Accountant-General could not be ascertained, it was necess<lb></lb>ary I should take time to inform myself of the nature of the fund; but, the orders of the Court being so lengthy and the expense to obtain them being so great, I required to have extra security, unless that expense was incurred to enable me to get the information, I proposed to advance 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at once on that day, it being Saturday, as he wanted to pay his wages for these papers, or else they would die, and I took an equitable memorandum—I asked him about his interest in the two newspapers—he said he pos<lb></lb>sessed the copyrights of them—(he said nothing about the value of them)—upon that I advanced 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him my own cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before I received the money from the client, in order that he might have the money at once—upon that this declaration was drawn by me, it is in my writing; I drew it out in the prisoner's presence, he read it himself, I took the precan tion to hand it to him and his wife, and asked them particularly to read it, and they both read it—this is the defendant's signature.</p>

Bruton, printer, in Crane Court, Fleet Street—I think that was after I had got the 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I served him with a notice which was required under the mortgage deed—I don't know that in consequence of that notice he ceased to print the paper—I did not hear so from Mr. Honey—I did not go to Mr. Bruton's about a fortnight afterwards, and tell him I had made a mistake, and there had been 84<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid—I did not send my clerk to say so—at the time I lent Mr. Jenkins the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I was not in great difficulties—I have never been applied to a second time for money—my father had his certificate at that time—he was not off the rolls for a considerable time, never—my firm was never in solvent—you did not tell me this was one newspaper with two titles—I distinctly made a point of knowing how many papers there were, and I took it down on the memorandum at the time—you told me it was the <hi rend="italic">South</hi>

Dear Sir,—I have yours of the 10th instant, covering copy of a letter to W. Chambers, Esq., upon which I have no remark to offer at present. You are aware that from the first I was drawn into the Haford mines affair, upon the clear understanding that the profits was to be equally divided between yourself, Mr. Crane, and me. That understanding was ratified by an agreement entered into between us three parties, and which was no more hastily entered into by you than by myself; and, therefore, to make an agreement one day to abrogate the next, seems to be absurd. As I understand the agreement, it is to divide between us equally the profits after all expenses are paid; and to that I adhere. Tour responsibility in the matter is no more than any one of us are liable to in any way. You must be aware that the time of a pro<lb></lb>fessional man, like myself, cannot be taken up with impunity to disregard in remuneration. You speak of the prejudice of Taylor. Do you think that I, for one moment, care a straw for the prejudice of a dishonest and dishonourable man like Taylor? My name shall not be even brought in question with such a fellow. I apprehend that Messrs. Le Blane &amp; Co. and Mr. Canceller know some one besides yourself in this matter, whatever you may think or write. You say that you bring all the property to market. You brought only Fair Rhos; the remainder have been added in the course of the correspondence that have taken place thereon. But who drew up that correspondence? We might go on to the end of our days making agreements to break them in letter and spirit. I am not so inclined, whatever be the hesitation which you shadow forth.

B.," to the alteration, are his—I am sure I saw him put them—there were three agreements signed at the same time; Bray had one, Arthur one, and I had one—this is the one that Arthur had—the signature, "William Bray," to this is also the prisoner's; they are all the same—I think this took place at 16, Dalby-terrace; I am not positive of it; we used to meet sometimes at one place and sometimes another—we were all three together when the three agreements were drawn up and signed by the prisoner, and when the initials were put to the alteration.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a working engineer, at 13, Palace New-road, Lambeth—I have been acquainted with the prisoner since 1842, during that time I have had considerable correspondence with him—I have seen him write very frequently—the signature of "William Bray" to this agreement is in his writing, and also the signature to the duplicate agree<lb></lb>ment—the signatures on these reports are in his writing—these letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are his writing—I introduced Crane to the prisoner in the year 1858—I also introduced Arthur to the prisoner—Arthur is dead—I intro<lb></lb>duced him about the same time—it was some time in the beginning of 1858, in April, and the early part of May, 1858—I frequently saw the prisoner—I was often with them at that time; with all three, the prisoner, Crane, and Arthur—they were in conversation about the mine when I saw them—they were talking it over about sending some letters to Mr. Chambers, and one thing and another, about the Haford Mine—the prisoner afterwards told me that he had signed the agreement, and that he intended to get it stamped—he said the agreement was between Arthur, Crane, and himself—he said he had signed the agreement between Arthur, Crane, and himself, and that he was going to send it to get it stamped—he did not tell me where he was going to send it to get it stamped, but he told me a few days afterwards that it had been stamped—the prisoner was not a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers—I never heard him say that he was—when I first knew him he was looking after a furnace belonging to Messrs. Mitchell, at a place called Pencoid—he was a workman there—he left there some time after<lb></lb>wards; before I did; it was not so much as a year before—I don't know what he did for some time after that, but in 1845 or 1846 he was at Mullens' works at Battersea—he was an assayer in their employment—I believed he remained there till 1847, or thereabouts—he then went to South America—I did not follow him there—it must have been nearly two years after<lb></lb>wards that I saw him again—he was then looking out for another situation—he got another situation, somewhere in the same quarter, to go out to South America—he was sent out by Messrs. Powles—he went out for them—I corresponded with him, and had some letters from him when he was abroad—this letter of 26th April, 1858, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's writing—it was sent to me—(<hi rend="italic">This letter wot read in part; is related to some other property, and contained this postage, "You had better write to Mr. Lampart to get the things copied at Waterlow's, or somewhere, and tend to me"</hi>)—I never knew the prisoner by the name of William Bayley Bray, merely as William Bray.</p>

In 1858 I was a member of the firm of Le Bland, Day &amp; Co.—I do not produce these two letters dated 30 April and 1 May—I have not seen these letters since the year 1858—I believe these are the original letters that were then addressed to my firm; I see they are endorsed by a clerk whose duty it was to endorse them—our firm was at that time taking an interest in this matter—I know by this endorsement that they have been in the hands of our firm—I saw the prisoner I think two or three times upon it; I also saw Crane; I think the prisoner accompanied both Crane and Arthur—I had conversation with the prisoner, I think twice, about the mine—I cannot tell you what the conversation was—I have not a sufficiently distinct recollection to do so, but my belief is that no statement was made by him that he was personally interested in the matter, because I think he was introduced to me as the surveyor, but I believed from the general tenor of the conversation that he was personally interested in the matter.</p>

               <p>What did he say? - He desired me to deliver my money.</p>
               <p>What were his words? - Your money or your life! I made answer and told him I had no money, I was a poor working man; the other made answer and said, if you have no money we will murder you! then they knocked me down on my face, and mauled me on my head and shoulders; I had nobody to assist me.</p>
               <p>Was you sensible after you was knocked down? - No; then one of them put their hand in my pocket, and took five shillings and one penny from me.</p>
               <p>What else was done to you? - They ordered me to make the best of my way home, and if I followed them, or made any noise, they would blow my brains out; I then made the best of my way home; and on the Wednesday following I saw the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178409150054"></xptr> Rellions before Mr. Green, at his office; he was taken up on the Wednesday morning.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you now swear to him positively? - That is the person that had the pistol, and beat it about me, and broke all the stock of it; my arms were all beat to a jelly.</p>
               <p>Court. Now you remember this man's life depends on your recollection of him? - I am very positive that was the man.</p>
               <p>Now then as to the other man? - He was taken the latter part of August; I went to the office after I heard he was taken, and as soon as I saw him I had no doubt but he was the person that assisted in the robbery; I am very positive he is the same person.</p>
               <p>You never saw them before the robbery, did you? - Not to my knowledge; it was a quarter past ten, and quite moonlight.</p>
               <p>Did you take notice of the dress of the people? - One of them had a longish brownish loose coat, and the other had on a brown short jacket.</p>
               <p>Which had the short jacket? - The tallest of the two.</p>
               <p>Was you sober? - Yes, I had only a pint of ale all day.</p>
               <p>Where had you been? - I had been taking a walk out in the afternoon, and in the evening I called at the Ship in Stepney Church-yard, and had one pint of ale.</p>
               <p>Court. Only one pint? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Rellions. I am the lad that did the robbery, but he has sworn to this lad very wrongfully.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the lad that was with you? - I do not know who he is.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employ of Messrs. Pickfords the car<lb></lb>riers, at Leicester—I have known the prisoner some time; I cannot say exactly where he lives—I have seen him frequently at the Griffin public-house in Leicester—he is a jobbing butcher by trade, as far as I know—he came to me about 27th March, and said he had a portion of meat to send to London, and wanted a hamper and cloths, and would I go round to the Griffin back-gate and fetch it—I can't exactly remember whether he said how much—I went round and took the hamper and cloths down the yard—I lined the hamper and put the meat in it—I am not in the habit of packing meat—I was not the regular meat man, I was doing his work whilst he was ill—I do not understand meat; I am not a butcher—I did not to my knowledge make any remark to the prisoner about the meat; if I did I have forgotten—he said that it ought to have gone up the day before, that Robert Dunn, Chaplin's man, ought to have had the meat, but he neglected it, and so he came and fetched me—he never said anything to me about it being good or bad, or I to him—I was examined at Guildhall—the only thing he said was that if they did not send him anything down for it, he should not come to London to fetch it—I forget how many pieces there were; I was in a hurry when I packed it—I noticed some of the loin—I cannot pretend to say what other pieces there were—I cannot say what caused his observation about not coming to London for it—I don't exactly know that he said that—I did not to my knowledge say anything about whether I should like to</p>

Matthew's, late James Matthew's, Newgate-market, from J. Worrens, Leicester"—I gave it to Garson.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the detectives of the City of London—on 5th April, I think, I went to Leicester and saw the prisoner at the Fox public-house—I told him that I was a detective officer, and had come from London for the purpose of making inquiries concerning six pieces of beef that he had consigned to Mrs. Matthews at Newgate-market, on 27th March last, and which had been seized and condemned as unfit for human food; that my inquiries were for the purposes of the prosecution, and if he choose to give me an explanation he could, he was not obliged to do so, and if he did I should most likely have to use it against him—he said it had been seized and that was enough—I told him, No, that would not be so, it was a rather more serious matter than that, he would most likely be sum<lb></lb>moned—he then stated that he had bought the two hind quarters of beef of a person who had bought them of somebody else; he declined to say who, although I asked him the name of the parties—he said he considered the meat was fit for human food—when I told him he would probably be summonsed he made a complete laugh of it—he said, "I shall not go five yards"—a summons was subsequently served upon him, and he did not attend at Guildhall.</p>

I am one of the inspectors of meat appointed by the Commissioners of Sewers—I was in Newgate-market on the morning of 28th March, and saw some meat in a hamper at Mrs. Matthews', a sales-woman there—I saw it opened and examined the meat that was in it—this is the label I took off—the meat was part of a bullock that had died from disease—it had a bad smell, and was unfit for human food—its unfitness was apparent to any one—it was packed the same as butcher's meat ordinarily is for market—Mr. Fisher and I examined it, took it to the Alderman, where it was condemned and destroyed—I do not know whether this is the condemnation note—I never saw it before.</p>

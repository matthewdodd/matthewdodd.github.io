               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">STEPHENS</hi>.

                  </hi>. On 6th October, I saw the prisoner in my shop, and gave the last witness change to give her—five minutes after she left I went to the till and found a bad shilling—there was no other shilling there—I showed it to Stephens, kept it, and gave it to the constable—on Thursday, 15th, the prisoner came again—I knew her well, and had been waiting for her—I saw Stephens take her money—he bent it, and I took it from him—I said to the prisoner, "This is bad, and this is not the first one that you have given me"—she said, "I know I gave you that one, but I never gave you one before; do let me off; do not give me in custody"—she clasped her hands together, and appeared to go on her knees—I gave her in custody, with the shillings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You said that I had given you five shillings, and afterwards you said nine shillings. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I said that I had taken nine shillings worth altogether.</p>

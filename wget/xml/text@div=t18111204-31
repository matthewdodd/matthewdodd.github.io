               <p>Q. In the summer time you and your family sleep in the country - A. Yes, and left the prisoner in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 7th of September you discovered your house had been robbed - A. Yes. I lost a great number of things, and amongst others a printed cotton curtain. I asked the prisoner where it was the thieves had broken into the house; she said she supposed that they must have staid in the house all night, as there was no appearance of violence about the premises. I had two clerks that slept in the house, I enquired of them if they secured the door, they informed me that they had every thing safe before they went to bed. The prisoner then informed me that she found the door shut, but the fastenings taken down; that when she came down in the morning she found a bundle of clothes tied up and left in the parlour, which she supposed the thieves had left, being disturbed. I then examined the drawers in the parlour, the clothes and wearing apparel; nothing was gone, they apparently were not open. This bundle I saw, it was in the parlour, it consisted of no great value, the drapery of the beds: and these drawers contained valuable things. I then went up stairs with the prisoner into the dining-room and examined the side-board where plate was kept; she informed me that she had lost two table-spoons and two tea-spoons and they had left the same quantity. I found a number of things gone; the curtains had been taken down, she was to unpick them and wash them, and that part in question was taken away; I asked her how many curtains were taken away; she said she did not know, they were all taken away in the night. The curtain in question and two others. On the night of the 6th, about a month before the robbery, she kept the key of the bed-room in her pocket, it was a new thing for her to do. I sent for an officer, and she was taken in custody; he searched the prisoner, nothing was found upon. The officer took her down stairs. He then went up for his hat, and as he came down stairs she made her escape. I offered a reward of five guineas for apprehending her, she was not apprehended until the 15th of November in our street; she was in a state of intoxication.</p>

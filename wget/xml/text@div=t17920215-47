I immediately knew them to be bad money; I shewed the money to Messrs. Blyth, and then sent for a constable; when the constable came, I asked him how he came by this money; he told me he had it in change for half-a-guinea; the constable searched him, every part, and at last he found three shillings, and two sixpences, in his mouth; I saw them taken out; I wrapped the seven shillings in one paper, and the three shillings and two sixpences in another, and delivered them to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 25, Princes Street, Lower Road, Deptford, and am a night watchman at Mr. Tripp's, Blackheath Hill, linendraper—on the 22nd June, at 5.50 a.m., I was coming home from my duties, and tried to get my key into my street-door but could not do so—before I could get the key in, the door opened and the prisoner appeared with a large bundle—I asked her what she was doing there—she said she had slept there that night and was going to service—I ran upstairs and spoke to my wife, the prisoner having passed me and gone into the street—I then went back and ran after the prisoner—she threw the bundle over a wall—I caught her and handed her over to a man named Brown and I went for a con<lb></lb>stable—when we returned she had gone—I got over the wall and got the bundle—I saw her again about half an hour after, in custody—these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my property, and were in the bundle—they were in my possession the evening before.</p>

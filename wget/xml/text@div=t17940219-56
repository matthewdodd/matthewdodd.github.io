               <p>The prisoner at the bar came to my shop to buy some silver spoons, the 27th of December, Friday, he agreed for the spoons, and looked at two more silver articles, he then begged a bill, the three articles came to two pounds three shillings, but he desired the abatement of the one shilling, which we did; then he presented this bill for payment. At the first moment I took it for a Bank note, but on looking at it I saw it was a bill payable at Taylor and Lloyd's. I asked him to endorse it; when I gave him the pen I discovered something of a sluttering in the man, he attempted to write and he could not; he turned about the note and began at the other corner, he could not write there; and then I addressed him, I said I would give him a book to write upon, he then in an awkward manner writ his name on the note; I gave him the change in three guineas, and the spoons; I thought there was something suspicious, I slipped on my hat very artful, and I followed him and kept him in my eye till he came to Soho-square, there he joined a very suspicious young man, I then came up to him and touched him by the shoulder, and told him he must come back with me, that he had given me a forged note; he seemed very much surprised, and asked me how I knew it, and where I had been to know it? he came back very quiet, I begged him to give me my money and spoons, and I give him the note again; but when he had got the note he said, I knew very little about notes, for it was a good note; we exchanged two or three words and I said, will you let me look at it again, he did, and then I said, he should go along with me, there was a carriage then came up to the door, and while I put my head into the door he slipped away, and he was taken about a fortnight after.</p>

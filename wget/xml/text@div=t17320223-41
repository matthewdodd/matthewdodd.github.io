            , the Prisoner's Maid. Last Tuesday was Seven-night, between 12 and 1, my Mistress (the Prisoner's Mother) told me I might go to Bed (for I was not very well) and she would sit upto let my Master in; and so I did. My Bed is below in the Kitchin, and my Mistress lies with me. I fell asleep, and was waked with a Noise above Stairs about One or Two o'Clock. The Prisoner was knocking violently against the Inside of the Door of the Room where he lay, the Room is even with the Shop; and I heard him call out, Damn ye, ye old Bitch, do ye think I'll be lock'd up in my own House ? My Mistress told him she would not open his Door, till she had open'd the Street Door first: I heard her open the Street Door, and go out, and shut it after her. As soon as she was gone, my Master came down into the Kitchin, and call'd to me; Mary, says he, where are ye? Here, Sir, says I; What in Bed? says he; Yes, Sir, says I; What do ye want? I am come to bid you good Night, says he, give me a Buss. I was very much frighted, for he was stark naked without his Shirt. Sir, says I, you had much better go to Bed: No, says he, I will have a Buss first. He came to my Bed-side, and as he did not offer any Rudeness, I suffer'd him to kiss me once or twice, in hopes that he would then go away. But instead of that, he got upon the Bed ( out side the Bed-Clothes) and lay upon me ry hard, and endeavour'd to pu his Hand into the Bed, but with much difficulty I kept them out ; I begg'd him to leave me, and look after my Mistress, who was gone into the Street, and might come to some hurt a that time of Night. I had hardly spoke, when my Mistress appear'd by my Bed-side (for she had the Key of the Street-Door in or Pocket when she was dead.) You Dog, said she, what business have you upon the Maid's Bed ? With that he got up and said, Damn ye, you old Bitch, I don't know what Business you have in my House. She ran into the Coal-Vault to hide herself, and in running, her Candle went out. He ran to the Fire, and lighted a Match, and went to look for her; but she got by him and ran up Stairs, and he after her. I heard a great Scuffle, and a Struggling in the Passage at the Stairs Head as if he was running after her, and she was endeavouring to get away from him; I heard no Blows indeed, but presently she fell down with such Violence, as if Part of the House had fall'n with her: She neither spoke, nor so much as groan'd. He ran down immediately after her, and cry'd out, Damn the old Bitch, I have murder'd her, and I shall be hang'd for her. Mary! bring me a Candle. I am coming Sir, says I, but being in a Fright, I ran up Stairs in my Shift to Mr. Gold's Chamber, and begg'd that I might stay there a little, (Mr. Gold and his Brother lie together.) Aye, pray do, said they, and bolt the Door, for in his Passion he may murder us too. The Prisoner continued calling out, Mary! bring a Light! I have murder'd my dear Mother, and I shall be hang'd; after some time the Gentlemen bid me call the Watch, and then I ventur'd down again. The Street Door was open, and a Washerwoman came in with a Candle and Lanthern; but I was in such a Fright, that I don't remember whether it was I or any Body else that open'd the Door. Then the Prisoner call'd for a Knife, or a Fork to bleed his Mother; I brought him a Fork, he prick'd her Arm, it bled a little, and he said, He would give a 1000 l. to save her Life. She had a Napkin on her Head, and it was bloody. The Prisoner sent for a Surgeon, and Mr. Martin came and said, he believ'd she was dead.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173202230019"></xptr>Court. How long had you liv'd with the Prisoner? Parrot. About a Month.</p>
               <p>Court. How did he behave himself to his Mother in that time? Did you ever observe that he treated her with ill Usage?</p>
               <p>Parrot. He would sometimes scold at her as I thought, but I don't know what he said, because he us'd to speak in French; but at such times I have seen him pull her by the Nose, and push his Hand in her Face, thus -</p>
               <p>Court. In Anger? Parrot. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say you would hang me if you could, and that you would hang me rather than be hang'd your self?</p>
               <p>Parrot. No, some People that were strangers to me were saying, that if they had been as me, they would have let my Master have lain with them to have saved his Life. And I answer'd, that I would see half the World hang'd before he should lye with me, or Words to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How much Liquor did you fetch your Mistress that Night?</p>
               <p>Parrot. About 2 o'Clock I fetch'd her half a Pint of Gin and Bitter (I think they call it) and she gave me a Glass to carry to the Watch and to another Woman. I never saw her fuddled in my Life, and yet I know she would drink a great deal; but she was so much used to it, that it would hardly disorder her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Parrot. I cannot say you was drunk, I have seen you much worse, I believe you had been drinking, but you seem'd to be sensible, only you was in a great Passion.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How did I behave my self after you came down?</p>
               <p>Parrot. I was so frighted that I could not take particular Notice; but I remember you trembled and said, You would give a thousand Pounds to save her Life.</p>

            . I lodg'd up one Pair of Stairs at the Prisoner's House, about 2 in the Morning I heard a violent Out-cry of Murder. I waked my younger Brother who lay with me, and the Noise continuing I went down and found the Prisone (in his Shirt and Breeches, without his Wag) opening the Street Door, his Mother had a Candle in her Hand, and Mrs. Bormen stood crying with her Hair loose about her Ears, and the Prisoner gave her several Blows, and call'd the Watch, and bid them carry her Home, or to the Roundhouse. I asked him if he was not asham'd of himself, he said, She was an but his Mother said, was and Woman, and had brought him had lost his Watch and his M. When Mrs. Brown was gone, I was going upto bed again; but the Deceas'd pull'd me by the Sleeve, and pointed to his Door that I should get him to Bed. I persuaded him into his Room, and he sat down on the Bed side. As he was undressing himself, he told his Mother, that she was a wicked, drunken Monster, and a base Woman; that she had been the Ruin of him; that all his Misfortunes were owing to her, and that he had paid 15 or 16 l. for her but a few Days before. His Mother said, if it was so, it did not become him to tell her of it in that manner. He was in a great Passion, but at last I got him to Bed, and we went out; I shut his Door, and his Mother shut the Door of the Shop that goes into the Passage. I advised her to go to Bed, she thank'd me, and went down, and I went up.</p>
               <p>Court. Was either of them drunk?</p>
               <p>Gold. I believe they had both been drinking, but they both spoke perfectly well, and appear'd to be well in their Senses; I had not been a-Bed three Minutes when I heard a violent Noise at his Door. He swore he would not be lock'd in, but would break open the Door. I thought then he was coming to have a farther Dispute with his Mother, for I did not think the Maid was in the House because I had not seen her when he quarrell'd with Mrs. Bowman. While he was knocking at his own Door. I heard his Mother say. If I must open this Door, I'll have it. When his Door was open'd, I heard the Street Door shut, and then I was pretty easy. But soon after I heard a running and a scuffling Noise, as if two were struggling, and something fell down with a violent Force. After which I heard somebody come up to my Door barefoot, I at first thought it was the Prisoner, but opening the Door I found it was the Maid. Lord, Sir, says she, my Master has murder'd my Mistress, and I am afraid murder me too; and so I let he in. We all went down in a little time, and I believe my Brother<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173202230020"></xptr> open'd the Street Door and call'd the Watch. I went into the Kitchin, and found the Prisoner sitting stark naked with his Mother's Head in his Lap. He cry

            , Watchman. As I was crying the hour of the Night, I came to the Prisoner's Door, and found a strange Watchman. What do you do here Friend, says I, Why, says he, I have lit a Man and a Woman hither. I heard a sort of a Dispute with a Woman within doors, and by and by the Deceas'd came out and asked who I was? and I told her, I was her Watchman, so she bid me fetch a Pint of Beer to make my Brother Watchman drink, which I did; and when I was come back with the Beer, I heard words encrease betwixt the Prisoner and the Woman, and at last I heard Blows, and the Woman cry'd Murder 3 times; with that I knock'd at the Door heartily, and the Prisoner open'd it. Who are you? says he, I am your Watchman, Sir, says I; then light this Woman safe home, says he, and I'll give you Six-pence; but when he felt in his Pocket he had no Money, and so he asked his Mother for some, she said she had neither Copper nor Silver. Why then, damn it, (says he, in a Passion) give me some Gold! The Woman had no Head-clothes on when she came out of his House, but she had 'em in her hand, and put 'em on at the Door, and so we lighted her home, and she gave us a Shilling. I came again to the beginning of my Beat, and then I went to the Prisoner's door, and found a Washer-woman there, and she said she believed there was Murder done; so I went in (for the Door was open) and down Stairs, and there I saw the Prisoner sitting as naked as ever he was born, with his Mother's Head betwixt his Legs; I went and called the Constable, and other Watch, and the Prisoner said, he had murdered his dear Mother, the best Friend he had in the World, and called for a Penknife, or a Rezor, to let her blood.</p>

The Prisoner bid the Watch take her away, and she said, Ay, for God's Sake do, get me out of this House. After she was gone, I heard my Master knock at his Room-Door, and say, That be would not be lock'd up in his own House. And his Mother said, What a-devil ails the Man? I won't open it; or if I do, I'll go into the Street. Then I heard both the Doors open, and the Street-Door shut to again; and in a little time I heard her open the Street-Door with the Key, and come in.</p>

Dunbar, who lodges in our 2 pair of Stairs Room, called out to me, For God's Sake, Jack, get up, he'll murder the poor old Woman! So I went down, and he was making his Complaint, and said, O my poor dear Mother; she is dead. Why won't you speak to me? he bid me fetch a Surgeon. I went up and saw several Watchmen, and I sent one of them for Mr. Martin, and went myself for Mr. Weems.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever observe that he treated her in an undutiful Manner? Barber. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Martin, Surgeon. I was called up about 3 to come to the Deceas'd; I found her lying along on her Back: Says I, She's dead, you have no need of me. The Prisoner was standing sideways, and desired me to bleed her; I prick'd her Arm, but she bled but about a Spoonful, for there was no Circulation of the Blood. I observed a Wound on the back-part of the Head, about an Inch long. Next Day the Coroner sent for me, and (Mr. Weems being with me) I opened the Skull,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173202230021"></xptr> and found it crack'd in two Places from Ear to Ear, and a Piece of the Skull separated; so that it was impossible she should ever speak after the Blow. There was much extravasted Blood.</p>
               <p>Mr. Weems, Surgeon. Between 3 and 4 in the Morning, I found the Deceas'd dead; I felt of the Wound, but found no Fracture at that Time; I did not see the Prisoner, he being then in the next Room. I came again the next Day, and found the Skull crack'd 4 or 5 Inches, and a vast deal of extravasated Blood contained in the Ventricles of the Brain.</p>

I went out in the Morning to speak with Capt. Randal, and from him I went to Mr. Hasleton, the Riding-Master's, and so to several others, drinking with one and with another. I was at the Tavern all the Afternoon, and went to the Ale-house at Night: From thence I went to Mrs. Bowman's; she ask'd me for my Watch, and a few Shillings that I had, that she might take care of them, and so she came home with me. My Mother ask'd her to stay and lie with her, and so did I too, but she would not consent, and that put me in a Passion, and so I beat her, and called the Watch to take her away. When she was gone, Mr. Gold put me to bed, but I did not like to be lock'd in, and so I got out and went down to the Maid without my shirt, and laid myself upon the Bed; and then my poor Mother came down, and ask'd me what Business I had with the Maid? and so I got up, and - and - my Mother run into the Coal-Vault, and I lighted a Match to look for her, but then she run Up-stairs, and I followed her; and some how or another, as she was endeavouring to get by me in the Dark, I suppose her Foot slipp'd, and she fell down. And this is the Truth, as I hope to see the Face of Almighty God.</p>

Sometime in September last, I had heard some spightful People say, that he had used her ill, and with unbecoming Language when he was in Drink. I ask'd my Mother about it, and she said, O Lord, Billy, it's quite otherwise, he has always treated me in the most tender endearing manner that ever Son did. Ah, Billy, I wish you was but half so good! She had enough to maintain her and therefore had no need to live with him if he had used her ill: But for 4 or 5 Years past she has been very much given to intoxicate herself with Drink.</p>
               <p>Mary, the Wife of William Atkinson. I visited my Mother frequently for several Years, and saw nothing but Love and Unity between her and my Brother: I never saw any Disturbance but once. when he desir'd her not to drink so much. But she always said he was the most endearing Child in the World, and the most dutiful Child that ever Woman bore. About a Year and a half ago, there was some falling out betwixt me and her, and thereupon I said I would never go into her House again; but however, she came to see me, and always said what a good Son she had. After my Mother's Death, I heard

               <p>Parrot No; but some Woman said they would let the Prisoner lye with them to save his Life; and a Journeyman said, the Prisoner should lye with his Wife rather than be hang'd; and they blamed me for not letting him come to bed to me, because, they said, that would have saved his Mother's Life, and his too. I was very much provoked to hear them talk in that manner; and so I told them, that I would sooner see half the World hang'd, than he or any Man else should come to bed to me against my Will.</p>

I never saw a Son more dutiful to a Mother, or more concerned for her Welfare; he was quite tiresome and teazing, in begging me to take care of her, if it cost him all he had in the World. The Passage at the Top of the Kitchen-stairs is not above a Yard wide. The Door that leads down the Stairs is in the Corner; and the Door into the Shop is almost close to it, not a Foot asunder; so that any Scuffle there might easily be the Occasion of a Fall; and if her Foot slipt at the Top, the Stairs are so steep, she must certainly fall to the Bottom.</p>

My husband keeps the Angel, at Tothill-street, Westminster—on 12th July the prisoners came in; Stroud asked for a quartern of gin—I served her—one of them required hot water, and one cold—Stroud gave me a bad half-crown; I put it in the detector—Warner then said to Stroud, "He has not given you bad, has he; you have some more?"—Stroud then gave me a second half-crown, which was bad too, and then a third, which was bad too—I gave them to the officer—they did not pay for the gin.</p>

The prisoners were given into my custody with these three half-crowns—I was in uniform—I told Stroud that she need not say anything unless she liked, but that what she said would be given in evidence against her—she said that she received them from a gen<lb></lb>tleman who she met once or twice a week on Westminster-bridge, who came from St. John's Wood—she afterwards said that she met him at Knights-bridge, and walked from there to Westminster with him and Warner in their company—afterwards she said, "Now, if I am going to be locked up, I will round"—both of them then burst out crying—they said that a man named <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> was in a public-house round the corner, who they got the money from—</p>

               <p>they pointed the house out, and asked me to go there, but I did not as I knew the place, and that it would be dangerous to take two prisoners then—Warner said that Stroud told her she had been with another female the previous day and got three half-crowns—I afterwards went there to look for I him—he was known there, but he was not there—he is a thief and an aaso<lb></lb>ciate—nothing was found on the prisoners.</p>

Warner says</hi>, "When Stroud went into the public-house for the money I wanted to go in too, but she would not let me; she told me to stay out and be quiet; and previous to that I asked Stroud how she obtained the money, and she told me that a gentleman gave it to her whose son had disgraced her.</p>

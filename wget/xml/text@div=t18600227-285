                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Turner of 127, Drury-lane—on 16th February a man told me to go to Mr. Mantel's and gave me a key to let myself in—I had been in the habit of going backwards and forwards there for many years—the prisoner was servant there; I found her in bed-she said, "I have got a bad cold and a pain in my back through a fall I had on Saturday, and hurt my back, and the chemist says I am to keep quiet for a few days and I shall be better"—I gave her some gruel and left her to do her work for her—I saw her again next morning; she was still in bed and I gave her more gruel—I went to her again at 7 o'clock that night, and she said, "If I tell you what is the matter will you tell any one?" I said, "No; what is it?" she said, "I have been confined with a baby;" I said, "I could not keep that a secret if it was my own daughter; where is it?" she said, "In my box"—she also said that it was yesterday at dinner time—this conversation was on Friday—I went again next day and saw her—Mr. Mantel afterwards came to town; I told him what was the matter, and next day I took Dr. Thain up to the prisoner's chamber—she denied it to him, and I asked her for the key of her box; she gave it to me and I opened the box in the doctor's presence, lifted out a bundle, and saw a female child.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D, I live at 9, Hart-street, Bloomsbury—I was called to Mr. Mantel's counting-house—he took me to his dwelling-house, and the last witness took me up stairs to the room where the prisoner was—I asked her what was the matter; she said there was nothing the matter, that she was quite well and able to get up; that she had had a bad cold and pains in her limbs, but that was all gone—I told her I thought something else was the matter, and wished to examine her but she refused—I went down stairs, and Mrs. Turner came to me—I went up stairs again with her, examined the prisoner, and found she had recently been delivered of a child—she said nothing had passed but some clots of blood, and that there was no child—Mrs. Turner said that she thought the child was in the box—I went down stairs again, and Mrs. Turner came down and told me, that the prisoner had given her the key of the box, for me to look into it—I went up stairs and Mrs. Turner took two bundles out of the box—I opened one of them and found the body of a female child, full grown, wrapped up in a dress, and in a portion of another, and two or three towels, and other articles, very closely—there were no baby clothes—the head was very much compressed, and the child had passed a motion into the dress, as if it had been living when it was put in—I went down and told Mr. Mantel to send for the police, as the child bore the appearance of having died from suffocation—I gave evidence before the Grand Jury on the charge of murder, but the bill was ignored.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When you asked these question first, were you by yourself in the bedroom? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; Mrs. Turner was present every time I spoke—I wished to lay my hand on the prisoner's stomach, but she objected and said there was nothing the matter; but when I was opening the box, shesaid there was something in it.</p>

I observed two or three people particularly active, and a bustle in the crowd, and in about a minute I missed my watch - next morning Ward brought it to me. I could not discover any person in particular.</p>

            . I am constable of Holborn. I was in the City-road while the mob were waiting for the procession; there was a hue and cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running from a gentleman who had lost his watch - I seized him; he said he had not got the gentleman's watch, or any other watch. He made a great resistance. I said,</p>
               <p>"You need not resist, if you have no watch, you will come to no harm." I took him into the City Arms, searched him, and found three watches on him. He gave me two from his left-hand pocket - the third he pulled from his right side, and threw it under the bench, which the prosecutor claimed; he said he found them tied up in a handkerchief - I asked him where the handkerchief was? He said he did not know. When I brought him out, a gang endeavoured to rescue him. I was in great danger.</p>

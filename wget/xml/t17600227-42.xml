On the 19th of February the prisoner came to my house and called for a pint of beer; some company went out of a box, and she went and sat there, soon after which I found a quart pewter pot in her apron, and took it from her; she said she never did such a thing before, and beg'd I would excuse it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was she got up to go away?</p>
               <p>J. Nix. No, she was not; then I bethought myself to look for more, and found 5 pint pewter pots hanging round her under her petticoat by strings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was she then?</p>
               <p>J. Nix. About a yard or two from the box.</p>

               <p>J. Nix. She beg'd forgiveness, and said she had never done so before, and own'd she had taken them with intent to carry them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>J. Nix. I have seen her in my house two or three times before.</p>
               <p>Q. What is she?</p>
               <p>J. Nix. Her husband is a labourer. She said she met a woman that asked her if she had any pewter to sell, who offer'd to give her a groat a pound for what she could get. (The pots produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . I was drinking at the prosecutrix's house, on the 19th of February; she came into the back room to two or three friends, and told us she saw a woman stealing a quart pot; we desired her to go and challenge her with it, which she did, and found the pot; then she was going to turn her out of her house, but said, perhaps she has got more; then she brought her into the room where we were drinking, felt about her and said here is another, it hangs by a string; she broke the string and took that, then another, and then another, till she found five pint pots, hanging about the prisoner by strings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner going away with them?</p>
               <p>Snipe. The prosecutrix was going to push her out, and the prisoner was going out; had not the prosecutrix bethought herself to search farther.</p>

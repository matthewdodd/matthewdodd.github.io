            . I work for a bricklayer when I have got any thing to do. On the 18th of January I was at Mr. Worter's, the pawnbroker's shop, and saw the prisoner Herrick come in there, alone - the prisoner Nicholls was outside the door; I did not see them together, but he said by the door when Herrick came in - I went out of the shop while Herrick was there, and walked up to Nicholls, and he said, "Do you want to buy a ticket of two pairs of shoes?" I said No - I did not see that he had any shoes; he was alone then, and I went home, leaving him standing outside the shop and Herrick inside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A bricklayer's labourer; when I have nothing to do my father keeps me, and I have worked in a brickfield - I sometimes sell green-grocery in the street; I was never at Hatton-garden or any office on any charge - I know a boy named Couch - he asked me what expences I was to have here; I said I might have 3s. 6d. a day - a Policeman told me so; he is not here - he came on Sunday morning, and told me to come to the office on Monday, and I did not go; the Policeman came on Monday, and said, "You will be satisfied for your time, you will get 3s. 6d. a day" - I have 9s. a week; I have attended here three days and expect 3s. 6d. for each - I have seen Nicholls carrying a baker's basket about before; I did not see the ticket he spoke of - I was in employ last Christmas; my father is a bricklayer - there is no work for men, much more for boys; I have sold vegetables and onions about for the last three months - I sold some last week; I was once at Marylebone office - a boy lent me a coat; I did not take it back when he told me, and he sent a Policeman after me; I had gone into the country with my master's carter, but not to get out of the way - the young man did not appear against me at the office; he was employed at the turnpike - he was a friend of mine; I forget his name - I had known him about three months; it was six or seven months ago - I have not seen him since; he came to our house for the coat just as I came home from the office - I was in the watch-house from Saturday until Monday morning, but a boy found the coat at our house; I was taken at home - I had been in the country for a week, and he thought I had run away with it; I believe he lives at Battle-bridge - I never was at any other office.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell Couch you was to have 3s. 6d. a day? A. He called me over to his house, and his mother put Nicholls' mother behind the door - young Couch asked how much I should get; I said very likely 3s. 6d. a day - I did not give that as a reason for appearing against him.</p>

             (Police-constable S 194). I was on duty; Evans' boy called me on Friday the 18th, between seven and eight o'clock - I had not seen any of the prisoners that evening; I know them, and have frequently seen them together before - in consequence of what Evans' boy said, I went to the shop, and found he was robbed; we went round to the pawnbrokers, and found two pairs at Archer's and Worters: Ridpath would give us no information - when we took Herrick on the Saturday, we took him to Worters', the pawnbroker; he denied having been there, but when the pawnbroker said he was the boy, he owned it, and said he had taken but two pairs of them - that he took them out of Evans' shop; when we took Ancion, he owned that he had pawned two pairs in Somer's-town, and Nicholls owned that he had part of the money that had been raised - he said he had received 3s. 3d. out of 9s. 6d., and he said Herrick was the first that took two pairs out of the window; that he saw him - Herrick was not present; he said they took six pairs in all - he said he had two pairs himself; he did not say he took them out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell Martin he would get 3s. 6d. a day? A. No; what I stated, at the office was taken down - I dare say it was read over to me, and I believe I signed it; I said there that Nicholls told me he had 3s. 3d. - I do not know whether that was taken down; I dare say my evidence was taken down - I do not know whether it was; nobody was present at the conversation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this signature your hand-writing, and what you said? A. Yes; I state here - "after Nicholls was at the watch-house, I asked if he was one of the three, and he said he had received his share of it."</p>

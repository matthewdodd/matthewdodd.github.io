On the 26th of August I delivered to him 1 oz. 5 dwts. 14 grs. of gold in ribbon to beat into leaves, and return to me in books, with the cuttings; on the 30th he absconded, taking with him the amount of one thousand gold leaves, and 14dwts. or 15 grs. of gold and shruff - I missed it from his room that morning; I sent him on the 29th to sell one thousand leaves,(part of what was missing;) he returned after I was gone to bed, and in the morning he said he had sold five hundred leaves; he gave me 5s. on Saturday morning, which was for one hundred: (I was summoned to a Coroner's Jury) I said he should give me more than that - he said he would make it right in the afternoon; I told him to stop till I returned, before he went out with the leaf gold - he said he would, and when I returned he was gone with six hundred leaves; and four hundred he had not paid me for; I found him on the following Monday evening in Eagle-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you find him? A. At his father's; he left his wife and children at my house - I turned them out; I found them all there; but I went there on Sunday, and they knew nothing about him; I was to supply him with gold to beat, and take it back at 2l. 10s. a thousand - we were not in partnership; I charged him for the gold - there was a running account between us; he owed me nearly 5l., besides what he took away. for rent and things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You allowed him to take gold out to sell? A. Yes, but not the shruff, which is cuttings.</p>

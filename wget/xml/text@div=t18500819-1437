                  </hi>. My father's name is William Bentley, he keeps a broker's shop in Church-street, Edgeware-road. On 23rd July I saw two decanters outside, at half-past twelve o'clock; a few minutes after five a lad told me something—I missed the decanters, went after the prisoner, and found him in Providence-place with three or four boys; he had the decanters with him—I said, "You are the person I want;" he said, "Come on then"—I turned round, and he was running down the court—I saw a police<lb></lb>man and told him—they were my father's decanters.</p>

                  </hi>. I live opposite the prosecutor's. On 23rd July I saw the prisoner walk up to the table where the decanters were standing at the back part—he reached one and brought it nearer to him—he then went under the blind for eight or ten minutes—he then went back and took the decanter that had been back, put it under his smock-frock, he then took the other, and put it under it, and ran away—I sent my son to tell.</p>

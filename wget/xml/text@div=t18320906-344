            . I am a waterman. On the 30th of August I put the prosecutor on shore - he had been in my boat with the two prisoners; when the prosecutor got to the public-house, he put his hand about his pocket, when he called for for a pot of half and half, and charged Walters with having his book; she denied it - she said she had it on board the vessel, and gave it him there; she pulled out a shilling and a few halfpence, and declared to God that was all the money she had about her - she then said she wanted to go to Woolwich, and I said I could take her to the coach; while we were talking I saw Griffiths go to the door - I went to her for my fare, and saw through the window Walters giving a 5l. note to the landlord at the bar; I went up to her, and desired to have it - they were then both going out at the door; I put them back, and asked her again for the note - Griffiths said to her, "Let the bl - y rogue have it - he wants to keep it;" I then said, "I shall take you both into custody - I think you are both in it together."</p>

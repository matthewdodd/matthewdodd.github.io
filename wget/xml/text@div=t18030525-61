            , lodged in our house; Ann Wright lodged in a back room adjoining the garden: On the 16th of May, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I called out, Mrs. Wright, are you at home? and nobody answered; I looked at the window, and saw the two garden-pots had been removed from the window; they were upon the ground; I then saw a washing-tub that had been removed from the bottom of the garden under the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How could any body get into the garden? - A. By going through the passage from the street; the door was upon the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were in the house at this time? - A.Myself, Mary Callan, and Cornelius Callan; I got upon the tub, and saw a half tester bed turned down, and missed a blanket, a pair of sheets, a pair of pillows and pillow cases.</p>
               <p>Q.They were your furniture? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>ANN WRIGHT sworn. - I lodge with Mrs. Beasley; I had the lower room backwards: On the 16th of May, I went out about half past six o'clock in the morning; I go out to daily labour, to whiten the rods that they make baskets with: I came home again about half past six at night, and found the window open; there is a fastening to it, but I did not fasten it, it was only shut close; when I came home I missed a gown and bonnet belonging to myself, and a pair of sheets, a blanket, and a pair of pillows and pillow-cases; I found my gown at Lazarus Jacobs's.</p>
               <p>LAZARUS JACOBS sworn. - I keep a clothes-shop: On Monday the 16th of May, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner brought me a gown and blanket; I bought them of her for 4s.(Vickery produced the gown.)</p>
               <p>Jacobs. I sold the blanket from my door for sixteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wright. I am sure this is my gown.</p>
               <p>JOHN VICKERY sworn. - In consequence of a search-warrant, I went to the house of Lazarus Jacobs, in Raven-row, Spital-fields; I found this gown hanging in the window; I did not find any other property; the prisoner was brought to the Office on the Saturday following by Jacobs; I asked her where she got this gown from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you promise her any thing? - A. I did not; she then said, she had bought it of a woman; I took her to the house of Beasley, to see if she could produce the woman she bought it of; and in returning, she said, I will not lay this blame upon any body else, for I am guilty of it myself; I then asked her how she did it, that the window I thought was so high that she could not get into it; she said, she did not get into it herself, but that she got a little boy, and put him in at the window, and he had given her the things out at the window; and when he came out, she gave him sixpence for what he had done, and that she had taken the things to Jacobs, and sold them.</p>

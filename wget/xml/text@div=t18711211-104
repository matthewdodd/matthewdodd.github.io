From instructions I received, I watched the prisoner Murphy, who was carman to Mr. Young-husband, on the 11th of November—I saw him arrive in Lime Street, Fenchurch Street, about 5.30, with a van and two hones—he unloaded in Lime Street and reloaded some empties at the same place—he started from there, and I followed him to Commercial Road, Lambeth—going down the Commercial Road, the boy who was with him took the reins, and Murphy went to the tail of the van—that was about 7 o'clock in the evening—I saw a man not in custody, come out of No. 45, Commercial Road, and come close to the van, and Murphy handed a sack to him; the man went into the house and the door was shut—the van never stopped while the sack was passed—I followed the van to Waterloo Bridge, up Stamford Street, and over Blackfriars Bridge, where I left it—on that day week, the 18th November, I watched the van again—Murphy was driving it in Lombard Street—there were a lot of packages on it—Osborne was with me—we watched him to Lime Street, where he stopped and unloaded—I saw him take something from a hamper which was in the van and throw it down in the bottom of the van—he then did the same thing again—I was not near enough to see what it was—we followed the van to Commercial Road, Lambeth; as it passed No. 45, Murphy looked up and whistled—the van did not stop, it went to the dry arch of Waterloo Bridge and stopped</p>

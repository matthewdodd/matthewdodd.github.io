On the 7th of March, about five in the evening, I saw the prisoner come out of the public house that goes down to the wharf, and make towards the warehouse door; I was about a dozen yards behind him; I went after him, he got into the warehouse before I could overtake him; I made the door fast on the outside, and went to acquaint the gang-porters of it.</p>

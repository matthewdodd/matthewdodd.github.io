             sworn. - I live at Bow, in Middlesex; when I returned home on Saturday last, I was informed I had been robbed of fourteen pigeons; about an hour after, a woman came to ask if I had not lost some; I went to Brick-lane, to bird-shop, and there I saw the pigeons, which I knew; the man had stopped the <rs id="t18031130-3-deflabel17" type="occupation">boy</rs>

               <p>- KEMP sworn. - About a quarter before nine last Saturday morning, the prisoners came into my shop, and asked me if I would buy some pigeons; they gave me a bag containing thirteen pigeons, twelve alive and one smothered; I asked them how they came by them; they said, their father had told them if they did not take them away, he would wring their necks off. From their appearance, and the price they asked, I suspected they were stolen, and stopped the boys.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear that to be the handkerchief, that was taken from the Gentleman?</p>
               <p>Dutton. I observed the handkerchief before, for I saw the corner of it hang out of his pocket, and it has been in my custody ever since; and the person that seized him, and I, carried him before my Lord Mayor directly, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the gentleman out?</p>
               <p>Dutton. I advertised it in the next day's Advertiser, and he came once, but never came again afterwards.</p>

               <p>On the 1st of December last, between five and six in the evening, I was coming through Soho-square, I met the prisoner, she asked me where I was going, and asked me to go to a place just by, I told her I was going home; then she ran after me to another place called <placeName id="t17830115-55-crimeloc320">Farmer's Rents</placeName>

I placed the buttons that she unbuttoned: I never got my watch again.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it dropped? - No, I knew the prisoner six years ago, ever since she was a little child, she used to come to the shop where I was; I am sure she is the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178301150088"></xptr> same woman, I did not know where she lived, she was taken up on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Court. Who advised you to indite her for a highway robbery? - Mr. Walker the justice.</p>
               <p>What did she unbutton your breeches with your consent? - Without my consent.</p>
               <p>What you stood still? - Yes, her apron was up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was coming down St. Ann's-street, and this man laid hold of me, and said, I had taken his watch.</p>

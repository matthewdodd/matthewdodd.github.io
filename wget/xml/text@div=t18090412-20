On the 9th of March, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Weston came into the shop, he asked me the price of a coat in the window, which he took to be a blue one; I told him it was a green coat; he asked me the price of that; I told him four pounds; he them went out and called Morris by the name of Jem; they both came in, he told Morris what I said respecting the coat; Morris made answer it was too much money to give, he could not afford it; they then both went out - Weston, with a view of looking at other coats that were in the window. He came in again, he asked me if I had a blue one; I told him I had, but I could not sell it to him; I shewed it to him. He asked me what I would make a blue one for; I told him four guineas; he then called Morris again by the name of Jem, he told him I would make him a blue coat for four guineas; Morris made answer again, called him Bill, it was too much money, he could not afford it. Weston then said he would have one, and he would give me two pounds as a deposit; he desired me to take his measure; he had a great coat on; I told him he must take his great coat off, or else I could not measure him; he said, oh yes, I will pull both my coats off; he did. I told him I could not measure him in that manner, he must put one on again; Weston said, oh yes, you can measure me, and threw out his arm. Morris said, oh Bill, you must put one on, the gentleman cannot measure you in that way. At that instant I heard a noise at the door, it was as though the buttons of a coat were hitting against the door; I was looking at Weston, with my back to Morris; I turned round to see what the noise was, I found that Morris and the blue coat were gone. I then told 
               <persName id="t18090412-20-person217">Weston</persName>
             I should detain him; he seemed very willing at first to be detained. I had nobody with me but a little girl in the back parlour, I sent her for a constable. After the girl was gone, Weston said he would not be detained; a scuffle ensued between him and me, he got out of the door, I got hold of the skirts of his coat and cried out a thief; two country stage coachmen were coming by at the same time and secured him. I did not know how to act at that time, the constable was not come; he got away, and ran twenty or thirty yards; he was secured then by the persons that were gathered round, and delivered to a watchman and taken to Bow street. Before he was taken, he said if I liked to go with him, he would go and get the coat back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Morris is the man that was with him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see Morris - A. I saw him on Friday afternoon (the next day) on Ludgate hill, in company with two more; I then did not say any thing. On the Monday following I saw him at Bow street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you, when you saw him on the Friday, not to stop him - A. I had passed him before I saw him; I was very fatigued, I had been walking near the whole day.</p>

               <p>Morris's Defence. I never saw the gentleman before with my eyes, and as to the coat it is my own property. That young man is innocent of the crime laid to his charge.</p>

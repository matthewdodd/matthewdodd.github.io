            . The prisoner brought me into her room, and put me into her bed, and went out again, and put the door too. She came in again; I had not got to sleep, and in rummaging about, she came to the place where my breeches were. I thought she was looking for her own necessaries, till she was gone out again. After she was out of the room, I clapt my hand at my pocket, and found my money was all gone.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Boyd. It was this day fortnight, about seven in the morning. I had sat up in the watch-house all night, and in the morning I wanted to refresh myself, being heavy for sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Boyd. I never saw her with my eyes before that morning. I happened to see her sitting in a public-house, where I went in. She said her lodgings were but a few doors off. So I went with her. She was to have called me about nine, but she never came near me after she was out, and I could not tell were to find her: so I sat in the house till five in the afternoon. She did not come; then I went to the watch-house, and the next morning I found her in the same public-house where I first saw her. She had a pint of purl by her, and a pipe in her mouth. I charged her with having my money. I fetched the watchman, and took her to Clerkenwell goal. She did not own that she had robbed me, nor will she now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your money again?</p>
               <p>Boyd. No, I never did. I had nine guineas in gold. That was gone, and she left me a bad six-and-nine penny piece, and three farthings. She had seen the six-and ninepenny piece at the public-house the night before.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. I want to know where the other woman is that lay with you?</p>
               <p>Q. to Boyd. Was there another woman in the room?</p>
               <p>Boyd. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that woman lie in the bed with you?</p>
               <p>Boyd. Yes. That woman staid in the room with me till five in the afternoon, but the prisoner never appeared.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to have so much money in your pocket?</p>
               <p>Boyd. I had received it, being paid off a man of war, and I was willing to keep it in my own custody, not knowing who to trust with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with the other woman?</p>
               <p>Boyd. She and I were in the watch-house together the whole night.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you both in the watch-house for?</p>
               <p>Boyd. There was nothing laid to her charge nor mine neither. I went there to get out of harm's way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that woman?</p>
               <p>Boyd. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not that woman take your money?</p>
               <p>Boyd. This woman took my money. I felt her about my breeches.</p>

               <p>In the morning I was going for some purl, when this man came in bloody, and his wife was in the same condition. He asked me to give him a little water to wash his face. I got a bason of water, and wiped his eyes. He asked me to show him the way to my house, and then to show him the way to bed, which I did, and he and she went to bed together.</p>

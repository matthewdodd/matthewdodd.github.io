I went with his nephew, Mr. William Shortto, to the offices of the defendant, in Riches-court, and in my presence he engaged berths on board the <hi rend="italic">South Sea.</hi> and paid 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the paper he received—the money was paid for the passage of Mr. William Shortto and his wife, and Mr. Aylwyn and his wife—they engaged the berths the first day, and the next day Mr. William Shortto and I went and paid the money, the second day I think it was—my husband was not going to Australia. nor did he pay any portion of the money—it was William Shortto who paid the money—I went with him to the office three times, and letters were read, and the ship did not sail; it was postponed from time to time—they went again, and there was no one at the office, two or three times—we then found that the matter was before the Magistrate—I do not remember what month it was in when we found the office shut; I should think it must have been about two months after the first application—I cannot remember how long it was after I got this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">the certificate was here read; it was dated</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">th Aug.</hi>, 1852, for 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">on account of passage money per "South Sea" and was signed, "For Thompson and Brothers, G, Shotter.</hi>")</p>

To Messrs. Thompson Brothers, 1, Riches-court, Lime-street, London.

As we are not aware of having authorized you to operate for this ship, especially for the date of sailing you give, which as we have not definitely fixed yet, we could not help expressing our surprise, and refused the documents. However, upon the parties threatening to apply to a Magistrate, we requested them to call again, and that we would communicate with you on the subject; which they have agreed to. If you will send us the amount, we will procure berths for these parties (we think the man and wife) in a ship to sail about the middle of next week. Requesting you will not act again in this manner without advice, which gives cause of great annoyance and dissatisfaction, we are, Gentlemen, yours respectfully, James Baines and Co."—"1, Riches-court, Lime-street, City, 30th Aug., 1852, To James Baines and Co., Cook-street, Liverpool. Gentlemen,—Is the <hi rend="italic">South Sea</hi> yet decisively fixed, or have you any other vessel now loading? We can let you have some passengers, if you will send us dates, and other requisite particulars. We are, Gentlemen, yours faithfully, Thompson Brothers."—"1st Sept., 1852. To Baines and Co. Gentlemen,—Our respects of the 30th ultimo still remain unanswered regarding the <hi rend="italic">South Sea.</hi> Do you intend, as originally proposed, to send her to Sidney, or have you any vessel proceeding to that colony in lieu of her? If so, shall we let you have some passengers? Awaiting the pleasure of your reply, we are, Gentlemen, yours faithfully, Thompson Brothers."—"2nd Sept., 1852. From Baines and Co., to Thompson Brothers. Gentlemen,—We have duly received both your letters of the 30th ultimo and 1st instant. The <hi rend="italic">South Sea</hi> will not be ready so soon as expected; but we have the <hi rend="italic">Luceparis</hi>, direct for Sidney, to sail on the 9th instant. She takes but a limited number of passengers. There is still room for about ten or fifteen steerage, and a few first cabin passengers, for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. respectively; but they should be here at the latest on Tuesday.

Gentlemen,—We can let you have some passengers per <hi rend="italic">South Sea.</hi> Please inform us, by return, as near as possible the day of her sailing, and mention how many berths you can allot us. We have had an interview this day with a party of four, who are anxious to go as chief cabin passengers, about the 25th of this month, and have no doubt we can persuade them to go per <hi rend="italic">South Sea.</hi> They are to call on us on Saturday morning, when we hope to book them, and forward you their deposits in course."—"10th Sept., 1852. From Baines and Co., to Thompson Brothers.

He wishes us to request you to state what number and what class passengers you can give, and, if we like the terms, shall berth them, on receipt of passage money. The <hi rend="italic">South Sea</hi> will sail in all this month."—"13th Sept. From Baines and Co., to Thompson Brothers. Gentlemen,—We are in receipt of your telegraphic message, and will take the fifteen passengers per <hi rend="italic">South Sea.</hi> to sail in all the month of Sept. Please to let us have full particulars of names, ages, and with amounts paid."—"14th Sept., 1852. From Thompson Brothers, to Baines and Co. Gentlemen,—We are in receipt of your favour of yesterday, and note we can have fifteen steerage passengers, at 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and will, in course of a post or two, let you know how many more we can engage, and what class; as also forward you the names and ages of those positively booked. If you can inform us what vessel you have sailing about the middle of Oct., we can at once positively guarantee you a certain number of passengers. Please let us hear from you as to this.")</p>

No</hi>; I think I was with him about six months—I only know from what he told me, that his brother died after the business began—I was there when Mr. Wanostrocht came, I think that was in Aug., or the latter end of July, he represented Baines and Co.—I did not see Mr. Thompson pay him between 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I know that he had a large sum of money for that purpose, it was the accumulation of passage moneys that had been paid; that was the money for one ship, I think it was the <hi rend="italic">El Dorado</hi>—I was not present at any portion of the time when the conversation took place between Mr. Thompson and Mr. Wanostrocht; it was in a private office, I heard no part of their conversation—there were a great many complaints about the non<lb></lb>payment of detention money, that is money given for the time of their being delayed from sailing, money paid back to the passengers—I know that in a great many instances it was paid by Mr. Thompson—in consequence of these various payments, Mr. Thompson's funds were very much reduced—he remained at the office up to the commencement of Oct. I think, or about the latter end of Sept.—at the time I met him at Paddington I made known to him that warrants were out against him—his papers and books had not then been seized; that was done at the last examination at the Mansion House—when I told him that warrants had been issued against him, he did not say that that fact would ruin him; he said he hoped to settle it—I am not aware that he said it would so damage his character as to ruin him—I cannot exactly tell how many cases he did settle, or how much money he paid; I know it was a large sum—that was paid in consequence of the repeated applications at the Mansion House—there was a very frequent correspondence between Messrs. Baines and Mr. Thompson, and also telegraphic messages—when Mr.</p>

               <p>Thompson was absent from the office, I had authority to open the letters from Liverpool—I acted upon the instructions in those letters in Mr. Thompson's absence—I treated Mr. Thompson as the agent of Baines and Co throughout—I know that he has paid them thousands of pounds in the course of the last year—that was all passage money—as far as I know, they never repudiated his authority until after the public investigation at the Mansion House—I saw all the letters that came—the large sums of money were paid on account of parties that shipped from Liverpool—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two letters</hi>) I have seen these before, I acted upon them—cards of Mr. Thompson's were circulated respecting the <hi rend="italic">South Sea.</hi> and I believe advertisements were inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>; there were also placards—Mr. Wanostrocht took several of them—I believe I have seen Mr. Baines at the office, but I could not swear to it; I believe I have—I am not aware that Mr. Baines saw any of these placards—I do not know Mr. Mackay—I have had frequent opportunities of witnessing the conduct and character of Mr. Thompson, and from everything I have seen and heard I believe him to be an honourable man—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some papers</hi>) these are the telegraphic despatches that have been received from Baines and Co.—I know of no other business between Mr. Baines and Mr. Thompson except that which had reference to the emigrants' shipping—I know there is such a firm as Fry and Davison, I am not aware that Mr. Thompson has acted for them, not while I was in his service, nor for Marshall and Etheridge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship-broker and ship-owner, at Liverpool, Captain Brett is the owner of the <hi rend="italic">South Sea</hi>—we were agents for the vessel in Liverpool—John Jaffery and Co., of Great St, Helens, were the London agents of the vessel—I know the father of the defendant, he was repeatedly at our office in June last, making inquiry about the Black Ball line of packets; you will find a correspondence before you concerning it—I cannot recollect the first time I saw the prisoner, as the older gentleman was the person we always saw—I have known the prisoner probably since about Aug.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he in any way, and if so, to what extent, employed by you in reference to the <hi rend="italic">South Sea</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We made arrangements with Thompson Brothers, not only with the <hi rend="italic">South Sea.</hi> but with previous vessels, to take passengers from them at a certain rate; it was no business of ours whether they got a profit or loss—we used to take a certain number usually by each ship, and if we could take more we used to send them word—the <hi rend="italic">South Sea</hi> was the last vessel—we arranged to take certain passengers on certain terms.</p>

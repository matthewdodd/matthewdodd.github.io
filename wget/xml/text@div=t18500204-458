                  </hi>. I am a chemist, of Barnet. On 29th Jane, between two and four o'clock, Lambarth and Needham came to my shop; one of them asked for some oil of thyme, and after being served with that he asked for an acid, describing its properties, but appearing ignorant of its name, or as if he had forgotten its name—I gave them an ounce and a half of nitrous acid, in a two-ounce phial; it has a strong pungent smell, and would produce such spots as these on woollen, if it fell on the flesh, it would destroy the skin, and stain it, in the same way, and it would be very serious.</p>

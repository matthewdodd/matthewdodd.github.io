                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 175). On the night of 9th January last, about 12 o'clock, I was passing through Flower and Dean-street, Spital-fields—I was in plain clothes—I had been off duty all the evening, and was going home—I live at the station-house in Moor-lane—when I had got about thirty yards down Flower and Dean-street I saw the prisoner and four other men standing on the opposite side of the way—I looked at them very hard—I passed by them a few yards, and then heard some footsteps behind me—I looked round and saw the prisoner and the other four men coming towards me—I took no notice, but was walking on, when the prisoner im<lb></lb>mediately put his arm round my neck from behind me, and pulled me back on to his knees and held me there some few minutes, till the other four men had taken my purse out of my right-hand trousers' pocket—I am quite certain that my purse was there—it contained a sovereign, two half-crowns, and a shilling—the prisoner hurt my throat very much indeed, and twisted my back by turning me back on to his knee so suddenly—they tore open both my trousers pockets, and tore my trousers down to my knees; and they ripped open my coats, but did not injure them—as soon as the prisoner saw that they had taken my purse, he immediately let go of me and ran across the road into a court—I made the matter known to the police-officers there, and waited about for two or three hours to see if I could see anything of the men—I then went to the station—this happened close against a shop window which was lighted up with gas at the corner, and there was a gas lamp on the opposite side of the way—I did not see the prisoner again until he was brought to Moor-lane station on 28th March, on another charge—I then immediately recognised him as the man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 95). I apprehended the prisoner on 28th March at a public-house, at the corner of Fashion-street, about another matter—I took him to the Moor-lane station—after he was charged he was taken into the backyard to the lock-up—Steer came to the yard, and as soon as he saw the prisoner he said, "That is the man that robbed me."</p>

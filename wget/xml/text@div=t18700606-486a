I am a driver, and live at 11, Shaftesbury Street, New North Road—on the night of 14th April, about 10.30, I was with my wife in Cavendish Street—I saw a man and woman standing on the opposite side of the road, quarelling—I heard the man say something to the woman; I could not hear what it was, but I heard her reply "No, no, I won't"—I saw him put his left arm round her neck, and take something out of his right hand trowsers pocket and draw it up to her throat, and I heard her scream—she then ran over to my wife and caught bold of her, and I ran after the man and saw the policeman catch him—she had her hand up to her throat, and the blood was all running down.</p>

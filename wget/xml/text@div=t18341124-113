                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Edward Fletcher, of Ironmonger-lane. On the 13th of September, a man came there for a bundle of linen—I gave it him—it contained the articles stated in the indictment—these are part of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer. On the 16th of September I went to the prisoner's house in Field-lane, which was empty, about four o'clock in the afternoon—the door was open—he keeps an old clothes shop—I found these trowsers and drawers on a shelf in the shop under some other things—I then went up stairs and found half of the lid of a basket, the rest was cut up—the half lid was spoken to as being part of the basket the things were in—I have been searching for the prisoner ever since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know that the prisoner went to Waller's to see if he had any charge against him—that he said, "No," but he believed you had, and the prisoner went to Guildhall to see for you, and you were out of town? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I was out of town eight days.</p>

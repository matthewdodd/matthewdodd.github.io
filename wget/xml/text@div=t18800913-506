I live at 14, Hill's Place—in consequence of instruc<lb></lb>tions from Sergeant Butcher I went on 12th August to a public-house in Long Acre with a man named George—Gwynn came in, and George intro<lb></lb>duced him to me, saying that I was an engineer from Notting Hill—we adjourned to 13, West Street, Soho, and George said "My friend will look it those things you have got"—we went to the top back room, and George brought some gun tackle from the landing, and some barrels from the foot of the bed, and said "I want 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the gun tackle, and 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the barrels"—I asked him if that was the lowest—he said "Yes"—we went to a public-house, and had a glass of ale, and Gwynn said that his friend was a good pal, he was 18 carat, and George said that he was 22"—I said "You had better stick to him"—he said "Yes, I will do for him"—I said "How about getting the gun tackle away?"—Gwynn said "I have a cabman who has done jobs for me before; he can get them away when the police change duty"—I said that I had not got the <hi rend="italic">pieces</hi>, meaning the money, and I would come in the evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brass finisher, of 20, Queen Street, Long Acre—on 19th July Gwynn told me he had got some good things, some gun barrels and stocks, and dies—I said, "That was the robbery in George Yard"—he said, "Yes, I did it"—I believe ho said that the barrels were worth 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he should be glad to get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 10th August I met him and told him I knew a friend who bought property like that, stolen pro<lb></lb>party, and he left it with me to get a sample of the stocks and dies—he said that he would negotiate it, but he did not like to be seen in it—I got a pair of stocks and dies from him, and some tape, which I took to Mr. Squire—I afterwards saw Gwynn by appointment—we went to 13, West Street—he produced the gun barrels and asked 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for thorn—they were taken from under a bed, and I removed them to a table.</p>

On 13th August, a little after 7 p.m., I was with Church in a public-house in Soho, and saw Gwynn and Knight talking together—they left, and went towards Long Acre—I followed, and saw Church take Gwynn in custody—I then went back to West Street, and saw Power coming out of No. 13 carrying three parcels done up in brown paper—I asked him what he had got—he said that he did not know, it was something a friend had left with him to take care of—I called con<lb></lb>stable, and told him to take him to Vine Street Station—I went to the top floor of 13, West Street, and found the room locked—Bowen lives there—I burst the door open, and found in a drawer there this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> and chisel, this peculiar dark lantern, two pairs of pliers, two pairs of pincers, a small centre-bit, screw-driver, file, and other articles, and two shoemaker's knives—I went back to the station and heard the charge read to the prisoners—I took down what they said—Gwynn said, "That man knows nothing about it; I got the things from a friend of mine, and having nowhere to keep them, took them to him and asked him to let me leave them there"—I said to Bowen, "I found this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> in the room"—Gwynn said, "It is not mine; I do not know anything about it"—Bowen said, "What Gwynn has said about the things is true; the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> came tied up with the rest of the things"—Bowen said that the lantern belonged to him—it has two holes, one of which has a rod glass, and the other blue; it never throws a bright light, but still you can see.</p>

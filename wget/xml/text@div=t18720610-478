                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. PETER HINCKES BIRD</hi>. I live at No. 1, Norfolk Square, Paddington—the prisoner was in my service from October till 16th May last—on 31st May, after my family had gone to bed, I went out about 11.15 and returned about 12.15—I had turned the gas off in my library before I went out—when I came back I found the gas in the library alight, and there was a box on the table—I missed thirteen sovereigns from that box; 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from a little sovereign-box, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loose—a leathern purse which contained 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver was gone—I called in a policeman and we went down stairs, and we found the glass of the door leading to the front area was broken and the bolts withdrawn—I know the bolts had been fastened, because I heard the servant do it before I left—the front area has no steps, it is not used—when I dis<lb></lb>charged the prisoner on 16th May I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the balance of wages due.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner came into my service from a lady named McCann—I understood that she did not require his services any longer—we received a character at that time—he remained in my service from October till 16th May—the night before he was discharged he went out without permission, and I locked him out about 12 o'clock—he gave me notice, but of course I should have discharged him—I believe that he re<lb></lb>entered Mrs. McCann's service—she lives at 2, Southwark Place—I don't think he was taken there, but he was in her service—I have under<lb></lb>stood since that he went into her service on the day that he left me—I should say that the burglary must have taken place about 11.30—the ser<lb></lb>vants had all gone to bed—the person who committed it, I understood, let himself out at the front door—the glass of the window of the area door was lying on the mat inside, there was none outside that I am aware of—I believe the prisoner's mother lives at Hemel Hempstead—I heard him say at the Police Court that he had received a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note from his mother—I did not</p>

               <p>hear him say that he changed a note with Mr. Grove—there were no marks on the sovereigns that I lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not find the street door open when I came home, but he was seen to go out—it took place on the night of the 31st—the inspector called next morning, with John Carter—I received a communication from Mr. Davis, two days after, on Sunday, the 2nd June.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer D</hi>). On 2nd June I received some infor<lb></lb>mation from Mr. Bird and Mr. Davis, and I went to Berkeley Street, Hyde Park, that is about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Bird's house—I met the prisoner there about 11 o'clock, in the street—I told him I was a policeman, and that I should take him into custody for breaking and entering into his late master's house, Mr. Bird, at Norfolk Square, on Friday night, 31st May, about 11o'clock, and stealing about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—he said "Very well"—I then took him to the station and searched him—I found seven sovereigns, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, a silver watch, and a plated chain—I asked him how he came possessed of so much money—he said it was his last quarter's wages—I then went to 2, Southwark Place, Lady McCann's—I searched his box and clothes, and found this receipt, which was paid on the Saturday, relating to clothing amounting to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and this box of matches—these two matches were handed to me by Mr. Bird, he has got no matches in his house corresponding with them—they are common wax matches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been examined before—I have said before to-day that the prisoner told me that the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the result of the last quarter's wages—I heard him say afterwards that he had received it from his mother, from Hemel Hempstead—when I asked how he accounted for the money, he said it was his last quarter's wages—these are ordinary matches in the ordinary box.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. BIRD</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I found those two matches on the floor in the library, when I came back and found the gas alight—they are different from any we have in the house; two or three sizes larger—they appear to be the same size as those in the box—we have wax matches in the house, but not that size.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glove cleaner, and live at 16, London Street, immediately opposite Mr. Bird's house—on Friday, 31st May, about 11.20 or 11.30, I was smoking my pipe and looking out of the first floor window—I could see Mr. Bird's house, and the whole of the square—I saw the prisoner at the corner of the square—he walked up to the first lamp-post, and then went back to the corner, and in about five or ten minutes, that would be about half-past 11 o'clock, I saw him run up the steps and get over the front area railings—I went and told my wife what I had seen, and then I went to the second floor front room and watched to see whether he came out—I saw him come out of the front door of Mr. Bird's house—he was in the house from twelve to fifteen minutes—I am quite sure he is the man—I had known him since 8th December last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I went from the first to the second floor, because I went to tell my wife, who had gone to bed—she was sleeping on the second floor—I did not suspect there was anything wrong, because I have seen him do the same thing before—I did not know that he had left the service—I thought the thing very suspicious—I thought probably he was going to see some of the female servants in the house—on the Sunday, when I heard Mr. Bird had</p>

               <p>had a loss, I communicated with him—I did not suspect anything when I saw the prisoner go in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had seen him get over, about two months before, that was about 5.30 in the morning, when he came back, as I thought from the Serpentine.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. BIRD</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I believe the prisoner knew where I kept my money in the library—I used to pay bills that were called for from that source—the library is at the back of the house.</p>

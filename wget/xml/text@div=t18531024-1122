                  </hi>. On 16th Sept., I was living as housemaid in the service of Mr. Trood, of Tulse-hill—the prisoner was cook there—she came on 22nd Aug.; I was her bedfellow—before 16th Sept., I and my fellow servants thought she was in the family way—I had not said anything to her on the subject—on Friday evening, 16th Sept., she complained of the toothache; that was about half past 8 o'clock—she said she was going to bed, and I said, "So do," and she went—two other servants slept in the same room, in another bed—I and the others went into the room to go to bed at half past 10 o'clock—I asked the prisoner how she was—she said she was still very bad with the toothache, and had a pain in her back—as I was undress<lb></lb>ing she gave a sudden shriek, and cried out as if she was in great pain—I went to her bedside, she desired me to hold down my head, that she wanted to speak to me—I did so; she took hold of my band and desired me to place it down in the bed; I did so, and felt what I conceived to be the head of an infant—I said, "For God's sake what is it?" and she burst into tears—I said, "We all suspect you are in the family way, is the baby born?" she answered, "Yes; what shall I do?"—I instantly went and communicated what had happened to my mistress—Mr. Finch, the medical man, shortly after came, and I saw him take the child alive from the bed, it was a male child—as far as I could judge, it was a fine healthy child—I attended upon the prisoner and the child from time to time, I fed it that same night; I can<lb></lb>not say whether it swallowed or not—the prisoner had not provided any clothing for the child; some clothes were provided, and it was dressed in shirt, a flannel, a bedgown, cap, and napkin; there were strings to the cap, tied under the chin, I believe there were also strings to the shirt; there were strings to the bedgown round the neck—on Saturday I fed the child again—I did not notice that it swallowed anything then—it had been put to the breast, I did not notice that it drew anything—I saw the child, and looked at it particularly in the course of the Saturday afternoon, and observed a red mark round its neck, such as would be caused by a string or tape—nothing was said to the prisoner about it in my presence—I did not say anything to her about it—Mrs. Smith, the gardener's wife, was there on the Saturday—I was not present when she spoke to the prisoner about it—I last saw the child alive on Sunday morning at half past 7 o'clock, it was then in bed with its mother—it had been in the mother's care during the Saturday night—she was left alone in that room the whole of Saturday night—I went into the room with Mr. Brown, the doctor, about 11 o'clock on Sunday, and we</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising at Tulse-hill. I was sent for to Mr. Trood's on Friday evening, 16th Sept.; I got there about half past 10 or 11 o'clock—I was taken into a bedroom, and there found the prisoner in bed—I was told that a child had been born, and I proceeded in the usual way to make such an examination as would be necessary, and I then found a living child by the side of the mother; it was still attached to the mother by the umbilical cord—I separated it—it was a male child, and to all appearance a full-grown healthy child—it was handed over to the women who were there to tend it—I then left—I went again about 10 o'clock next morning; the child was by the side of the mother—after speaking to the woman, I said, Let me look at the child"—it was removed by the last witness, and I took it into my arms—I then saw what struck me as being something unusual about the child; the face was very much suffused, and bloody froth was oozing from the mouth and nostrils—I said to the prisoner, "What is this about the child? this ought not to be; have you been lying upon it, or smothering it in any way? now you have got the child, you must take care of it, it is no use making bad worse;" or something to that effect—she said something, to show that she denied having done anything to the child—I then left her; I did not see the child again alive—I saw it dead about 2 o'clock on the Sunday afternoon—I should think it had then been dead a few hours—I examined it in the presence of the mother and Mary Long—I observed a mark round the child's neck, as of a cord, or something having been fastened round it, or drawn tightly round it; the mark went almost entirely round the neck; it was more marked in the front—the skin was broken in the front, and slightly on the left side, I think—the abrasion of the skin showed that it had been done with some considerable force—I do not recollect whether the cap was on then—I have seen the cap with the strings attached to it—in my judgment that certainly could not have caused what I observed—I was present when Mr. Brown made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the principal mark of injury was this mark of a cord encircling the neck—there were two or three little marks, but they might have occurred after death, from the extravasation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240090"></xptr>
               <p>of blood, in the usual way—there were internal appearances of Injury, slightly corresponding with the external appearance on the throat—there was a consi<lb></lb>derable amount of congestion about the lungs—I thought it probable that the child had died from injury received during life—I should think the congestion of the lungs was the cause <hi rend="italic">of</hi> death—that was most probably produced from some circumstance applied externally, interfering with the breathing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there anything to show the application of anything externally to interfere with the breathing, except the mark round the neck? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you think that the interruption of the breathing was caused by that which produced the mark; do you mean that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If you ask me if that in my judgment was the only cause of the breathing having been inter<lb></lb>rupted, I must say no—I do not mean that whatever injury was done by that which caused the mark was not of itself sufficient to cause death—I thought the question put to me was, Was that injury to the neck the sole cause of the congestion of the lungs? or might there have been any other? I think there were some others—my reason for saying so is, that I saw the marks of an interruption of the breathing before the mark of the cord was observed on the neck—my own impression is that there were other causes in existence, pro<lb></lb>bably sufficient, independent of that, to cause death—if I had been called in and knew nothing of the case, except seeing the dead body, and the mark round the neck, I should have thought that the injury that caused that mark was sufficient to cause death—there was no mark there on the Saturday morning—I did not see the child on the Sunday till it was dead—I know there was no mark on the Saturday, because I made an examination to see whether there was such a mark to account for the symptoms which I have already described—if I had found the child's breathing defective on the first night, soon after it was born, I should not have been surprised at the conges<lb></lb>tion of the lungs, and the consequent death—I observed how the bedgown was tied round its neck; it was tied behind loosely—I think it was possible, accidentally, to draw the bedgown so tight as to produce an injury, that is, to produce an effect; but there was no evidence of its having been drawn so tightly when I noticed this exudation of bloody froth—it is a common thing for children not to breathe freely from their birth; but if a child breathe freely after it is born, congestion does not usually come on, except from some definite cause.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Saturday, 17th Sept., I was sent for to the house of Mr. Trodd, between 12 and 1 o'clock—I was shown into a bedroom, where I found the prisoner and her child in bed—the prisoner was quite under the clothes, and in a state of great perspiration—I asked her what made her so—she gave me no answer—I asked her if she had been scolded, thinking it might be the effect of agitation—she said, "Yes"—I told her to uncover the child and show it to me—I examined it—it was breathing badly, and it bad bloody froth exuding from its mouth—I told her to give it more air, that she was smothering it—I went again next day, Sunday, between 12 and 1 o'clock—I then found the child dead; it was in bed with the mother—I asked her how long it had been dead—she said about an hour—I had the body removed to another room, and examined it—I observed marks round the neck, particularly in front of the neck—it was rather a broad mark in front, with the skin abraded; the mark was nearly a quarter of an inch broad at the widest part of it—that mark must have been made by something applied tight round the neck—I observed nothing more—I afterwards, in conjunction with Mr. Finch, made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—we opened the body, and found</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185310240091"></xptr>
               <p>a good deal of extravasated blood under the skin where we supposed the liga<lb></lb>ture had been applied, and also some froth within the windpipe; there was also great congestion of the lungs—I did not observe anything else of an un<lb></lb>healthy character—the immediate cause of death was the congestion of the lungs—I attribute that to something which impeded the respiration—the mark round the neck was sufficient to account for the respiration being im<lb></lb>peded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But you had seen impeded respiration before that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the mark would not account for that—I did not observe the mark then; I cannot undertake to say there was no mark then—I supposed that it was impeded by her having it too close in bed—I do not mean merely by being under the clothes, but by its being pressed upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is it an uncommon thing for children, at their birth, to suffer from congestion of the lungs? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is a common thing for them to breathe imperfectly when they are first born; it is not a common thing for them to suffer from congestion after they have once breathed perfectly, unless there is some cause to produce it—it sometimes happens that children are born with diseased lungs—the injury might have been caused by the child having been lain upon; she might have done it in her sleep—women are generally in a very weak state for tome days after their confinement—they do not sleep particularly heavy after a short labour like hers; after a severe and lengthened labour it is so.</p>

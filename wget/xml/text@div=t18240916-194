On the 29th of August, between four and five o'clock in the morning, I fell in with the prisoner at the top of Fleet Market. I had been to meet a friend at Somers Town, between ten and twelve o'clock, but he did not come till one o'clock. I was quite sober. The prisoner enticed me home with her: I said I only wanted to lay down to rest; she said if I gave her 1 s. I should sleep in her room as long as I chose. I gave her a 1 s.: she wanted more, and said she would give 4 d. towards a pint of gin, and was going out for it, but she turned round, and said, she could make more of the room, and I must give her another 1 s. I was going to give her a sovereign by mistake; I returned it to my waistcoat pocket. She said I had better give it to her; and in four or five minutes, she untied my apron, put her hand into my pocket, took the sovereign out, and run down stairs. Another girl came up and said she was gone. I ran part of the way down after her, but heard the cry of murder, and was afraid; the officer came after another girl, in a few minutes, and I told him.</p>

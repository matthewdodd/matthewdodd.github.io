I pulled my watch out; she snatched it from my hand, and ran down stairs. I pursued, but missed her, and called the watchman. As soon as I got out the door was shut, but it was opened to him, and the woman of the house pretended to be in fits, which quite confused me. I saw the prisoner sitting by the fire, but did not recollect her then. Next night I went with Dickenson and took her. I do not think I was in liquor.</p>

            . My husband is a porter, and rents the house; the prisoner lodged in a room with a woman to whom I let it. The night the prosecutor lost his watch she had been nursing my child, then went out, and did not come home until after the loss - I was confined to my bed at the time. When he came into my room she asked him if he should know the girl again? he said he thought he should if he saw her. Since the prisoner has been confined, the prosecutor came, and offered me a 1 l. note to find out the right girl. He was very much intoxicated.</p>

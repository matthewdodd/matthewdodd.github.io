            . I am a constable. On the 18th of September, I was in company with Coates, and in consequence of information which I had received, we went to watch the prisoner. We went to the Blue Lion, Gray's Inn-lane, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, I placed myself in the house, and Coates went up Guildford-street. I saw the prisoner come down Guildford-street, and go into the field near Bagnigge Wells, when he got near the middle of the field I callared him, and told him I wanted him; and seeing he had a brown paper parcel in his right hand, I told Coates to lay hold of it - he immediately threw it away. I kept hold of him - Coates also collared him, and we led him to the parcel, and picked it up; he exclaimed</p>
               <p>"I am sold!" We took him to the Blue Lion, opened the parcel there, in his presence, and found it contained two 10 l. and one 20 l. Bank of England note, and a 10 l. Dover note. I marked them all, in his presence; these are them (looks at them). He did not tell me how he got them.</p>

            . I am a constable, and was with Sellers. I saw the prisoner coming down Guildford-street; he crossed to the field by Bagnigge Wells; I kept close behind him, and Sellers caught hold of him - he threw the parcel from his hand, and exclaimed,</p>
               <p>"I am sold, it is a dead plant!" I suppose he meant it was planted on him. I collared him, Sellers picked it up. We took him to the Blue Lion. The parcel contained a 20 l. and two 10 l. Bank of England notes, and a 10 l. Dover note. I marked them - those produced are them.</p>

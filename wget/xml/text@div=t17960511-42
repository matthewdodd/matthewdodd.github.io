I lost it on Sunday the 20th of March, about twelve o'clock; I did not miss it till past ten at night, when my husband went to bed, our little boy always undressed my husband, he is troubled with the gout, and when he had undressed him that night, the watch was not to be found; the little boy came down, and asked me if I knew any thing of it, and I said it would be soon found; this man had been out in the afternoon, and before he went out, he went up stairs, he said, for his dirty linen to be washed, and then my husband said Coleman went up stairs after his dinner, and desired me to go and see what money he had in his pocket, and he had but five-pence; the watch was afterwards found at Mr. Windsor's, in the Minories; she was taken up for robbing her lodgings, and then the watch was found; we charged Coleman with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110107"></xptr>it, but he denied it; there was not a soul in the house that could have taken it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your door locked all day or open? - A. We were not out of the house all day, nor nobody came into the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Nobody saw him go into the room? - A. No.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Mr. Windsor, pawn-broker, in the Minories; some time about the 20th of April, Mrs. Smith came and asked us, if we had taken in a jewel watch, with the name of Finley on it, we desired her to call next day, and then we had found a watch, pawned in the name of Smith, by the female prisoner; I know her by no other name than Mary Smith; it was pawned on the 21st of March; I asked her how she came by it, she told me it was her own, she pawned it for 28s. she asked no more on it, (produces the watch).</p>
               <p>Mrs. Smith. This is my husband's watch; I know it by the number, and the maker's name.</p>
               <p>Wilcox's defence. I never knew the watch was lost till the Monday after, and I met this young man in East-Smith field, and he told me his master's watch was lost, and he said, his master had turned him out of doors on account of it, and I never heard or saw any more of the young fellow for two or three days, and I never heard any more of the watch; I never had the watch in my hand since I left the place.</p>
               <p>Coleman's defence. I know nothing at all about it, I never had it at all.</p>

                  </hi>. I am storekeeper in the employ of George Frederick Young and others; they are ship builders, at Poplar. The prisoner was in their employ last Sept. twelve months—to the best of my knowledge he was there about six months, employed as a shipwright; it was at the time of the strike—amongstother tools in my charge, there was a ring engine—the workmen give their names to me when they want anything from the stores; they supply their own tools, but supposing any extraordinary tool is wanted, they apply to their employer for it, and this ring engine is such a tool—I have looked at it it is the property of George Frederick Young and Co.—while the prisoner was in their employ he had access to such tools as this—about the time of his leaving there were several tools missing, and one or two of these articles.</p>

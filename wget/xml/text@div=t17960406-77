            (To Mrs. Macnanus.) Was the prisoner brought to your house afterwards? - A. No, I found her in the passage; she came, I suppose, to take some more things. I asked her what she wanted? and she said, she wanted to go backwards; a constable was sent for, and she was detained till he came; I searched her and found these keys upon her, and the duplicate; there was no violence done to the door. These are my stays, I had only wore them twice; there was a dirty lace in them, and they were made for me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was coming through Smithfield, I met with another woman, that told me my husband would be at home in a fortnight or three weeks; we had no money, and she went and brought these stays, and pawned them; she left the duplicate upon the table, and I took it up; I went to enquire for Mr. Dawson, and this good woman came and asked me what I wanted; she took me up stairs, and used me very ill. I know nothing about the stays any more than the child unborn. I found the keys as I was coming from Chelmsford to London.</p>

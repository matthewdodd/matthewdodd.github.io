            . The first time I saw the prisoner was on the 6th of April. On Wednesday the 4th of April, an advertisement appeared in the daily paper, that a person wanted 100 l. at proper interest, with a premium; a letter was to be sent to A.B. at the Surry and Sussex coffee-house, in Fleet-street. I am a neighbour of Mr. Weaver's, and I was to go with him. The purport of the letter is, to enquire for J. C. at the Admiralty coffee-house. On Friday the 6th of April, Mr. Weaver and I went to the Admiralty coffee-house, and enquired for J. C. He was not then to be met with. We accordingly went again on Saturday. Upon our enquiring, the servant went up stairs to a billiard-room, and the prisoner came down. He asked if we were the persons that inserted the advertisement: I told him, Yes. He said, that if Mr. Weaver would draw some drafts three months after date, he could pay them away in the common course of business, as ready money. On Tuesday I went to Mr. Weaver, at a society that there about half after eight o'clock. The prisoner came; he was shewn into the parlour, where the prosecutor and I and another were. That person went out and left us together. The prisoner mentioned the same circumstances of the notes, as before: they wanted some paper; I cut a leaf out of a lottery-book, which he cut into three pieces for the notes. He said, the gentleman that was to advance the money, would only want common interest, as he could negotiate notes to a large amount. The prisoner asked me if I would be the drawer; which I absolutely denied. He said, it should be settled next time who the drawer was to be. He wrote the notes, all except the mark; Weaver made that. They were intended to be the forms, and I did subscribe my name as a witness. ( The bills shown him.) These three notes were wrote in my presence by the prisoner, just as now, saving the drawer's name,

               <p>Q. What is the reason that your name is struck out?</p>
               <p>Clarkson. The three notes were left upon the table after Mr. Weaver was gone, and I put them into the leaves of a book. Mr. Weaver went to bed about ten o'clock, and left the prisoner and me together. I put them myself into the club-book, while the prisoner was in the room; and, I believe, the prisoner went away about half after eleven o'clock, and I went home. I put the club-book in a kind of book-case, and locked it up; but did not take the key out. On Wednesday the 11th, Mr. Weaver was to meet him at the Admiralty coffee-house, and fresh notes were to be drawn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any appointment made that night to meet next day?</p>
               <p>Clarkson. Yes; in order to have a drawer's name, and to have the money. We received a letter from him that day, which I believe to be in his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take such observation of the notes, as to be able to form a belief, whether that is his hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Clarkson. Yes, I do believe it. I was present when the letter was brought, and made a memorandum of it at the time. A porter brought it, and I opened it. I wrote upon it, A quarter before five in the afternoon, Wednesday, 11th of April.</p>

               <p>Clarkson. I was not there.</p>

               <p>Clarkson. No:</p>
               <p>Court. Weaver cannot be examined; then the man must be acquitted. We must not presume guilt against a man trying for his life.</p>

               <p>GEORGE SWIFT. I am a boot-maker, and live in St. Clements-lane; the prisoner is my apprentice. On the 26th of January, I marked three 1l. bank-notes, put them in my pocket-book, which I put on a drawer in my frontparlour, between twelve and one o'clock; it was not locked. Next day I missed the pocket-book, and money, I sent for the constable, who searched the prisoner's box, He told the prisoner to unlock it, which he did; the constable found the pocket-book, two 1l. notes, a half-crown, and some receipts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I never said I believed the prisoner did not rob me. There are two other persons lodge in the prisoner's room-my brother and another. My brother is in the country; he did not ask my wife to lend him the money. I do not know where my brother is. I was never distressed for money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some duplicates in the pocket-book - A. Yes, my wife had pledged the things; she had taken some of them out of the pocket-book; my brother was present at the time-the prisoner was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hesitate to produce the key -

            He hesitated to open the box, and seemed confused.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. On the 26th of January, I took some silver out of the pocketbook; I left a half-crown, a shilling, and the notes in it. I was present when the box was searched; the pocketbook laid at the top of the box, not under his things; he denied taking it.</p>

               <p>JOHN BURN. I am a constable; I was present when the box was searched; the prisoner shewed me his box - He appeared confused. I did not ask the prisoner for the key; I told him he had robbed his master, and must give up the property; he took the key, and unlocked the box-the pocket-book was at the top.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not compare the prisoner's key with any other box in the room. It was an S key, which is a common one.</p>

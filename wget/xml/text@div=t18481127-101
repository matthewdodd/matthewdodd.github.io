                  </hi>. I live at 47, High Holborn, and am a picture-dealer—it is my dwelling-house—I have a gallery at the back of my shop up one pair of stairs—I keep some of my pictures in that gallery—I have also a small back room up another flight of stairs, in which I keep other pictures—I was not at all aware that I had been robbed of any pictures till the 16th Oct.—I kept pictures in that room and gallery which were not immediately wanted, and I had not been up there for nine or ten weeks before I discovered my loss—Cook had been in my service for about four months, I had a good character with her, and believed her to be honest—I trusted her with the key of a door which led from the shop to that gallery—she had that key before we were up in the morning—on 16th Oct. I missed pictures from the gallery, and the room, and on the 17th Oct., I was in St. Mary-Axe, and saw a pic<lb></lb>ture of a huntsman blowing a trumpet, in Rowland's shop window—I knew it was mine—I went in, made inquiries, and waited till Rowland came in—I said, "I have been robbed to a considerable extent, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you will act straightforward, and provided you tell me the truth, and will give me every facility to find the person you bought them of, and will not let any person know of the robbery, that I may find my property, you shall not be a loser"—I further said, "My motive in making this proposition is, that I may apprehend the thief, and if I discover more of my property elsewhere I may claim it," but he mentioned the robbery directly to other people, he broke the promise directly—he said he had purchased the pictures of a person who gave the name of Falk, who was introduced to him by a Jew that he knew very well, and from whom he had often purchased pictures—I wrote down an address which he gave me—I found two more of my pictures in his window—I then asked permission to look round his shop—I found as many more pictures as made up fifteen or sixteen—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is one, which is a cattle picture by Lister—he is a well-known artist, whopaints inferior pictures at moderate prices—I had seen Rowland on the subject of this picture at my place—he offered me a sovereign for it, and said he would give me a sovereign a piece for as many as I had of that artist—that was at my own place five or six months ago—after my conversation with Rowland</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184811270064"></xptr>
               <p>I told him I should put it into the hands of the police. and I told him to let the pictures remain where they were till I came back with the officer—I went aways—I left four on five of the pictures in the frames in which they had been taken from my house and where I returned in two hours, or two hours and a haft, with the policeman. I said to Rowland, "Where are the pictures that I saw here this morning, they have been removed out of the shop, the frams are here, but the pictures are gone?—he asked me to repeat the promise I had made in the morning, in presence of the policeman—I did so—he then said, "Now I will produce the pictures"—he went to the hack premises, and produced the fifteen or sixteen pictures that I had seen in the morning—three or four smaller pictures had been taken out of their frames—"The Huntsman" was not—the policeman told him the pictures must be restored to their frames—he did not restore the person of whom he had purchased the pictures—he said of a young man about five feet eight or tune inches high, with a light complexion, and a moustache—he said he had given the name of Falk, that he was related to Mr. Falk of Oxford-street—he was then cautioned to keep the pictures, and I and the officer left—before I left I found about half a dozen more pictures, as many as made up twenty-two—on Monday morning, 23rd Oct. Maiers was taken into custody, and on the same day I gave Cook into custody—on the day after Rowland had been given into custody, I found at his place three other pictures—that would make twenty-five—I found no others that I could swear to—just as I had found the other three pictures, Rowland came home—he had been admitted to bail—he produced the duplicates of nine paintings which had been stolen from me—I saw them at the pawnbroker's, at the police-court, and they are now here—in answer to a question, he said he had no duplicates—he then said, "I recollect I have some"—he produced the duplicates, and said, "I bought them of a man, but I had forgotten the cir<lb></lb>cumstance"—I had told him that Maiers was in custody—the duplicates I found in his possession produced the pictures I had lost—I have lost altoge<lb></lb>ther 110, or 120, worth 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they had nearly emptied the room, and the gallery beside.</p>

I was stopped by three men in the road; they had soldiers' clothes on, all three of them. Two of them had belts and bayonets. When they stopped me, they asked me how far it was to Bedfont; I told them about a mile; the next village was Bedfont. They then said one to the other, they would turn back from whence they came. I walked on fast, and they walked on after me; I was walking <placeName id="t18141026-36-crimeloc194">from Bedfont to Staines</placeName>

I asked them for some old clothes to put on; they said d - n you, hold your tongue, or else we will kill you, we will murder you; they mentioned both.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay with you - A. After they tied my hands, one staid with me quite an hour, from nine till ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he remain with you all that time for - A. I cannot say; he stood over me, about two or three yards from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular occasion his going away - A. The other two men came returned back at ten o'clock to the other man that stood over me. I was tied, and laid in the hedge with my hands and legs tied.</p>
               <p>Q. In the hedge next to the lane - A. No. In the hedge that grows in the pit.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they immediately left you, did they - A. Yes. They examined my hands. They said, if I hallooed they would murder me. They all three left me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did they leave you, with respect to your clothing - A. They left me an old pair of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260025"></xptr>trowsers, a waistcoat, and they put an old cap over my head; they left me in that state until half past six o'clock in the morning, the things they left me were very old indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that they were with you, had you an opportunity of seeing their faces? - A. Yes; I am not quite clear of all, but the tall one was the man that stood over me from the hour of nine until ten.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of light was there? - A. It was not dark, it was dusk just at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed the prisoner Anderson, did you, first? - A. Yes; because he caught hold of me first. They were all dressed in soldier's clothes. I am not so clear as to the short one as I am to the tall one. I firmly believe the short one to be in company with Anderson, I think I can recollect him being pock-marked; he threatened my life the last time he spoke to me, I firmly believe Dooley to be the man, he is a little pock-marked.</p>
               <p>Q. You took no particular observation of his features? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Only being pock-marked? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more particular to say respecting that man which you believe to be the prisoner, Dooley? - A. No; I have a letter I received from the prisoner Anderson. They told me to strip; I did, and they assisted me in stripping.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they all assist? - A. I am not quite clear as to that. Anderson in this letter confesses that he was guilty of the robbery. This letter was sent to me by the post.</p>
               <p>Q. to Anderson. Do you recollect that I begged a coat of the other man to keep you from starvation? - A. Yes, you did; they refused it first; you begged a coat for me</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the other men say any thing of taking your life away; I pleaded with the other men to spare your life? - A. I did not hear that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any person come into that public house while you were there? - A. I did, about a quarter before four; two were dressed in soldier's clothes, and one in black. I remarked two of the persons so as to know them again. The man in black was one, and the tall prisoner the other. They asked the lad who served at the bar for half a pint of rum, they had it put into milk; and after drinking it, the man in black offered a ten pound note in change; the lad refused to give them change. I was standing close by the bar when the man offered the note; he begged very hard for change, that is the reason I took notice of them; he held the note between his finger and thumb; the lad, after being asked several times for change, asked the man in black what note it was? He said it was a ten pound note, and after another question or two, he said it was a note of the Staines bank. I took my nephew in with me to give him something to drink with me, before he went home; his name is

When I was there I saw both the prisoners at the bar; the other person was standing upon his legs, just going to leave these men to go out; the other man was in black. The two prisoners had regimentals on; they had the cross-belt with the bayonet on it, and on the plate of the belt, there was 45. I took particular notice of the prisoners, both their collars and cuffs were turned up with green. They had something to eat and drink; they had only a bottle of ginger beer while I was there. I saw them pay for nothing. I did not stay for the man's return that went out. I am positive sure to the persons of the prisoners. Both of them I took particular notice of. Dooley did not sit in the chair any length of time, he was in and out of the yard. Dooley set next to me. The man in black went out; I did not observe his uneasiness until the man in black went out. I heard him wish for his return. I thought there was something extraordinary in their conduct. I walked round the market to see if I could see any of the officers of Bow-street, to come in and look at them. The next day I saw Bacon, the captain of the patrole. I communicated my suspicion to him on the Tuesday following. The one in black came to the same house. I told Bacon that one of the men came back, and had left an umbrella with Mrs. Grigg. Bacon went in the course of the afternoon, and found that man within one hundred and fifty yards</p>

I know it by the holes, and by being the fellow to it in my possession; they came both off one piece, the pattern corresponds exactly. I had this handkerchief in my pocket at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Anderson's Defence I was compelled to do it, or else I was to share the same fate as the man that fell in my way. I at last agreed so far, if they would not hurt any one. When we met Mr. Longhurst, Strangeways asked him the way to the next town; he replied, about a mile. We replied, then we will go back from whence we came. Strangeways ran, we followed him; the gentleman fell; Strangeways laid hold of him first. Strangeways pulled off his clothes, I begged of him to give the man clothes to keep him from starving with the cold. I asked Strangeways to let me put my coat on the man, and when we came back again, Strangeways said, let us kill him. I begged of them to spare his life; they were both angry with me all the way we came to London. I was ignorant of the man having any money until we came to London. We then went into the King's head: the other man told me, he had a pocket-book and a note; Strangeways said, it was a three pound note. I asked to see it; we went to get our breakfast. I asked him if he had got change, he said no, it was a ten pound note. I was compelled to do it, in order to save my own life, and I saved the prosecutor's life. I plead guilty.</p>
               <p>Dooley's Defence. I am innocent of the fact; I leave myself to the mercy of the Court.</p>

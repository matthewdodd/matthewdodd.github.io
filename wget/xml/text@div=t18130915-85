On my hearing the blades of the scissars move I put my hand down and saw my seals were gone. I saw the prisoner run away from me; I ran after him, and caught hold of him by the collar; he struggled to get away: he asked me what I wanted; he put his hand to his jacket pocket, and appeared to throw something away. I charged him with stealing my seals; he said he had not got them. They were picked up near to where he stood. The person that picked them up does not appear. These are the seals that were cut from my ribbon. A pair of scissars was picked up; another person, his name is Catling; he produced the scissars from behind the prisoner; he put them on his shoulder. The prisoner said they were not his.</p>

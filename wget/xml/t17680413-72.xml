On the 4th or 5th of this month, the prisoner came in at the Blakeney's Head in Bow-street, and enquired for me; he asked me if I knew where poor Gold was; (that is a waiter that had lived with him) I said I believed I saw him somewhere the night before; he said he heard he was poor, he designed to give him a note of hand that he had of his; said I, when you look over your lumber, if you can get my watch and ring, I should be obliged to you; he began to mock me, saying, I did not speak proper; I said, I believe I cannot speak in a better time than now, for that is my ring you have upon your finger; he told me I was a scoundrel; I believe I called him the same; he said, you scoundrel, take it, but if you do, I'll transport you; he laid it down; I said, before I touch it there wants three stones; when I took it, I said I would swear to it through all England, (produced and deposed to.) He sent for a waiter named Brown, who came; the prisoner wanted to breed a quarrel in the house; the prisoner said to him, lick this fellow, I'll stand by you if it costs an hundred pounds; then he went to Sir

                  </hi>. I am clerk to the treasurer of the Blind Man's Friend Charity, which is a charity for the purpose of paying annuities to blind persons, founded by the late Mr. Day—we pay annuities of 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—a person named John Hooper Bicknell was appointed on 11th January 1861, to an annuity of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are payable on 20th January, April, July, and October—we require the annuitant to produce a printed form of receipt, which is sent to them by us every quarter—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a receipt for a quarterly payment of an annuity due on 20th</p>

               <p>April, 1862—the prisoner brought that to the office of the charity—I asked her particularly if the receipt and certificate had been filled up entirely by Mr. Amos, the clergyman, and she said that the had just left him and seen him fill it up—we supply the printed part only of the receipt—the clergy<lb></lb>man has to fill it up—when she brought it it was in the same state as now, with the writing on it—(<hi rend="italic">This being read, was a receipt for 4 l. of the trustees of the Blind Man's Friend Charity, being a quarterly payment of an annuity of 16 l., for the quarter ending July, 1862, signed "John Bicknell" with a crost. It also contained a certificate, signed by James Amos, minister of Trinity Church, Marylebone, that John Hooper Bicknell had signed his mark to the foregoing receipt, in hit presence, and produced a certificate, No. 1,637, 100, and that he had no doubt of the identity of the said person. At the side of the receipt was written Jane Bicknell, No. 15, Charlton-street. The printed directions on the proof were also read</hi>)—the figures in that refer to our books—I do not now recollect the person of John Hooper Bicknell—his was always a mark, not a signature—we send these forms of receipt to the annuitant—we sent the one for John Hooper Bicknell's annuity to 15, Upper Charlton-street—I did not send it myself—I believe Charlton-street is in the district, of Trinity Church—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the receipts for the quarters ending, January; April, July, and October, 1861, and January, 1862—I have no doubt they were brought by the prisoner, because each of them is signed by her—I know her writing—they are all exactly in the same form—I believe the "Jane Bicknell," on the one that was read, to be the prisoner's writing—when an annuitant changes his residence, it is the practice of the office to require a certificate—I received this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) before I sent any receipts for John Hooper Bicknell, to 15, Charlton-street—it bears a mark of mine—refreshing my memory by it, I can say that the first receipt sent to 15, Charlton-street for him, was on 20th October, 1861—I paid the prisoner 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for each of these receipts that I have produced.</p>

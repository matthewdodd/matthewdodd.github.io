               <p>The prisoner took three guineas and a crown piece out of my drawer on the 23d of September, about five in the afternoon. Nobody was in the room but she and me. The drawer was locked, and I found it locked. Whether she picked my pocket at night, or whether she had a false key, I cannot say. I saw the money and things three weeks and two days before I missed them. I had opened the drawer in that time, but did not look for the money till I went to take out a guinea to pay my quarter's rent, and I had none. The prisoner carried two guineas over the way to the chandler's shop, and she had not an half-penny when she came to me, and she took her things out of pawn, and she gave half, a guinea to her sweetheart, to pay for a bed, and buy liquors. She lodged with me six weeks. I never looked in her pocket: I found nothing on her. She went to Chiswick to a place the day before I missed the money. She was taken before the Bench of Justices at Hammersmith, and she owned she took it, and at the board she offered to pay me half a guinea a month for the money.</p>
               <p>What did she say, as near as you can recollect? - Says she, I promise Mrs. Kelly to pay her half a guinea a month, till the money is paid.</p>
               <p>Did she say whether she had or had not taken it? - She did not say.</p>
               <p>Did she give any reason for offering that? - No: she said she had taken it.</p>
               <p>Did you hear her say so? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Somebody is speaking to her: Pray, how came you not to say so before that person told you just now? - I said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290134"></xptr> Sir, that she offered me half a guinea a month.</p>

               <p>I am a shoe-maker. I was with the prisoner at Chiswick. I heard her say that she took the money. The prosecutrix asked me to go with her.</p>
               <p>Court. Why did not you go before the Grand Jury? - I did not know. I went with the prosecutrix to Chiswick to the prisoner: the prosecutrix said, you served me very prettily in taking the money, and she said she did not take so much, and would pay the prosecutrix half a guinea a month: afterwards she confessed that she had taken the money.</p>
               <p>What did you or the woman say to her? - The prosecutrix said she had a constable just at hand, if she would not confess.</p>
               <p>And what was the constable to do if she would not confess? - I do not know. Nobody was present when she owned it, but the prosecutrix and me.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I did not promise her any such thing. She came to me and said she would not hurt a hair of my head. I was just got into a new place, and she took me up. The guinea I changed was lent me by my brother. I have no witnesses, because I did not let my relations know.</p>

The prisoner ran away, about half-way down St. Paul's Church-yard, before we took him. He was stopt by Doctors Commons. My handkerchief was taken out of his bosom. The constable has got it, but he is not here, neither do I know where to find him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Oliver. I was coming out at the Queen's Arms tavern at the time with others, and we heard the cry of stop thief. We agreed to follow. We saw a boy run along the highway, and we laid hold of him: he with an oath then said he had not the handkerchief. We found the handkerchief in his bosom, which the prosecutor owned as soon as he came up, and he swore to it afterwards before the sitting Alderman. The prisoner begged to be sent to sea.</p>

               <p>In walking along I picked up this handkerchief in the middle of the street.</p>

            . I am mother to the prisoner; he was always a dutiful son. I have kept him at school from three years old. He was out of his apprenticeship last Christmas, and has been two voyages since. He was at sea with his father at seven years old, and was at the taking of the Havannah.</p>

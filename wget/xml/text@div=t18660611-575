I am a lighterman of Bermondsey—in 1859 I was foreman to Mr. Joyce—in 1849 or 1860 the prisoner, who was then a boy, came into Mr. Joyce's employment as an apprentice, and from that time till 1863 he was a young man of an amiable, kind disposition—in February, 1863, he suffered a severe injury by a blow on the head from the fall of a martingale, after which I observed a marked change in his appearance, and he became very dissatisfied with his master—before the accident he was a kind, hardworking, industrious young man, and kind to my children—after this accident he became dissatisfied with his master and with his work—he lived in my house, and I observed an alteration as to the children—his temper was calm before the accident, and very irritable after<lb></lb>wards—he was perfectly temperate in his habits before the accident—after the accident he complained of a bad pain in the back of his head—about the time he made these complaints he became addicted to drinking and neglecting his work—we were at last obliged to part with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician of Great Dover-street—I attended the prisoner for the injury to his head—he had no severe external injury, but severe to his brain, I think—I cannot refer to the exact date, but he suffered from it two or three weeks—in my judgment his brain suffered from the accident—I have not attended him since—when he had sufficiently recovered to resume his avocations, he suffered from headache and complained of pains in his head—I had only known him about a week previous to the accident by attending his master and mistress, and he used to come for medicines for the family—I think such an injury might have an effect on his mental powers—change of manner, irritability, and attempt to commit suicide would indicate disease of the membranes of the brain, which would be quite consistent with the accident he received—such an injury to the brain as I have described would produce occasionally appearances which might be mistaken by the witnesses for intoxication—a small proportion of liquor would have a great effect upon a person whose brain had suffered an injury—the irritability described by the witnesses to-day would have just that effect—the symptoms would be those of mental cerebral affection, and not of intoxication.</p>

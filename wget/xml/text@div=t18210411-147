Hart came in soon after, I had known him some time about the Mews, he asked me to mind a purse for him till he wanted it, as he was afraid of spending all his money; he put it into my hand - directly after W. Jones, (Mr. Jones's nephew) came in, and Hart gave some loose money into another person's hand to keep for him. Jones told him if he stirred, he would knock him down, and said, he knew what he had done, they sent for an officer - the young man who had the loose money threw it down, and I threw his purse on the table and came out.</p>

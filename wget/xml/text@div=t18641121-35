I can be at your place about 11 o'clock on Friday or Monday next"—I replied to that letter, stating I should be glad to see him and Mr. Edmonds on Friday the 18th—Nash came and said that Mr. Edmonds had sent him to pay for the plants he had previously had, and to select the others—the bill then amounted to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he paid that—I asked him where Mr. Edmonds was?—he said he was so busy he could not come, and he had asked him to come and select the plants for him—he paid for the other plants with a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and I gave him the change—while paying for them, he said, "But since I have seen you I have taken Brandenburg Cottage and nine acres of land, and I am going to com<lb></lb>mence business as a nurseryman"—I said, "Oh, indeed, have you left Mr. Edmonds, then?"—he said, "No; in consequence of my taking this place, you are to send the plants to me"—he said he was to pay 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year for the place—I said, "60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is cheap for nine acres"—he said, "Yes, I have got it cheap"—he said, "You are to send the plants up to my new place"—they were taken up to Brandenburg Cottage by a carman, on my orders—the prisoner said, "You must send these plants up to-day, as Mr. Edmonds wants them to morrow; he always settles his bills on Monday, and he will pay me for them; and I will come down and settle with you"—he came again on the Monday, said he waned some more plants, and that he would pay me for them altogether—the bill amounted to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—on 13th April, I wrote a letter to Nash, to Brandenburg Cottage; it came back through the dead letter office—this is the envelope, marked "Not known at Branden<lb></lb>burg Cottage"—it is in my clerk's handwriting—these four labels (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>) are my handwriting—they were on the last plants which I sent to the defendant—I parted with my goods on the belief that he had taken Brandenburg Cottage and nine acres of land—nine acres of land in Fulham is worth about 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>

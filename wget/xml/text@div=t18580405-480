I followed the two prisoners that morning, and called to the last witness to stop them—I searched Hopkins, and found on him a cribbage board, a pack of cards, and a timepiece—these are them—I asked him what he had got; he said, "Nothing"—I opened his coat and found this timepiece—he was further searched, and this cribbage board and pack of cards were found—I went to the prosecutor's house, and found the cellar flap had been opened by a crow bar.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 41, Ashdown Street, Kentish Town, and am eleven years old—on Saturday evening, 9th April, I was sent on a message for my mother—on my way I met the prisoner—he said "Will you go and get me a half-quartern loaf, and I will give you a penny when you come back"—Emily Scott was with me—the prisoner gave me a florin, and I went to Mr. Philby's for the loaf, gave him the florin, and he spoke to me and went over to the prisoner—I pointed him out—Mr. Philby asked the prisoner why he gave it to me, and he denied giving it to me—I am quite sure he is the man who gave it to me.</p>

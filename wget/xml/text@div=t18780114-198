                  </hi>. I am in the service of William Hinton, a draper, of 80, Pitfield Street—I was aroused at 12. 30 on Sunday, 23rd December, by my master—we went down into the shop, and found the middle shop-door kept open by a box, and a pile of cloths behind the door taken down and removed—one piece was placed within the shop<lb></lb>front door, and one piece taken away—I saw no one there, and went out into the road, and took up my position by some railings, and in about</p>

               <p>three minutes I saw three men coming down on the opposite side of the street towards the shop—they were about 80 yards off when I first saw them—when they got opposite the shop-door they crossed over towards the door—Mr. Hinton opened the door just then, and all three turned and went sharp down the other side of the street about 40 yards, and two men left the other and ran away—the prisoner walked on, and I went on the other side of the street till I saw a policeman, and gave him in charge.</p>

I was standing by the railings, 12 or 14 yards from the shop, when I saw you and the other two crossing the road—I was on the same side as the shop—the shop-door was just put to—you were all three side by side—when you came back to the shop you begged my master not to give you in charge.</p>

I am a draper, of 80, Pitfield Street—I was dis<lb></lb>turbed at about 12. 30 on Sunday night, 23rd December—I went down with my assistant and found the shop-door opened, and things disturbed—my assistant went out and the door was pushed to—I afterwards opened the door and saw the prisoner and two others walking across the road to my door on to the pavement, evidently coming into the shop—directly they saw me they turned sharp round on to the other side of the road—my assistant followed them—I nave heard nothing of my property since—my porter fastened the doors at night—I went to bed at 11 o'clock—the door was opened after I went up by a young man who came in rather late.</p>

I saw the prisoner and two other men coming along Pitfield Street—the prisoner was about a yard behind the others—the other two men ran away and Mr. Somersall called to me to take the prisoner, which I did—I went to Mr. Hinton's shop and examined the door, which had been forced by a double-claw jemmy, the prints of which I saw on the door—there was also an inner door which was more torn than the outer door—considerable violence must have been used in opening the doors—it is not my beat—I passed the house perhaps half an hour before—I was not the same side of the street, but I have a man here who was.</p>

I was about 40 yards from the shop when I saw you coming along behind the other two; you were about midway between me and the shop, 20 yards from the comer of Great Charles Street, where the other men turned round—my back was turned until I heard Mr. somersall whistle; I then turned round and the other two walked away sharply.</p>

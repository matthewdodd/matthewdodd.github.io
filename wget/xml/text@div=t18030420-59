               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A.Almost; I was a little in liquor, but very little.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not dead drunk, you could walk? - A. Yes, quite sensible; I immediately missed the money, and challenged her with having it; she denied having it, and I told her she must go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200063"></xptr>to the watch-house; she was searched, and the money found upon her, concealed in a stocking.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you keep this note? - A.In my waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.Could it not have dropped out of your waistcoat pocket? - A. No; I searched every where, and could not find it.</p>

             sworn. - I was officer of the night; the last witness brought the prisoner into the watch-house, about half past eleven o'clock at night; he said he had been robbed of a one-pound note, two shillings, and a half crown piece; I searched her, and found the money in her stocking, all wrapped up together. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Gannell.) Look at that one-pound note, when you had it in your pocket, was the silver wrapped up in it? - A. No; it was in the same pocket, but was not wrapped up together.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the note again? - A. I do not know the number, but I know it by its being a new note, not signed at the back; there is no mark upon the money, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give her any thing at all? - A. I gave her sixpence and some halfpence.</p>
               <p>Turney. When she was at the watch-house, she said she had no more than nine-pence about her, and when the money was found, she said it was not his. <rs id="t18030420-59-verdict322" type="verdictDescription">

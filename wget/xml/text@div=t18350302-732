                  </hi>. I am bailiff to Charles Lancelot Hoggart, Esq. The prisoner worked for him—I missed some wheat, and got a search-warrant—I went to Briant's house, and found this sack and eight bushels of wheat in his wood-lodge, and about a gallon and a half of potatoes in a bag, and this dibber with "C L H" upon it—this sack is Mr. Boone Smith's, a large farmer at Edmonton, and this sack is marked "Jacob Kirkby, Dartford"—my master had some seed corn of him in this sack—I can only swear to that from the best of my knowledge—I never saw the sack before—I had only been at Mr. Hoggart's seven weeks—he had a quantity of wheat in his floor which the prisoner was threshing—I compared what I found at the prisoner's with that in the floor—they are just alike—these are the samples—the potatoes were a valuable sort, which I had charge to lock up—I believe those found at the prisoner's were part of them—they were got out by taking down two boards and putting them up again—I found that had been done.</p>

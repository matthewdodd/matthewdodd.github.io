                  </hi>. My daughter, Elizabeth, lives with me—the pri<lb></lb>soner is my son—he did not live with me, he used to come sometimes to see me—he came on Sunday, the 11th April—he used always to behave very kindly to me when he was sober, but when he is drunk he is very outrageous at times—he does not often get drunk—he was sober when he came, but went out, and at a quarter to six came back drunk—I and my daughter were there drinking tea—I got up to let him sit down—he said I did not act as a mother to get up to let her child sit down, that I ought to let him get a chair himself—he asked me if I would take anything to drink, and said he would fetch me something—I said I had much better not, but if he would give me a pint of beer for my supper I would much rather—he seemed very angry at that, and upset my table with the tea-things on it—I took up the poker, and said if he did not go out of my place I would make him—I did that because, if he sees me frightened when he is tipsy, it makes him think worse of it—I did not do anything with the poker, but said I would use it if he did not leave the room—I saw a knife in his hand during the transaction—I do not think that was before I caught hold of the poker, but I was so agitated at the time that I do not Know; but when I saw it, I laid hold of his arm, and told him to drop the knife—I cut my thumb and finger very slightly—they bled, but not</p>

               <p>very much—it bled by the heat and the passion I was in—I did not put anything to it—I think he took the knife before I took the poker—after the cut with the knife I took the poker, and he laid hold of my arms behind me—I did not use it, he prevented me—he had hold of me, and I had no power of doing anything—I hit him with my head and made his mouth and nose bleed, and then he gave me some blows on my head, and about my ear—I do not know whether I fell or whether he knocked me down—I was very ill with influenza at the time—my girl called a policeman, and I was taken to the hos<lb></lb>pital, and was there a fortnight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutrix's daughter, and sister to the prisoner. I remember the prisoner coming in drunk on Sunday evening, at a quarter past six o'clock—I was taking tea with my mother—she asked him to sit down—he did not sit down—he said, "If you were like a mother you would let me get a chair myself"—he asked if she would have anything to drink—she said she would rather have a pint of beer for her supper—he got very angry, and said, "How would you look if I were to upset the table?"—she said, "Don't do that, have a cup of tea"—he upset the table—there was a knife laying there—he had it in his band—he went towards the fire-place with it, where my mother was—he went towards her—he did not do anything, he only went towards her—my mother got it out of his hand—this is my mark to my deposition—it was read over to me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"The prisoner took up the knife, went towards her, and made an attempt to stab her with the knife in the chest")—I did say that my mother saved herself and got a cut—the prisoner left the room, and returned, my mother took up the poker, and said if he did not go she would use it—he caught hold of her hand, and she did not use it—he struck her, and she struck him with her head and made his nose bleed—he knocked her down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hos<lb></lb>pital. On the 11th of April Mr. Leonard was brought there—I examined her—she appeared very much injured—there was a swelling on the side of her head, on her wrist, and the whole side of her body—it appeared to be from repeated blows—there had also been blows on the back of the head—I considered her in danger for a short time—she had inflammation in the side, being in a precarious state of health.</p>

               <p>I live in Kensington. I am a builder. On the 4th of March I lost four hundred pounds weight of lead from some carcases of houses, in Manchester-square; it was fixed to the houses; it was the middle gutters: information was brought me about the robbery, on the night of the 4th; I found a lad in custody at the watch-house; I saw the lead the next day morning, in the watch-house, and the prisoner was there; it was in the watchman's possession, and I believe he has had it ever since: the lead was compared, and matched exactly: there was no other circumstance but the matching; it fitted exactly: there was only this piece of lead at the watch-house; the other was removed ready.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you go with the people to sell this lead to this woman after it was stolen? - No.</p>

               <p>I was the constable. On the 4th of last March, between nine and ten at night, I was at the Red-lion, and received information of the robbery; and I went and apprehended Merchant in Mr. Adams's house: he was in custody: I went and took Mrs. Cross into custody: I found this lead at Mrs. Cross's; there were Mr. Williams, Mr. Gale, and Mr. Cheeseman present.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What time did you send him to Cross's with the lead? - He went himself.</p>
               <p>Why, do you mean to say he went without your consent? - By my consent as well as the rest.</p>
               <p>Was not he sent to Cross's in order to lay a trap, and to induce them to buy this, in order to prosecute them? - I beg your pardon; it is wrong; the lead had been already stolen, but not moved from the premises: I never gave him any consent.</p>
               <p>Did you refuse the consent? - No, Sir, I did not: I believe there were half a dozen went with him.</p>
               <p>How long did you allow him to lay the trap before you went down to spring on the game? - I really do not understand your cramp words; I believe it might be half an hour: nobody went in with him: I suppose it might be five minutes before I went in.</p>
               <p>How much was given to this boy to go and sell it there? - Not a farthing to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>How much was promised him if he would go and sell it, as a trap for somebody? - Nothing to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Cross's husband there? - I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Court. What time in the morning was it that you went to take the prisoner? - about a quarter after five in the morning.</p>

             come out of the house; I did not see him come in; I took hold of the boy, and asked Mrs. Cross if she had bought any lead of that boy? she said, no; the boy immediately told her that she had bought it, and put it into the chimney, and gave him two shillings for it; then the prisoner Mrs. Cross, and the two boys endeavoured to get me out of doors: they tried to put me out; and Mr. Kelly, and several more came in; and the boy told them in her presence; then they went to the chimney, and found the lead; the boy marked the lead, and this is the piece.</p>
               <p>At the time you went into the room,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179007070014"></xptr>who did you find in the house? - Mrs. Cross and two lads.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. She is a married woman? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>Was you at this publick-house with the last honest man and the boy? - The boy never was at a publick-house at all; he was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Whose scheme was it to give the boy the lead to carry to Mrs. Cross? - We gave it him to carry: I believe one Mr. Foster, an iron-monger.</p>
               <p>Was it agreed among you all that the boy should take the lead from the place where he left it, and carry it to the prisoner to sell? - I cannot tell whether it was agreed; it was not by me: I did not hear what passed; but I heard Mr. Foster ask him whether he thought Mrs. Cross would buy the lead; and upon that the boy was sent to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury, originally the lead was stolen, therefore the person who stole it might be convicted of felony; but the lead actually gets to the possession of the right owner; then there is a scheme, in which this prosecutor is a party, that the lead should be carried to this woman to sell; the lead did not come to her in the character of stolen goods: you must acquit the prisoner: as to her morality, I can say nothing at all to that.</p>

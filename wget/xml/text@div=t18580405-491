On 24th March, Bergance came, between 7 and 8 o'clock, and called for half a pint of porter; he tendered a shilling; I bent it, put told him it was bad—he said, "Is it? I suppose I have taken it this afternoon; I have been at Croydon to see my mother"—he felt in his pockets, and at last he found 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I put the shilling on the counter for him to take, and he said, "You had better keep that; you may be able to detect somebody else—he went to the door, and said, "What is the next train to London Bridge?"—I said, "There is more than one to London Bridge, and if you make haste you will catch it"—I then went up the hill with James Collins, and saw Bergance standing with his back agatinst the wall—I went into a little shop; when I came out he crossed the road, and joined the two Smiths, who were standing about twenty yards off—they all went up the hill, and I follwed them, and gave information—Ikept the money in my pocket, and gave it to the sergeant.</p>

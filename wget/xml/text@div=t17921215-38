               <p>Q. How happened she to be in the kitchen? - The person that she had been servant to used to give her needle work for to do; and she came to the house that morning with something that she had been doing for her; my wife went down to her and told her, we had had a loss; says she, I have lost a guinea and you have got it; says she, I will strip, I will strip; and I laid hold of her right hand and put my hand into her pocket; and she said, she had a piece of stake or pork in her right hand pocket, which she did not like her mistress to know; her mistress up stairs came down, and asked what was the matter; my mistress, said she had stole a guinea of her's, and at the time she had her hand in her left hand pocket; my wife called out, she is putting it in her mouth; while she was putting her hand to her mouth, her mistress said, there is the guinea, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179212150072"></xptr>swore an oath; I clapped my hand to her mouth, put my finger and thumb in her mouth, and got her mouth more open; and her mistress saw the guinea more perfect in her mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the guinea ever found? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was not any thing particular in that guinea. - No, I cannot say it was my guinea; I did not see the guinea myself in her mouth; Mrs. Butler called out, there is the guinea, why do not you take it out of her mouth.</p>

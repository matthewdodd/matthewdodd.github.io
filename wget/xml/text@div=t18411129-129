                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, William Cribb—we are manufacturers of matches, at Clarence-place, Regent's Park-basin. The prisoner was our porter and carman for about eighteen months—he was in the habit of coming home late, and it was his duty to stop there and attend to his horse—that frequently occurred when most of the other persons were away from our premises—on the 30th of October, in conse<lb></lb>quence of Mr. England calling on me, I went down to his house—Mr. England brought to my house about 8lbs. of blue, and two gross of con<lb></lb>greves—I compared the blue which he brought with what we had—I missed about 4lbs. of blue from a parcel we had of 7lbs., and that was all that I could miss from our store—about 4lbs. of the 8lbs. of blue that. Mr. England brought, corresponded with that parcel of 7lbs. —I have no doubt whatever it came from there—there were two or three different qua<lb></lb>lities in that which was brought by Mr. England, and the rest of the blue he brought corresponded with other blue we had on our premises—after I went to Mr. England's house, the prisoner came there, and I gave him in charge—I went with the officer to make a search at No. 7, Clarence-gar<lb></lb>dens—in the front kitchen we found the prisoner's wife—I knew her, as he and his wife had lived on part of our premises for a considerable time—she appeared to be living in that front kitchen—we searched, and found Twenty-four gross of congreves and other matches, and various other arti<lb></lb>cles there—all the matches were of our manufacture—we found twenty<lb></lb>two quires of a description of brown paper we use for packing—there were two quires and three quarters of emery paper which resembled what we sell-there was 12lbs. of black lead, which is an article we sell—there was 1lb, of powder-blue—we never had but 1lb. of powder-blue on our premises, and I afterwards found that that 1lb. was gone—I had seen it safe some months previously—I have no doubt that these articles are ours—the con<lb></lb>greves that Mr. England brought to me were also our manufacture—the lowest price at which we sell congreves, is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gross—the 4lbs. of stone-blue he brought is such as we sell at 20<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per lb., and the other blue was worth from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—amongst the congreves found at the prisoner's, were some with the name of May on them, which we manu<lb></lb>facture exclusively for Messrs.

                  </hi>. I keep a chandler's shop in Vere-street, Clare-market The prisoner called on me on the 29th of October—he said he had some congreves, and blue and black lead if I wanted any—I said I did not at present want any—he said, "Let me persuade you to have them—you shall have the blue at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound, and the congreves at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a gross"—I said, "I am generally in the habit of paying more to your governors than that," meaning Messrs. Cribb whom I dealt with—he said, "I will bring you some"—I said, "You had better call another day"—he came the next morning with the prosecutor's cart—he brought me two gross of congreves, put them down on the counter, and a cloth full of blue—he said, "Come let us see what it weighs"—he put it into the scale and it weighed eight pounds—I asked him what it came to—he said 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "There is the cloth, you must <hi rend="italic">heave</hi> off something for that"—he said, I will <hi rend="italic">heave</hi> you off 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said the whole came to 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the blue, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the congreves—I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in part, and said he had better call again for the remainder—he said he would call about eleven o'clock that day—after he left I put the goods into my little cart, and took them up to Mr. Cribb—I left them there, and went home—Mr. Cribb and the policeman came down to my house shortly after—the prisoner came according to his appointment, and was taken—I then went to Mr. Cribb's and got the same parcel—I took it to the station.</p>

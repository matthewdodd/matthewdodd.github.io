                  </hi>. I live in Banner-street, St. Luke's, and am a stationer. On Saturday evening, 27th July, the prisoner came and asked if I was in want of any foolscap marble paper—I asked him the price; he said 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; it was a little tinder the half ream—I can buy it at 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ream—he brought it, and I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—I gave the same paper to Mr. Brannan and Mr. Renvoize—on the Monday morning I took it to the police court.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Branch-place, Hoxton, and am a manufacturing stationer. The prisoner was employed about five months in my factory, as a marble paper maker—I do not know exactly the number of these papers; they are something short of half a ream—they are mine—I know them by these white marks about them, which were the occasion of their being thrown out as spoiled—it was manufactured by the prisoner, and when I made complaint of these marks, his reply was, "It is no fault of mine; you have used my trough for oil"—I missed this paper on Monday morning, 29th July, but this is not the paper I missed first—I had seen this safe on the Friday night, at seven o'clock, and had the whole of it through my hands—it was either ten or twelve sheets short of half a ream—I am quite sure it is mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does the observation about the defect apply to the whole of this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, very nearly the whole of this is imperfectly manufac<lb></lb>tured—that would reduce it I should think one shilling the half-ream in value, but I never sold such—four of the prisoner's family were is my employ, his sister, his brother, and his brother's wife—George had not been there so long as John—I did not consider them very good workers—to the best of my recol<lb></lb>lection the first time I saw the prisoner was in Delarue's service, seven or eight years ago—we were both in the same employ—the prisoner had not given me notice to quit—he asked me if I would give him a character—I said "Certainly."</p>

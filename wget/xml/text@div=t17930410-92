             rushed in to me and took hold of me, used many infamous words to me, calling me such names as an infamous bitch, and that she had been better than a mother to me, and turning about asked me where the white headed buggar of a husband was? she said, she would take him to the watch-house; I being much frightened I left the room; that is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This is the shop where our servants and apprentices get rid of their money, and sometimes come to the gallows for robbing their masters. Pray how often has it happened to you that you and your office has been invested by people that have come to look after persons offending against the Lottery Act? - Mrs. Parsons had received money of my husband before.</p>
               <p>Q How often had the officers of justice been in your house to take persons offending against the Vagrant Act? - They never were since I was in Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>Q. What you locked them out? - I don't know they have ever been in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your house so constructed as to prevent the officers from visiting you? - There is a middle door.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to tell me how I was to get in if I wanted to make insurance? - I don't know any particular manner, there are people at the first door to open the door; they do not report to me nor to my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know there are persons stationed at that middle door to let proper persons in? - I should suppose that they let in people that we know without any enquiry.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you would let in that gentleman Mr. Wood? - I saw Mr. Wood at Bow-street, but I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not persons stationed there to prevent persons from getting in who are likely to inform against you? It is to prevent informations? - I cannot answer to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Maid servants and apprentices, and unwary people are let in without the least difficulty? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you seen the conduct of that office? - I am in my parlour always; I do not go below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say at Bow-street that you knew at that time they were executing illegal insurances, illegal transactions in your house? - I knew it was illegal transactions.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Foley first of all took hold of Sykes. Upon your oath did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179304100109"></xptr>Sykes withdraw with you and say we must give them money? - Sykes did say they must have money.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did not Sykes tell you that they must have money to prevent them from going to goal? - They did not tell me what they came for.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Sykes tell you these people must have money, or they must go to the watch-house? - I don't know for I did not know what these people were come upon; I had never seen Foley nor Mattingby before, and Mrs. Parsons was not in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Sykes asked the money of you to prevent them from going to the watch-house? - I know it now, I did not know at the time, I did not know at the time but Sykes was arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one of the gentlemen jump out of the window because he would not be taken</p>
               <p>Court. Did not you give this money, not from the terror of this bludgeon, but to prevent the men from going to the watch-house? - At the time that they had their bludgeons over the men I gave the money to save the men from going to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Now look at these policies, look at them and tell me what name they have on them first? -

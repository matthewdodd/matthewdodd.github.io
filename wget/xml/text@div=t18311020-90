               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me go out with any thing? A. Yes, I saw something protruding under his arm, which I took to be a trumpet or bugle - I followed him, and saw they were candlesticks.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I apprehended the prisoner at a quarter-past twelve o'clock on Monday night - on our way to the station we met his wife; she said, "What are you going to do with my husband?" I took her, and found these candlesticks, boots, and knife under her handkerchief; the prisoner said to her at the the watch-house, "I am the man that brought you into trouble, I stole these things."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not say I found them? A. No, you said you stole them.(Property produced and sworn to)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went that evening to Cold Bathfields, to release a comrade from prison with his wife and child - they, I, my wife, and two children went to the prosecutor's, and had some refreshment; a man came in, and would play at bagatelle - I then laid my head on the table, and do not recollect any thing else, till my wife awoke me on the step of a man's door, and I had these things in my possession - she said she would take me back, but I remember no more, till I found myself in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

             the staple of the padlock; when I got into the room I found the curtains all gone off the bed; I said nothing about it only to one person in the house, that if she saw the prisoner at the bar to let me know; I missed other articles likewise; the curtains were pawned at Mrs. Payne's, Bow-street, Bloomsbury, for six shillings and sixpence, the other things I had delivered to me at Bow-street; I sent for the constable, Mumford, he found the ticket in her possession, I saw her searched; she was then at Mr. Pearl's, in Church-lane, a few doors off me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS MUMFORD sworn. - I took up the prisoner, and found a duplicate of the curtains upon her, (produces it); I went to the pawnbroker's with it, and then took her to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL AVELY sworn. - I live with Mrs. Payne, Bow-street, Bloomsbury: The latter end of last month, the prisoner came, with another woman, to our shop; the woman brought some curtains to pledge, (produces them); on questioning her about them, she said they were her property.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them said so? - A. The woman that came with the prisoner; I lent six shillings and sixpence upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive as to the prisoner, that she came? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sudbury. These are my property, I have a piece of the same in my pocket; there are no particular marks about them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. When I took the room of her I had a deal of sickness, I had been in the hospital, my children were ill, and I was in a great deal of distress when I was in this place; I had no money to go to market, my children cried with hunger; I thought it not wrong to take the curtains and pawn, to get some money to go to market and buy a bushel of apples; I locked the room, and went out; when I came back again, a man met me, he asked me when I heard of my husband; he insisted upon my going into a house to have something to drink; while I was there, the gentlewoman and her husband came and took me; he asked for the duplicate, I gave it him; Mrs. Sudbury said, "I have had that room robbed before, and you shall pay for all; "the constable went up stairs with me to see about the things; when I came to the room door, I said, this door has been opened; "Yes," says Mrs. Sudbury, "I have opened it;" when she came into the room, I said, there is the glass and every thing; she took me to Bow-street, and sent for the pawnbroker, he did not come the first hearing; Mrs. Sudbury said, "if you will give me thirteen shillings you shall go free;" I said, if I had had thirteen shillings I should not have taken<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179702150040"></xptr>the curtains; I had two shillings, and I gave them to her.</p>

I am a printer, and live at 19, Goulden—terrace, Islington—it is my dwelling—house—it is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington—the prisoner has been in my service about six weeks. On Sunday, 29th June, I left my house about 6 o'clock, with my wife and my two children—I believe my lodger, Mr. Adams, was in the house at the time, as I heard the piano—I returned about half—past 10 and found there had been a fire—there was about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of damage done, including the house—before I went out I had gone into the two attics, which were two of the rooms in which the fire occurred—I found there had been three different fires—it was all over when I got home, but I saw the remains of it—I went into the attics for the purpose of lifting up the windows to allow a current of air to pass through—I left them open about two or three inches, and also left the doors open—there is a grate in the front-attic, and I think one in the back, but it has never been used—there was no fire whatever in either of those rooms—the front-attic was used as a composing-room—there were a great many books there, and a bed in which my son slept—there was nothing combustible in the back—attic, there was nothing but an iron press, an iron table, and a wooden table, and the chair which I put against the door—there was an old cotton dress thrown over the press to keep it from the dust—when I returned I found that that dress had been</p>

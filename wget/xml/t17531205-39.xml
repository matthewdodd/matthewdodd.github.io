               <p>Q. Did you see any fire-arms ?</p>
               <p>Humphrys. I did not. I collared him and threw him down on his back: while I was tussling with him there came up another man and struck me over the head, I believe with a stick; he followed his blows after that I imagined with a hanger, and cut me in four places on my head; then he that attacked me first took me by my middle and threw me into the ditch; there I was stunned, and they rifled me; they took my hat and wig from my head, then my watch from my fob, a guinea, three farthings, a tobacco-box, spectacles and case, out of my pocket, and a dead pig which I had got for my Sunday's dinner. There I lay some considerable time in a gore of blood, feeling it come out of the knee of my breeches into my shoe. I got up upon the causeway very faint, and scrambled along, and in about five or six hundred yards met three men coming towards London, and begged their assistance, who saw me to my habitation though they were strangers to me. I cannot be certain to any of the persons that abused me; I believe the evidence here is the man that first demanded my money.</p>

Mason met Humphrys the prosecutor, and wished him a hearty good night, and spoke with a chearful voice that we might hear; the prosecutor came up, and I laid hold on him, but had a lame hand, having had it run through with a sword, so could not do much, and he got me down upon the causeway; I got him on his back in the ditch, and got his silver watch out in the struggle; but he would not give up his money to the prisoner; Welch took a hanger and pushed it at his mouth, which took him in the chin; I called out to him to let him alone, then Welch bid me cut his throat; I said there is no occasion, he is easy enough; then Welch junior said, two old women could have done the business sooner than you have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you?</p>
               <p>Kirby. No, he stood in his place; then Welch senior gave the prosecutor a stroke on the head first with a hanger, and after that with a stick; and he broke the stick and left part of it in the ditch; Welch took his money from him, but at that time he did not acknowledge it to us, but said he had no money. I staid a little while to search, and found he had a pig tied up in two cloths, which I took; after the next robbery Welch acknowledged he had a guinea and some halfpence from the prosecutor, and paid us.</p>

In about half an hour after nine Mason came in and desired to speak with me; about ten o'clock or a little before, he bid me ask the woman of the house for some money, to fetch some things he had from a pawnbroker, that he might carry them to another where he said he could get more money upon them; I asked, and they lent it him; he took it and went out, and returned with some steaks, and said he had got more money at another place after that came in Kirby, and after him Welch<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175312050014"></xptr> the younger; Kirby desired Mason to drink with him, which he did; then Mason ordered me to go and make the bed, I went and made it.

I went for the things in West-street, Seven Dials, and carried them to Mr. Bibby's, a pawnbroker; they lay for thirteen shillings, and Mr. Bibby lent me a guinea on them, after which we went into Clare Market, and got a breast of mutton, and some pork steaks; then we came to Mr. Reding's at the Two Brewers, and had the steaks dress'd. At that time I believe it might be about nine o'clock, and I borrowed the money about seven.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Harvey. Are you certain as to the time you mention?</p>
               <p>S. Harvey. The child was sick at Mr. Reding's, and a man took out his watch to see about its time to take physick, and I know it was near ten when the money was lent Mason.</p>

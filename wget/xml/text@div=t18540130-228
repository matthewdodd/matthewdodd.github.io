                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Robertson, M'Clean, and two others—they are white lead merchants, at Old Swan-wharf, Upper Thames-street—I know the prisoner—I have seen him at the warehouse on many occasions—he was in Mr. Bowick's service, and I have supplied him with lead many times—on 27th Aug., between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, he came to the warehouse, and wanted a cask of lead—he did not say who for, because I knew he always came from Mr. Bowick—he said he wanted it very particularly that evening—I said that the carts were all out, and he had better get a truck—he did so, and I asked him if he had brought me an order—he said, "No," and I said he must write me one—it had been his habit to bring orders from Mr. Bowick—sometimes he brought them signed, and filled them up himself, but they always had Mr. Bowick's signature—I furnished him with a piece of paper and a pencil—he wrote something, and gave it to me, but it has been lost—being Saturday night, we were just going home, I had got my coat on, and I laid the paper on the side of my desk—on the Monday morning, when I came, it was gone—I do not recollect the contents of it—the moment he gave it into my hand, I told a man to give him a cask—I had not the least suspicion—a cask was given to him, and he wrote this receipt, and gave it to me (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Received of Robertson and Co., one cask of white lead, for Mr. Bowick, of Holloway. George Manning.")—he wrote it all at the same time—I asked him to give me a signature, and gave him a paper, and he signed it—he had signed many of them before—the cask was put into his truck—he did not say where he wanted it to be sent to, but I should have sent it to Mr. Bowick's premises—it was worth 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should not have let him had it, if I had not believed that it was on Mr. Bowick's authority—there was a light where he signed the paper.</p>

Robertson's—he left my service about the latter end of July, or on the first week in Aug.—he was not in my service, or employed by me, on 27th Aug.—he was not authorised to get lead from Messrs. Robertson for me, or to sign a receipt—he had no authority to sign the receipt produced—I have never seen the cask of lead—the prisoner was about three years in my service.</p>

Mr. Bowick, Sir,—You will, I hope, pardon my not coming to you, as you requested by my daughter. I cannot be too thankful to you for your kind<lb></lb>ness towards me—When I see the position in which I have placed myself I have never for a moment thought of not paying for the things I might have, but only of getting a short credit, which I had a difficulty to obtain on my own account. I have this day made arrangements, by which I shall be enabled to pay you half the amount within a fortnight from this time, and the remaining half in another fortnight following, on which you may rely. I therefore beg of you to withhold for that short time, and by so doing you will confer a great boon on myself and my family, for which we shall feel for ever grateful. Your obedient servant, Geo.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I am very sorry it has happened so; I had previously paid Mr. Bowick, and it was my intention to pay for this; I had done some work with the same materials, and I was to be paid for my work as soon as I had finished, but the person who employed me went away to Australia, and never paid anybody; I was thrown out of work; I never had any intention to defraud Mr. Bowick, or anybody else; as Mr. Bowick did not come after me, I calculated he would let it be till the spring, as he has done before; I am fifty years old, and never was in a court of justice for defrauding any one.</p>

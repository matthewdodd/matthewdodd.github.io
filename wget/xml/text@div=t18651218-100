                  </hi>. I live in Backchurch-lane, St. George's, and am a labourer—on Saturday night, about 11 o'clock, I was at the corner of Backchurch-lane, and met the two prisoners—the elder one stopped me, and asked if I would treat him with a bottle of ginger-beer—I said I would if I could get it—we went to a shop, but it was closed—he then asked if I would give him some potatoes—I said, "Yes, and welcome"—we went to a fish and potato shop; what they had came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I paid for it—I then wished them "Good-night," and was going home—the elder prisoner asked me if I would go any further—I said, "No"—he then upset me, pushed me down, and the younger one picked my pockets of two half-crowns and a shilling, which was all I had, except a few shillings in my waistcoat-pocket—they said they were hard up—I was sober—I had just come from my work.</p>

On this Saturday night, I heard cries, ran up and saw the prosecutor bleeding from the face—he had been cut over the eye—in consequence of what he told me, I went down Con<lb></lb>naught-place, and found the prisoners standing in a dark door-way there—I said, "What are you doing there?"—the younger one said, "We have not robbed the man, governor; we have not got his money"—I said, "I did not say you had"—the elder one was eating a potato at the time—I said, "Come back, and we will see"—I had left my brother constable in charge of the prosecutor at the top of the court—I brought the prisoners to him, and he said, "They are the two fellows, the big one knocked me down, and held me, while the little one took my money out of my pocket"—the younger prisoner said, "1 did not rob you,' and the elder one said, "I did not knock you down"—the prosecutor was quite sober.</p>

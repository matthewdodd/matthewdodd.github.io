                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 122.) On the 3rd of April I was at the Dock-gate, Woolwich. I saw Hyde put his hand into a gentleman's pocket, and take out a handkerchief—I had been watching him and Clark for five or ten minutes—I tried to seize Hyde, but lost him and the pro<lb></lb>secutor—in the course of a quarter of an hour I took Hyde, and the hand-kerchief was found on Clark—I have not had any other cases where the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Hyde.</hi> I was charged at the station with attempting to pick a pocket, not with stealing. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was charged with stealing before the Magis-trate; I did not state that we both tumbled down—I said I was <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> down by the crowd—there was a score down at the time—I did not see Hyde five or six times afterwards—if I had I should have taken him.</p>

I was robbed on Wednesday the 2d of October last, between the hours of nine and eleven in the evening. On coming home through Lincoln's inn-fields, returning to my lodgings, I saw a person who looked very hard at me; my lodgings are in Mason's-yard, Duke-street, Piccadilly; he looked very hard at me, and I thought it had been some body that knew me, (this was in Lincoln's-inn-fields, that side next to Holborn, he met me, I was going towards Duke-street,) I turned back and immediately found it was nobody that I knew, and I walked my way home; he immediately came up to me, turned back from the way he was going, and came up to me, said what a fine night, and what fine girls were passing; and further said, if I chose I might go and spend the evening with two at his lodgings, which were in London-street, Tottenham-court-road; after some conversation I agreed to go with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a shop, or are you a journeyman? - I was a shopman at that time. We came to where he said he lodged, and then he said that he had forgot himself, there was a person there then that would not let him bring any girls in, but she would be gone presently, and he did not wish to go in till this same person was gone; he immediately asked me to take a walk up to the Adam and Eve, Tottenham-court-road, where we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300117"></xptr>drank six-pennyworth of negus, which I paid for; then we returned down towards London-street again. He then said, on recollection, he did not wish to go to his lodging that night, that he had an appointment at a house that he was well acquainted with, to spend the evening with some girls that were to be there, with which I then thought to return home. He persuaded me to take a walk with him as far as there; when we came to the house he knocked at the door; this was in <placeName id="t17931030-75-crimeloc399">Little Newport-street, Newport Market</placeName>

            , by the best enquiry I could make. He went and secured the door by putting his back against it; says he, there is no girls here, and if you do not deliver what you have about you I will blow your brains out; on which I went towards the door, somewhat alarmed at that expression, because it was what I little expected; but there was a table standing near the door, on which was a candle, he comes up to the table and thurst his hand into my left hand coat pocket, and took from thence, two muslin neckcloths; he took these, and thrust his hand in again, and took out a roll of ribbon, about eight yards and a quarter, pink sattin; while he was taking that, I endeavoured to take out a silk handkerchief which I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any resistance? - I did all in my power to prevent his taking any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to prevent his taking what he did? did you struggle with him? - I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him put his hand in quietly into your pocket? - I begged him not to do it. While he was taking out the pink sattin I endeavoured to take out a silk handkerchief with some cash tied up at one end of it, to conceal it from him.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no money mentioned in the indictment? - No, he did not take any, he perceived the handkerchief, and said, give me hold of that handkerchief; I did not give him the handkerchief, I put this handkerchief up under the back part of my coat, with the money tied up in it, he wanted to know if I had no money about me, I told him I had none but three-pennyworth of halfpence, which was in my waistcoat pocket, not owning to what I had in my handkerchief; he did not take that.</p>
               <p>Q. Now at the time he thrust his hand into your pocket, did he lay hold of you in any way? - He laid hold of me by the side of my coat to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When he said he would blow your brains out, had he any pistol? - I saw none.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his hand? - I saw nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose that is all that is lost? - All that I can recollect or swear to his taking away; he demanded my buckles, I made resistance, and he said he would not take them as they would be of little value; he then opened the door and walked down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. What time might it be you got there? - Between the hours of nine and eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see him after that? - He walked down stairs; I followed him, and he told the landlord going down stairs, which I suspected to be the landlord at least, it was some man standing by the side of the stairs, that he was surprised the girls did not come, and when they did, desired they would wait<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300118"></xptr>till he returned, then I walked on to go home as fast as I could, and went along Leicester-fields, where I was followed by this same person, the prisoner at the bar, there at the bottom of Leicester-fields he again took hold of me by the coat, and said, if you don't deliver up either the buckles or handkerchief, I will blow your brains out; on which I did not know what to do, I plucked off my coat from me, and I ran away from him, up the side of the Square, and up Leicester-street, then running along a street which goes along the top of Leicester-street, I went up Wardour-street, and along Coventry-street, till I came to the Hay-market, and went into Jermyn-street, and went on to Well-street, there I stopped quite out of breath, I could not run any further; in about a minute, or very soon after, he came up to me again, he said, I know you have property, and if you don't let me have something more, at another time I shall serve you the same sauce; he likewise said, he should know me, see me where he would; there was nothing passed but that, but he walked away from me, which is all I believe that passed at that present time, till Saturday the 5th of the same month, October, this was on Wednesday the 2d. I was going up to the Green Man, and Still, in Oxford-street, with a box, and turned down New Bond-street to the Green Man and Still, and I saw the prisoner, and called to my mind that it was the same person who robbed me, on which I kept my eyes on him, and I walked further down the street till I came to some house, which I thought I would go in to get assistance to take him; I went into a house somewhere in the street, and got the assistance of a person that was in the tap room, I don't know his name, he is not here, he was discharged at Marlborough-street, and I have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him? - I did, and took him to Marlborough-street. When I first took hold of his collar, I said, you are the man that robbed me; after some words he said, pray loose my collar, and I will go along with you; I was first going for Bow-street, not knowing of Marlborough-street, till some people told me; turning the way for Marlborough-street he said, he would make me any satisfaction if I would let him go; on which I said, I wanted no satisfaction but to take him to justice. In going in at the door, when he found I would not release him, he said, then damn you, I will be revenged of you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. A very probable story you have been telling indeed. You never saw the prisoner before the time you met him in the Square? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual with you to fall into conversation with a person going along? - Not usual.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived at that time with some mercer? - No, I had lived in a shop, but I was out of place at that time; I was out of place since the 12th of January last, I was under a view of getting into a situation for myself; I was then going to my lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lodge? - With one Simkin, a coachman; he drives for a gentleman, a Mr. Dean, in Mason's-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live there now? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. He is as remarkable for telling probable stories as you are perhaps.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you ever recover your property? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where? - When he was examined at Marlborough-street an officer, two of them at least went to where they found his lodgings, not in London-street, but in Titchfield-street, there with a search warrant they found the things; one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300119"></xptr>officer is here, Hamilton, with the property; the ribbon was found first of all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you describe your loss before the magistrate? - I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peat. Was this your own property that was taken from you, or did it belong to any other person? - It was my own.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by it? - The neck-cloth I had in my possession when I left London, the ribbon I bought of my master the second day before I lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your master here? - No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get the other articles? - They were also bought to the best of my recollection, of the same person at the time I lived with them.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose your master recollects you bought all these articles of him? - No, I don't suppose he does, but the shopman recollects the ribbon.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems you went along with this man for the very proper decent purpose of getting women? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not, I suppose, without his assistance know any person of this description, you found women so scarce in this town? - Why yes, I could have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. But it was better to get into their company through the means of a stranger that would not hurt your character? - I was not going with women, I was going that night home, and did not intend to go with any women till it was hinted to me by the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink any thing in the course of this progress that you have described? - Yes, I paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you complain of being short of cash when you had so much in your handkerchief? - I did not tell him I was short of cash.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you did not desire him to make a little money of these things, nor did you put them into his hands as security for payment of the reckoning? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. But what made you call out so at the time you gave him the things? - I made no alarm at all.</p>
               <p>Q. It was your fear that made you call out so lustily? - I did not call out at at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What past between you then past very quiet? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you state to the man of the house that he had robbed you? - I know of no such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed him down stairs, and you had time so to have done.</p>

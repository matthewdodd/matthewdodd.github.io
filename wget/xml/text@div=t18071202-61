                  , in a lodging room
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>MRS. TATTERSON. Q. Do you know the prisoner. A. Yes, I let the lodgings to her; the house is in <placeName id="t18071202-61-crimeloc379">Frying Pan-alley, Spital Fields</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did she relate herself as a single woman. - A. No. I let the lodgings to her on the 4th of November, and she quitted it on the 27th of June; it went at three shillings and sixpence a week; it was a furnished lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she the use of a pair of sheets, a feather bed, bolster, and two chairs. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she a wooden pail and an iron pail. - A. No, it was a wooden pail with iron hoops; she had also a tea kettle and a saucepan; all these things she had for her use in her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay you the rent. - A. Yes, very well for a considerable time; she owed me about nine shillings when she went away. The last week we could not get into the room, we were afraid they were doing something they should not; my husband went up to her room about nine o'clock on the 27th of June, the daughter asked if it was her mother; he got in the room and I went in after him; we looked about the room, we perceived the things were gone; we got possession of the key. We saw the woman no more till she was taken up; we have only found one sheet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lived in the lodging with her. - A. Her daughter; there was a man there, I should not know him if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>JOHN PRICE. I am a pawnbroker, Wentworth-street. On the 8th of June last we had a sheet pledged in the name of Mary M'Lane for half a crown. I have no recollection of her person.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never pawned any thing but that one sheet; my husband offered to pledge the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180712020046"></xptr>things; I told him he had better not. I pawned the sheet for half a crown and brought my husband the money; I was married in the year eighty-one; the tea kettle was not worth twopence, it run; when the things were taken away, my husband told me he would fetch them back.</p>

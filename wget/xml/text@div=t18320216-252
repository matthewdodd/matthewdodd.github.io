             was a journeyman of mine formerly. He called on me, and gave me some information - he brought me three brown sheepskins, a lock, and seventeen iron trunk plates; it was on a Sunday morning that Barker brought them, and on the Tuesday morning the prisoner called me aside when I came up from breakfast - he began the conversation himself; he said, "I took three skins and the lock to Mr. Barker to make a trunk, for which I had an order, but I have not got the order, and I will fetch them;" I told him it was then too late, Barker had told me all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it not the custom, if young men want skins for business, to take them without asking you? A. No, never - I know Mr. White; I have granted him the materials to make a trunk for a friend when he asked me, but my men never take skins without asking me - I had discharged Barker, not having employment for him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you ever permit your apprentices to have any work of their own? A. No; I always strictly forbid it - I have kept Barker employed out of doors doing what I could send him.</p>

            . I am a trunk-maker - I did live at Mr. Maltwood's; I live in Greece-street. The prisoner came to me on Saturday, the 28th of January; he said he wanted a trunk for a friend, and asked if I would make it for him - he said I should find the wood work, and he would buy the rest of the materials; I said I would make it for about 16s. - he said he could not give more than 12s., as he was only to have 24s. for it; this was agreed upon, and on the Sunday morning I received the leather, the lock, and the plates from my landlord's two children - as soon as I received them I went to his master, and told him- on the Tuesday morning the prisoner came to me again, and said he had not got the order for the trunk, and asked me to let him have the lock and the plates back again - he did not ask for the skins then; I said, "Where did you get these skins from?" he said, "From Mr. Maltwood's"- I said, "You can't have them, for Mr. Maltwood has them;" he said, "It is all up then," and off he ran.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. LEE. Q. Are the children here who delivered these articles to you? A. No; I was discharged from Mr. Maltwood's house, but I work at home; I never knew of journeymen taking materials to make a trunk, if I have asked for any thing it was given to me.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When did the prisoner ask you for the skins back? A. About nine o'clock on the Tuesday morning, and he told Mr. Maltwood about ten.</p>

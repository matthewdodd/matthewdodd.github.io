I am an assistant to Mr. Rose, divisional surgeon to the Thames Police—on 27th April I went on board this ship, and saw the prosecutor; he was lying on the hatch, with a punctured wound about an inch in length on his right side—it was a punctured wound—the knife had struck the rib, and proceeded on about an inch—he was taken to the London Hospital on the Thursday—there was only one wound—it was a dangerous wound, and one which could have been inflicted by this knife—it is a common knife with sailors—his nose was bitten, and bleeding.</p>

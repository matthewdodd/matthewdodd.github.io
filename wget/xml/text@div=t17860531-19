               <p>Did you threaten him into it? - No, Sir, it was a free voluntary act of his own mind, and I am sure he was not intimidated, because he very correctly wrote with a pen and ink, every article I have missed, and more than I had missed.</p>
               <p>Did he assign to you any reason why he took these things, or that it was by mistake? - He hoped I would forgive him, he said, it was the first time; I had not a vast deal of conversation with him.</p>
               <p>Had he lived any time in your service? - Three months, or thereabouts; I had no reason to suspect his honesty.</p>

The Goods were lost out of my Ship on the 15th of July in the Night. On the 17th I went to buy a Hat at Ben. Green's in Rosemary-lane, and there I found one of those Hats I had lost - Green produced Lucas, from whom he said he had the Hat; and by Lucas's Information the Prisoners were taken.</p>
               <p>Ben. Green. Lucas brought this Hat to me to dress - The Captain came to buy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173409110010"></xptr> a Hat, for he said all his Hats were stolen out of his Ship. He bought one, and in an Hour afterwards came for another. Here's a Hat would do for you now, says I, but it's none of mine, it was brought to be dress'd; and so I shew'd him the Hat that Lucas left. Why this is one of the Hats that I have lost, says the Captain. Is it? says I, then I can help you to the Man I had it from. And so I took Lucas at a House he frequented in Wells-street</p>

            . I and the two Prisoners were drinking at Reynold's Brandy-shop, in Weil street, near the Watch-house, in Rag-Fair, and about 10 at Night we went from thence to Iron-Gate, where we stole a Boat and a pair of Sculls, and row'd about to see what we could get.

Then Newell struck a Light, and lighting a Candle in a dark Lanthorn, he gave it to Martin, who went in at the Window, but came out again presently, and said he heard a Woman speak to a Child. Upon this I pull'd off my Shoes and crept in, and brought out 2 Coats, 2 Petticoats, 3 Hats, a silver Watch, a pair of silver Buckles, some Linen, and other Things. My Wife sold the Watch for 36s. I kept 12s. for my own Share, and gave the Prisoners 12s. a-piece. Martin allow'd 4s. 6d. for the Buckles, he reckoned 18 d. for his own Share, and gave us 18 d. a-piece. We sold all the rest, except one Hat and a Handkerchief, to

                  </hi> I am the wife of David Crichton. The prisoner was in our service five weeks—on 2nd May 1 missed a lace veil from a hat<lb></lb>box, in the closet by the side of my bed—in consequence of seeing some flowers in the prisoner's bonnet I suspected her, and on 4th May went with my husband into her bed-room, and found in a hat-box the net handkerchief to which the had been attached—I found the veil between the bed and mattress—I also found in her box some lace cuffs, candles, and tea—she was not present—these are the things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are mine—my father called the prisoner up stairs, and she said in my presence she had found the lace cuffs under her bed, and did not know anything about the veil—I also found some combs which I had seen a week before—I had not seen the veil for three weeks.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your husband present when you found it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he is not here—my father lives in the house, and there are lodgers; the prisoner only had to eat on one of them—these is no other servant—I am not in the habit of wearing these combs—I dare say she knew that—the cuffs are of very little value—she admitted taking all the things except the veil, and she said she had bought the combs—I know the combs by one of them being broken.</p>

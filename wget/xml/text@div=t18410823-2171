                  </hi>. I am separated from my husband. Early in July, the prisoner came to my shop, which is in Chancery-lane—I had been wash<lb></lb>ing my hands—I placed my ring over my knuckle—he caught it Quickly off my finger—I requested him to return it—he would not—he went very quickly out of the shop—I saw it when it was produced by the pawnbroker—I repeatedly asked the prisoner for it after he took it—he said he had left it with a friend.</p>

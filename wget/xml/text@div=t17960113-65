               <p>I was going to Bayswater, on the 8th of December last, between nine and ten o'clock; at a little distance I saw three men coming, in soldiers' dresses, walking a-breast; and, as I came up to them they separated, and went one behind another; as I had just passed them, I turned round to look after them, and one of them held up either a pistol or a bludgeon, I don't know which, and told me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130112"></xptr>If I did not stop, he would blow my brains out; I immediately stopped, and they surrounded me; they searched my pockets, and took from me a knife, a pocket handkerchief, six or seven shillings in silver, and some halfpence; they were three or four minutes searching me; the tallest, Bedford, is the man, I believe, that stopped me; I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of the other two? - A. I cannot recollect their faces, but they are about the same height, as near as I can guess; and they were dressed the same as the persons that robbed me; they were all in regimentals; my handkerchief, afterwards, was found, by the officers, upon one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not positive as to Bedford? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never were? - A. No.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole: On the night of the 8th of December, I was out upon the <placeName id="t17960113-65-crimeloc370">Uxbridge road</placeName>

               <p>Q. That does not apply to this prosecution? - A. No, nothing; but this handkerchief I found upon Richmond.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Montague). Look at that handkerchief: is that the one you was robbed of? - A. Yes; it is marked M with black silk.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, I don't know well how to leave this case to you; here are three men charged with a highway robbery on the 8th of December; 6s. in money, a pocket handkerchief, and a knife, were taken away; Mr. Montague does not undertake to swear positively to their persons; as to Bedford, he thinks he is the man; there is no property found upon Bedford, but, on one of the prisoners, some time afterwards; but he does not attempt to speak to them, except as to their cloaths, which is a very common dress; as to their height, it is very common; if you are inclined to think as I do, you will acquit them; it is certainly a very suspicious case.</p>

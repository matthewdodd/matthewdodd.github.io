I went to the next door, to enquire whether any body had changed any money? I found the prisoner had been there, drinking bumbo, and had changed a guinea; this was the day before he was taken; and after that, he wanted more gold to be changed. I got a warrant, and took him up, on suspicion: I charged him with the robbery, and he confessed it directly, before Mr. Berry: he was shewed a key that was taken out of his pocket: he said that was the key with which he opened the drawer; he had lived with my mother, who kept the house before me: I have been in the house about nine months; he knew the house all over. He gave to me this silver watch and silver shoe-buckles (producing them); and told me in Justice Berry's house, that my money paid for them, in redeeming them out of pawn, which was 46 s.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money did he say he had taken?</p>
               <p>Paine. He said in my hearing he had taken some money, but he could not tell how much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention from what place he took it?</p>

            . I keep the sign of the Horns, at Limehouse-hole, a public-house, next door to the prosecutor. The prisoner was at my house the day the prosecutor missed his money; he came with two young fellows; they had some brandy and water; he gave two women two penny drams. After that, he wanted change for a guinea; we changed it; he had half a guinea, a quarter, and the rest in silver. After that, he wanted the half guinea to be changed, and also the quarter; he was a little fuddled: I desired him to go to sleep. As he was sitting at the bar, Mr. Paine's apprentice came near the door, and he desired it to be shut.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Garret. This was at noon time of the day: he got the half guinea changed, he went away: Mr. Paine came to me the next morning, and I told him as he has mentioned; he got a warrant, and took the prisoner up: we took him to Justice Berry; the justice's clerk desired me to see what he had about him: I found this key in his right hand breeches pocket, and found also 2 l. 2 s. 9 d. upon him. I said, I am certain this is Mr. Paine's money. He said, give me the key, and I will pay Mr. Paine, and make it up with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how much money he had taken?</p>
               <p>Garret. No, he did not. All the way we went along to prison, he cried, and begged I would deliver him the key, and he would pay Mr. Paine, and make it up with him. I thought I had no right to deliver back such a key as this; (producing a proper pick-lock key).</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say from what place he had taken the money?</p>
               <p>Garret. No, he did not. He owned to me the next day, when I went to see him, that he had no confederates in it; but that he made the key himself, by filing the wards out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner?</p>

On Monday, the 29th of September, I was in Kingsland-road, and met Mrs. Freeman, who I had known many years - the prisoner was with her. I gave them 6 d. to get drink; Freeman asked me home to tea with her - I went, and after tea gave them more liquor. I got up about half-past four o'clock to go; Freeman said she wanted more gin; I said I had no money - they asked me to pawn my watch; I refused; Freeman pushed me on the bed, and said I should not go. I fell on the bed, and the prisoner snatched my watch, and ran off with it; I followed, but could not find her. Freeman went with me, and described her, and the officer took her. I believe Freeman was as much implicated as her. I was sober. She was taken on the Friday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not give it to me, and tell me to do what I thought proper with it - A. No; I refused to have it pawned; she snatched it from my hand. I had money, but did not choose to spend more.</p>

                  </hi>, I reside in Sackville-street, and am a merchant; I have a place of business in Fenchurch-street. On The 18th of Dec. I was going down the Dover-road—when I got near the turnpike, from something the officer said to me, I missed my handkerchief—I had put it into my pocket half a minute before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable M</hi> 272.) I know both the prisoners—I saw Mr. M'Kennell going down the Dover-road on the 18th of Dec., about half-past six or near seven o'clock—I saw the prisoners follow him about 100 yards—I was on the opposite side of the way—I saw Ryan go and lift the prosecutor's coat, but I did not see him get anything—they followed him about 100 yards further through the turnpide-gate, and I distinctly saw Ryan take the handkerchief out of his pocket—Linford was close to him—I have every reason to believe they saw me, and ran off together down a dark street by the side of the floor-cloth factory—I ran, but could not find them—I then ran after the prosecutor, who said he had lost his handkerchief—I knew the prisoners, and I went near the Mint, where I'know these characters resort, and about eight o'clock I saw them, and took them into custody—they denied any knowledge of the robbery—I cannot say what sort of a handkerchief it was, but I was about the middle of the road, and saw it distinctly—it was a dark handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No.27, Ewer-street, Gravel-lane—I go out washing, or charing, or anything I can. Thomas Ryan is my nephew, he was not out at the time this gentleman expresses—he came in to his tea, at Ewer-street, at four o'clock that night, and he never went out till a quarter before eight o'clock—his feet were rather damp, and he pulled off his shoes—whatever other misdemeanour he may have done I cannot say—this was on a Friday, 18th Dec.—I did not hear of this matter till after nine o'clock the same evening, when a policeman came and told me he was in the station—I cannot say I know this turnpike in the Dover-road—I don't live near there—I and my nephew and my little girl sat down to tea—my daughter-in-law, Mary Ann Bateman, came in, but she is not here—she came in about half-past six—she was waiting for my son, who is her husband, to come—he did not come in till ten o'clock—my nephew did not put on his shoes till he was going out, at a quarter before eight o'clock—he had a pair of list shoes to put on while he dried the others—he had lived with me for the last two months—we had our tea that day soon after four o'clock—we had nothing but tea—we sat talking about one thing and another—he sat warming himself—my room is on the ground-floor—he generally comes in at twelve o'clock to dinner, and at four to tea—he went out, and said he should not be many minutes—he sleeps up stairs—my son came in that night at ten o'clock—I told him my nephew was taken into custody—I talked it over with his wife—I</p>

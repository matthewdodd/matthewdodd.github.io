             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Tuesday the 15th of July I saw the prisoner come out of a lighter near the keys, that had been landing sugar; it was between four and five in the afternoon; he had something under his arm; I stopt him, and asked him what he had got there; he said a little sugar; I asked him where he got it; he said the watchman gave it him; I told him I should take the watchman into custody; then he denied that, and said he found it in the lighter; I told him I would take him to the compter; he said, if you will not take me to the compter I'll give you some money; I told him no, I would take him there; he said, then if you won't do that you can do one thing for me, that is to reduce the quantity of the sugar; I would not, and then I took him to the compter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, prisoner's counsel. There was no person present but yourselves? - No.</p>
               <p>You have taken up a great many persons, have not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of the persons you took up since? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You are a handy man at taking people up; what became of the men you have taken up since? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Tell me some of the names of those you have taken up since? - I cannot rightly.</p>
               <p>Look at your book and see if you cannot find 2 l. 2 s. set opposite to any of those mens names; don't you know of the two men who stole the 7 lb. of tobacco? - Yes, they were discharged by the lord mayor.</p>
               <p>Or, before they came there, you know for the 2 l. 2 s.? - No, not for that.</p>
               <p>How long has this man been employed on the keys? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that the many men you have taken up have not been discharged without prosecution? - I cannot say, sir.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the first battalion of Grenadier Guards, which is stationed at Chelsea Barracks—the deceased, Noah John<lb></lb>son, was a private in that battalion, the prisoner was a private in the second battalion—on the night of 25th December, I was sergeant on guard in the guard-room-men in the regiment are confined in the guard-room for drunkenness, and all other offences—there is a large bed in the guard-room, I suppose it would hold twenty men, it is a board or bank raised at one end—on 25th December, at 11.30 there were three men confined in the guard-room, Rawlings was one, he was confined for dis<lb></lb>obedience to orders; he was sober—Slack was brought in by an escort at 6.10 from the Tower, he was sober; the third man was Brewerton, he was in custody for absence; he belonged to the third battalion, and I did not take any account of him, he was sober—at 11.30 Johnson came in, he was drunk and dirty; the back of his coat was dirty; I ordered him into the guard-room—at 11.50 the prisoner was brought in <hi rend="italic">by</hi> two police-constables and Corporal Jacobs, he was drunk—he was reported to be drunk <hi rend="italic">by</hi> the corporal who brought him in—he was placed in the guard-room between the escort, Nuttall and Carter—I noticed that his cap was dirty as if it had been in the mud, and his tunic was dirty on the sleeve, I ordered Nuttall and Carter, to see him in the lock up—the prisoner said "Are you going to do me drunk"—I told him to mind his own business—the expression "do me drunk" is a common saying with soldiers, it meant was I going to keep him in the guard-room, to treat him as a drunken man—it would have been my duty next morning to report him for drunkenness—I saw him put in the lock up; that is where the prisoners are confined, it is the same place in which the other men were confined; it is not the same as the guard-room, the guard-room is where the men are on guard—it is all one room.; there is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187701080034"></xptr>
               <p>a door leading from the guard-room into the passage, and there is another door leading into the lock up, and on the other side of the passage there are three or four cells—I saw the prisoner put in the lock up; he made tie fifth man there—there is a peep-hole in the wall of the lock up from the guard-room—there was a light in the lock up—you cannot see quite all of the lock up from the peep-hole, you can see the whole of what is called the bed, the bed comes right under the peep-hole—the bed runs from the one end of the wall to the other, the peep-hole is above the bed, so that you can see all the way up it, I believe it is about a yard above the bed; in looking through it you cannot see the part of the bed nearest the peep-hole—the peep-hole is about as big as the top of that inkstand, it might be a little larger, about as big as a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, and there is a slide goes over it—a brick wall separates the lock up from the guard-room—it is my duty to be in tie guard-room during the night, I do not keep the peep-hole always open during the whole night; there is no glass to it, there used to be, but it is deficient—when the slide is up you can put a stick right through the peep-hole into the lock up, the slide is an iron one—at the time I put the prisoner in I saw the inside of the lock up, I noticed the four other men who were already in there; I went to the door so as to be able to see the men distinctly; three of the men were at the far end of the lock up lying on the bed asleep, Slack, Brewerton, and Rawlings—Johnson was lying on the same bed nearly opposite the door, asleep—I looked through the peep-hole at 12 o'clock, and the four men were in the same position, and appeared to be asleep; the prisoner was sitting on the bed between Johnson and the other three, nearer Johnson, about a yard away from him, he was sitting with his feet on the floor; he was sitting near Johnson's feet—he had his tunic off, it was on when I put him in—Johnson's tunic was on—I am sure of that—the prisoner was sitting with—his body inclining forward, and his arms across his knees, and his faces towards the wall opposite the bed—I could not see whether he was asleep or not; it was a mere momentary glance—I then closed the slide—my attention was next attracted to the lock-up about a quarter of an hour after, by cries of "Murder" and "Sergeant of the guard" proceeding from the lock-up—I then looked through the peep-hole; I saw that Johnson was off the guard bed and I saw the remaining four prisoners at the end of the lock-up; the prisoner was standing over a man, pulling at his legs, the remainder were in the act of getting up—I am not certain of the man whose legs he was pulling—Rawlings, Slack, and Brewerton were all on the bed—the prisoner was not standing up; he was bent over—the men were all aroused at the time—I immediately went to the lock-up with the escort—when I got in I saw Johnson lying on the floor behind the lock-up door—I could not see him, looking from the peep-hole; he was lying faces downwards, his left side was resting against the foot of one of the legs of the guard bed, in a pool of blood—I turned him over, I could not recognise him, he was that much bruised, and his face covered with blood—he appeared to be dead—he was not then wearing his tunic; his shirt was smothered in blood—I ordered Nuttall and Carter to take the prisoner and place him in a cell; he said "Take me to a cell, for I have killed him"—he was then sitting near Johnson's feet, he was drunk—I noticed his shirt, hands, and boots; the boots were saturated with blood, covered all over, and his hands had blood on them, and his shirt—he was then put into a cell on the other side of the passage, and Mr. Fernandez, the surgeon, was sent for—I saw Johnson's</p>

               <p>tunic on the guard bed over where he was lying; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Johnson was lying at the foot of the guard bed on the floor, and his tunic was over where he was lying; I noticed that one of the epaulets was torn in this condition, and the button was off the other one—this is exactly the state in which it was when I found it—the epaulet was on when Johnson was brought in, and the button on the other side as well, and the tunic was not torn, it was all right—I found the epaulet on the floor near his feet, it it has been lost since—I afterwards searched the prisoner in the presence of the adjutant and the doctor, but found nothing—he said nothing—after he was left in the cell he was very riotous, kicking at the door, and I then had his boots taken off—about 3.15 Sergeant Thompson, of the police, came and fetched the prisoner; I gave him the boots.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased was in my battalion, the 1st, quartered at Chelsea barracks—the prisoner was in the 2nd battalion and was quartered at Wellington barracks, Birdcage Walk—they might have been quite strangers—when men are brought in drunk and put into the lock-up their boots are not taken from them unless they make a noise or kick the door, that is if they are riotous—it is not an understood thing in our battalion if a man is very drunk to take his boots off—the bed is a sloping bank, sloping down from the wall—when I looked in at 12. o'clock he was lying down in his tunic, he was lying in the ordinary way, with his head on the raised part of the bank and his feet at the bottom of the slope—I hare marked on the plan the spot where he was lying, and also the spot where I found the body when I went in at 12.15—the bank is about 7 feet in length from the wall to the foot, and about 7 yards long from wall to wall, that is the length of the lock-up—there' is about a yard's space at the entrance, just enough room for a man to walk up and down; two men might walk up and down together; that extends the whole length—when I went in and found the body I found the tnuic lying, on the bank as if it had been thrown there, and the epaulet was on the ground.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. When the slide is down you cannot hear anybody talking in the lock up—we put all prisoners in the lock-up unless they are riotous, then we have to shift them into the cells for safety—if a sober man is put into the lock-up at 10 o'clock in the morning for disobedience, and a drunken man comes in at 12 or 1 o'clock, he would be put into the same room—if half a dozen drunken men, not riotous, came in, they would be put in the same room where the man was sleeping who had only been guilty of dis<lb></lb>obedience—there is no order in our battalion to put the men in cells; the door that leads into the lock up from the passage is a wooden door; that is the only door to the lock up; it is close to the door of the guard-room—you have to pass through two doors to get from the guard-room into the lock up, one into the passage and another from the passage into the lock up—the guard-room door is an ordinary wooden door; it is opened from time to time and closed after it has been used; this was on Christmas night—there is a sentry at the entrance gate in front of the guard-room—the officer of the day does not visit us at night-no one visits at night—when anyone comes in, the sentry calls out "Gate," and the gate is opened—there is a wooden bed-place in the guard-room of the same kind as that—in the lock up for the men to lie down on—there would be about twenty men usually in the guard-room—there were two separate guards, two sergeants or acting corporals, and eighteen privates; the lock up was entirely under my control that night—no one had any duty to look into that room except</p>

               <p>myself; a number of the twenty men had just come off sentry, and were sitting by the side of the fire, and a number of them were lying on the guard bed—if a man was riotous in the lock up, he would go into the cell, because he would be annoying the other prisoners; if a man came in drunk and incapable and obliged to be carried in he would be put in the cell; if he was only staggering he would not be put in a cell, he would be put in the guard-room—it is my duty from time to time to visit the lock up, once every hour, at the hour—I did not go in after the prisoner was confined, because he was confined at 11.50, and that was under the hour—there is no fixed time to visit, the sergeant uses his discretion; I generally visit at uncertain times—there is nobody whose duty it is to keep a constant watch; there is no sentry over them to watch them constantly—I frequently look through the peep-hole.</p>

I am a private in the first battalion of the Grenadier Guards—I was confined in the lock up at 6.15 on Christmas night—I had come from the Tower in custody of an escort—I had been in confinement from the previous night for being drunk, at 5.45; when I was put into the lock up at Chelsea Barracks, I was quite sober—there was another man there when I was put in, Rawlings; he was awake and sober—I afterwards went to sleep on the wooden bed—there was then nobody else in the lockup but Rawlings—I can't say what time it was when I awoke—I don't know what caused me to awake—I sat up and saw the prisoner standing over the other man and kicking him at the side of the head as he laid on the floor—I did not hear them say anything—the man was lying straight out on his back and his hands were lying down by his side—I did not see him move at all; his head was towards the wall where the peep-hole is—the prisoner stood at the side of him, with his face towards the hole—I only saw him kick him once; it was a violent kick—he had his boots on—when I saw this I was still on the bed—I noticed that there were then two other men in the lock up besides rue, Brewerton and Rawlings—I was lying at the further end of the lock up against the wall, Brewerton was next to me, and Rawlings next to him—they were not awake when I saw this, neither of them—after the kick the prisoner came towards me and took hold of Brewerton by the legs and said "If you take this man's part I will serve you the same"—Brewerton was not awake when he said this; he said it directly he pulled his legs; he might have pulled him a couple of feet off the bed from what I could see—Brewerton woke up and shouted out for the sergeant of the guard, and I called out "Murder"—the prisoner was then standing against the guard bed—he spoke in a violent manner—he did not say or do anything when I called out—I did not notice the peep-hole when I called out—you can tell when it is opened if you look; I did not notice it at all—when we called out the sergeant of the guard came in—the prisoner was then sitting in the middle of the guard bed, 2 or 3 yards off from the man on the ground—he seemed to be very violent—we were on the bed when the sergeant came in—we got off afterwards, and I went out into the guard room and know no more about it—I did not know the prisoner before that night, nor Johnson, Brewerton, or Rawlings—I did not know when Brewerton or the deceased or the prisoner came into the lockup.</p>

I was on duty on the night of Christmas Day, at 11 30, in the Commercial Road, Pimlico; that is very near half a mile from the Guardsman beer-house, and close to the barracks—Hobden, another constable, was with me—I saw the prisoner there, he was drunk and was stripped; his cap, belt, and tunic were lying in a doorway, his shirt sleeves were rolled up to the elbow; he was in a fighting attitude—there was a crowd there—he said he would fight me or any other b—man; I picked up his tunic and held it up for him to put it on, he put it on, but did not button it up; I told him to go to the barracks—the other constable picked up his belt and cap and handed them to him, and told him to put his things on and go to barracks—the prisoner threw them down again in the road; I saw corporal Jacobs, and called him to him and he took charge of him, and both us constables accompanied him to the barracks.</p>

I am a corporal in the first battalion of Grenadier Guards—on Christmas night, about 11.40, I was in the Commercial Road—I saw the prisoner there with two constables—I saw his cap and belt lying in the centre of the street; the constables said if I did not take him to barracks or order him away they should have to take him into custody—I then ordered him to go to barracks—he said he would not till he liked—I took him to barracks with the assistance of the two constables; when we were going by the front of the barracks he wanted to get his hands loose—he kept putting his left hand up, asking the constables to put his cap on pro<lb></lb>perly—they said "Never mind that, stop till you get inside"—between the gate and the guard-room door, he said "I suppose this is 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for me"—I took him in and gave him over in charge to Sergeant Shepherd—he was drunk—he said "Sergeant, are you going to do me drunk."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant B</hi> 16). I was sent for on this morning, shortly after 3 o'clock, to Chelsea Barracks—I saw the body of Johnson lying in the lock up—I has informed what had occurred; I went to the cell where the prisoner was—he was apparently asleep; I aroused him and told him from what I had been informed by the medical man, Dr. Fernandez, I should take him into custody for murdering a brother comrade named Noah Johnson by kicking him on the head—the prisoner in an unconcerned manner replied "I don't care"—some other words followed, but I could not distinctly say what they were—he appeared to be recovering from the effects of drink—on searching him at the police-station I found blood on the front of his shirt, and on the charge being read out there he again replied "I do not care"—I produce the boots, which I received from the sergeant of the guard.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the third battalion of Gre<lb></lb>nadier Guards—about 12.30 in the morning after Christmas Day I was called to the guard-room at Chelsea Barracks—I saw the body of Johnson lying in the lock up, he was quite dead—there was a great quantity of blood on the floor and his head and face were covered with blood—I saw that his head and face had been injured—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination on the 28th—I found the head and face much swollen and covered with contusions and lacerations, the right ear almost severed from the head, and the left ear touch lacerated—there were many contusions on the surface of the trunk and limbs—there were a great many injuries to the head and a great many both on the trunk and limbs—on removing the scalp I found a large quantity of blood effused between the scalp and the skull on the upper and posterior part of the right side, corresponding in position with a large external contusion—on examining the interior of the skull I found much congestion of the blood vessels of the convolutions of the brain and a considerable quantity of blood effused on the surface of the right hemisphere of the brain, correspond<lb></lb>ing also in position to the external injury before alluded to—three of the ribs on the right side were broken; there were external bruises corresponding with that injury—the right lobe of the liver was lacerated opposite the fracture of the ribs—in my judgment, the death arose from those injuries; either those to the head or the liver would be sufficient to account for death—he was a thick-set, strong man—the organs were very healthy, indeed—the injuries were such as might have been inflicted by kicks from a man's boots—the injuries to the head were such as would produce insensibility—the one on the right side might have been inflicted by a kick from a boot and would produce insensibility—the injuries to the ears might have been inflicted by kicks by a boot—I think one kick would fracture the three ribs and lacerate the liver—I could not judge from the appearances how many blows must have been given, there must have been a great many separate blows, some of the contusions might have been inflicted with a man's fist——I don't think a blow from a fist would produce the lacerations I found—</p>

I spoke to the prisoner about his friends both before and after he was committed—he said when I saw him first that he had no friends—after he was committed 1 went to him again, seeing that he looked faint when he came out of the dock, and asked him if he would have any refreshment—he said he would, he would like a little drop of brandy—I then again spoke to him about his friends—he said, "I have no friends, friends cannot do me any good, I killed the man, I shall be hung for it;" about quarter of an hour afterwards he sent for me and I went to his cell—he then told me that his mother lived in New York, America, and that he should like for her to know that he was charged with murder, in case he should be hung—he gave me her address, 844, Eleventh Avenue, and I took steps to have that done.</p>

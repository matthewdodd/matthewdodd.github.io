            . I am a policeman. On the 10th of August. I apprehended the prisoner in White Horse-alley, Chancery-lane - when I got to the station-house, I said he was charged with taking a sovereign - he refused at first to give his name or address - at last he gave his name, and said he received the sovereign from his master, and had lost it - I found no money on him - I examined his pockets - there was no hole in the pocket the night I searched him - but, on Monday, before the magistrate, there was a hole in his right hand breeches pocket - I am certain it was not there before - he had the same trowsers on as when I took him - he did not tell me how he lost the money, when I took him, but, before the magistrate, he pulled his pocket out, and showed the hole in it.</p>
               <p>DANIEL BECKHAM re-examined. I found he had delivered the bills - I never sent him out with money before - he was about six weeks in my employ.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am sorry it has happened so, but I lost the money.</p>

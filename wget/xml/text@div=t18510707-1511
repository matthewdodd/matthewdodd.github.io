                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Davis and Co., and have two part<lb></lb>ners. The prisoner was our clerk; part of his duty was to receive money, sometimes at the warehouse, and sometimes to go out and collect it—he ought to bring it to the counting-house, and having made an entry of it in the col<lb></lb>lecting book, to take it to Mr. Jolliffe, the cashier; hand the money to him, he would put his initials to the entry, which would discharge the prisoner from it—it would then be Jolliffe's duty to post it from the collecting-book into the cash book, and it would be Browning's duty to post it from the cash—book into the ledger—unless Browning requested it, or authorised him to do it, the prisoner had no authority to make any entry in the ledger—none of our firm have received the sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Whyte, or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Hicks, or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Arpthorp—I have looked through the collecting-book and cash—book, and cannot find any such entries there—in the ledger I find the sum of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. entered to Robert Whyte, in the prisoner's writing, that has a reference to a folio in the cash—book, but there is no such entry there—in Mr. Hicks's account in the ledger, I find three sums of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, entered; one is on 9th May, that has a reference to a folio in the cash—book, but there is no such entry at that folio of the cash-book—in Arpthorp's account in the ledger, the last payment entered is 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 2nd June.</p>

               <p>any clerk who receives money would enter it in the collecting—hook; it is indexed for that purpose—Mr. Alfred Davis, one of the partners, takes a more active part in the counting—house business than I do—he is not here—to the best of my belief the clerks do not frequently pay him money, the cash passes through the hands of the cashier, and then into Mr. Alfred Davis's hands—he does receive money from the clerks, but very rarely—I do not see any entries in the collecting-book made by the shopmen—I may have received money myself from Mr. Hoyle, the principal clerk; if I receive any, I put it into the cash-box—Mr. Hoyle would then make the entry in the cash-book, and my signature there would be his discharge—Mr. Jolliffe is not the only person who enters in the cash-book—the cash—book is not common to all the clerks—(<hi rend="italic">looking through it</hi>)—I only see the entries of Mr. Jolliffe as far as the payment of money is concerned, with the exception of my own and my brother's—my brother makes entries in it when he receives money—the col<lb></lb>lecting—book is not made up in any way, it is a kind of rough—book, not posted into any other book—we call a book rough from which no posting is made, and which is not balanced—we call it posting when there is a reference by a letter or number to another book, when there is none we call it copying—I have referred to the book, and do not find any instances of the clerks having handed money to Mr. Alfred Davis, and he having entered them; I can only tell whether that has been the case or not by referring—I find no entry of Mr. Alfred Davis's here—if a clerk was to hand him money, I suppose he would enter it, but I do not find one such entry here—I do not know that the clerks hand money to each other, and that through their medium it handed over to Mr. Davis or Mr. Jolliffe—it is impossible for me to say that nothing of the kind has occurred—I do not swear that the entries in the ledger in Whyte's and Hicks's account, are the prisoner's; I believe they are.</p>

               <p>I was drinking at a public house, I was never out ten minutes from three o'clock in the afternoon, till this affair happened, I have not a soul here, I have a list of the people to my character, there is the man at the public house, that they know, that came and took his oath that I was at his house, there was a great many people in the house, that will swear I was not out of the house ten minutes in the course of the time.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen: Upon indictments of this sort, there are in general three questions very material to be attended to, the first is, as to the fact of breaking into the house, and to that Mr. Garret says he left the house perfectly secure when he went out, and when he came home the door was broke open, the lock forced, and the staple wrenched out, if that he so, it must have been done by force, then there is no doubt but the house was actually broke open; the next question is, whether there was any person in the house at the time, to that you have the prosecutor's evidence also: the next question is, as to the value; now where the house is broke open in the day time no person being in it, it makes a very material difference as to the degree of guilt and the degree of punishment, for if the value does exceed five shillings, in that case it is capital; the articles now produced are much above that sum, and therefore, if you are satisfied with this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250007"></xptr> evidence, you will find the prisoner guilty, if not, you will acquit him.</p>

             of Halifax of 43 l. 7 s. 6 d. I received the money that day, at Messrs. Boldero and Co. bankers, No. 5, opposite the Mansion-house; I received seventeen guineas and a half, and a twenty-five pounds bank note, I came to receive the money the day before, and it was not due; the banker told me I came a day too soon; I was going to Berkley-square to stay all night with a friend, and on Holborn-hill I met with the prisoner at the bar, and he came up to me and asked me if I came out of the country, and I said I did; he said he was just come from the country too, and he was going to receive money, and I told him I came to receive money too, but I came a day too soon; and when we had walked about three hundred yards further on, he picked up a purse; and we went to a house, but I do not know what house, I am quite a stranger in town; he told me he had found a prize, and he would go in a house and have six-pennyworth<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200088"></xptr> a little farther on, and see what it was; I went into that house with him.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he ask you to go into that house with him? - Yes, and there were two or three more men in the house, and he said we will not say anything of it here, we will go to another house, and we went to another house a little farther on, and there was a man sitting, with a pot of beer, reading a newspaper by himself; the prisoner said, we can see now what we have found, and there he opened the purse, and in the purse there was a ring and a bill of the value, the value of the ring was two hundred pounds: this man that was in the room before we went in, says to the prisoner, suppose you give this gentleman, as he was, with you when you found this prize, eighty pounds for his share: we staid there, and I had some dinner with them, and staid there a good part of the afternoon, and they proposed to me to go and drink tea at some place or other, and spend the afternoon, if I would go with them, so we had a coach in the evening, and went to some place to drink tea, I do not know what place; so this other man that was in the room when we came in, he said, I will take you to a good place where you shall have a bed all night; we went all together, the prisoner staid and slept with me; the next morning I got up, and we had some coffee for breakfast; I was to go to the Bank to receive the money at ten o'clock, and they said they would go along with me: we all went in a coach together, I went to receive my money, and they staid in the coach till I came out: after getting my money, I went into the coach to them; I do not remember where we went, but the prisoner told the coachman to drive to some place; then, after I had the money altogether, we came to a house and had some beer, and the prisoner went out, under pretence to get his money from a gentleman to give me, and he came back in a quarter of an hour, and he told me he could not get it; and this other man that was with him called me to the door, and said, you had better take the purse and ring, it is such a fine prize you will make your fortune by it, and give him, meaning the prisoner, what money you have, and I will take you to Red-lion-square, No. 36, where I keep livery-stables, and I will give you what money you like, and the prisoner was to come to this man's house, at Red-lion-square, and to give me my own money and the eighty pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. But the prisoner was not present when the other man advised you to do this? - No, the other man called me to the door.</p>
               <p>Did you go back to the prisoner? - Yes, we both went into the house again, and I gave my money to the prisoner upon this condition, that he was to come in half an hour's time, to this other man's house in Red-lion-square.</p>
               <p>What was the prisoner to come there for? - He was to come there to bring back my own money, and the eighty pounds besides; when I went back to the prisoner to take the ring, as it would make my fortune, the prisoner proposed himself to come in half an hour, and to bring my money and the eighty pounds besides; and he was then to receive the ring back; he did not like to part with the ring.</p>
               <p>He proposed, and you agreed to it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you give him your money? - Yes, all of it, the money and the bank note; then he went away, and this other man and me walked up to Red-lion-square, to his house, and when we came about half a mile, he left me in a square; he said he wanted to go to speak to somebody a little way off, that he had forgot, and he told me to stop there till he came back; I stopped there about half an hour, waiting for him, and he never came.</p>
               <p>When did you see either the other man or the prisoner? - I never saw him till I saw him at Bow-street on Tuesday the 12th of this month.</p>
               <p>How came you to see him at Bow-street? - Mr. Carpmeal took him up.</p>
               <p>What did he take him up for? - For taking the money from me; I gave information the same day, I came to Bow-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200089"></xptr> after I found there was no such man or house; I described the prisoner as well as I could: I was sent for to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner when you went to Bow-street? - I saw him in the back room there.</p>
               <p>Who shewed him to you? - I do not know who it was, somebody shewed him to me.</p>
               <p>What did they ask you? - They asked me if that was the man, and I said it was.</p>
               <p>Did you know him directly? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>It was near two months before that, that you had seen him? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>How came you to know him at that distance of time, he was an entire stranger to you at first, was not he? - Yes, but I knew his face as soon as ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>What, so well as to know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Should you have known him if you had met him in a crowd of people, and not seen him at Bow-street? - Yes, I am sure I should have known him any where, I was twenty-four hours in his company.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure that he is th e man? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>What did he say for himself? - He denied ever having seen me before.</p>

               <p>Did he know the man as soon as he saw him? - I was not present; this is the ring and purse which the prosecutor left with me on the day he gave the information.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and tell us whether you saw him, and when? - A. Yes, that is the man; I never saw him before the 23d of July, on a Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you see him, and where? - A. Near upon twelve o'clock at night, in my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he alone? - A. He came alone.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he come for, and what passed between you? - A. He asked me whether I had any thing left; I said I had a little but not much; I pointed to a piece of beef, and asked him if that would do, that it should be sixpence halfpenny a pound, but I would take sixpence, it weighed eight pounds two ounces, I abated the two ounces, and said he should have it for four shillings; he asked me whether I could give him change for a note; I asked him what; he said it was a five pound note; I gave him change in three one pound notes, five seven-shilling-pieces, and a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you gave him change did you make any enquiries of him? - A. Yes; I asked him his name, and he said it was William Biddles, and he lived at No. 23, Drury-lane, and was a button-maker; he gave me the note, and I wrote his name on it; I asked him if it was a good one; and he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any request of him respecting the notes you gave him? - A. I asked him to write my name on the notes I gave him, as I had written his name on that note; he made answer, it did not signify, for he dared to say they were all good ones; he said, it was between two or three of them, and he dared to say they were all good ones.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left your shop, did you see which way he turned? - A. I asked him if he would have the meat chopped, because he was going without it being chopped; he said, yes, and I chopped it; he went away, and turned down Holborn-hill way instead of towards Drury-lane, it was directly the contrary way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that raise your suspicion? - A. Yes; I followed him a few yards, when he picked up some sort of lady; I followed him to Turnstile, with the lady and the meat in his hand; my shop is near St. Giles's; he crossed over from Turnstile, and kept on to Brownlow street. I heard him say, the poor fellow will rue this to-morrow, and d - n us, that made me more anxious to give charge of him; I went rather past Gray's-Inn-lane, and saw a watchman almost asleep; I said, I wish you would take charge of this man, I suppose he has given me a bad five pound note; he said he should not go off his beat, and would not take him; the prisoner went on and turned up Brook-street; the woman being with him he did not hear what I said to the watchman. I went on, and saw a watch-box; I asked the watchman to take him into custody; I suppose the lantern made a noise, or something, but they turned into a public-house; we waited for them coming out for some time, but they did not, as the man had gone out at another door.</p>
               <p>Q. You wrote the name the prisoner gave you on the note? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that, (shewing a paper) and say whether it is the note he passed to you? - A. Yes; this is my hand-writing, and there is William Biddles, No. 23, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you written that address on any othe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140040"></xptr>note - A. No; I have not had a five pound note lately but that.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you first questioned about this? - A. I paid it away on Monday to Mr. Nott, who is a banker, and takes money for goods; it was returned to me on the Saturday following.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you applied to by Croker? - A. We went to No. 23; that is, the gentleman and I, who brought the note to me; we could not find such a person; and then we gave information to Croker.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it you next saw the prisoner? - A. Three or four days; I saw him again in a public-house in King-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not in custody at that time? - A. No; I was sent for, and went there, and sat down by him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him again? - A. I knew him again; he went out, and I went after him; he returned in again, and I with him; I then told Croker, and the prisoner was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he passed the note, was Thomas Holstock in the shop? - A. He was in a little accompting-house with a window that sides up, and stood full facing the prisoner as he was standing in the shop, and saw him take the change.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Was the boy before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received the note, you wrote the name of the person who uttered it to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was the 23d of July? - A. Yes, I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. If I can read, this is the 26th of July? - A. That is the same note I will swear; those words,"received Gibbs," are not my writing.</p>
               <p>Q. After the man left you, and you heard the conversation, it necessarily excited your suspicion? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The man, whoever he was, absconded? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, he had intimation of the fact that you were in pursuit of him? - A. I imagine so.</p>
               <p>Q. After this you went to Smithfield, though you suspected the note to be a bad one, and offered it? - A. I shewed it to several people, and they said it was a good one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the man to whom you offered it that you suspected it to be a bad one? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Bank, and communicate any thing there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came to enquire after you, then you told this story? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the watchman here you spoke to that night? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard it said, by my learned Friend, in his address, that the man bought a very small piece of meat - eight pounds is a good allowance for a poor man, is it not? - A. I have often sold twenty pounds; but oftener less than more.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it from the time the note was offered to you till you saw Croker? - A. Eight or ten days; they sent Croker to me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that was it when you saw the prisoner at the bar, was it a day or two? - A. Three or four days.</p>
               <p>Q. Croker told you he had apprehended the man who paid you the note? - A. He sent to me to come and look at a man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not add, that he believed he was the man who had uttered the note? - A. I said it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you again - Did he not add, that he believed he was the man who uttered the note? - A. He said, he thought he had got the man I gave information of; and I said it was the man.</p>

               <p>Q. At this time the man was in some public-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He saw you, did not he, when you spoke to Croker? - A. I did not speak to him at all, I said that was the man. I sat down by the man, and he went out and I followed him; we both returned in together, and I spoke to Croker.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always been as positive to the person of the prisoner as you are to day? - A. I said all along it was the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said it as positively as you do to day? - A. It is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said so? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never spoke in doubt of it? - A. I knew it was the same man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never spoke with doubt, as to the identity of the person? - A. No; I knew it was the same man always.</p>
               <p>Q. And have you always said positively it was the same man? - A. Yes, I always did.</p>
               <p>Q. Remember, you are upon your oath, did you or not, when you were examined before the Magistrate, say, you did not know that the prisoner was the man positively - but if he was not the man, he was extremely like him? - A. Do you mean to say positively you have never said that? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner say, he was surprised you could say so; and did not you make that answer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Isaac Baxter? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon the oath you have taken, whether you have never told Baxter that you did not recollect the person of the man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said any thing to that effect? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say to him, that if the prisoner was not the person, he was very like him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said to Baxter, that you entertained a doubt, and if it was not for the boy, you could not have sworn to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are asked when you put<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140041"></xptr>this note off yourself, whether or not you knew it to be bad - to whom did you pay it? - A. To Mr. Nott.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you known to Mr. Nott? - A. Yes; I do business with him every Monday almost, and have for years.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at all in custody at the time you saw him in King-street? - A. No, perfectly to himself, not in custody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You followed him upon his leaving the house? - A. Yes, he went to the door just to the step, and came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had attempted to run away, you would have followed him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Isaac Baxter? - A. He is an acquaintance of mine, and I was telling him about the man; I said it was the same man, but I had not sworn to him.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you when he spoke to you, did he not tell you it was on the 23d of July, and desire you to say so? - A. No, he never said anything about that.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - A. He asked whether I was sure that was the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he not desire you to be perfect to the man? - A. No; he said that was the man, and asked me if I did not think it was the man; I said, yes, I am sure it was the man; when he came by, he asked me to look at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not your master say, he thought it was the man, and asked you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to recollect it was the 23d if your master did not tell you? - A. I cannot tell the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not at the public-house you saw him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he, taken by your master's house? - A. Yes; he was walking by the house with the officer.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140042"></xptr>Q. You knew he was in custody, and charged with the offence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the reason you were sure of the man was because he held his head down, and went the wrong way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For both those reasons you took notice of the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when he left the shop? - A. In the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of it? - A. In the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. There is an accompting-house? - A. I was in the accompting-house while my master gave him change.</p>
               <p>Q. You were in the shop when he went away? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him going the wrong way? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How could his going the wrong way induce you to take notice of his person? - A. I took particular notice of him, because he would not sign his name to the notes my master gave him; I looked at him two or three times before he went the wrong way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Q. You began yourself to have suspicions when he would not sign his name to the notes your master wanted him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know what day of the month it was, but you are sure you saw that man some time or other in your master's shop? - A. I am sure I saw that man in the shop on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the day of the month? - A. I do not know.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are an officer belonging to Bow-street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call upon Mr. Dear on the 1st of August, in consequence of what you heard from the Bank? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive from him any description of the man from whom the Bank-note was received? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did you see the prisoner at the bar? - A. In the afternoon of the same day.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of information you received, did you go to any place to enquire for the lodging of the prisoner? - A. No, not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What place did you go to? - A. To several places in Gray's-inn-lane, and about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Drury-lane? - A. Yes, to No. 28.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with Dear? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. What took place between you and the prisoner at the time you saw him, and where did you see him? - A. I went into a public-house opposite Gray's-inn-lane, at the corner of Middle-row, where I saw the prisoner; he asked me to drink, I declined it; as I was coming out he followed me, and asked me if I did not want a man, describing a man they call Ugly, but whose name is Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ask you what you wanted him for? - A. No, I did not let him know I knew the man; he said, he thought he could find him: I asked him if he thought he could, and if I should call upon him where he lodged: he declined telling me where he lodged; I asked him where I should see him, and appointed him to meet me where I live; I asked him when he would come, and whether he would come in the morning following; he said it would not suit him, but he would come on Thursday morning; in the evening I went to Mr. Dear, and told him what had happened, and desired him to meet me on Thursday morning, at ten o'clock, at my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner that day? - A. Not at the time appointed; it was five or six o'clock in the evening on Thursday; I had been out with Mr. Dear, and after I left him, I met the prisoner; said I, I thought you were to have called upon me this morning; he said, I could not, but I have just been to your house now; I went with him to the Turk's Head, in King-street, Holborn, and took an opportunity of sending for Mr. Dear to come down; when he came in the prisoner walked out of the door; Dear followed him out, and the prisoner came in again.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at this time acquainted the prisoner with your suspicions of him? - A. No; when the prisoner came in Mr. Dear came in, and called me aside, and said, that was the man; in a little time after the prisoner wanted to go; I told him what was alledged against him, and he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him where he lodged? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did he not tell you where he lodged, and did you not go afterwards and search them? - A. He told about a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not search him in the public-house? - A. Yes, and found nothing but a dollar upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which he told you where he had bought, I believe? - A. Yes; he said he had bought it at a silversmith's, which, upon enquiry, I found to be true.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were at the public-house, and the prosecutor came there, he set down by the prisoner? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. He went out a second time, and returned, I believe? - A. No, I don't think he did when he first went out the prosecutor followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who came in first? - A. The prisoner did.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not attempt to abscond, or any thing of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you find his lodging to be at No. 23, Drury-lane? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You went away, and left the prisoner in the house some time, did you not? - A. I only went outside the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not go out of sight? - A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140043"></xptr>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Where was the place he lodged? - A. At the Bell, in Newkener's-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find his lodging to be in Drury-lane? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know him by the name of Biddles? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Newkener's-street is about a hundred yards from the prosecutor's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How many people were there in the public-house when you went in with him? - A. There might be six or seven playing at bumblepuppy in the back-ground; I took him there to engage his attention, while I sent for the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mr. THOMAS BLISS sworn. - Q. You are an inspector of Bank-notes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note? - A. It is a counterseit, the whole is a counterseit.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the name of the cashier? - A. It is not our cashier's writing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. (To Croker.) When you went to examine whether he purchased the dollar or not, did you not discover he paid by a Bank-not, which turned-out to be a good one? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bliss. We could not ascertain that; we wished to see the note, because Mr. Dear always puts his name on the one-pound notes, and we were in hopes we could trace it.(The note read - No. 2269, dated Bank, 16th of February, 1803.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I am entirely innocent of the charge. Croker has made the man and boy come round, and swear my life away; he has been with them every day, and told them I was the man. I never was in the man's shop in my life. He wanted me to swear against my wife; he would not swear against me at all when I was before the Magistrate; all he said was, that if I was not the man, I was very much like him.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. A cheesemonger, No. 6, Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lived there any time? - A. Yes, two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a housekeeper? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prosecutor? - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you known him any length of time? - A. Three quarters of a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. I never saw him before last Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any conversation with Dear about the prisoner? - A. Yes, about six or seven weeks before in my own house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the habits of visiting each other? - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He came into my house about the Monday or Tuesday after he took the note; said he, a person came into my shop late on Saturday evening, and bought a piece of meat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it was the Monday or Tuesday after the note was paid him? - A. I think it was the Tuesday following; he said the person gave him a five-pound note to change; that he changed it, and gave him his address, No. 25, Drury-lane, a button-maker; accordingly I gave him the difference in change in some small notes, and asked him whether he chose to back them; he said, oh! no, it was no consequence, he should soon distribute them amongst his shop-mates; that the man went out, and instead of going to Drury-lane, he turned down Holborn, which led him to suspect the note was a bad one; then he said to his boy, d - n me, Tom, we are done, it is a bad note; accordingly he ordered the boy to take in the meat, and he went after the man. He told me the man crossed over the way, and went down a little below Gray's-inn-lane; that there was a watchman in his box, and he would have given charge of him, but the watchman would not take charge of him, as it was not done in his beat; that he followed the man down Brook-street, when he went into a gin-shop or public-house, where he lost him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing, whether he should be sure of the person, or not, after he lost him - did you ask him whether he should know the man again? - A. He said he saw no more of him; it may be five or six days after; I saw him again, and he said, the note that man gave me is a bad one; I did not hear any thing particular then, but two or three days after, he came into my shop one evening, and said, I have been down to Bow-street, and a person of the name of Croker had apprehended a person on suspicion of being the person who gave him the note; says he, my boy swore to him hard and fast, he knows him to be the same; says I, what do you think of him; says he, if he is not the same, he is very much like him, but he has altered his dress; that is all I heard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. How came you to make your appearance here as a witness for the prisoner? - A. On Wednesday last, two or three friends of the prisoner came past my shop, and said, such a trial was going to take place that day; accordingly I said, I never was at any trial in my life, I should like to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them? - A. One of them, by dealing at my shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of that friend? - A. I cannot say; he lives at No. 26, Short's-gardens; it was a woman who asked me to go.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a woman was it? - A. A stout woman.</p>
               <p>Q. One of the friends? - A. Yes; and asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140044"></xptr>me if I would go down to hear it; I said I should like to hear it; I came down with them on Wednesday, and understood it was not to come on that day; upon which, they asked me to go in, and see the prisoner, and I said I had no objection; I went in, and he asked me what I heard pass, and I stated what I have now stated.</p>
               <p>Q. You had before been an acquaintance of Dear's, and knew it was his prosecution - did you state to the prisoner what you heard Dear say? - A. Yes, he asked me what I heard; I told him I knew Dear, and stated what I had heard.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of this application you have made your appearance here to-day? - A. Yes; I was asked if I would come forward, and say the same.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you could report to him was, that Dear said if he is not the man, he is very much like him, and the boy has no doubt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And he told you all the circumstances of the case, as you have stated? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Dear.) You have heard what Baxter has said, that you told him, if he is not the man, he is very like him - did you, or not? - A. I said I was sure it was the man - that he was dressed in a brown great coat, and if I liked, I could swear to the coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever express a doubt? - A. I told Baxter all along I was sure it was the man, if I liked to swear to him, but I did not then, for he had not then been before the Justice.</p>

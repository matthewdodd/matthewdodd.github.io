               <p>Coffe depos'd he saw him at Mrs. Smart's with his own hands file and lighten guineas, and that himself and Gahagan taught him bow to do it; and although he did not lodge in their apartment, yet he came every day, except one he was not well, and he was lock'd up in their room, and did work with them in lightening guineas and other money; that his chief Instruments were a knife and an engraven that at melting, what Mrs. Smart call'd Salve in her kitchen, Conner and himself did blow the fire, and when he went abroad to change the money away, they used to allow him for his expence, and also to buy him cloaths and pay his rent; but Gahagan and himself were Partners in the profit, and allowed the prisoner at discretion, and that Duff was never at their lodgings in Mrs. Smart's house; but

               <p>Mr. Fretwell depos'd, that the prisoner apply'd to him two or three times for Portugal pieces and brought silver in exchange; after that he refus'd serving him; then the prisoner apply'd to Mr. Welch, and his suspicion arose from seeing him and Gahagan walking together near Stock's market.</p>

            . I am a teller at the Bank of England; Mr. Fretwell once refus'd changing the prisoner's silver, and he apply'd to me and I serv'd him several times; he generally came for seven or eight Portugal pieces, and in exchange brought silver; he us'd to take particular notice of the 36 s. pieces, and gave me several back, which gave me a suspicion; he has ask'd me several times to go to the tavern; I apply'd to our principal officer, and he advis'd me to go with him to see if I could make any thing of him; I went twice, I told him he put them to a bad use; but his answer was, he sent them over to Ireland to his brother, and sold them for forty shillings a piece; I told him it was very unlikely to send six or seven at a time: after I had tax'd him about filing them, said he, if I knew the art I would not be honester than they that did; but after that he came no more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dell depos'd he saw three persons sitting at a table at work in filing and the like, as before, but could not swear to the Prisoner's face, but said the third person was a tall man (as the prisoner was ) but being tall as he sat, the upper part of the window being blinded, with the place where he sat he could not come at a sight of his face, although he had tried hard so to do.</p>

            . I do not remember seeing the prisoner at my master's shop above once, and as near as I can recollect, about July, he brought rather more than an ounce of gold to sell, it was set in the pot, I weigh'd it, and paid him some of the money, as usual, and gave him the bill in our trade, 'till such time as an essay was made; we judg'd it to belong to Mr. Gahagan, as they generally call'd in a day or two; and to the best of my knowledge, Mr. Gahagan came with the note, and I paid him the remainder of the money.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Gahagan desired I would dispose of his translation of Mr. Pope's Essays on Man, and I went to several noblemen who were very generous to me for them; I have from several brought Mr. Gahagan a guinea, or a guinea and a half; I was allow'd to drink a pint of beer and other expences, that I might attend it, which may be a sufficient reason for my having money about me sometimes; and when I went to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174901130019"></xptr> Bank of England for 36 s. pieces, I was sent by Mr. Gahagan, who told me it was by Coffe's direction, and I ask'd for such in Coffe's name: and as to what Mr. Welch said to me about fileing the money I took it to be in a joaking way, and says I in the same way, I will not set up for more honestly than other people, saying, if I knew how to do it I would. My lord, please to ask Mr. Welch whether he did or did not talk in this funny way?</p>
               <p>Welch to the Q. No, sir, it was not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner continues. Mrs. Smart said she saw me blowing the fire; Mr. Coffe call'd me into the kitchen, and said, for God's sake blow the fire, for I am quite in a flame: I took the bellows and blow'd some time: as for the book, he took it out of my pocket; it was in my hands but sometimes; I had it to take an account of the washerwoman's work; it never was in my hands but on such occasions, and what they had wrote in the book I do not know.</p>

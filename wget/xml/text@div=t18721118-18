I am a stab, and lodged at 4, Paternoster Row, and lodged at 4, Paternoster Row, a lodging-house, for four nights—on the night of 16th November, about 12 o'clock, I came home, and went into the kitchen—Moore was against the gas, and Goddard was standing by the side of the table, in his shirt-sleeves, and with his hat on the table—Moore turned the gas off, and they turned round and caught hold of me, and felled me to the ground—three attacked me; the two prisoners and a third—one of them held me down while the other cut my pocket off, and took the contents, 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and some halfpence—I had seen the money safe, and counted it, not five minutes before I went into the lodging-house—they then bundled me out into the street, and shut the door against me, and gave me a wrong hat instead of my own—I went in search of a policeman, and went back with him to the house, and saw Moore, who is the deputy or manager of the kitchen—I asked if he knew anything of that hat—he said "Yes, it belongs to a man up stairs, in bed"—I went up stairs with the constable, and saw Goddard, and asked if that was his hat—he said "Yes"—I asked where mine was—he said "Under the bed," and he gave it to the constable.</p>

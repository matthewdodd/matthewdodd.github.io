            , dealers in coals, timber, and flour. On Thursday the 14th of this month I was going out with my master's team, the waggon was loaded with fourteen sacks of flour, a chaldron of coals; and I had some business to do, and the man that was with me drove my team on for me; I overtook the team between White Friers and Bunhill-row; I was shooting the coals at Mr. Allens; the prisoner came to me and said, you are shooting your coals without a measure; I told him I really did not know whether I was or no; I had a little business to do, I was obliged to leave the waggon; I laid down the case to him, and told him the particulars what I left the waggon for; he said he would be my friend, if that was the case. It was a particular friend of his that took the number, he would speak to him for me; I thanked him, and he went away; I did not see him again myself till seven o'clock the next evening; he then said he would settle it for a dollar, and a tankard of porter. I agreed to pay the dollar, and the expences they had been at: the prisoner and another man as a witness went to my apartment; I gave the prisoner a dollar and five shillings in silver; the prisoner wrote me a receipt, and gave it me. After the prisoner gave me the receipt I asked him what authority he had to do such a thing; he said he had authority from government, or by act of parliament to do it, I cannot say which; I then had him taken in custody, and the next day he was taken before the alderman.</p>

            . On the 15th of February, at seven o'clock I went to my brother's apartment, the prisoner and another man were there, they related the story that a friend of theirs had taken the number; but had told them to make it up; they said they thought my brother was a hard-working man, they would let him off as light as they could for a few shillings, and something to drink, my brother's wife was very much frightened at seeing them to and fro all the day; I advised them to go over the way to the public-house, and get a little beer till my brother came in. Soon after I went over to see if they had been there; they were at the public-house, and the man that they said had taken the number, he was there. My brother came out with a man of the name of Jackson. The man that they said had taken the number, spoke to me; he said, I will settle with you any where, but not with 
               <persName id="t18110220-104-person920">Jackson</persName>
             the coalman, he knows me. He said Smith and the other man were his men, they could settle as well. We went down to my brother, my brother paid down to the prisoner five shilling and a dollar, and they said they would pay for the liquor that they had; before my brother stopped one shilling they gave a receipt for the ten shillings. After the prisoner had got the money he sent for half a pint of gin, and after that he took the eight shillings and fourpence, put it in paper, and was going out my brother stopped him, and asked him what authority he had to come, and extort money from him; I understood he said he had authority from some Queen-square officer. When my brother charged the constable with him, he went back and flung the money on the table, said he would not have it, and owned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181102200052"></xptr>himself in a fault.</p>

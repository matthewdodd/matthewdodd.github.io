I am the daughter of the last witness—I served some man with twopenny worth of gin on 20th July; he gave me a bad florin—I gave it to my father, and when the man saw that he went out—I had given him the change—I went out with my father and saw the prisoner and the man I had seen previously—they turned round, saw us, and ran away—I pointed out to my father the man who had been in the shop—he went alter him, and I saw the prisoner in custody.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector P</hi> 40). I was a sergeant at this time—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running at the top of his speed—I laid hold of him; he drew a paper packet out and threw it on a grating in front of a shop—I heard a chink of coin going through the grating—Mr. Jones gave me a florin which was passed in the house, and afterwards John Brown gave me nine bad florins—I said to the prisoner, "I know now what I have got you for"—he said, "I have done nothing"—I searched him at the station, and found a good half-sovereign, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, among which was this counterfeit florin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>because I found it since—nine bad coins were picked up in the cellar, and Jones gave me two—no one from the Mint saw the good money before the Magistrate, but the Solicitor to the Treasury was there, who looked at the coins—I looked at it, and it was so good an imitation that I believed it to be good, and marked it A—the prisoner was twice before the Magistrate, and I think it was after the second time that I found it was bad—I should have mentioned it to the Magistrate if it was before that—I have been in the force 17 years—I told the Solicitor of it at the Treasury—this case was postponed from last Session, and it might have been after that that I found it was bad—there was no V on it when I marked it that I could see—I made the A and the bar across all at the same time—it is not Valtered to A.</p>

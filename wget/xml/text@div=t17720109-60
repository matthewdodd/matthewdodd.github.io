While I was employed in the post-office, on the 16th of December, Sloper the prisoner was stamping the letters; he was about a yard and a half from me. I saw him, as he was stamping the letters, take a letter and convey it under his coat. I informed Mr. Potts the comptroller of it immediately. Upon being charged with it, and brought into the comptroller's office, he unbuttoned his breeches, and the letter was taken from under his shirt. He was afterwards taken before Sir

            . On the 16th of December last I was desired by the comptroller to take care of the prisoner, who was then in the inland office. I took him to the Bull in Sherborn-lane; I staid there with him about an hour and an half; then I took him back to the comptroller's office. After he came from the secretary's office, going again to return to the Bull, he went to his own drawer, which is in the passage. He unlocked it and took out a bag, which he put up in a blue and white handkerchief. I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said, he was going to give it to Mrs. Whitefield at the Bull. I thought it proper to inform my partner Dupree of this circumstance. I desired him to inform the comptroller of it. He came to me some time after at the Bull, and desired me to take care that Sloper did not make away with it. In the mean time the prisoner delivered it to the girl of the house, and she gave it to her mistress. Dupree came again and demanded the bag, which I saw the servant deliver to the prisoner, and the prisoner gave it to Dupree.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a bag was it?</p>
               <p>Good. A leather bag about a foot long; that bag looks like it; it was of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in at the Bull before you sent to Dupree?</p>
               <p>Good. About an hour and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to give the bag to the mistress<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090044"></xptr> of the house or the girl, before you sent for Dupree?</p>
               <p>Good. No, not till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your business as a porter?</p>
               <p>Good. To stamp and face up letters, and sometimes to go with expresses. (A bag shown him.) This is the bag; these are what we call receiving-bags; this bag is marked Chard.</p>

            . I am servant at the Bull. Sloper and Good came to our house on the 16th of December.

               <p>Mrs. Whitefield. I keep the Bull. Good and Sloper came to my house; Sloper called the girl and gave her the bundle, and bid her give it me.</p>

            . I am a porter at the post-office. Good, who had Sloper in custody, sent for me to the Bull; the person that was to have told me, did not tell me for half an hour.</p>
               <p>Good. He told me Sloper had a bundle, and he thought it proper to acquaint the comptroller. I did; the comptroller ordered me to bring it to him. I went for it, and Sloper gave it me out of the bar. I took it to the comptroller, and I opened it in his presence. This is the bag; here is Flexney upon it; that is the receiving house. There were two bags in the handkerchief. I opened both; they contained 124 letters. These are the letters. This is the letter mentioned in the indictment, (picking out one.) I put my name upon it; they were all paid letters. (Opens the letter.) This is the letter and the bank note. Mr. Parkins the solicitor took out this bank note, and I signed my name on the back of it. I have had the bag in my drawer ever since; they were all locked up in my care, till Mr. Parkins opened them and marked them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two bags separate, or one within the other?</p>
               <p>Good. Separate.</p>
               <p>Court. Mr. Potts, please to give an account of the methods you took in this business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Potts. When Dupree brought this bundle of letters, when he came to turn them out, they were observed to be all paid letters from different receiving houses in London. I took them down to the secretary, and they were ordered to rest in Dupree's hands, that there might be proof against Sloper if any thing should arise. They have remained in his hands ever since; I only examined them to see that they were paid letters. I gave them again to Dupree, and the seals were not broke at all.</p>
               <p>Q. From how many receiving houses did the letters in the bags come?</p>
               <p>Potts. I can't say I took that notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are all the letters here?</p>
               <p>Potts. No, there were some foreign letters; they were sent off.</p>
               <p>Court. Look over the letters, and see whether they all come from one receiving house, or several.</p>
               <p>Potts. They come from five different houses, Partington's, Flexney, Jones, Creamer, and Gibson. The prisoner was employed to bring letters from those receiving houses. Here are 13 that have escaped the stamp of the receiver's name, I suppose through the hurry of stamping. Each receiver has a seal with the initials of his name, and he tyes the letters up in a bag, and seals it with his name; the bags are brought to me or the deputy before the seal is broke, to see that they are right.</p>
               <p>Court. Do they never receive letters in their passage to the post-office?</p>
               <p>Potts. No.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time, in what department of his office must these letters have been taken?</p>
               <p>Potts. The prisoner is appointed to bring up the bye-bags, and is on duty three times a week; the other three days he fetches the bags. The days he is on duty at the post-office, he employs another man to bring them up, who is likewise provided by the post-office; he must have got possession of the letters in facing them. The bags, as I said before, are first brought to me, to shew they have never been opened since they came from the receiving house; then they are carried to the junior officer to open them.</p>
               <p>Q. May they not carry them first to the junior officer?</p>
               <p>Potts. They should not do it; if they did, I should soon know such a bag had not been up to me.</p>

            . I keep a receiving house on Holborn-hill. The letters that were brought to my house on the 26th of October, were delivered with the money in the bag; they always are delivered at night. I remember very well, I took in this letter, and took 8 d. postage for it, it being represented as a double letter. I put it into the bag with the rest of the letters, and the money with them. I gave the bag to the prisoner or his deputy, I can't say to which I gave it. I marked it 8 d. I have a tool in my pocket with which I mark the money paid for letters; and I have another tool with which I stamp my name. (The stamp for 8 d. and the name are applied to the stamps on the letter, and correspond exactly.) We have two bags. We put the paid letters into a bag, and then that bag into a larger bag with the rest of the letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you do that yourself?</p>

I have been employed in fetching the prisoner's bags from Mr. Partington's, Mr. Creamer, Mr. Flexney, Mr. Gibson, and Mr. Jones; and I brought the bags on the 26th of October, that was the night when he was on the grand duty, on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. I receive the letters for a fortnight, then he receives them for a fortnight. I carried the bags into the room and shewed the comptroller the seals; then I brought them out to the long table in the post-office, and turned them out upon the table; the prisoner was on duty there that night, either stamping or facing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Potts. Is there any post-office stamp upon that letter?</p>
               <p>Potts. No; if it had come to the proper officer, he would have stamped post-paid upon it, and the day of the month on the reverse side.</p>
               <p>Court. Were these 124 letters of different stamps, or the same day most of them?</p>
               <p>Potts. They are not opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they received any stamps?</p>
               <p>Potts. None of the 124 had, only the receiver's stamps.</p>
               <p>Court. You must break open a letter.</p>
               <p>Potts. This is dated the 31st of October. The prisoner, instead of handing the paid bag over to the proper officer, must have every time put it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not that have been liable to detection?</p>
               <p>Potts. He ran to be sure a great hazard; there are twenty or thirty officers in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Partington. How many paid letters had you on the 26th of October?</p>
               <p>Partington. We keep no account; we put the money in a bit of paper, and put it in a bag with the letters.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the money would be found if the letter was missing?</p>
               <p>Partington. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Potts. They are laid on the table for the stamper; then the next person to him faces the directions all one way; when they are stamped they are faced up into rows, and the sorter sorts them into the several divisions.</p>

            . I am a principal of the office called the Bank-note office, at the Bank. Mr. Larkin is one of the cashiers appointed by the governor and company to sign bank notes which they issue out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the name of Larkin to that bank note to be his writing?</p>
               <p>Vitu. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It is counter-signed by yourself?</p>
               <p>Vitu. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this is to all intents and purposes a bank note?</p>
               <p>Vitu. Yes, undoubtedly. (The date and signature of the letter read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I leave my defence to my council. I never opened the letter, nor concealed the bag.</p>
               <p>The council in behalf of the prisoner, arged some doubts whether his offence came within the meaning of the statute, as he had not made any use of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177201090046"></xptr> bank note, nor opened the letter; it rather appearing that his view was meerly to defraud the post-office of the money paid for the postage of the letters.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called a number of persons, who gave him a good character; several said, that they believed he was at certain times not perfectly in his senses. The officers at the post-office said, that they never observed any thing of insanity in him; that he was always capable of his business, but was apt to drink too much.</p>

               stealing a letter containing two half guineas

               <p>The letter in question was the same that Mr. Rowe, inspector of the franks, saw him secrete, as mentioned in the last trial, of which he informed Mr. Potts the comptroller. The prisoner was searched, and the letter, containing two half guineas, was found in his breeches.</p>
               <p>The prisoner in his defence said, that the letter slipt into his waistcoat, where the buttons were off, and so fell down into the waistband of his breeches.</p>

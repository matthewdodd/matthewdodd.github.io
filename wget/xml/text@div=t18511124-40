                  </hi>. I am a clerk, and live at 85, Bartholomew-close. I have known the prisoner two years and a quarter, and have occasionally em<lb></lb>ployed him to clean knives and boots—on 30th Oct. he went with me on business to the West-end, and we came home together—it was between 12 and 1 o'clock at night when we got home—we went into the front parlour, and remained there about half an hour, when I was knocked down by the prisoner—when I recovered I made for the parlour-door, and found it locked—I then went and opened the shutters and windows, and called "Murder! and police!" and while doing so he knocked me down a second time by a blow behind the ear, and I became insensible—my wife was in the room, and my child in bed in the back-parlour—when I recovered I saw my wife was all over blood—after I was knocked down the second time, I do not remem<lb></lb>ber anything till I found myself in the hands of two officers—I was hurt very much about the head and ribs—my ribs are now as black as my hat; the back of my head was nothing but bloody matter; I shall feel it all my life—my wife is about six months gone in the family way, and too ill to attend to-day—I hear my little boy was assaulted by the prisoner while I was insensible—I saw him in the hospital next day—there was nothing the matter with him before.</p>

I have been with Mr. Ewbank this morning, but he has left me several times—I cannot say whether he is sober or not—on the night of 80th Oct, I was on duty in Bartholomew-close, and heard cries of "Police!" and "Murder!" proceeding from No. 86—I went there, found the window open, looked in, and saw the prisoner there, hurling every thing out of the window he could lay hands on—I got the assistance of Templeman and Delaney—the street-door was open, we went in, and forced the parlour door—it was dark; a light was got, and I then saw Ewbank lying on the ground, in a state of stupor, I should judge from ill-usage—the prisoner was behind the door, and appeared to be intoxicated—I stayed with Ewbank till he came to himself, and then took him to the station—the prisoner had gone on there before—I saw that Mrs. Ewbank and the boy had both been ill-used; the boy was taken to the hospital—I saw a drop of blood on the prisoner's forehead, when he was at the station—on the following morning, Ewbank made a complaint of the prisoner's ill-usage—while the prisoner was at the station, he kicked Templeman in the privates.</p>

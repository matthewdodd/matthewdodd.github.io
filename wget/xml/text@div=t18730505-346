I am one of the medical officers of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—I visited the prisoner's house by order of the relieving overseer, on 18th March—I saw the deceased; she was in a state of great exhaustion; in fact, I almost thought she would have died while I was there—the cause of the exhaustion was want of proper nourishment—I continued to visit her till her death, on 17th April—the cause of death was the actual wearing out of the powers of nature, simply because she had not had nourishment in time to save her from exhaustion—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and that confirmed my view—there was no organic disease, but extreme emaciation and absence of fat, indicating that she wanted nourishment, and she might have lived if she had had it at an earlier period.</p>

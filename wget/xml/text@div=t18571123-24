                  </hi>. I am single and reside at No. 2, Little Ryder Street, in the parish of St. James, Westminster. On 4th Nov. I went to bed about a quarter past 11 o'clock—I had a gentleman lodging in the house, and he had not come home; he should have fastened the street door after he came in, but I believe he did not do so; I was awoke about a quarter past 5 o'clock, and saw a man in my bedroom standing at the drawers—I had a basket containing my plate on those drawers—I did not notice my plate basket at that moment—I moved, and the man immediately rushed out of the room—I saw his side face as he rushed out; he was a little man—I jumped out of bed and followed him along the passage to the street door—I called, "Police!" and a policeman immediately came—I then shut the door, and behind it I found my plate basket.</p>

                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, C</hi> 111). On the morning of 5th Nov., about a quarter past 5 o'clock, I was on duty in Little Ryder Street, I heard some noise, and stood still and listened; I heard the bolt of a door spring back, as if some one was opening it from the inside—I went back towards it, and when I was within about five yards of the door, I saw the prisoner come out of Miss Gibbs's house, slam the door after him, and run away—as I went straight off after him, I heard the voice of a female in the passage cry, "Police!"—I followed the prisoner in Bury Street, and there apprehended him at the area railings of No. 10—I lost sight of him for about a second, just as he was turning the corner out of Little Ryder Street into Bury Street; I was about ten yards behind him, I turned sharply after him—when I turned into Bury Street he was walking; there was not a soul in the street that I saw, but him—I laid hold of his collar, and said, "I want you to go back along with me to No. 2, Little Ryder Street"—he said, "What for?"—I said, "When you get there you will ascertain what for"—I</p>

               <p>found on him a latch key, and a pocket book—the latch key would not open Miss Gibbs's door—I took him back to Miss Gibbs, and she said, "That is the man"—he said it could not be him, for he had just come from work, it was a great mistake—I do not think he had got above a yard or so past the door of No. 10, Bury Street, when I took him; he was against the area railings when I laid hold of his collar.</p>

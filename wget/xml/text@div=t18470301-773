                  </hi>. I am servant to Thomas Jenkins, of the Blue Posts, Newman-street. On Monday, the 1st of March. there was a raffle at the house—it commenced at eight o'clock in the evening—the prisoner was there—about eleven o'clock at night I found her up stairs in one of the bed-rooms which was let—I said, "O dear, how you frighten me!"—she said she felt very poorly, and came up there to make use of the room—I had never seen her before—she appeared very stout—she said she was in the family way—she waited a few minutes, and said, "Good night," and went down stairs—next morning, about ten minutes to seven o'clock, I missed the articles stated, which was everything I was possessed of, from my trunk, which was in my bed-room—they were worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and were safe in my box about five o'clock on Monday evening.</p>

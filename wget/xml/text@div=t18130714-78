On the 16th of July I had just turned my back to the shop; I was going into the yard to the butt of water; I heard the witness, Brookbank, call out, have you sold a leg of mutton; I returned into the shop and saw the leg of mutton was gone; I asked him to run after the man; the prisoner was brought back in less than ten minutes with the leg of mutton under his arm. That was my leg of mutton: the leg of mutton is disposed off by order of the magistrate, as it was an article that would not keep.</p>

            . I live at No. 4, Coppice-row, opposite of the butcher's shop. On the 16th of July, I saw the prisoner come out of the shop with a leg of mutton; he put it under his coat; I immediately went over the way and enquired of Mrs. Palmer if she had sold it, and in consequence of what she told me I pursued the prisoner, I stopped him at the top of Saffron-hill; I told him he had taken a leg of mutton; he came back with me to Mrs. Palmer's shop. The leg of mutton was claimed Mrs. Palmer.</p>

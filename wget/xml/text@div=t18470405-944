                  </hi> I am inspector of Letter Carriers in the London District Post-office—the prisoner has been a letter-carrier nearly three years, employed at the Branch-office, Charing-cross—it was his duty to deliver letters in Covent-garden, and that neighbourhood—if the letter in question was at the London District, it would not be his duty todeliver it—it bears the mark of the old office—it was posted at St. John's Wood, and arrived at the chief office from there—it has the five o'clock delivery marked on it from St, John's Wood—it would be collected at St. John's Wood at there o'clock, and arrive at the General Post office, St. martin's-le-Grand, between there and five o'clock—and be sent from there to Charing-cross, and be sorted there to be ready for the five o'clock delivery in Henrietta-street—it would not be part of the prisoner's duty to deliver it—his beat was next to the beat which included Henrietta-street, but might very likely have fallen into his hand by mistake, and if so it would be his duty to give to the party who should deliver it, or to the inspector on duty—Inspector Pearce, of the F division of police, showed me the letter on the 10th of March, and I went in search of the prisoner, in company with Ashman—I have heard Ashman's statement of what passed—it is correct—I was present at the Post-office when the letter was shown to the prisoner, and heard him say he had not seen it before, that he knew nothing of it—he admitted pawning the coat—I heard him asked if it was not likely that such a letter might be sorted to his walk by mistake—his answer was, "Very likely"—the prisoner was on duty at the Charging-cross office on the evening of the 1st of Feb., and if in the performance of his duty he would have been there at the arrival of this letter in its due course, he has signed his name as being present at that time.</p>

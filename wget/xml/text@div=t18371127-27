                  </hi>. I am shopman to Charles Flower Murfin and another, of Tottenham-court-road. On the 7th of November the prisoner came to purchase a reel of cotton, to match a piece of print—the apprentice served her—she asked to look at some ribbons, and the lad showed her a basket of gauze ribbons—I was standing by—she selected a piece which she said she would take—she then altered her mind, and said she would look at some sarsnet ribbons—the lad left the basket, and turned his back to get the drawer of sarsnet ribbons—while he turned his back, I saw her place a piece of cloth partly over the basket of ribbons—she took a piece out, and I saw her place it under her right armpit—I said nothing to her till she went out of the shop—she looked at the sarsnet ribbons, but bought none, and went out—I followed her just outside the door, and asked her to step inside, as I wished to speak to her—she said she would not—I told her I would fetch a policeman, and make her—she then came in, and I said, "You have a piece of ribbon belonging to us"—she said, "I have not"—I told her it was under her armpit—I pulled her shawl on one side, and there I saw it—I took it out—I told the Magistrate that she refused to return—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being read, stated,</hi> "I asked her to step in, and she did so ")—this is the piece of ribbon—it is worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she had paid 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the cotton—my employers have inquired, and find her family bear a good character—I never saw her before.</p>

I was sent for to the shop, and told the prisoner she must come with me—she said, "I am sorry for it, I took it, I cannot help it"—she appeared agitated—I took her to the station—she was searched, and the reel of cotton was found, but no money.</p>

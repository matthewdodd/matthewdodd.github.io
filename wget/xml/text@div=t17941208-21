               <p>Q. I do not mean the prisoner, I mean the deceased, did he compleatly cover the hole? - He stood with his shoulder against the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was the hole? - It is about a yard from the floor, rather more than the middle of the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You said a yard from the floor? - Yes, it is the middle of the door, as near as can be.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This hole then you say was about the middle of the door, you and the deceased, Marsh, stood against the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you stood by the hole? - Yes, by it, I stood on his right side.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no light on the stair case at this time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time think you might elapse from the time that the prisoner went up stairs with his lady, to the time this accident took place? - About half an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. So that there was time enough for the prisoner to have been asleep? However half an hour had elapsed in that time? The prisoner at the bar and the woman had been perfectly quiet from the time that you parted with them, to the time that you saw him? - Yes; as soon as he got up stairs, Sampson and I went up to him, and Sampson borrowed some money of him, and Sampson came down stairs and went to bed, I was not quite undressed.</p>
               <p>Q. From the quantity of liquor you drank together, was the prisoner at the bar perfectly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080082"></xptr> sober? - He did not seem intoxicated in liquor.</p>

               <p>Q. You drank a good deal you know? - I gave one of my glasses to the life guard that was on guard.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner never-spoke at the door? - No, I never heard him speak a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not say on Sampson's calling to him to come down stairs, take case, I will frighten them? - No, I am sure he never spoke.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately as Sampson called to his comrade, he came down? - Yes, immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. This was at ten o'clock at night? and after you had parted for the night? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He came down in his shirt, and attended the call of his comrade? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as you stated at the beginning, they were perfect strangers, the prisoner and the deceased, so that they had not an opportunity of having any quarrell? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman; I went with this man to apprehend the prisoner at the Admiralty coffee house.</p>
               <p>Q. As you was going to take him into custody, did you hear him say any thing? - He was very sorry for what he had done,and he must suffer for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to say that? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. He did not attempt to deny any thing that he had done, as the cause of this man's death, but he said he was sorry for it, and be must take the consequence of it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose that was after they told him the man was dead? - I cannot say that.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you apprehend this man? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. As he was going to the watch-house did he say any thing, and what did he say? - As soon as I got him out of the house I fastened him, and then I told him I was very sorry to tell him that I had a charge of murder against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing further to him? - I asked him how he came to commit so horrid a deed? he said he was very sorry for it, that it was done and he supposed he should suffer for it. I questioned him then with what his comrade said to him when he called him out of the room; and he said, that his comrade called him, and told him that he believed he was stuck with the bayonet. I did not after that question him any further, only respecting his sword. After he was at the watch-house it was intimated to me what had become of the sword that he had done the mischief with; I asked him where the sword lay? and he said, it lays under the bed; in consequence of that I sent two patroles immediately for the sword.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I believe he appeared extremely concerned at what had happened? - He rather seemed stupid, he said he was sorry.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean that he appeared stupid in liquor? - When I first came into the room, to the best of my knowledge, he was perfectly asleep, if it was feigned sleep I could not discover it;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080087"></xptr>at the time of his getting up he seemed rather stupid, but when he came out of the house he was rather solid then.</p>

               <p>Q. In your judgment was that the occasion of his death? certainly. I opened the body on Thursday, and I found the weapon had gone through the liver, opened the stomach, ruptured the aorta, and caused a great contusion in the vessels; it was impossible any man could exist after he had received such a wound as that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sampson called me down when I was up stairs and almost asleep, I got out of bed, and my sword was laid drawn on the chair and I catched up my sword, I was between sleeping and waking, I catched my sword up, and when I came down stairs I pushed my sword against the door, but I did not know there was a hole there; the man stood up against the door so that I could not see through that there was any hole, so I put the sword against the door before I hardly got down the steps, and it happen ed to go into the hole, and ran right into the man; but I never saw the man before nor never see him at any time, only when I fell in.</p>

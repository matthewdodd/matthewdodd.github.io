                  </hi>. I am now living at 3, Herne Road, Brixton—I am separated from my husband—in December, 1876, I was living at 298, Kennington Road—I had full power to let the whole of the house No. 98, Fleet Street, with the exception of the shop, which was occupied by Mrs. Judkins—before October, 1876, I only knew Colls by seeing him come in and out to a tenant of mine—I had about nine tenants in the upper part of the house—in October, 1876, Colls applied to me to take some rooms at 98; I replied that I would not let them unless the rent was paid in advance—the rent was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, a quarter was to be paid in advance—he said he was quite willing to do that, but he had not the cash in hand directly—I said "I will wait till you have, but I won't let them till I have my rent in advance"—he repeatedly came to me respecting them, but the matter remained on that footing till 16th December—he then brought me this lease (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said he had been trying to borrow 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it as he had done before, but that his solicitor, Mr. Ody, was very ill, and could not lend it him; but if I would, let him have some money, with the rooms, he would deposit the lease with me as security—on perusing the lease I asked him what benefit he reaped from it—he said 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I then arranged to let him the two back rooms for one year and give him a receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance for the quarter and advance him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he should have the carpet and table so that he would not have to buy it, as he said he had no furniture for offices; the Turkey carpet was to be 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the table 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the agreement was made at 98, Fleet Street, in my own sitting-room; my servant, Mrs. Bowley, was present, cleaning and drubbing the room—I let him have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion, as I had no more in my pocket, and he gave me an I. O. U. for it; he was to come</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187802110002"></xptr>
               <p>to my private house for the remainder, which he did that evening—Mrs. Bowley let him in, and my daughter Katie and my daughter-in-law, Mrs. Hemming, were present, when I gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and he handed me the lease—these two documents marked A. and B. are in his writing, and we signed them. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "A. Received of Mrs. Appleford 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Arthur Colls. December 16, 1876." "B. I promise to return to Mr. Arthur Colls the lease of three houses situated at Sheerness, Kent, on being paid 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the 23rd January, 1877, or to be renewed as may be arranged between Mr. Colls and myself. Annie Appleford. December 16, 1876.") When I parted with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I of course thought the lease was genuine, or I should not have let him have sixpence—the carpet and table were moved into the front room on that same day, but I locked it up and did not give him possession till the 23rd, when this agreement was signed—it is the prisoner's writing, my solicitor drew the copy of it. (<hi rend="italic">This was a memorandum of agreement to take the two rooms as offices at</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year, pay<lb></lb>able quarterly</hi>. ) It is signed by him—in January, 1877, I was taken ill with pleurisy—I was then living in Fleet Street; the doctor would not allow me to be removed; I was in bed for ten weeks there—on 8th January the prisoner brought his wife and daughter to live there, not with me, but in the same house—at the latter part of January, or the beginning of February, I gave my daughter 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay some taxes—the prisoner said he was going that way and would pay them for me to save her going, as it was raining fast, and I gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I after<lb></lb>wards found he had not paid it, and asked him for it; he promised to give it me, but did not—he said he would give me an undertaking for it, and that it might go off the deed—he gave me this memorandum: "I hereby authorise you to deduct 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. further from the deed you hold of mine, Jan. 23, 1877." About the 9th February he applied to me to lend him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. further on the lease, as there was a warrant out for his body for his taxes at Forest Hill—I said I could not let him have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I would let him have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and as I had not so much with me I let him have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for which he gave me this I O U—I parted with that, believing the lease to be worth 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he said I should be safe up to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I would not have let him have the money but for that belief—I recovered from the attack of pleurisy about the middle of March—it was at the latter part of March that I had information with regard to Mr. Hawkins's receipt of the rents of those houses—I had suspicion before, and in the middle of March I told the prisoner I had reason to believe that the lease of these premises which he had given me as security was not worth the parchment it was written upon, and if such was the case I should certainly punish him unless he returned me the money<lb></lb>he said he was quite aware that the lease was of no service when he gave it me, that he had been ejected, and I might do my best and my worst, that he had been offered 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Mrs. Judkins to take possession of my premises before that day month, and I should be outside of them, and he did it and threw my furniture into the street—he further said he thought he should have done business and then he would have paid me<lb></lb>I afterwards applied to a Magistrate for a warrant, which was granted in the early part of May—I was not well enough to appear before—I was told that the officers could not find him, and I did not know he was in custody till afterwards—I subsequently got a summons, and he was taken before a Magistrate and committed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. The agreement was made on 23rd December—there was one made on the 16th, but my solicitor advised me not to give up possession upon it—I swear that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced on the 16th; it was not for interest—when I was taken ill I gave the lease to my daughter and son with other deeds—I should say that I had it in my possession on 1st January, 1877, at my Kennington house—I did not engage you as my agent, I am always my own agent, I employ no one, I never gave you authority to do anything for me—I might have instructed you to distrain on Mr. Brown for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a quarter's rent; just for an hour while I went to get an order to go in possession—a man named Carroll was put in possession—I did not owe any rent to Mrs. Judkins—I did not ask you, as my husband had deserted me, to come and keep possession of the house for me—if an execution was put in on my goods for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was a sham affair, it was withdrawn without a farthing payment—I did not offer Hammond, the broker's man, half-a-crown to settle it, he gave me the warrant voluntarily—I swear I gave you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash on 9th February—you were not maintaining me, I never had a meal from you—I did not tell you to sue my husband for my maintenance, I always kept myself—I have never received a bill of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from yon for six weeks' board and attendance—I was never applied to for that amount—I did not write a letter to my husband for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to provide necessaries for myself and child—you wanted me to write it, but I said no—I am bringing an action against Mrs. Judkins for illegal distraint—a man named Joy came and broke open a door and took possession, planned, I believe, by you—I telegraphed to you for Carroll's address, and sent to the station for a policeman to come and take charge of the premises till I could get him—two policemen came—I did not suggest that you should tome in as a <hi rend="italic">bon fide</hi> lodger, and keep possession under the Lodgers' Act—I allowed your wife and daughter to come for a week as you were obliged to leave your lodgings, and a memorandum was drawn up to that effect—I sent to Mr. Hammond for it, that I might indict you for false swearing—I don't know that you are an important witness against me in the actions—I have not offered you money to come on my side or sent any one to intimidate your witnesses—I went to Mr. Hammond's, not to intimidate him, but to ascertain if he lived there—Mr. Cooper, my solicitor, took out a summons against Joy for an assault; the summons was adjourned six times because I was ill—I did not employ you to make my will, you were the attesting witness—at the time the distraint was in, on 8th January, I did not send down to your wife some chairs, a timepiece, and some bedding, asking her to protect them—I was never bound over to keep the peace—you did not tell me when you put the lease into my hands that it was worthless, or that it might be worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you did not tell me that it had been out of your possession six years—you made a charge against me at the police-court about this table and got me locked up—I was not locked up at Warwick for pawning stays—I have never charged men with indecent assaults—I have not had a good many solicitors.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re examined</hi>. It was in December last year that the prisoner locked me up about the table, the very day after the bill was preferred against him—he appeared before the Magistrate and charged me with stealing the table, but the Magistrate discharged me immediately.</p>

               <p>years of age—in December, 1876, we were living at 298, Kennington Road—there was a money box there, I had the key of it—I remember seeing the prisoner there on one occasion; I opened the box, I left mamma to take out the money; there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, I believe, but I did not notice exactly what money it was—I am sure the prisoner was there at the time, he brought a deed wrapped up in paper—I remember having some money in an envelope to go and pay some taxes, I can't say how much money there was, the prisoner had it, he said he would go and pay the taxes—I was living with my mother, at 98, Fleet Street, at the time she was ill—the prisoner and his wife and daughter were there—mamma nearly always provided the food for the house, or gave them the money for it—I saw the lease afterwards, mamma had it.</p>

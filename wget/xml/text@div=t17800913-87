On the 31st of August the prisoner came to my house, between seven and eight o'clock at night; he went backwards; the fiddle and bow were in the parlour, the door of which opens into the passage that leads into the yard; I saw them there not a minute before the prisoner came in; I missed them as soon as he was gone; I pursued him, but could not find him; I took him about an hour after at a publick-house, and charged a constable with him. I was informed by a person that the prisoner went into the Coach and Horses, a publick-house in Shug-lane; I went there, and the woman of the house delivered to me the violin and bow.</p>

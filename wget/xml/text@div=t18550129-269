                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. On the morning of Sun<lb></lb>day, 21st Jan., I received information respecting Mr. Roberts's farm at Southall, in the precinct of Norwood, in Middlesex—it is called Waxlow Farm—I went there with Sergeant Mansell, and found one window had been broken clean out—the cellar flap had been forced up—that cellar com<lb></lb>municates with the whole body of the house—the wine cellar door had been forced open, as it appeared, by a crow bar—the hinges were broken off—the lock had been broken off the door of the kitchen and the door was open—I ascertained the nature of the property which had been removed—there were some slight footmarks in the snow leading from the house towards the canal—it was then about 12 o'clock—in consequence of some other informara<lb></lb>tion, I gave directions to Neave and Mansell to search a boat on the Grand Junction Canal.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, T</hi> 1). On Sunday, 21st Jan., I received directions from the last witness, and I went to Paddington with Neave—we arrived at Paddington about 5 o'clock—I think there were about a dozen boats lying in the canal—we went on board a boat called the Highgate—the prisoner and three other men were sitting in the cabin—I asked them whose boat it was—a man of the name of Pope, who ran away, said it was Mr. Tilsley's—I told them I wanted to search the boat, in consequence of a robbery that had taken place during the night near Southall (I was in uniform)—Pope said he knew nothing about it, and he pointed to the pri<lb></lb>soner,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290039"></xptr>
               <p>and said, "That is the captain"—I do not remember that the prisoner said anything—Pope came out of the cabin and made towards shore—he was going across the other vessels—I told him to stop, and not to run away—he continued going across, and got away—I had not searched the boat at that time—I did afterwards, and found in it 12 planes, 24 centre bits, 1 pair of plyers, 1 chisel, 1 screwdriver, 1 mallet, 3 saws, 1 hammer, 3 copper tea kettles, 1 lantern, 5 brushes, 2 meat covers, 12 bottles of wine, 1 Bible, 1 leg of pork, 1 goose, 1 piece of salt beef, 1 loaf, 1 piece of cheese, 5 half-pounds of butter, 54 pieces of China, 1 candlestick, 3 sheets, 9 table cloths, 36 pieces of linen towels, 2 pillow cases, 7 satin chair covers, 1 roll of satin, 1 dressing gown, 7 cotton chair covers, 7 odd pieces of print, 7 drinking glasses and tumblers, and 4 other glasses—they were all in the cabin—the linen was in a drawer under the bed, the greater portion of it—I think there were some strewed about—I am not aware that any of the articles I first mentioned are used in housebreaking.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 94). I have known the prisoner about two years and a half—he was potboy at Mr. Tilsley's beer shop, at Heston, near Norwood, which is rather over two miles from Waxlow Park—he afterwards worked in Mr. Tilsley's brick field—the last two months he was boating in the <hi rend="italic">Highgate</hi>, one of Mr. Tilsley's boats—Mr. Tilsley, of Heston, who keeps the beer shop, has a brother who is a brick maker—on 21st Jan., I went with the last witness to Paddington—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Highgate</hi>—I found the prisoner, and Henry Pope, and two others—one was named Collins—I do not know the name of the other—Collins went with the prisoner; he belonged to the boat—Pope went off, and while he was pursued, the other two escaped—the prisoner was the last who came out of the cabin—I was standing near the stern of the boat—I apprehended the prisoner; the other two were too quick for me to stop them—when I seized the prisoner he was not out of the boat; he had got out of the cabin, and seemed as if he was going to turn himself round to get out—the <hi rend="italic">Highgate</hi> and most of the boats were loaded with bricks—I looked in the boat, and saw some property—I asked the prisoner where it came from; he said he did not know—I looked in the cabin, and saw the parts of three copper tea kettles broken in pieces—I said to the prisoner, "What have you done with the goose?"—he said, "You can look in there," pointing to the stern end of the boat—I asked him for the key, and he gave it me—Mansell had not returned at that time—I unlocked the place with the key, and found a dead goose, a leg of pork, some beef, some butter, a lump of cheese, and a half quartern loaf—I set those things upon the cabin, and when the sergeant came back he searched the boat—he found in my presence the things he has mentioned—after we had packed up the things, we took the prisoner to the station and locked him up—Waxlow farm is from three quarters of a mile to a mile from the Canal—the boats stop at Northall Bridge—it is not a stopping station—there is a public house where they can put their horses up.</p>

               <p>—he said, "I know I am the captain of the boat, and I must take the brunt of it"—that was after Mansfield had stated what he came about—he did not say, "We suspect the stolen property is in this boat"—he said, "We must search your boat"—it was after that that the pri<lb></lb>soner gave the key, and said, "Search the boat"—Henry Pope has been along with the prisoner on board that boat for about three weeks—another of the men has also been a labourer on board—the third man was quite a stranger—the prisoner did not say, when he gave me the key, "If there is any stolen property here, I know nothing about it"; but said they ran away like cowards, and he must take the brunt of it—I said I had heard a great deal about Pope, and he had run off like a coward to leave him—the pri<lb></lb>soner said, "Yes, he is a coward; and he has left me to bear the brunt of it"—I opened the locker, or whatever it was, where I found the property, with the key the prisoner gave me—I do not know that there was a duplicate key to that locker—I never heard there was—the prisoner did not tell me there was another key, and one of the men had run away with it—he was feeling for the key about half a minute, and he said, "I suppose they have taken it with them"; and then he said, "Oh, no; here it is"—the chest, or whatever it may be called, was locked, and I unlocked it with the key—I am sure it was locked; I saw the padlock hanging on it—after I found the property, I think the prisoner did make some remark that he did not know how it came there—he did make the remark in the boat—he did not say it must have been put there while he was absent, or that it was put in without his knowledge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Do you know that the prisoner's defence is an alibi? A. I have been told so - I did not fix the time before I knew that; I can only say the gas was lighted, and it was dark; I had never seen him before - we sell almost every thing at our shop; I was not at that time aware that a bill of this nature should have a stamp - I never saw one like it before - the name of Westfield and Co. is printed; I did not particularly examine it that night - I know this happened after twilight.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutors. On Tuesday, the 3rd of April, I was behind the counter when this bill was brought - Mr. Venables stood nearly opposite me, with his face towards the door; I am certain the prisoner is the person who presented something to Mr. Venables - it was talked of as a bill; I only saw a paper in his hand, which seemed rather dirty - I heard him ask for change; Mr. Venables said it was not customary to do so; I heard nothing else - Mr. Venables sent him up to the desk, and Olney asked him if he would have notes or sovereigns; I saw the prisoner write something on the opposite counter to where I was, and give the paper he wrote on to Olney, who delivered some sovereigns to him; he was in the shop nearly five minutes - there was a gas-light just over where he stood; I saw the prisoner again at Hatton-garden on the Saturday following, and knew him directly I saw him - I cannot say at what time he came, it was after we had our tea; we generally finish tea about a quarter past five or six o'clock - it appeared to be quite dark out of doors; our shop closes between eight and nine - we have no fixed time; I cannot say when we closed that night - I think the prisoner came after six and before nine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Will you swear it was after six o'clock? A. I cannot be certain, but should think so - I never heard Mr. Venables say at what time it was; I never heard him say it was half-past four or five o'clock - the prisoner's witnesses were examined at the office; Mrs. Courtney and her husband, and others - I cannot say whether they were sworn.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Was there more than one examination? A. Yes, three - Mr. Venables was examined the first time; I cannot say whether the prisoner's witnesses were examined at the second or third.</p>
               <p>DANIEL SUTTON OLNEY. I am cashier to Messrs. Venables. On the 3rd of April, by Mr. Venables' desire, I gave twenty sovereigns for this bill to the prisoner, who wrote his name and address on the back of it, on the counter, in my sight - I did not notice him so as to know him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Perhaps you can give us some notion as to what hour it was? A. I think it was past six o'clock - I had come from tea about half an hour, and generally finish tea about six.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BARFORD. I am a Policeman. On Saturday, the 7th of April. I received the prisoner in charge; Mr. Venables was examined at the first and last examination - there were not three; Mr. Venables was examined on the Saturday, the prisoner was remanded till the Saturday following, but nothing was done on account of Mr. Phillips' absence - he was remanded till Monday; there was no examination then, and he was remanded till Thursday the 19th, and then committed; on the day the prisoner was apprehended, he wrote his name and address in my book, here it is (reads) - "

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who was that gentleman? A. A person from Henrietta-street; Mr. Venables fixed the time at the first examination at between five o'clock and eight; I never heard him fix a nearer time - I think five or six witnesses were examined for the prisoner; I cannot say whether they were sworn - I think they were; Mr. Laing ordered the prisoner to be admitted to bail, in 500l. himself, and four sureties of 250l. - he was not bailed.</p>

I have had no opportunity of explaining the circumstance; the Magistrate behaved very harsh to me, and public reports have gone forth as if I was guilty of the crime; the inconsistency of the nature of the bill must he evident to any gentleman concerned in trade; on the day I was arrested, I was going to Henrietta-street, Brunswick-square, to bring my friend to the Adelphi theatre, for which I had orders, and was going into Brunswick-square, when I felt a touch on my shoulder, and on turning round, I saw a person who was a perfectstranger to me; he requested my name - I asked his object, and when he persevered, I said it was Brennan, and that I lived over the water, thinking he would then perceive his mistake - he says he met me, but he could not, he was behind me; on his stopping me we had a scuffle - I told him to loose my arm; he said he would not - I refused to go with him, not knowing where he would take me; at the examination, as far as I recollect, he named the time to be five o'clock, or thereabouts - I never saw the bill, and my witnesses will prove my occupation during the whole day.</p>

            ; we live at No. 6, North-terrace, Marsh-gate, Lambeth. I have known the prisoner seven years; he is a landscape-painter, and came over here the latter end of January, at my husband's invitation - he boarded at our house, but did not sleep there; his painting-room was in our house - he has held situations of trust. I remember all the transactions of Tuesday, the 3rd of April; he breakfasted with us that morning, about ten o'clock - he was engaged, finishing a landscape; he went to his painting-room after breakfast- we dined about five o'clock; (the prisoner, my husband, and myself, in the back parlour.) and after dinner removed to the front parlour - my husband is a reporter and attends the Houses of Parliament; his hour of attendance that week was seven o'clock - the prisoner was in our company from five o'clock till my husband went to his duty; I have two children - I did not miss the prisoner from the fire for ten minutes from dinner time till half-past ten at night; I did not miss him at all, but he could not be away ten minutes without my knowing it; there was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183205170111"></xptr>little coolness at that time between my sister-in-law and Mr. Courtney - she came to the house that evening about half-past eight or nine o'clock, and the prisoner saw her part of the way home, at half-past ten o'clock - she lived with us, but was going to a friend of hers, who was in trouble; Needham, a mason, called at our house about seven o'clock that night, and waited about an hour for Mr. Courtney's return - Mr. Courtney went out again between nine and ten o'clock, and did not return till twelve; I am sure the prisoner did not go out.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You have known the prisoner seven years - have you been in Ireland part of that time? A. I have been more than three years in London, but my husband corresponded with him - we are not related. On the 3rd of April the prisoner was very ill - my sister-in-law being out all day, and my servant having left, I was obliged to do every thing myself, and I made soup for him; my servant had left two months before, and my sister-in-law came to stop with me; I have a servant now - she came about three weeks ago; my sister-in-law had been out all that day, and all the night before, which made the day remarkable to me, having so much to do; and I had been ill and was weak then; my husband was learning drawing of the prisoner - I was examined at Hatton-garden at the last examination; my husband and the prisoner drank gin-and-water after dinner, but before dinner they were drawing.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was what you said at the office taken down? A. If it was it was done quickly; I think my husband went out when our clock struck seven, and we keep it ten minutes too fast, on purpose, to give him warning; I was out of the room at times for five minutes; the prisoner was lounging on the sofa, and reading something - I have seen the prisoner write, and believe the paper produced to be written by him; I was asked about that at the office, and said I did not think it was his, but it was then in the clerk's desk, and I only saw the J.B., but when I took it in my hand, and looked at it, I said it was his.</p>
               <p>MRS. BYRNE. I am Mr. Courtney's sister. On Monday, the 2nd of April, I went to see a friend, whose husband had been drowned on the Sunday, and staid all night with her; I returned to my brother's about twenty minutes past seven o'clock on Tuesday evening, and on going into the garden in front of the house, and looking in at the window, I saw the prisoner sitting there; I saw nobody else, but he appeared in the act of speaking, and thinking it might be my brother, I was afraid to rap, as there was a coolness between us; I did not go in - I returned in about ten minutes; I still saw the prisoner in the act of talking, and returned up the terrace again; I returned to the house about half-past eight o'clock, and then went into the kitchen - I afterwards heard the door shut, and went into the parlour; my brother had just gone - nobody but the prisoner was there; he was on the sofa, and did not appear in good health; I remained there till half-past ten o'clock, and he then left with me; I went to Mrs. Torren's, New-street, St. James' - he came with me as far as Charing-cross.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you live with Mr. Courtney? A. Yes, since about a week after Christmas; the servant had just gone - I assisted Mrs. Courtney; there are short venetian blinds to the parlour window - they were folded too, but not turned; I swear the prisoner was there.</p>

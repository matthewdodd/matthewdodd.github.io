                  </hi>. I live at 6, Thurloe-place, Lower Norwood, and am the owner in conjunction with my son of 5, Farringdon-street, in the parish of St. Sepulchre—this is the lease (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 28<hi rend="italic">th February,</hi> 1813, <hi rend="italic">from James sivewrite, for twenty-one years</hi>)—it being empty in November, I engaged Mr. Martin to let it, and in consequence of what he told me, I met Perry at his office on 23d November—Perry proposed to take the house for the remainder of my lease, about fifteen years, paying 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium—I bargained for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he said that he was a printer in a large way of business, at 12, Milbank-street, Westminster, and that he wanted the house for a printing establishment, to put in expensive machinery to a large amount, and that he should want several hundreds to get it ready—he said that he was going to commence almost immediately—I ultimately agreed to take 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by three bills, and he signed this agreement (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), in which he describes himself as a stationer of 12 Milbank-street, Westminster—Henry Baker was keeping the house for me at the time—I gave Perry possession on 25th November—it was not in a very good state as to the leads, but all the other part was in good repair—there was lead on the roof, and piping in the drain-pipes and water closets—there was also a large iron safe fixed, belonging to the owner of the house, which was worth not less than 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; also some mahogany swing doors with plate glass, which cost not less than 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with the fittings on them—I told Perry that the iron safe did not belong to me, but to the owner; I did not tell him the owner's name—in consequence of information I went there six or eight days afterwards, and the lead was every bit gone, the water closet pipes pulled down from the second floor to the bottom, and every thing was taken away—the lead across the roof from the back to the front, what is called the flushing, was gone, and also a considerable quantity of the lead on the roof, and the rest of it was turned up ready to move away—I also missed the copper from the kitchen, and the range, the tank, and the lead pipes connecting it—a lock was taken off, and I believe the doors would have gone in a day or two—the damage done was not less than 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they tore the place to pieces.</p>

Q.</hi> Did not I say that the kitchen was as dark as a grave, and was of no use, and request it to be cleared? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You said that you wanted to put your machinery there; I said that the back part had been excavated—if it was necessary to take anything away to make any alterations for your business, that is one thing, but you were not to steal anything—neither of these three bills (<hi rend="italic">produced by Perry</hi>) is due; the first is not due till 28th January—I had borrowed 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the lease formerly—I did not tell you that I had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. borrowed on the house then, but 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing—when I went to the premises on the 7th or 8th, I saw some carpenters boarding up the place where the iron safe had been taken from the wall—the only fixtures put up were two desks put there as a blind—there was something of a counter brought in in the morning, and taken out before the evening—I saw the painters doing something to the front, but it was all deception—I ordered them to leave off work—I did not authorize the prisoner to do so, that I might get the key.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 49, Skinner-street, Snow-hill, and am an auctioneer—No. 5, Farringdon-street was put into my hands in August, and remained so till 20th November, when Browning called on me and said that he had been sent by a gentleman sitting in his chaise, to make enquiries about the terms of the house—I asked who the gentleman was—he said Mr. Perry of 12, Milbank-street, Westminster, a wholesale stationer and printer—I gave him the terms and he went away—he returned on the same day, and told me that Mr. Perry had looked the house over, and he would call on Monday to make me an offer—Browning called on the Monday, and made me an offer on behalf of Perry, in consequence of which I communi<lb></lb>cated with Mr. Robinson, who met Perry at my place on the following day, the 23d—Browning came again in the morning—he wanted to have an answer because they were about other premises, and I promised him an answer about the middle of the day—I wrote to Mr. Robinson—he came on the Tuesday morning to see if I had got an answer from the landlord—Mr. Robinson had not then arrived—he called again a second time, and Mr. Robinson was there—he then went away and sent Perry—I was present when the agreement was drawn up—I had occasion to go into the other office, and Mr. Robinson told me there was no occasion to go about the reference, he was quite satisfied with Perry—I drew up a temporary agree<lb></lb>ment by Mr. Robinson's request, so that they might be bound to the</p>

               <p>bargain by Thursday, as Mr. Robinson did not wish the matter to stand open till Thursday without a written agreement—that memorandum is here—in Mr. Robinson's presence the agreement was concluded—I saw the state of the premises before they were let in—I did not go outside the top of the house, but the inside was correct—I saw the safe and the mahogany doors—I went some time afterwards, and found that they had all been removed—the lead at the top of the house had been loosened—some was taken away and the rest left ready to be taken—the flushings were gone, and the water-closet pipes.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Perry. Q.</hi> Was it a week before I took possession that you went over the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was within a few days—there was a kitchen range—I cannot say that I noticed a copper, but I believe there was one—I did not see that any lead was gone, because I only stood on top of the ladder and looked out; but I saw that it was cut, and saw that the flushing had been removed—water had come through a good space in the ceiling, which was very wet—I will not swear that the lead flat was touched—I heard most all of the conversation between you and Mr. Robinson—I know that a conversation took place relative to your making alterations; I do not recollect the exact words—there was some conversation about the front being cut into by the late tenant, and you asked what had become of the plate glass which had been removed to make way for the door—a perfect door was put in the middle, and the glass was taken away—I saw Browning after I had been over the premises with Mr. Robinson—he came to see if I had any message for you some days after possession had been given—that was the day that Browning was given into custody in the afternoon, as I understand—I had some conversation with Browning respecting the alterations and repairs—the shop ceiling was, certainly, in tenantable repair when you took possession—the water had been through a portion of one side, but the ceiling was not almost coming down.</p>

I am a carpenter and fixture-dealer, at 40, London-road—I first saw Perry on 28th November; he called on me and bargained with me for two desks, price three guineas—they were sent to 5, Farringdon-street—I went there and saw him—he showed me a small partitioning, and said he was going to make extensive alterations there, and asked me what I would allow him for the partitioning—there were some mahogany doors belonging to it—I offered him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the whole, which he agreed to take—he made me out an account, and they were removed to my place—a few days afterwards, he showed me an iron safe, which, he said, was of no use to him, and said he would allow me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the account for it—I said that I had no objection to that, but I would not give 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money for it—it was taken to my place—I repaired the walls, washed, stopped, and whited the ceilings, fixed up two desks, and made good some scrambling under the stairs—my foreman was not there—I had a carpenter doing the repairs—no one was instructed to go on the roof to my knowledge—I saw Browning there, but Perry was the man who I did business with.</p>

Q.</hi> When you went over the house to see the repairs, did you see a copper, a kitchen range, and a cistern. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I only looked after my own business—the partition had been altered several times, and three parts of it was deficient—the iron chest was an old-fashioned one, and would be of no consequence in these days—two of the iron partitions were taken out of it, and the key of the door was broken, and one key was lost—it was cast-iron—my bill came to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the partitioning and glass doors which I took down, I should be most glad to reinstate for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the gentleman has got the hinges, but that is part of what I would reinstate for 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Browning stated that he had taken the first floor of you, and asked me to give him an estimate for making a sash door, and one or two other alterations on the first floor—you did not ask me to give you an estimate for fixing the new water-closet—something was said about moving the water-closet to the leads at the back of the house—there was a labouring man working for you during the time you were there—if he was not there in the morning, he was there in the afternoon.</p>

I am a lead and glass merchant of 118, St. John-street—I know the prisoners—I can speak confidently to Browning, and I believe I have seen Perry twice or three times—I first saw Perry about December 1st.—I cannot say what he brought on that occasion, but he brought me old lead on several occasions, ordinary old gutters—he may have brought me some pipe, but I do not remember it—he brought me thin sheet lead as if it had been used for roofing and flushing—he gave the name of Reeve, Endell-street—on Wednesday 8th December, Browning brought two gutters weighing 1 cwt.—I weighed it, sent into the counting-house, and I believe he took the money for it—I am the son of the head of the firm.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any flour and bread any time - A. I found some flour and bread in Millis's basket.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason have you to charge him with stealing this flour and bread - A. From the evidence of the watchman. I found it in his basket about half past nine in the morning. He took his bread from the shop, in a barrow. My brother manages my business; he sent him out with the bread. I was not in the shop. On the 5th of December, about eight o'clock, I was sitting at my desk, opposite the shop window.

            . I am a baker. I live near Mr. Howell. On Saturday morning, the 5th of December, about twenty minutes before three o'clock, before day-light, hearing some footsteps in the street, I went out. I observed the watchman coming up the lane with a quantity of bread under his coat. I asked him how he came out so soon in the morning. He said, I have got some of the bakers bread below, but you must not take any notice. The watchman's name is Wyegate. I watched Wyegate to his door, about four doors from our house. He tapped three times with a stick upon the pavement, and the door was opened. He went into the house occupied by Mrs. Carter, where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Howell what you had seen - A. I did, about eight o'clock in the morning. Mr. Howell followed the prisoner about half past nine, up to the Queen Elms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Howell follow the prisoner - A. Yes, and Wyegate, the watchman, was talking to him at the Queen Elms. When Mr. Howell came up to look at his bread, he found four quartern loaves, and this flour, more than the prisoner had out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what Wyegate had - A. He had a great quantity of bread under his great coat. I saw the top of two quartern loaves; it made a great bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Howell charge the prisoner with having more loaves and flour than the fair delivery - A. Yes. Millis said, the flour that he had in his basket, Mr. Lockey's young man gave it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Lockey - A. A baker, in Lisle-street, and when the young man was fetched, he denied it; in the hearing of the prisoner, he denied giving him the loaves and the flour. He then said, a stranger gave it him, and he was to leave it at the Queen Elms public-house for the stranger, and he was to have a glass of gin for leaving it. Wyegate was in custody a week before he said anything about the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a constable of the parish of St. Luke, Chelsea. On Saturday, the 5th of December, I went along with Mr. Howell to the Queen Elms. Mr. Howell took the bread out of Millis's basket, and underneath there were two parcels of flour tied up in one bag, and a string between the two; underneath there was a bill of parcels where to take the flour to. Millis came back. Mr. Howell asked him how he had come by that. Millis said, that Lockey's man had given it him. Dick at Lockey's was produced before the prisoner. Dick said he knew nothing at all about it. Millis then said, some other person had given it him to leave at the Queen Elms until called for. Then Mr. Howell gave charge of the watchman. I took Wyegate to Queen-square office. He was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner - A. He was at large, and then in the afternoon, I was ordered to see after Millis. I searched the watchman's lodgings with an officer. We found a quartern loaf there; it was taken to Queen-square office. One of the men came forward, and said he believed it to be Mr. Howell's. Millis was brought forward. He was asked if he had anybody to speak for him. He said, he knew Mr. Dyson. I took him home with me until Tuesday, and then I resigned him up. Wyegate was in custody eleven days. He was released to give evidence against Millis.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square office. On the 5th of December, I searched the lodging of Wyegate, there I found concealed a quartern loaf behind the curtain. It was a new one. I went along with Dyson in search of Millis. I found Millis at a public-house, at Knightsbridge. I took him out, and told him I had a charge against him at the suit of his master, for stealing bread and flour. He seemed at first astonished, and denied it. He said, that Wyegate had been assisting him in removing the bread from the bakehouse to the shop. Wyegate was in custody. He was discharged on purpose of becoming an evidence against Millis.</p>

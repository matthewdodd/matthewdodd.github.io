I was on duty on the morning of the 23rd July, in New Cross Road, Deptford, about 12.50—I saw the prisoner hurrying along towards Greenwich—I stopped him and asked him now he came by the coats—he was carrying two, and the top coat he was wearing—he said he bought them—I asked him where, he said Croydon Wide—I said I was not satisfied with his statement, and I should have to take him into custody for unlawful possession of the coats—he asked me what station I would take him to, and I said Lewisham, and with the assistance of another constable I took him—on searching him I found 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in bronze, two keys, and a box of silent matches—the two keys were found in the lining of the inside coat he is wearing now—the latch key opened Mr. Spicer's door.</p>

I said I did not mind, I was going that road, He told me to wait at the Centurion while he went round the corner, and he brought a young woman with him. He told me to go up the road, and said he would catch me before I got 50 yards, and he was talking to the young woman. I went along thinking he would come, and when t got up to Lewisham Road a policeman stopped me. I looked back, but could not see the man. The policeman said "Where did you get the coats?" I said they belonged to me, not knowing what to lay at the time.</p>

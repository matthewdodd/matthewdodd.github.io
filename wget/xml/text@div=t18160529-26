            . I am a widow. I know the prisoner at the bar. I never knew him before he took my shawl, on the 15th of April; I was standing at my door in <placeName id="t18160529-26-crimeloc134">Sun-yard, Nightingale lane</placeName>

The one broke the strings of the other, as I suppose; the shawl was cotton, I valued it at four shillings. I had never seen the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181605290017"></xptr>before; he ran away as fast as he could, and I ran after him, and sung out stop thief. Immediately after, I ran against him. I saw him again as soon as the watchman attacked him, and took him to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a patrole. On the 15th of April, I was standing at the corner of Nightingale-lane, and heard a cry of stop thief. I saw the prisoner making towards me; he was running fast; if I had been behind him, I could not have come up to him; it had just gone twelve o'clock. I caught hold of him, and we both fell, and he chucked a shawl and apron on the ground; I have them here; he did not throw them any distance from him.</p>

            . I am a Scotchman. I know the prisoner. I recollect the Sunday he was taken into custody; I parted with him at about half past ten; I left him in Sun-yard, Nightingale-lane, with the woman of the house, the prosecutrix; he had money when he went up stairs in that house; I am quite sure it was that house, kept by that woman,(pointing to the prosecutrix,) I knew the other woman who went up stairs with the prisoner. I remained in the house after he went up stairs with the woman, and after he came down again; he was not above a quarter of an hour with the girl, and they came down quarrelling; it was near ten and eleven o'clock when he came down, as near as I can recollect. The other young man and I went out, and left him quarrelling with the old woman, the prosecutrix. I am quite sure I left the prisoner taking about ten minutes with her, before I left the house.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix, Re-examined. It is all false; I never spoke to him in my life.</p>

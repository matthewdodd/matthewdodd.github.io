On the 17th of July, about four o'clock in the morning, I and my wife left the house - we returned about half-past five; all was then safe; I was the last person in the house. I fastened it up safe, shutters and all; I locked the door, and took the key; the stockings were in a box in the bed-room - there are but two rooms in the house. I returned between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and found the door open (I had given the key to my wife) - I watched, and saw the two prisoners come out of the door, and go round the corner of the house; I jumped over my garden fence, went on the other side, and met them coming round. I collared one, pushed the other against the house, and secured him - I asked what they wanted there - they said they came to ask for some water; I asked why they came for water when the garden-gate and house were fastened up. I dragged them into the house, and got a person to hold them while I examined, and found a box in the bed-room broken open, and things laying about the bed; the stockings were taken out of the box, and laid about the room - they are worth 5s.; I left nobody in the house. The door had been forced open by an iron wrench.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife - he gave me the key. The box was safe when I went out. I came home after the prisoners were in custody, and found the trunk broken open; I picked up the staple of the lock - I found three pairs of stockings under my bed - they had been taken out of the box - another pair were on the bed; property above 5s. value had been moved.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MULLINS' Defence. We were going to Edgware to look for work, and asked a man where we could get a drop of water - he said over in his garden was a well - we got over, but could find no well; this man came and asked what we wanted, and swore he would kill us - he was quite drunk.</p>

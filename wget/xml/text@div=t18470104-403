               <p>where I live—I went towards the Colonel's Pheasant cover, with Field and his son—I saw the foot<lb></lb>steps of two persons—the snow was on the ground—I traced them into the cover, and found the prisoner and another person there—the prisoner had &amp; horse-pistol, and the other a short gun—they ran away, and we pursued them both—I was near enough to the prisoner to hit him with my stick—I was within a yard or two of him—he then said, "Shoot the b—r," or "b—rs"—I was about to take him into custody—he turned round and <hi rend="italic">snicked the pistol</hi>

                  </hi> My father is keeper to Colonel Wood, at Littleton. I was with Mansell and my father last Sunday evening, at Apsley Copse, and joined in pursuit of the two men—I saw Mansell come up to the prisoner, who turned round and snicked his pistol at him—he was within three or four yards of him—I saw a flash come from the pistol—he ran a little way and then chucked the pistol down—I saw it picked up—this produced is it.</p>

                  </hi> I am serjeant of the Sunbury police. About ten o'clock last Sunday evening, on my return from my rounds I met Mansell on the road to the station with the prisoner—this pistol was afterwards brought to me—I examined it—it was loaded with a full charge of powder—the which I drew out—I found a piece of paper in the pan and some powder—the pan was up and the cock down—it was produced at the station, and the pri<lb></lb>soner said that was the pistol he had dropped—I examined it about three quarters of an hour after it was found—I did not see it found—if three was no stray powder about the pan, I suppose the paper in the pan would have prevented it going off—the flint might have gone through the paper.</p>

                  </hi> I am master of St. Pancras' work house—the pri<lb></lb>soner was admitted there as a pauper in Nov. last—he was there till 27th Nov.—he and another person made an application to me between eight and nine o'clock that morning—the prisoner came up with two cans containing milk porridge—he held out one of the cans to me, and said, "This is thin, it is not fit to eat, it is not like that in this other can which is sent to the men's hall"—I examined the cans and could see no difference—I referred him to the store-keeper—in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards my attention was called to the passage—I went there and found the prisoner and some twelve or fourteen others—they had left their ward, which is situated at the other end of the house—they came into the passage up of the office—the prisoner said the porridge was not fit to eat, it was hogwash, and pig's milk, and he would not have it, he would have better, or he would know the rea<lb></lb>son why—a man named Miles was more violent than the prisoner—I tried to quiet them and could not—I asked if any two men would come forward, and they would not—I put my hand on Miles, and said if he was not quiet I would lock him up—he threw himself down and kicked me on my legs—I put my hands down to take hold of him, and the prisoner and other closed me round and got him from me—I sent for two constables and told them to take Miles and lock him up—I went out with them—I then came back and saw the prisoner in the centre of the room—I pointed to him and said, "Take that man"—the moment I said it, he made a blow in my face with a can, which cut my lip through, fro the nostril down to the bottom, loosened four of my teeth, lacerated my under lip, and swelled my jaw and chin—I was five days unable to eat anything but spoon meat—I saw the prisoner's hand under his jacket, and the moment I spoke he struck me with it.</p>

                  </hi> I am store-keeper at St. Pancras' work house—the pri<lb></lb>soner and another man applied to me on the morning of 27th Nov. about the milk porridge—I examined what they had got—the same porridge was served in their wards as was in the men's hall—there was no difference—I took</p>

               <p>them into the scullery to endeavour to explain it to them—I was present when the master ordered Miles to be taken into custody—he threw himself down—the master was pushed away, and Miles was rescued—I afterwards heard the master order the prisoner to be taken into custody—on one had touched him at that time—he was standing in the middle of the room, with his hand under his jacket—the moment the master pointed him out he struck with this can with his right hand backwards, with all the violence in his power, and struck the master on the lip—it is a pint and a half can, which the men use for their breakfast porridge—Mr. Eaton was severely wounded—I wondered he did not fall down, but he did not.</p>

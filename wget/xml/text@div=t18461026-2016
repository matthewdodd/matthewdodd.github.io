                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Slack, hairdresser, of Sloane-street. On the 2nd of Sept. the prisoner Miller came to the shop and asked for a quarter of a pound of soap—I said it was only sold in packets—she went to the door and talked to Tustin, and they both came into the shop together—I produced one packet of soap, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Miller gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it</p>

               <p>On the 7th of November, at about twelve o'clock at noon, I went with Mr. Clarke and some more of the officers from Bow-street, to an alley near <placeName id="t17801206-38-crimeloc198">Black-boy alley</placeName>

When I opened the door and entered the yard I saw the house door immediately shut. I ran up to the door and attempted to open it but could not; I went to the window  and I heard a noise in the inside; I called to the others who were at the door to break it open for the people were making their escape; the door was very strongly fastened and they could not force it open. I threw up the sash and jumped in at the window. When I got into the room the prisoner Williams was standing by the fire; I asked her what she meant by fastening the door; she said she did not know what we wanted. I went out into the stable; there were ten cart load of rubbish at least that had been dug out of the earth. Morant in examining the stairs that go up out of the kitchen, found two of the bottom steps loose; there were an hole made at the bottom of the stairs to go under ground by lifting off these steps; I pulled off my clothes directly and went down the hole and Mr. Clark followed me. There was on the left hand of the hole a small press for cutting out blanks; there was a candle burning by it and a sheet of copper in the press; farther on in the cellar which was a hole dug on purpose; there was a large press<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178012060036"></xptr> with a fly with dies in it for raising the impressions on farthings; there was another candle by that. These are the dies ( producing  them); there was a farthing between the dies finished, and a large quantity lying by in the cellar. Mr. Clark said he was sure they must be some where about. We lit a candle and examined round the cellar; Mr. Clark observed a hole under the foundation of the house farther into the ground; he called out, if there was any person in the hole they must speak and come out; there was no answer. I said take care I will fire a pistol into the hole and then they will be glad to come out. Upon that a voice very low cried out, for God's sake don't hurt me; help me out; and with a deal of difficulty we dragged Harpur out of the hole. We found in the cellar every implement for coining farthings or halfpence.</p>

               <p>I went to this house; Morant found a quantity of halfpence concealed under the floor which occasioned a closer search; at last he pulled up the bottom step of the stairs and there was a hole that went under the house fourteen feet deep, which had caused the house to sink six feet; we got down into the hole; and on the left hand there was a small press fixed for cutting out and a candle burning by it; and another press with the dies fixed and a farthing in the dies, and a candle burning; by that I was positive some persons must have made their escape, or were concealed in that place. I looked on the side of the large press and there was a hole that went into the shore; I looked there and saw the head of Mrs. Harpur, we got her out with difficulty; she had got in feet first, and that had jamm'd her clothes up to her waist, and she stuck fast; there must have been somebody at work within five minutes; the very handle of the press was warm at the time; there were places for three persons to work; one to feed the press and the others to work the fly and cut out the dies; she had on her working dress, a bed gown; her other clothes were in the parlour. We found in the parlour a die in the fire hot to strike the impression on another die.</p>
               <p>Court. Is not the working of the press very laborious and not fit for a woman? - It does not require much strength; it works round without any purchase, and the spring throws it up again. I was informed two men had made their escape.</p>

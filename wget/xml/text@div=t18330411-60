On the 12th of February I fastened the house up myself the last thing at night; the doors were locked, and the windows fastened - we went to bed at nine o'clock, and got up about half-past seven o'clock; we found the great gates open in front of the house - the doors and windows were all fastened; they had entered by a cellar flap in the garden, which had been fastened by nails - it was safe on the night of the robbery; we found it lifted up, and the nails wrenched out - it was large enough to admit a man; they had then got up stairs - the passage door was open; I missed the articles stated in the indictment - I have only found one shirt.</p>

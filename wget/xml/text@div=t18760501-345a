                  </hi>. I am now in the employment of a land agent in the Strand—in February, 1873, I saw an advertisement in the "Daily Telegraph," upon which I wrote to 31, Great Marlborough Street, and received a reply making an appointment—I then went to 31, Great Marlborough Street, and saw the prisoner—he told me he was in business with Mr. Lawrence, of Dublin, who had a large business there in Sackville Street, and kept sixteen clerks, and that he managed the London business, which was a branch of the Dublin business, and that they were auctioneers, house and estate and financial agents—he afterwards showed me a book full of blank deposit notes, and said that the clerks were so satified of their in<lb></lb>tegrity that they deposited monies with them for terms of three, six, and nine months, at various rates of interest, and allowed them to. use it in the business; in fact, that it was the nucleus of a bank—he opened the book and showed me perhaps a dozen counterfoils, on which were shown various large sums of money, purporting to have been so deposited by clerks—he asked me where I had been employed, and for my references, which I told him, and he said that there had been many applications for the situation, and as soon as he had made a selection he would write and let me know—he said that he should require security, as I should most likely have a good deal of money passing through ray hands, and that money must be deposited as security for my honesty, for which he would allow me 10 per cent, interest—I asked how he could afford to pay me 10 per cent, when money in the market, as a rule, brought only 5—he said that they had opportunities, as they lent money on bills of sale and turned the money over several times in the course of the year—I received this letter from the pri<lb></lb>soner afterwards—I know the writing; it is his signature—upon that I went to his office on 1st March for the purpose of being engaged—I depo<lb></lb>sited 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with him as security, and he gave me a receipt—he said that several of Mr. Laurance's clerks had absconded, and that he would take no more unless they deposited a cash security—he then drew up this letter, and submitted it to my father, who was with me:—"March 1st, 1873. Sir,—We hereby agree to engage you as a clerk in our office at a weekly salary! of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for twelve months, and we hereby acknowledge to have received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to bear interest at 10 per cent., to be repaid to you at the end of twelve months, should you leave our employ. Laurance and Garnier." (<hi rend="italic">Deposit not read:</hi> "This is to certify that Mr. C. C. Duriment has deposited with us 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., bearing interest at 10 per cent. This deposit note becomes dne on 1st March, 1874, and on that day we agree to pay the amount," &amp;c. Laurance and Garnier, Financial Agents.) I entered the employment, and received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for a time, but it began to fall off about July—the prisoner was at the office every day—I do not think the Bishopsgate office had been taken then—we were principally employed in looking through the papers and writing to people who advertised their property to let, to place it in our hands, and going to see people on financial matters—he got from other agents a payment of half commission if he could get certain arrangements made, and we had to go to solicitors and offer them another division of com<lb></lb>mision if they could carry out business with their clients—very few people came to the office except on such business as that—on 19th November I went to the prisoner with the other clerks, seven of us, I think—about four weeks', or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., of my salary was then overdue—we said that we must have some money, that he had given us no salary and we could not go on, and we should take criminal proceedings against him—he said that be</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187605010089"></xptr>
               <p>should pay us, but we must give him time; that Mr. Laurance was away in Sligo, I think, and he could not get a cheque from him—we got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each that day, and I think we got deposits of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and sometimes a half-crown afterwards, and we had another instalment of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Christmas—that was the only time we had a full week's salary at one time—he left on 23rd of February, 1874, and I did not see him at either place of business—I knew that a summons had been taken out against him—I did not see him again till 1st April, 1876, when he was in custody—I did not get my 110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when March 1st came round.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I could not write to Mr. Laurance to ascertain the truth of his statements, because you did not give mo his address—I made no in<lb></lb>quiries about your character or the stability of the firm—I think I under<lb></lb>stood that my 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be used in the business, but it was not stipulated in that particular manner—I was in your employ eleven months and three weeks and you owed me 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. salary when you left—I actually received 83<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and my salary for fifty-two weeks would be 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I only in three instances had to do anything which was a source of clear profit—I went to Carlisle about a mortgage on some mills, and to Southampton about a bill of sale, which was carried out, and to Holloway to make an inventory for another bill of sale, which was carried out—I remember Mr. Finch and Mr. Wood conjointly taking out a summons against you at Marlborough Street for obtaining money under false pretences—I do not think Mr. "Wood's money was due then—30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the only sum that passed through my hands—I recollect your engaging a clerk named Jennings, and a portion of his money being returned to him, because he wished to go;, he agreed to take 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in. return for his 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 367., I believe, it was, which he had lent you—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is his deposit note—he agreed to give you a full discharge for 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the consideration that you gave him a bill of sale on his furniture, which had another bill of sale on it at the time, so you told me—I was never in Reading Gaol, except as a visitor, and I deny telling you that I had Mr. M. Williams for my counsel—I did not look in the Directory for your address, because you have been using so many names that I did not think it at all likely that I should find you there in your own name—I did not tell you on the Saturday before 23rd February that the best thing you could do was to abscond, or that it would be the best thing for me and the other clerks—I deny saying that in the event of your not appearing a war<lb></lb>rant would be taken out against you, but that it could be arranged with me and the other clerks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I believed that Mr. Laurance resided in Dublin, and that there was a genuine branch of the business there, those facts amongst other reasons induced me in depositing the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—had I believed that the busi<lb></lb>ness which came to the office was the business only of solicitation I should not have deposited the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I deposited it as security for my honesty, although it might be used in the business.</p>

I remember the meeting of 19th November, 1873—Duriment and Harris threatened you with criminal proceedings—Lynch took out a summons against you—I think if time had been given you you would have been able to clear off these debts—none of these prosecutors' money was due when they joined Finch in 1874—I think you tried to do the best you could to do business—I know that your friend, Mr. Reynolds, assisted you, he brought you 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when the <hi rend="italic">rumpus</hi> was—I do not know that he lent you 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Stourbar, of Sunderland, helped you to the extent of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that was the current report in the office—I remember your going to Mr. Stourbar in Sunderland to get money, you brought some back, and gave all the clerks 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and you gave me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I found out your address about a fortnight before your arrest, Duriment informed me of it—he said nothing about taking proceedings against you—I called on you at your house—Mr. Heriott was a clerk in the office, and he was very offensive because I would not join in the prosecution, I preferred holding back—the clerks in the City office were very unwilling to work, because they could not get their wages—I remember a bill transaction of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., bat through the affairs of Spain no one would look at it, although it was a very good bill, for in the state of Spain it might be good to-day and bad to-morrow—I believe that had things gone on in the proper way and had the prosecutors behaved to you with a little more leniency you would have been able to meet all your engagements.</p>

Stubbs, and heard that the prisoner was highly respectable and strict in bis engagements—I saw no money pass through the City office—the pri<lb></lb>soner told me when he engaged me that a large amount of money would pass through my hands and that he required the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as security for my honesty—I do not want to go into how much he owes me—I have had bill transactions with him and another party and lent him money besides—if I knock off the advances I have made him I get nothing for wages—I first began to lend him money in 1873, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—the only bill transaction was one of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I discounted for him for a friend of his, but he drew a bill which included my salary; that was accepted by a Mr. Porter, and it includes 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. salary and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan; it became due in February, 1874—I have</p>

The Prisoner, in his defence, denied passing as the Hon. Mr. Gdrnier, or as Mr. Webster, but admitted that he was acting for Mr. Webster. Her stated that his partner, Mr. Laurance, was absent in America surveying some mines in Chicago, which they had entered into an agreement to purchase and bring out as a company. He complained that his business had, been ruined by sum<lb></lb>monses being taken out against him by the prosecutors and others before their money was due, whereas if they had waited till it was due ke should have been prepared to pay it; and argued that the fact of the money being placed with him at interest, proved that he had a right to make what use of it he liked; but that even if he had rendered himself liable to a prosecution for misappropriating the money, that would not make him guilty of unlawfully obtaining it; that he had borrowed money to keep the business going, which he would not have done if he had been acting fraudulently; that with the exception of Somers, who was dismissed for neglecting his work, lie had continued-to pay the clerks' salaries for twelvemonths, when he could easily have found excuses for dismiss<lb></lb>ing them if so inclined; that having dismissed Finch for opening his private letters and insulting him, he set the other clerks on to prosecute him.

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a serjeant in the North Middlesex Supplementary Militia: Shillie made a confession to me, and positively said, that he took thirty-two pair of shoes; I never saw the man in my life before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What had you said to him to make him confess this? - A. I asked him plain, did he take these shoes; he said, yes, thirty-two pair.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did not you say it would be better for him? - A. I did not indeed, I know better than that; thirty-two pair was his reply.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you make use of any threats? - A. No; I asked him where he got these shoes from; he said, he took them out of the chest, thirty-two pair; I will repeat it fifty-thousand times if your Worship pleases; thirty two pair; I speak very plain, Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say what chest? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Lord Almighty, Sir, it is the biggest lie that ever was told; he never was there any more than you were.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. (To Heaton.) Had you any conversation at any time with the prisoner, Finch? - A. Yes; on Tuesday the 4th of July, I went up, and said, did you buy any shoes; he said, I did; how many pair? twelve; what did you give for them? one guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of those shoes? - A. About three shillings and sixpence a pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any property upon Finch? - A. No; I asked him if he could know the man if he saw him again; he said, if he could see him again, and it was the man, he would swear to him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he swear to any man? - A. No; when he saw Shillie, he said, he could not positively swear to the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these shoes; where were they found? - A. In Mr. Saxton's back yard, under the wood. I took them from there after he was taken; I had the care of the shoes, they were of this sort.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is your Quarter-master? - A. Lieutenant Ormiston; he is answerable for the shoes.</p>
               <p>Shillie's defence. These shoes have been in a very large barn in Hounslow, this chest of shoes lies open to coachmen, hackney-coachmen, and post-boys, and anybody, to get to it; Mr. Saxton said, before the Justice, that he had found twenty pair of shoes; and that man that says I confessed before the Justice, knows very well that he was not there at all.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Saxton.) Q. Was Wilcox at the Justice's? - A. I was not there the second day myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. (To Goutly.) Q. Did you see Wilcox at the Justice's at all? - A. I believe the man was in the yard, but I do not recollect the Justice asking him any thing. Both <rs id="t17970712-49-verdict271" type="verdictDescription">

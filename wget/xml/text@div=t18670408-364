               <p>we got near the dock gates Selby said, "Don't go in yet, I have not finished; drive round the square"—Childs did drive round the square towards Cubitt Town, and then went back to the West India Docks—he said it would be too late to deliver it if he did not make haste, and if we took the case back it would be found out if it was weighed—Selby got down before we got into the docks—he said he was going to take a cab, that he was going home with the stuff, and he would sell it before night—he said he should like to take the one in the provender sack with him, because that was the best—he walked away with it on his back—Childs and I then delivered the case at the docks, as we delivered it I heard it rattle—he took the bundle out of the provender sack when we got to the stables—I saw Selby afterwards one morning talking to Childs against the stable, and he said, "If I ever went before Mr. Russell, what would I say about the parcel?"—I said I would say what I knew about it—he said, "Would you say you knew nothing about it if I gave you some money?"—I said, "Yes"—he gave me a shilling one night when Childs took the other bale to his house.</p>

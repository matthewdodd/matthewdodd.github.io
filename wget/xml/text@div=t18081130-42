               <p>Q. Had Mr. De Roufigney any carpet - A. Yes; it was taken up stairs in the room where the servant slept about a year ago, I saw it there and opened it; about a month ago, I dare say, I missed it. The prisoner's house was searched, I was present at the time; the prisoner was at home; she lived in Plough court, Fetter lane. We found in her lodgings some shirts, stockings, night caps, handkerchiefs, a pencil case, and a cork screw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know to whom they respectively belonged - A. Yes. They had all been in our house; I remember the time they were missing; I many times enquired of the prisoner respecting them; she said she did not know any thing of them, nor could she think what had become of them, it was very strange, she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Among the other articles was these a shirt belonging to Mr. Stoll - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner wash for Mr. Stoll - A. No. I enquired of her three months ago if she had any such shirt; she said no.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Mr. Roufigney keeps a pretty large school in Castle street - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner washed for him - at what time did you make the search at the prisoner's house - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300031"></xptr>It might be three weeks or a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. There had been an unfortunate quarrel between Mr. Roufigney and Mrs. Penn just before you went to search the house - A. I do not know of a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Now we will see whether you and I agree in the definition of a quarrel - do not you know that Mr. Roufigney owed her fifty or sixty pounds - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know positively - A. Yes, he may.</p>
               <p>Q. And she did not get her money - she threatened to arrest him - A. Yes; but I do not know that she found any difficulty in getting her money.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, she did threaten to arrest him and he then paid her - A. Yes; she had no occasion of taking these means.</p>
               <p>Q. She could not get it without - A. No, that is not right.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath had not she been applying week after week, and month after month - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. However he has paid her - A. He has paid her with money that he has not received; he has been a great friend to the woman; she agreed to give credit.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not some of it two years standing - A. I believe some of it might.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of her demanding the money in this way Mr. Roufigney was not well pleased - A. He was not well pleased.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he very ill pleased - A. He was not pleased certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And certainly not being pleased was not he very angry, and said he would be even with her - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps that was too coarse English, he said it In French perhaps - A. I have heard him very angry.</p>
               <p>Q. Now how many days after his being very angry was it that you went to search her house - A. I dare say three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Q. So long as: that can you swear it was a fortnight - A. I cannot; I can swear it was a week.</p>
               <p>Q. You found some shirts; you found some things of Mr. Dowling's and Mr. Stoll; the cork screw who did that belong to - A. Mr. Turreneau.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you find that in a box belonging to William, who formerly had lived in Mr. Roufigney's house - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You know you had a man of the name of William live with you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Roufigney tell you he knew that box in which the cork screw was found - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>SARAH DONNOVAN. Q. You was servant in the house of Mr. Roufigney - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect a carpet belonging to one of the rooms being placed in your room - A. Yes; I was present when it was opened and part of it was missing; I saw a piece of it at Mrs. Penn's, it laid wrong side upwards; it was the same pattern as the carpet in Mr. Roufigney's house. I said nothing to Mrs. Penn; the first time I saw it in her room; when I went the second time I found the carpet there again.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you went the first time - A. It was two or three days before she was taken up; the second time was the day after; I then said to Mrs. Penn, Mrs. Guy sent me to see if I should know this carpet; she said this is not your carpet; I said it is Mr. Roufigney's there has been a great noise made about it, and there will be more; she told me to tell Mrs. Guy that I did not know the carpet.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in point of fact know the carpet - A. Yes; there was another piece of carpet laid by the door, of a different pattern; she told me to tell Mrs. Guy it was not hers.</p>

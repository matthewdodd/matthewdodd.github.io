            . I am hostler at the Half-moon, on the Godstone-road, about thirty-six miles from North Ease - it is about three miles and a half on this side of Godstone. On the 12th of April, about six o'clock in the morning, the prisoners both came there - I am sure of their persons. Williams rode a bay mare, which I have since seen, and Sanders was on a dark gelding pony - they each had a saddle and bridle on. I have seen the mare twice since in the possession of Saxby. It had been thrown down in the night, and dreadfully cut on the knees, the lip was also cut. I washed and cleaned it - they had both been travelling very hard; the mare could not feed, they remained for about an hour - I am certain they are the men. I helped Sanders to cut a piece of the mare's lip. I never saw them before. Our house is about sixteen miles from London.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FOX. I am hostler to Mr. Gearing, Red Lion-yard, Gray's Inn-lane. On the 12th of April, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners in our yard - I am certain they are the men. Williams was on a bay mare, and Sanders was on a brown pony; they appeared jaded, as if they had travelled - the mare was cut and very much hurt. The prisoners put them up at our inn, and went to lodge at the Bull, near our stable. They came backwards and forwards, and went away on the 14th. I had an opportunity of seeing them those two days, and am certain they are the men; I conversed with them about the horses - they said they were going to stop a night or two. Williams took the bay mare away about nine o'clock on Friday morning, and Sanders took the pony away about eleven o'clock. I have seen the mare since in the possession of Saxby - it is the same. I have not seen the pony.</p>

            . I am a saddle and harness-maker, and live at No. 14, Goswell-street. On Wednesday, April the 12th, Saunders came to my shop about the middle of the day, and asked if I bought second-hand bridles and saddles? I said I did. He went away, and brought a bridle and saddle, which I bought of him; I gave it to the officer - (looks at one) - this is it; I particularly noticed the saddle - he said his master came from Lewes, and I saw Lewes on it. When he brought it I believe he asked 49 s. for it; I said 30 s. was the most I could give. He said,</p>
               <p>"Can't you afford to give more. Well, you must have it." I asked him where he brought it from? he said his master's name was Captain Parker, that he had a letter from him, saying he must come to town immediately, and take a ship to go to sea, that he brought the horses up to the Repository, and sold them - he said his master gave him the bridle and saddle, and he did not want to take it into the country again.</p>

            . I am a farmer, and live at North Ease, near Lewes. I have seen a mare in the possession of Palmer, which is mine - I have never found the pony; I lost them both on the 11th of April. The saddle is mine, and I believe the bridle is mine. There is no Captain Parker in my neighbourhood, but there was a Colonel Parker, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182004120065"></xptr>is gone to Ireland - the mare was never his. I bought it last August, and have known it more than twelve months; I had had the pony about three months. I saw them both the day before they were stolen, and in the morning about five o'clock, I found the stable broken open, and missed them. I gave 55 l. for the mare; she was in very good condition when she was stolen, and had met with no accident. There was a drain in the road, between Mersfield and East Grinstead, with marks of some horse having met with an accident. The pony was worth 16 l.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Portpool-lane. On the night the prisoners were apprehended I was at the Bull - I am a constable. I took them to the watch-house; they were both in the same room - Sanders sat in the same box with me. I said it was a pity men could not come to do business without being drunk, as Williams was drunk. He said Yes, it was, and it had been 25 l. out of their way.</p>
               <p>SANDERS'S Defence. My father lives at Ringmer, in Sussex, about two miles and a half from Lewes, and about half a mile on the London-road. I left my grandfather's about a quarter before nine, and went on the London-road to fall in with the mail. I waited at the public-house till about half-past nine o'clock, when the mail came by, but could not take me. I walked to Hucklesfield to get a bed, but it being late the house was shut up - it was between eleven and twelve o'clock. I walked on till I came within a mile and a half of East Grinstead, when the prisoner, Williams, overtook me with two horses, one of which he rode and the other he led. He asked me if I was out of work, and where I was going? I said I was, and was going to town. I mounted the mare, rode a little distance, and fell into conversation. I said I was a gardener, and was going to Lewisham for employ; he said if I would stop with him a few days, he would give me 5 s. a day and part of my board, as he expected to buy some more horses. accepted his offer; we put the horses up in Gray's Inn-lane. He said to the hostler,</p>
               <p>"I have borrowed this saddle, and must take it to a friend" - he offered it for sale, but the person would not buy it; he went to another place, but the master was not at home, and he left it there. As we went up Goswell-street he said,</p>
               <p>"You had better go into the saddler's there, and ask if he buys them." The man said he did; I said I had one, and he said if I brought it he would buy it. Williams told me to fetch it, and to tell the man it was made at Lewes, and that it was Captain Parker's, who had sold his horses, in consequence of taking a ship to go to sea - I did so. After that, I remained with him two days. We stopped at the Bull inn, the first afternoon he got in. He went to a man about the mare; they called next morning to look at the horses, and said they would call again in the afternoon, but did not. About nine o'clock he took the mare to the Horse Shoe, and told me to go with him; about half-past ten o'clock he sent me to fetch the brown gelding, and gave me the money to pay for the standing, which I did, took it to Goswell-street, and a man there bought the horse. I was taken into custody with him at the Bull, but do not know how he got them.</p>
               <p>WILLIAMS'S Defence. On the 12th of April I was coming to town, and bought a chesnut horse at Medhurst Fair. In my way to town I met two men with a mare and a gelding. I chapped with them, gave them my horse and five guineas for the mare, and sixteen guineas for the pony. The man said he bought them of Captain Parker, of Lewes, who was going abroad, and had no farther use for them. I paid him the money, proceeded to town, and met Sanders. The horse I had in hand hung backwards, and would not lead well - Sanders said he had missed the mail. I said I would give him a lift if he would pay the gates. We stopped at the Half-Moon to breakfast, and I offered him 5 s. to stop a day or two with me, as I meant to buy some more horses.</p>
               <p>MR. SAXBY re-examined. Colonel Parker left Lewes several months before my horses were stolen. Sanders is a gardener, and has worked for me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a barrister of the Inner Temple. I was a passenger in the "Emperor" on the night of the 30th of January and heard an alteration between two persons at the Angel—I believe it to have been between the two drives of the "Emperor" and the "Dart"—the "Dart" started frist, but I think had not got bayond the horses heads of the "Emperor", when the "Emperor" also started, slowly at first, but as soon as the horses got into a trot, in my judgement, we went at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour—all I observed with respect to the "Dart "was it proceeded a few yards, we then passed it, and there appeared to me no effort on the part of the driver of the "Dart" to race,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010126"></xptr>
               <p>and I did not notice it afterwards—after proceeding four or five hundred yards (I cannot say whether it was opposite Penton-street or not,) there was simultaneously a breaking in of the glass of the fore window, and at the same time a passing over something the road—that was going down the hill—according to my judgment, we were then going at the rate of eight or nine miles an hour—in consequence of an observation made by a gentleman in the omnibus I looked out at the window of the door and thirty or forty yards behind the omnibus I saw something lying in the road—I could not discover whether it was a man or what—it was a beau<lb></lb>tiful moonlight night—I immediately desire the <hi rend="italic">cad</hi> in attendance to stop, and I believe all the passengers called to him to stop—the pace of the ominous was not slackened—we proceeded thirty or forty yards before it did stop and then it made a regular stop—I thing two passengers got out before myself, and went in a direction of the object lying in the road—I told the coachman to stop, and told him he had either driven over some<lb></lb>body or killed somebody—I cannot say what were my exact words—I insisted on his stopping at the same time called out for the police—a policeman came up at the instant and went towards the horses' heads, and desired the coachman to stop—I think the conductor told the coachman to go on, which he did immediately and galloped so fast down the hill, that sight and hearing—I was calling after it, "Stop him, stop him," and the policeman was running after it.</p>

I live in Rawstorne-street, Clerkenwell, I was coming up Pentonville-hill, about eleven o'clock, and saw a gentleman on horse-back riding at a very furious rate—I should imagine twelve miles an hour, gal<lb></lb>loping—he continued to gallop, while in my sight—I called out to him, to beg of him to stop—I said, "Stop, for you will run over somebody"—he did not stop; but took no notice of anybody—Miss Brownwitch was with me,</p>

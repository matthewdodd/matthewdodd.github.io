                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at No. 76, Cheapside. I had some gas-fittings in my cellar, not fixed—I cannot eay when I had last seen them—they have been out of use four years, and very likely I have not seen them since—they were with a heap of things of the same kind in the cellar—the prisoner was employed as the dustman to take the dust from the cellar—I did not miss these things till they were brought to me—I did then—these are mine—I am sure of them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 151.) On the 9th of June I met the prisoner on Finsbury-pavement, with something covered with a sack—I stopped him, and asked what he had got there—he said, "Only a bit of old brass for a pot of beer"—I found it was these gas fittings—I asked where he got them from—he said from an empty house—I told him he must go to the station—he then said it was from a tailor's shop in Cheapside—I took him to Cheapside, and he pointed out Mr. Morrison's house—I showed him the gas fittings, and he identified them—I fitted them to the counter, and the pillar exactly fitted.</p>

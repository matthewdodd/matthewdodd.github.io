            . I keep the George at Holborn-bars; it is a night-house: we sit up all night for the reception of watchmen and coachmen, and others that come to lodge in the house: about 3 in the morning, the prisoner came down stairs, with his neckcloth tied about his jaw, and complained of the tooth-ach; he asked for a glass of gin, and drank it, and walked backwards and forwards, holding his hand to his jaw, as if he was in pain; he made towards the door; but I perceived by his pushing so hastily to it, he was for making off: I stepped to him, and laid hold of him, and said, My friend, stay till I see all is well up stairs. The maid went up; he made an attempt a second time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176405020011"></xptr> to get away: when the prosecutor missed the things, I searched the prisoner, and the things were found in his shirt. The prosecutor described the purse before he saw it; then the prisoner fell on his knees, and asked pardon.</p>
               <p>Gascoyne, a watchman, deposed to that of searching and finding the things in the prisoner's shirt.</p>

I was going out, the landlord asked the maid to go up and ask if any thing was lost. I went up with the maid; there were four more men in the room; but the prosecutor getting up, he put his hand behind the pillow to take out his breeches, and the purse fell out; the garters were in in my pocket, not in my shirt.</p>

            . I live in Gower's-walk, Whitechapel. I have an unoccupied house at Stepney; the copper was fixed. I had seen it safe three days before.</p>
               <p>AMBROSE SAUBING. I live near Mr. Wick's house. On the 5th of August, about five o'clock in the morning, I was at my window and saw a woman go up to the door of his house, a copper was handed out to her by somebody within; in a few minutes after I saw the prisoner come out with a stove; I followed him to the Gun and Sword public-house, and then got an officer; the officer asked him whose it was, he said it was his-he said the copper was at his house-we could not find it there.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and found the prisoner, with his wife, and another man at the public-house; he said the stove was his-and that his wife had taken the copper home as they were moving - I went home with him, when I got there, he said it was not his house. He denied having the floor-cloth - I took him back to the public-house and found the copper and floor-cloth there. I tried the copper to the place and it fitted. Wicks claimed them.</p>

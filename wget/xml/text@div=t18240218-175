            . I am cook to Mrs. Ord, No. 6, Montague-place - we deal with Mr. Coles. On the 24th, I paid the prisoner 7 s. 8 d. on his master's account. I do not recollect the date, but I paid him every week, and have a memorandum of having paid him 7 s. 8 d. on the week following, the 17th - I produced the bill, with a receipt, which he wrote in my presence. I gave him a sovereign, and he gave me change - the bill was for goods up to the 17th of January.</p>

He should account to me every evening for what he receives - he never accounted to me for this sum; he pays his money every night, and has his book signed - there is no entry whatever of this sum; he has paid me monies since, according to the entries in his book. I did not inquire about this sum, Mrs. Ord being a regular customer.</p>

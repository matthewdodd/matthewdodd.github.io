                  </hi>. I live with Mr. May, a watchmaker, in Myddleton-street, Clerkenwell; the prisoner lived with my master as an errand-boy. On Tuesday morning, the 7th of March, I was in the kitchen, between seven and eight o'clock—I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. lying on the dresser—the pri<lb></lb>soner came down into the kitchen several times—I left the kitchen while he was there—I was up stairs five or ten minutes—I then came down, and he was gone into the shop—my money was gone—I went into the shop and said, "David, I have lost 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he said, "Have you?" and two or three times in the course of the morning he asked if I had found it—I afterwards spoke to my master—after I had been out and come back, my master called me—I saw the prisoner with his boots off, and my master showed me a sixpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside near Hornsey; my place of business is in Myd<lb></lb>dleton-street. On the 7th of March, when I came to town, my foreman told me of this—I called the prisoner—he turned his pockets out in my pre<lb></lb>sence, and said he had not taken the money—I afterwards found a sixpence of the money in his boot—he began to cry, and said he had taken the money, and the shilling he had spent, 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in pastry and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in a toy—I then took him to the station—he had been with me about seven months—I never found anything dishonest in him—I will take him again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable in the Metropolitan Meat Market—I was on duty there on 21st October in the "F" Avenue—I received informa<lb></lb>tion, and saw a man take a sheep from a truck—he passed out of the gate of the market, where he was joined by the prisoner—there were about twenty-five carts standing in a row—they went to about the seventh one—the prisoner took the sheep off the man's shoulder, and placed it in the cart—I went up to him and said "Is that your sheep?"—he said "Yes"—I said, "Where did you buy it?"—he said, "At Bristow &amp; Frost's"—I said, "What did you pay for it?"—he said, "4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a stone"—I said, "Have you got a ticket?"—he said, "No, but I can get you one, if you like"—I then turned round to speak to the other man, but he was gone—the prisoner said "I will take the sheep back, if you like, to the shop with you"—I said, "Yes, I want you to do so"—on going back the prisoner said "I secured the sheep at Bristow &amp; Frost's this morning"—I said, "Did you see it weighed?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Did you pay for it?" and he said "No"—I took him back to the shop and asked Mr. Frost if the prisoner had bought the sheep there—Mr. Frost said he had no recollection of him buying it—I took the prisoner into custody—the cart was brought to the station by another con<lb></lb>stable—there was a clod and a sticking of beef in the cart—the prisoner said he had purchased that at George Wright's.</p>

             were in the room. I stood at the door and said, I could not come in, I wanted to go home. Hambleton laid hold of me and pulled me in and shut the door. There was a chair; she put me down in the chair, and sat down by me, and was very great with me, and presently I saw the chain of my watch, in her hand; I laid hold of her fist to try to get the watch from her; then Ann Gee came and pushed me off; she gave me two shoves, and asked was I going to murder the girl? Then Martha Raymond came up and took the watch, and ran down stairs with it. I called the landlord and told him they had robbed me of my watch. He laughed at me and told me I should keep better company. I begged of them to let me have my watch again; I wanted to go home. Hambleton said if I would give them a shilling to buy some supper, they would give me the watch again. I gave her the shilling, and then they began to turn me out of the room. I have never seen my watch since. The Landlady came up and said we made a great noise; and she turned us all down stairs; they said they had a box to deliver at another house; then they said they would go with me to the watch-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100065"></xptr>or any where, I should search them for the watch. As soon as we were out they run one one way and the other another. I pursued Hambleton, upon which she cried out murder! She was taken by the watchman, who carried her to the watch house, there she was searched, but nothing found upon her. Raymond was taken on the Thursday following.</p>

               <p>It is not true then that while he struggled to get the watch from her, you pushed him and gave him two shoves and asked him if he was going to murder the woman? - I can take my oath, I never said any such thing.</p>

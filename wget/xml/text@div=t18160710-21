On Wednesday evening, the 12th of June, I was up late, I was drinking in the early part of the evening; I was some what in liquor; but was sensible of what I was doing. I went into a coffee-shop about two o'clock in the morning, in the neighbourhood of Clare-market; I had some coffee there; there was a good many people there; they were intirely strangers to me; there have been two of them to my house. The prisoner was in the coffee-shop. We went in together. He accested me first in the street; he had some sort of conversation with me, and seeing this place open, we went in to have some coffee, and we drank it together. I staid there a short time, half or quarter of an hour. I went first out; I had paid for the coffee for both. We sat next to each other. I remember when I paid for the coffee, I took out all my silver to see if I had a sixpence. I went out first; he followed me out, and made up to me almost directly; he came up to me, and gave me a blow on the front of my head, and knocked me against the wall, and thrust his hand into my pocket, and took every farthing in the world that I had, and did not leave me a halfpenny. He stupified me for a moment; but I directly called out, when he ran away; I told the watchman, and every one I met, what had happened. I went back to the coffee-shop, and told the people there; I described the man to them, and somebody in the shop gave me some information where I should be likely to find the prisoner; they asked me if I would go with them to Fleet-market, and they would find him; but I declined going, as I had no hat; and then they told me to stop where I was. While I was there, they went; and one of them then came back, and gave me some information; in consequence of which, I went with him, and saw the prisoner; he saw me, and escaped out of the market; I followed him into Holborn-hill, and there he got into a tobacco shop; I went over to him, and saw my hat on his head. I asked him what he was doing with my hat on his head, and he said, it was not mine; I said, it was. I also asked him where my money was that he took out of my pocket; and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181607100014"></xptr>said, he did not take any out of my pocket. He then shuffled out of the shop, and got away again, with the hat on his head; I ran after him, and overtook him; he ran through the cross courts, and I overtook him in Poppins's-court, Fleet-street; he fell down; when I overtook him; I took hold of his two wrists, and the hat fell off his head, and fell down, and he said, he had none of my property; he said, he would murder me if I did not let him go; and I told him, I was in a good case, and was not afraid of him; and he was in a bad one, and all I wanted, was my own. Some people went and fetched an officer, Mr. Cresswell, the street - keeper of Fleet-street. The hat was laying at the prisoner's feet when the officer came. This was about half past seven, or a little after. I had had some liquor; but I am perfectly sure that he is the person who struck me in the street.</p>

            . I was called to Poppin's-court, and found the prosecutor and the prisoner there. There was a hat laying about three feet from them, and the prosecutor had the prisoner by both wrists. The prosecutor told me what mark I should find in the hat before I took it up; he mentioned three or four particular marks, as if done with a bodkin; I took up the hat, and found those marks in it; I have kept it over since; it was in my own sight the whole time, close to myself; I observed the forehead of the prosecutor, the forehead and nose were very red, as if they had had a blow.</p>

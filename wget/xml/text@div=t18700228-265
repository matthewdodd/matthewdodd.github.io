                  </hi>. I live at 15, Mortimer Road, De Beauvoir Town—on Saturday night, 5th February, I went to bed about 10.30 or 11 o'clock—the breakfast-room window was fastened in the usual way with a snap, and the shutters were put to with a bar and bolt and a long brass screw—about 7.30 in the morning the policeman on the beat knocked me up, and I found my Venetian blind lying in the garden, and missed a pair of damask curtains, and a canary bird had been taken out of a cage—they had been safe overnight—the cage hung about 18 in. from the window—the curtains were worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them.</p>

About 6.30 on the morning of 6th February I met the prisoner in Nicholl's Row, Shoreditch; that is about two and a half or three miles from the prosecutor's house—he looked very bulky round the body, and when he passed me I went after him; the fatter I walked the faster he walked, and when he got round the corner of Cross Street I ran after him, and saw him drop this window-curtain from under his coat—he was passing a gateway, and he tried to drop it in there, but it fell on the footway—I picked it up and took hold of him, and asked how he came by it—he said he knew nothing at all about it—I took him to the station, and on searching him found this knife; it has been ground down, and would be used for getting between the sashes of a window and undoing the hasp—I afterwards examined the window of the prosecutor's house and found marks of nails on the sill, and likewise in the garden, as if caused by nailed boots—the prisoner had nailed boots on.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was standing at the corner of the street. I had just done eating a bit of bread and cheese, and put the knife in my pocket, when he tapped me on the shoulder and said, "Old fellow, do you know anything about this?" and I said, "I knew nothing at all about it."</p>

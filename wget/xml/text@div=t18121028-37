            . On Wednesday night, the 23d of September, a little after seven in the evening, I was coming into Lincolns-inn-fields, from Little Turnstile, as I was going to cross to <placeName id="t18121028-37-crimeloc211">Covent Garden</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18121028-37-crimeloc211" type="placeName" value="Covent Garden"></interp>

The prisoner met me at the corner of Gate-street, as if coming from Queen-street. He met me as I was going to cross the coach way. He came plump against me. I had not an opportunity of getting out of his way, and that moment he seized my watch, he ran against my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. So that he hit you against your breast - A. Yes, and at the same instant he seized my watch, and took it from me.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did he say anything to you - A. Not a syllable. He took my watch from my watch-pocket. I perceiving my watch instantly gone, I took hold of the prisoner. I felt it going. I laid hold of him, and prevented him from going towards Little Turnstile, which seemed to be his direction.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him - A. I merely uttered that he had got my watch. I saw nobody just at that moment. I very shortly saw two or three men. They were so near me. When I saw them they appeared to be stationary. I did not see them come up. One of these men asked me what was the matter. Expecting for they were my friends, I told him, that the prisoner had got my watch. The instant I had mentioned that, one or two of these men up with their fist, and aimed to strike at me. I did receive some slight blows, but I warded off blows that might have been more unpleasant to me. I received a blow upon upon my thumb, that caused me a deal of pain; but with what that was given me, I know not. Finding myself thus surrounded by enemies, I made use of my voice, as strong as I could, to call assistance, and I was obliged to relax that hold that I had of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What obliged you to do that - A. The fear from the persons who surrounded me. The prisoner also caused a great fear of him, he being one of the gang. When he got from me he did not take the direction towards Little Turnstile. He got from me, and I kept a great cry of stop thief, pursuing him that side leading to Clare-market.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the West side - A. I think it is. At this time I saw several people collected round, but having exhausted myself, I was obliged to relax my pace of walking. I have two witnesses here that pursued him, when I could not. He took down Duke-street, and his party also.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him turn down Duke-street - A. I did not. I went on after him in that direction. The persons who were in pursuit of the man, they stopped him. He was stopped when I came up. He was stopped by the Romish chapel.</p>
               <p>Q. That is about turning into Duke-street - A. Yes. Just about that place I saw a great quantity of people collected there. When I came up I went immediately up to the prisoner. I recognised his countenance and person also. I am quite certain he is the man. I do not know whether Limbrick was there from Bow-street, but immediately after I came up he was soon charged.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body hold of him - A. Yes; the witness that you will soon hear. Limbrick took him over to a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Limbrick, the Bow-street officer, happened to be there - A. Yes. He took him to a public-house opposite, but there was no watch or property of mine found upon him. One of my witnesses can account for that. He was taken to Bow-street that night, and the persons that stopped him went with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more of the persons who had come up to you while you were with the prisoner - A. There were two brought to me at Bow-street, but I could recognise neither of their persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you say, as soon as you came up to the prisoner, you immediately recognised his countenance and person: at the time he was stopped what sort of light had you - A. His hat was thrown backwards, so that I had a full sight of his countenance.</p>
               <p>Q. That was when he pulled at your watch - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. His hat was not pulled over his face - A. No, it was thrown backwards rather.</p>
               <p>Q. What light was there - A. It was a little after seven, on the 23d of September, and certainly light enough to discriminate his person. It could not be a quarter after seven, I believe. I am positive to his person and face.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did it take up before he ran away - A. When he first seized my watch?</p>
               <p>Q. Yes - A. It might be a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again - A. No. It had a chain and seals to it, I had got hold of this man; whether it was the first time, or when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280050"></xptr> I got hold of him again, I am certain his coat was torn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are satisfied then, that the man that you had hold of, his coat was torn - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, when the prisoner was in custody was anything observed about his coat - A. Mr. Read desired one of the officers to look at his coat; and his coat was torn. He was asked if he could account for that. He said, it had been so several days.</p>

            . I live at No. 30, Berwick-street, Soho.</p>
               <p>Q. On this night, the 23d of September, where were you - A. I was on this side Lincolns-inn-fields, between seven and eight at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts were you when you first heard or saw any thing of this - A. About fifty yards from the corner of Great Queen-street. I was coming in that direction towards that place. I saw several men at the further corner of Queen-street. I heard a cry of, help; stop thief. I then saw one man run towards me very fast, with his hat in his hand. I instantly laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he then - A. He was going towards Duke-street, down the square.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he turned Duke-street - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You laid hold of him in Lincoln's-inn-fields - A. Yes. I heard something drop from his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any thing drop - A. No; I only heard something drop, apparently from his hands. It appeared to me to rattle like a watch on the stones.</p>
               <p>Q. It was such a sound as a watch, dropped, would make - A. I thought so at the time. I was meeting him, in fact, at the time when I stopped him. I endeavoured to keep my hold, but was prevented by another coming up, and striking me on my breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come in the same direction - A Yes. I let go of him, and he instantly ran towards Duke-street. I then looked about, to see if I could see the watch; not finding it I went on towards Duke-street, as I heard that he had turned in there.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him turn there - A. I did not. I went into Duke-street, where I found him, and the other witness had hold of him. I asked the prisoner to take off his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. You had spoken of a man before. Do you mean that man is the prisoner - A. Yes. As soon as he took off his hat I was convinced it was the same man that I had laid hold of in the square. Limbrick, the officer, came up, and took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you searched the spot where you heard something full - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say the reason why you searched, and nothing was found - A. The man that struck me was on the spot the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the spot where you had hold of him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, I understand you to say, that you had such a view of the prisoner, that you can undertake to swear positively to his being the man - A. Yes. I went to Bow-street with the other witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any thing said about tearing his coat - A. Yes. Going along to Bow-street, Mr. Batchelor said, there was one particular circumstance that would convince him, that he had hold of him, he felt his coat tore in the inside, somewhere by the flap. Then he went to Bow-street, and the coat was examined. It was torn.</p>
               <p>MR. WEAVER. Q. On this night, the 23rd of September, where were you - A. I was coming out of Great Queen-street, and just as I had passed the corner, I heard a cry of, help, stop thief, and seeing the prisoner running across the fields, going towards Duke-street, I immediately ran after him. He turned down Duke-street; that is where I came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, before that, see anything of Mr. Green, the last witness - A. No, no more than seeing him come after him. When I came up to him, I immediately laid hold of him. I had not stopped him long before I was opposed by three or four. They were swearing at me, you be d - d, how dare you stop the man. Then I was convinced they were a gang of pick-pockets around me.</p>
               <p>Q. It gave you that impression - A. Yes, and I let go my hold then.</p>
               <p>Q. What made you do that - A. Because I was struck once or twice by one or two of them. I still kept myself about the prisoner. Soon after, Mr. Batchelor came up, and requested to look at the man. He identified him being the man that had robbed him. I laid hold of the prisoner again, a second time. I was obliged to let go my hold after that. I was afraid of being knocked down.</p>
               <p>Q. This was after Mr. Batchelor came up - A. Yes. I was afraid of the people about: I then perceived the prisoner, as if he was going straight off, on the other side. I got hold of him again, and I sung out, an officer. I said, there was an officer or two come, to frighten them. It had the desired effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen an officer then - A. No. Very fortunately, Limbrick came up soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. But an officer was there, though you did not see him - A. Yes. Limbrick came up soon after, and took him over to a public-house, and from thence to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever lost sight of him until he was secured by an officer - A. No. I went with Mr. Green and Mr. Batchelor, to Bow-street, and when I was there, Limbrick and another officer asked me, if I should know any person that struck me. They went, and brought two persons. I could not identify them.</p>
               <p>- LIMBRICK. I am an officer of Bow-street office.</p>
               <p>Q. On this night, the 23d, where happened you to be - A. I lived then at 33, Duke-street. Upon my hearing the cry of, stop thief, I ran down stairs. I found the prisoner in custody. Mr. Green had hold of him at that time, I believe. Mr. Batchelor said, he had been robbed of his watch. He was there at that time. I took the prisoner into a public-house, and searched him, but there was no watch on him. Then I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear anything said at Bow-street, or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181210280051"></xptr> before you came there, about the taring his coat - A At Bow-street, Mr. Batchelor said, he thought he had his coat torn. He told the magistrate, he heard his coat tare at the time he had him in custody. I searched his coat, and it was torn at the back part of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your lordship, I never saw the prosecutor until he came up to me in Duke-street. I was wrongfully taken into custody; and Mr. Batchelor, when he saw me in Duke-street, said, I was not the right man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I never said so. I never had any doubt of his being the man.</p>

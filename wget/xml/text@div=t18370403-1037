                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant N</hi> 7.) I was in a public-house, at Whitehall, at five o'clock on the 1st of April—I followed the prisoner and two others into the house—the prisoner called for a pint of porter—I saw him lay a shilling upon the ledge of the counter with his thumb and finger—I went by the side of him, and called for a glass of ale myself—I had my plain coat on, but police trowsers—he looked round, and looked down—he did not pay the shilling—he put it out of his right hand into hit left, and took a penny out of his pocket—he said to one of his companions, "I only have a penny"—one of his companions immediately lent him a penny more—he paid for the porter with the two pennies—I then took hold of him, and asked what he had in his hand—he said, "Nothing"—I took hold of his hand, and found this shilling in his left hand—he had it clenched, and I was obliged to open it—I asked him where he got it—he said his mother gave it him—and between the crown and cover of his hat, which was covered with oil-skin, were these two shillings wrapped up in the thumb of a glove—these are the three shillings.</p>

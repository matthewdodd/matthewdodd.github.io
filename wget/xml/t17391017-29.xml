               <p>Gooday. On the 14th of August, between Eight and Nine in the Evening, I was going up Fleetstreet, and met with a Woman, who stopp'd me, and asked me to give her a Drink, and she carry'd me into a Room up one Pair of Stairs in <placeName id="t17391017-29-crimeloc118">Salisbury-Court</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17391017-29-crimeloc118" type="placeName" value="Salisbury-Court"></interp>

I was no sooner in the Room, but the Prisoner came up with a Quartern, and bid the Woman I brought in go down Stairs, - she would stay with the Gentleman, (meaning me) herself. As soon as the Quartern was out,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173910170014"></xptr> the Prisoner demanded the Money for it, so I put my Hand in my Pocket, and pull'd out 2 s. and Half a Guinea, and I give her a Shilling to change, and put the rest of the Money into my Fob. Then (in a very impudent Manner indeed) she sat down on my Knee, and solicited me for more Liquor, and during the Time of Solicitation, I found her Hand in my Pocket: I charg'd her with it, and she immediately rose from my Knee, and ran down Stairs; I pursued her, and saw her give something into the Hand of a Woman on the Ground-floor. Upon which I got a Constable, and charg'd him with her; but there was such a Mob rose upon me immediately, that I thought I should have been murder'd.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was a great Mob indeed, and I thought I should have been duck'd, but the Prosecutor got me to the Elephant and Castle in Fleet-Lane, and there he kept me, and told me he had lost his Master's Money, and if I would give it him again, I should be discharg'd. <rs id="t17391017-29-verdict119" type="verdictDescription">

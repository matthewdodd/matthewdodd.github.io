He asked for a straw bonnet; I took one out of the window, which he approved of. He asked for a box, which I got for him - they came to 1 l. 8 s. together. He gave me a 10 l. Dover note; I asked him for his name and address? He said if I would give him a pen and ink he would write it himself - (looks at one) - this is it; here is,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Thompson, Snargate-street, Dover," which I wrote on it. I gave him 8 l. 12 s. in change.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him - A. I took the note up, read it, and said,</p>
               <p>"Snargate-street; do you know any person there of the name of Marsh?" he replied</p>
               <p>"Yes, there are two of them." I said, they were relations of mine. He said,</p>

               <p>"Good evening," and went away. I put the note in the desk with others, but I had no other country notes whatever. I gave it to my husband next morning with other money.</p>

            's lodging A. I did, in consequence of directions I received.</p>
               <p>Q. From whom did you receive your directions - A. From Herbert, a person employed by the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were these lodgings - A. No. 14, Percival-street, Clerkenwell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find there - A. Mrs. Hopgood, the wife of John Hopgood. The prisoner came in soon after I was there; on the prisoner coming in he was asked to sit down; Mrs. Hopgood said she was glad to see him; he said John was gone to purchase some things for me; meaning her husband. The prisoner then said he had just come from Birmingham, where he was able to get all sort of things; he produced a one-pound note; he said it was one of the things that he had brought with him. It purported to be a bank of England note; he shewed it to Mrs. Hopgood; on which I requested, I believe myself to look at it, and asked him if he had any objection to sell me one; to which he assented. I then paid him; he gave me that same note that I had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. You had that note in your possession at the time, had not you - A. I don't think that I had it in my possession at the time; it was handed back again, and then given to him. I then asked Hughes to sell me one I believe; I had returned him that note, considering that note to be dirty, and not sufficiently clean; upon which I received another of him, that was a one-pound note; I put the note in my pocket, remained there some time, and came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do any thing with the note - A. I did not, except keeping it in my possession until the following morning, then I put the mark upon it the following morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the note you put the mark upon the following morning was the note that the prisoner gave you - A. I am certain of it, because I ever had it out of my possession; I delivered that note up, into the hands of Mr. Westwood, the clerk in the solicitor of the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you delivered it to Mr. Westwood - A. About twelve or one o'clock the day following.</p>

               <p>Q. I observe on it there is the prisoner's name, and Thursday, the 17th of June, 1813 - A. Yes, that is my writing.</p>

            . Q. On the 17th of June do you remember the last witness coming to your lodging - A. He came once when the prisoner, Hughes, was there; I remember Mr. Roberts produced a five-pound bad country note, and he asked thirty shillings for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember Hughes producing any thing - A. I saw two bank notes that Hughes had; Hughes had a great many notes; a one-pound note was shewn between Roberts and Hughes; they handed it one to the other; I never had it in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Hughes do any thing with that note - A. Nothing further than give it to Roberts; Roberts said here Mr. Hughes is the ten shillings. I did not see the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect before this took place any conversation about Birmingham - A. Hughes said he came from Birmingham; that is all that I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Q. How long have you known Roberts at this time - A. A very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you had seen more of the five-pound notes in his possession - A. Yes, several.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he ever told you that he had got rid of many of them - A. Yes, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. He offered you one of these notes for thirty shillings - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw one or two bad notes produced by Hughes - A. Yes, I saw two.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the ten shillings that passed would be the balance for one of these notes - A. I did not see the money; he said here is ten shillings. I did not see whether any notes passed between them; he did not say; I could not swear for they sent me out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Hughes come there to enquire after one Blissard - A. Yes, I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. It is your husband who is in a distressful situation - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes had Roberts of Hughes - A. I believe he had one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did Hughes take from Roberts a five-pound note - A. I think he did not, I am not certain.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Hopgood's house to enquire for Mr. Blissard; he rented a coach-house of me, in which he made a coal-shed; when I enquired for him Roberts was there; Roberts said it is no matter where he is, he is a d - d rogue. He produced these country notes; he asked me if I would purchase one of them; I told him if I was tired of my life, and when I was I should take up such things as them; I had bank notes in my pocket, good ones. He offered me one of the five-pound notes for thirty shillings; I told him I would not pick up such things if I saw then in the highway.</p>

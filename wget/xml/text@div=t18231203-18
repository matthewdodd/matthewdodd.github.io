On the 10th of November, between one and two o'clock, I put thirty-one sovereigns and a half into a box, in the back room, on the ground floor - I put them into the box in the presence of the prisoner, who lodged in the house. I went out at two o'clock; he asked how long I should be gone; I said not a great while. I returned between three and four o'clock - I had left the door locked, and found it so, but the back room window was open. A person in the yard could open it, and get in. Two large boxes were moved off the top of that the money was in, the box broken open, and the money gone; I had locked it and had the key in my pocket. I did not see him again till he was taken. I did not expect that he was going to leave - he had lived there four months, and slept in this back room, which we rented - he had new clothes on when he was taken. I had left nobody in my apartment.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not people up stairs - A. There might be. Anybody in the yard could open the window. He owed me 1 l. 11 s. 6 d., for rent, at 2 s. a week. I had asked him for it, but he could not pay me.</p>

            . I am a labourer. On the 11th of November, I saw the prisoner at the Highgate Archway-tavern, at twelve o'clock - I knew him before. When he saw me come in, he hung down his head, took up his hat, and was going away - I put my hand on him, and said he could not go, for he was accused of robbing Connor; he denied it. I called the landlord, and asked where I could get a constable - he said at Crouch-end; I went there, returned, and he was gone. I found him at Hatton-garden next day.</p>

            . I keep the Archway-tavern. On the 11th of November, Hickey and the prisoner were there. Hickey went for an officer, leaving the prisoner in my house. Several men promised to take care of him, but let him go - he had had a pint of beer, which he paid for in silver, and had a quantity of silver in his pocket. When I heard he was gone, I sent my brother after him; he brought him back. I was endeavouring to put him into the back parlour out of the way of some labouring men, who abused me very much, and threatened to break my windows. I was obliged to let him go, but sent a man to watch him - he ran as hard as he could a little distance - then went through a gate out of the road. I went in search of him with the officer, and found him in Maiden-lane, about three o'clock that day, in the road, asking a man about a coach - we took him to the watch-house. I saw him searched; twenty-nine sovereigns and some silver were found in his left hand breeches pocket; in a small pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long did I stay in your house after being charged with this - A. I suppose half an hour from first to last. I told him if he was an honest man he had better stand his ground. Maiden-lane is about a mile from my house; he had left my house an hour and a half, and had crossed the fields,</p>

I stopped all night with him, as he was accustomed to drink; I thought it best to take his money till he wished to have it returned. I stopped all night with him to take care of his money, and was to meet him at a coffee-house next day, and was going there when I went into this tavern.</p>

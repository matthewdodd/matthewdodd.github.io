               <p>Q. Did you know her before - A. I have seen her before, but never spoke to her; I missed her all in a minute, in Rose-lane there is a little passage there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you went out of Wentworth-street into a passage - A. Yes, I did not stay in that passage a minute with her. When I missed her, I put my hand into my pocket and missed my tobacco box and a dollar, they had been both in my waistcoat pocket. There were some children that saw the prisoner, they knew where she lived, they went to Mr. Gilman's, he went and took her, and my son in law sent for an officer, and had her searched in his house; I saw her searched, a tobacco box was found upon her, it was my tobacco box, no dollar was ever found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the magistrate the same account you have given now - A. To the best of my knowledge, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you told him you went to her lodgings with her - A. I did not; I did not go into her lodging, I went into a gateway with her, not into the house.</p>
               <p>- WHEELER. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in Mr. Gillman's house, the prosecutor was there and gave me charge, he said, she had robbed him of a tobacco box, and a crown piece. I searched the prisoner, I found upon her a tobacco box and a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor in Rose-lane, he asked me where I was going; I said, home; he said, go on, I will follow you, he came up stairs; I asked him if he was going to give me any thing; he said, he would go and get more money; he went down stairs, some children were there that knew him, they said they would go and tell his wife; and then they came and took me, and charged me with robbing him; I said, I had none of his money, I took the tobacco box out of my pocket and gave it them; his wife said that is enough, I will swear that is his box.</p>

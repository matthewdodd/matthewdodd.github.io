On the 31st of May, about nine o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop, and asked to look at some watches; I asked what price - he said about five or six guineas; there was a lady in the shop: I said I was engaged, but would attend to him immediately, and in about two minutes I took down two watches, and shewed him one; he opened the cover, then the glass-case, and said he could not open the interior - I took it, and opened it for him; he looked at it very deliberately, then shut it up, and said,</p>
               <p>"This will do," and putting it into his pocket. ran out with it; I ran out, and never lost sight of him till he was taken, and I took the watch out of his hand - it is second-hand, but is worth 50 s. I would give above 40 s. for it, to sell again.</p>

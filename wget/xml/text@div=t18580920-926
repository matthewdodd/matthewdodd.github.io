                  </hi>. I am a paper-hanger, of 10, King's-court, Suffolk-street. On 1st September, I was at my brother's, a pork butcher's, shop, 5, Cross-street, Blackfriars-road, at half past 10 at night—the prisoner was smoking a pipe outside the door; he asked me the price of beef and pork—I told him; he said, "Weigh me half a pound of beef;" I did so; it came to 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he gave me a half-crown; I bit it, and said, "It is a bad one"—he said that he got it at Mr. Rushall's, in change for a sovereign—I went away for 20 minutes to find a constable, but could not—I left my brother's mother-in-law and Mr. Reed in the shop with the prisoner—I went back and told the prisoner to go about his business, for I did not want any more trouble with him—he would not go, and I went out again, saw a policeman, and gave the prisoner in custody with the half-crown—the shop is about two minutes walk from Mr. Rushall's.</p>

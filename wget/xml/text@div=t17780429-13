The prisoner came to my shop on the 26th of February, at about nine in the morning, under pretence of buying toys; he asked for a very large doll and a large drum, then he said he wanted a quantity of earthen ware to send on board a ship; supposing him likely to be a good customer, I was willing to serve him. I offered to carry them on board his ship myself, but I had not a doll so large as he wanted; he perswaded me to go to Broad-street to see if I could not purchase one to his mind, he said he would go to about half a crown or 3 s. in the price; I called a neighbour, Isabella Mersin to mind my shop, and to accompany the prisoner till I came back; when I returned, the prisoner was gone, and I missed my cloak.</p>

               <p>ISABELLA MERSIN sworn.</p>

               <p>I was left in the back room with the prisoner, he sent me out of the room several times upon frivolous errands; at last he asked me for some small beer, when I brought it he desired it might be warmed and made very hot; he said he was going to leave a message just by, and he would be back by the time the beer was hot; he went away and did not come back again: while he sent me away upon these frequent errands, he had opportunities to take any thing. I had seen Mrs. Bulford's cloak hanging there that morning, but I did not observe it at that time.</p>

               <p>I happened to be at the next door to the prosecutrix, and I heard the prisoner give orders<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177804290019"></xptr> to have this small beer made very hot for him while he went on a message; I threw up the sash and saw him come out of the house, he stood hesitating in the street sometime which way he should go; at last he went Rosemary-lane way: when the cloak was missed I went in pursuit of the prisoner. I went and looked into all the shops in Rosemary-lane, but did not see the prisoner till I was coming back, then I met him going into Rosemary-lane, I watched him till I saw him go into a cloath's shop; he took out the cloak and offered to sell it; I ran into the shop and collared him and charged him with stealing the cloak, he then said it was his wife's cloak, after that he said he found it; the mob rose about us; there was no constable to be got, so I took him myself before a justice.</p>

               <p>[The cloak was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutrix.]</p>

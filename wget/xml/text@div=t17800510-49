               <p>I am apprentice to Mr. Bond. On Saturday morning I saw Richardson take a dozen of flax out of the warehouse and carry it into the dressing shop, where he worked, and Dowdey was in the warehouse, and shut himself in. I went down stairs and lighted the fire, and when the maid came down I told her of it. I thought it particular because they had no business in the warehouse.</p>

               <p>I never was in the warehouse at all; I had no goods but what my master weighed out to me himself.</p>

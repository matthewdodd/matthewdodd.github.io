                  </hi>. I live at 139, Burbige Road, Peckham—I have been nearly eighteen years in Mr. Kemp's employ as clerk—on the death of Mr. Karslake's clerk I acted as head clerk to both him and Mr. Kemp—about eleven months ago the prisoner came into the employ as second clerk, at first he was paid soemthing like 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for about two months, and after that he had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he had a separate room and a desk in that room where he sat when he had writing to do—the blotting paper and desk belonged to him—I knew that Mr. Karslake had an account at Child's and that he was in the habit of drawing his cheques on blue draft paper—I did not as a rule fill up the body of the cheques for him to sign, I have done so—Mr. Karslake was not in the habit of putting the words "the sum of" on his cheques, I never remember his doing so—I should think I have not put in those words when I have drawn cheques for him—this cheque was first shown to me on Tuesday, 16th February—when I was passing through my room I showed the prisoner the cheque and said "This is the forged cheque"—I took the cheque back to Child's directly—I was not aware that the prisoner was married—no portion of this cheque is my writing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mr. Kemp intimated to me that my services as joint clerk to himself and Mr. Karslake, so far as Mr. Karslake was concerned, would end at Michaelmas—I had not been reproved by Mr. Karslake—Mr. Kemp had reproved me for insobriety—I remember going into the room when Mr. Dashwood was making a comparison of the cheque with my baud-writing—I was last in the office that morning—Mr. Dashwood said that he charged me with writing the body of the cheque—I made some remark to him, he then said that our consciences would tell us—he had charged the prisoner with forging the endorsement—I said my conscience was perfectly clear, on the matter—I did not practice writing the initials of Mr. Karslake—my attention was never called to any blotting-paper with the initials E. K. K. on it—I never remember his pointing it out to me or my destroying it—I was not the worse for liquor on 16th February—the day I was taking the cheque back to the bank I might have had a glass of ale, but I was not intoxicated—I don't think I was affected by liquor at all on that day; I think I was one day between the 13th and 25th March—I am certain that I never burnt any blotting-paper, with Mr. Karslake's initials on at any time—I did not make any comparison between the writing on the cheque and my own writing when Mr. Dashwood was there—my attention was only called to the hand-writing on the cheque and on the blotting-paper, I said that the signature was not a bit like Mr. Karslake's, I rather chaffed the bank clerks for paying a cheque with so bad a signature—I did not show them any specimen of Mr. Karslake's signature—I have not frequently filled up the body of a cheque for Mr. Karslake to sign—I keep no record of the cheques I fill up—I have not examined a great number of Mr. Karslake's cheques since 25th March, I have not seen one.</p>

                  </hi>, Q.C. I have chambers with Mr. Kempat 4, Stone Buildings—since 1845 I have kept an account at Messrs. Child's bank—for the last twenty-five years I have been in the habit of drawing cheques on blank paper—no portion of this cheque was written by me or with my authority—I should say it is not at all like my signature, it is much too upright, I call it very clumsy—I know Leatherbarrow's handwriting well, he has been my clerk for two or three years—I won't say that no portion of the cheque is in the least degree like his writing, but I don't recognise any similarity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had noticed a want of sobriety in Leatherbarrow and had complained to him of it—I should say several months ago, call it four months, for the first time—I repeated the complaint once or twice afterwards; I am happy to say it has not happened often—there would be several of my signatures to papers in my chambers in my drawers, nearly all of which are kept open, and a great many with my initials E. E. K. on briefs—I have very rarely employed Leatherbarrow to fill up the body of cheques; four times a year he has done it for rent to Mr. Kemp, but probably not more than three or four times besides, if so many—I was present when Mr. Dashwood found the blotting paper—some one in my presence pointed out to the pri<lb></lb>soner the close resemblance between the cheque and what was on the blotting paper, and he practically admitted that it was blotted on that paper; he also said most positively, without faltering in the least, that he did not know how it was done and that someone else must have done it—I think it was at this interview that Mr. Dashwood said that the body of the cheque was in the handwriting of Leatherbarrow; I think the words were uttered by Mr. Dashwood, but they may have been by Sergeant Outram—I don't recollect anything being said about the endorsement—the policeman and Mr. Dashwood did not leave and return in quarter of an hour—it was Leather barrow's duty to be there before the other clerks, but on that occasion the prisoner came first, and therefore it was that he was shown the cheque and blotting paper, before Leatherbarrow came—as soon as Leatherbarrow came I showed them to him and asked him if he could accout for it—the policeman went into some of the other rooms, and he and Mr. Dashwood were looking for papers, but I should say none of them left for the best part of an hour—I was not present when the prisoner was taken into custody and had nothing to do with his being taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had always found Leatherbarrow most thoroughly honest. George Lionel Dashwood. I am a cashier in the employ of Child and Co. of Temple Bar, with whom Mr. Karslake keeps an account—on Satur<lb></lb>day, 13th February, a Mr. Butler was in the employ as a cashier—he-has since left; he has retired in consequence of delicate health—we have two tills out of which cheques are paid, which are common to all the cashiers—there is also a book in which entries are made as cheques are cashed—when cheques are cashed they are put behind the actual till itself from which the monies are paid—I was at the bank on Saturday, 13th February—I did not myself take the balance of cash at 2 o'clock that day, I saw the result in writing; we draw the line at that hour—I found this forged cheque in the counting-house, it was in the hands of a gentleman, who was about to post it to Mr. Karslake's account—it was the duty of Mr. Butler to enter it in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it was his book in fact; if he was busy he might say</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187504050016"></xptr>
               <p>to me "Write off this draft for me in my book," quite independently of who cashed it—the cheque would be placed behind the till before it was entered in the book, it would lie there perhaps for a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> minutes—I find an entry in this book in the handwriting of Mr. Butler. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Besley objected to this entry being received as evidence of uttering, in the absence of the person who made it. Mr. Straight would not press the uttering but would proceed upon the forgery.</hi>) I found the cheque on Tuesday, 16th—directly I found it I went to the chambers of Mr. Karslake—I had not been there prior to that—I found the prisoner sitting there at a desk in a room by himself—between that day and the 24th I was having inquiries made and making inquiries myself in reference to this matter—on the 24th I made a search at the desk at which I had found the prisoner sitting, and in the blotting pad on the desk I found this sheet of blotting paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on the morning of the 25th I went again to the chambers with the detective sergeant Outram, and in Mr. Karslake's presence saw the prisoner there, and showed him the forged cheque and the blotting paper; I held the blotting paper up to the light for him to see it—I told him that the cheque was a forgery and that the writing on the blotting paper was a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi> of part of it, and I asked him how he accounted for that—I told him that I had found it in the middle of the pad at his desk—he said he did not know anything about it—Leather barrow came in shortly after and his attention was called to the blotting paper and the cheque, the prisoner was present—I told Leatherbarrow that I was under, the impression that the endorsement John Barnes was in hand of the prisoner, but that the writing on the face of the cheque I fancied was in his hand—he denied all knowledge of it also—at that time I had only a knowledge of Leatherbarrow's handwriting from what I had seen on the previous evening—I had seen some of the prisoner's writing to four or five documents, which have been produced, marked A, &amp;c.—on Easter Tuesday I searched a coat of the prisoner that was hanging in his room, and in the pocket found the paper marked C, an application form for a loan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That was after the prisoner was in custody—I told Leatherbarrow that I thought the body of the cheque was in his hand writing—I did not use the words "I charge you with forging the cheque, and God and your own conscience know that I am speaking the truth"—I said "Your own conscience will tell you whether you have done it"—I said "I think the handwriting on the face of the cheque is yours"—I had found the blotting paper the night before—I did not compare the lines of the cheque with the blotting paper; it was so before my mind—I had not the cheque in my pocket at the time, but I found the impression a <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>—I compared the writing on the face of the cheque with Leatherbarrow's in my own mind only, that was what made me say "I think;" I had not had possession of his writing previously—I carried it in my mind as it were—the night I found the blotting paper I had access to the chambers by Mr. Karslake's permission, and I saw one of Leatherbarrow's books, and I fancied then for the first time that the writing on the face of the cheque was his—I went to the chambers for the purpose of seeing whether there was a resemblance of the handwriting; that was the first occasion on which I examined any handwriting of Leatherbarrow's, and at the same time I ex<lb></lb>amined some handwriting of the prisoner's—I had made up my mind some days before that the endorsement was the prisoner's writing—I had not seen Leatherbarrow's handwriting before I found the blotting paper—I hud not come to the conclusion that the face of the cheque was not the pri<lb></lb>soner's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187504050017"></xptr>
               <p>before I saw Leatherbarrow's writing; I fancied that it was done by one of the two, and it was that that made me go to the prisoner's desk—I had previously seen the prisoner's handwriting, and come to the conclusion that the endorsement was his—I was not then sure that the face of the cheque was written by another hand—I had, to a certain extent, come to that conclusion, or I should not have said to Leatherbarrow "I think "I was careful about it—I now feel perfectly certain that the face and the back are not written by different persons—I have had more time to look into it—I am not equally certain that the signature is in the same handwriting—I do not say that two persons have written the same document—I am per<lb></lb>fectly certain that the body of the cheque was written by the same hand as the endorsement, and I think the signature is by the same hand—I am almost perfectly certain that the whole was written by the same person—I have compared the signature of the forged cheque with the signature of Mr. Karslake—I did so on 16th February—I looked up an old cheque of Mr. Karslake's—my nephew was with me when I found this blotting paper; it was not a pad, it was a quire of blotting paper, each sheet loose; this sheet was in the middle—I have not got the other sheets here; this was one of the middle sheets, and there was nothing else on it but this; I examined carefully—there were heaps of clean sheets.</p>

               <p>bills there, amounting in the aggregate to 43<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which appeared to have been paid between 15th and 20th February—on the day of the re<lb></lb>mand I showed him those bills, and told him where I had found them—as to the account for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I said "I have made inquiries at this ad<lb></lb>dress, John, and find that this bill has been paid by your wife in gold"—he said "I handed to my wife 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold about three weeks before she left her situation"—I said "How do you account for the money?"—he said "I received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as commission for buying a house for Mr. Dellow," a person that the prisoner and I know well—I found on him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., several keys, and the letter produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was married on 21st February—I have known him many years—I have seen his wife—I produce the bill for 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd; it is for household furniture—he did not say "I have had no money since my mar<lb></lb>riage, and if you had asked my wife she would have told you that I gave her what money I could scrape together four weeks before we were married"—after the remand he said "I wish you had asked her about the money before, when you saw her the first time"—I did ask her, and I told him "Your wife said all the money she had when she was married was 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of her own money"—I saw a deposit note at his house for a watch and chain—his wife said it was her chain and his watch—it was pawned some time in March, I think—he did not tell me that he had been trying to raise more money for the purpose of buying more furniture, or borrowing money from his sister.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on my business at 27, Red Lion Square—I am an expert in handwriting—I have had a very large experience in the comparison of handwriting for about twenty years—I have had certain documents submitted to me in this case—I have looked at the forged cheque and at the documents A, B, C, D, E and F in the handwriting of the prisoner and in my opinion the same hand that wrote those documents wrote the forged cheque—the capital "B" in "Barnes" in the endorsements the cheque is as nearly as possible identical with the "B," in the name of a firm in the docu<lb></lb>ment marked D, the strong point about it, independently of its general form is the manner in which it is terminated very distinctively by a loop—the "B" in document "<hi rend="italic">D</hi>" is terminated in the same manner, also the "B" in document F in the same word "Barnes "and in the word "Barristers" in document C there is a peculiar habit of forming the B which the prisoner seems to have—then the small "h "in "John "in the endorsement to the forged cheque, is formed in an unusual manner, particularly the final part of it, and in the same word "John" in document C the "h" is formed in the same manner—the letter "n" in "John "and "London "in the cheque is terminated by a long up stroke, curved the wrong way, and in document C the "n" in "Tem<lb></lb>pleton" is terminated in the same way—the letter "m" in the word "sum" in the cheque is terminated more distinctly in that remarkable manner, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187504050019"></xptr>
               <p>again in "William" in document C—the letter "a" in "Barnes" is to my mind almost identical with the "a" in "Barristers" in document C, in both instances the loop is open at the top—the "o" in the abreviation "Co." in the forged cheque has appended to it a long dash in a similar manner to the "o" in the word "no" in document C—then the well-rounded letter "l" in "Child "in the cheque is like the "l" in the word "children" in paper marked B—the "f" in the word "five" in the cheque is looped above the line and below the line, and is like the "f" in the word "of" in the eleventh line of paper B—in the cheque beneath the abreviation "th" of the date, and beneath the abreviation "rs" in "Messrs." there are two firmly written lines, very short, and similar marks of abreviation, with precisely the same touch of hand, apparently to my mind made by the same hand, occurs in document C in the abreviation of the date "17th of March," and under the "re" of "Esquire," they correspond exactly—those are the principal points, there are minor matters besides—the endorsement is most like the prisoner's ordinary hand writing, I think the writing on the face of the cheque is assumed, and I will tell you why, the prisoner invariably forms his small letter "r" with its shoulder to the left—all the "r's" in these documents are found with the shoulder to the right with one exception, one inadvertence where it is in his natural hand, and that is the earliest "r" in "February" which is very well represented by the "r" in the abreviation respec'vely in docu<lb></lb>ment B.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not examined at the Police Court—I was first asked to look at this writing I think the day after Good Friday, I then gave no opinion—I had not then received all the documents to which I now refer—I can't recollect what I had, I had A and B, I don't know about the others—it was not till I had this document C, that I was perfectly satisfied it was the prisoner's handwriting—I at first said I was not satisfied, and would not give an opinion—all the matters in A and B, were not sufficient to justify my giving an absolute opinion, not sufficient to justify me in appearing against the prisoner—when I saw the document C, I said at once, "Now, I am perfectly satisfied"—I think I saw that on the following Monday—I did not see Mr. Dashwood—I have seen no one but Mr. Billing—I have had no documents before me except those to which I now refer—I was aware that the prisoner was in custody on a charge of forgery, and that he was to be examined before the Magistrate—after I had seen documents A and B, I did not attend at the Police Court—I should think I was about half an hour examining document C—I came to a con<lb></lb>clusion before I had it in my hand half an hour, but when I had examined it I was perfectly satisfied—I drew up my report on 2nd April, last Friday, the marks under the "th" <hi rend="italic">is not</hi> a very strong ground upon which I came to a conclusion—I should not come to a conclusion upon anyone ground taken by itself—some of the grounds are stronger than others—I have not weighed their relative strength—l take them cumulatively; the "h "is rather a strong point, the last turn of it is absolutely angular—I don't know that the writing on the face of the cheque is simulated; the endorse<lb></lb>ment is very nearly a natural hand; I don't know about its being absolutely the or dinary hand of the prisoner, but it is very much like, the hand in document C—the "John Barnes" seems to me very nearly like the natural hand of the prisoner, as nearly as possible—there is nothing to indicate that it is not a natural handwriting, it is the same stamp of hand as that on document C, but larger—I don't know that I can point out any</p>

               <p>difference—I don't know anything about the signature; I would not swear whether it is, or is not written by the same hand—I have not troubled about it; the only thing I should remark about it is that the up-stroke in the final "e" in Karslake has the same character as the final up-stroke in the letters "m," and "n"—I have been examined and cross-examined a great many times.</p>

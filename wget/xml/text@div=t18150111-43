               <p>Q. Did you and your husband go to see the prisoner and his wife on the 4th of December - A. Yes; after tea a gentlewoman and a gentleman came to tea with Mrs. Penton; she wanted to break the things on the mantle piece: in consequence of some difference between Mrs. Penton and Mr. Penton, Mrs. Penton took the crumpet out of the gentleman's hand, and she knocked it about the prisoner; she throwed the crumpet and the knife at Mr. Penton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it hit him - A. It went on one side; then she took the kettle off the fire, she said, she did not like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Like what - A. I do not know; that is what she said. She lifted up her hand and went to sweep all the china off the mantle-piece, and said, I will break every thing here; she did not break it, Mr. Penton stood up, and then went down stairs, and then I said to Mrs. Penton do not break the things, she then said she would break every thing in the house; she said I do not care for it, there is nothing will vex him more; then my son followed Mr. Penton down stairs, and then I went to see what kept my son, I went over the way to the public-house; Mr. Penton was there abominably drunk, he was in liquor. After supper my son brought Mr. Penton up stairs out of the public-house; I was going home, I said to Mrs. Penton do not say any more to him that night, and then I said to Mr. Penton if Mrs. Penton says any thing to you to-night, do not mind her; he said, no, I will go to bed; then I bid them good night, and left them; I know no more.</p>

               <p>MR. HUDSON. I am resident surgeon of St. Bartholomew Hospital. The deceased was brought to the Hospital on Monday, the 5th, she was accompanied by another woman, I do not know the name of the other person. She had a fracture on the let arm: I used proper means for the recovery, and ordered the sister to put her to bed; she complained of a slight pain in her right side; I offered to examine it, she stated that the pain was not very acute, she begged that I would examine her in the morning; accordingly on Tuesday morning I came about ten o'clock, and on examining her, I ascertained there was a fracture, I cannot state the number of ribs that were broken; I treated her as a fractured rib; I used proper means also for it. She grew worse, and complained of pain very much, at the same time the inflamation increased, very much blood was taken from her arm. On the same evening I saw her again, and the inflametary symptoms encreased. Mr. Wheeler, the apothecary, was called in, he thought proper to take more blood from her. On Wednesday morning she was seen by Sir Ladbrooke Harvey, he thought it advisable that the woman should be bled again; she was bled again. I saw her the same evening, she told me she was much relieved by the bleeding. I saw her again on Thursday morning, on finding her much worse, I called in Mr. Wheeler, the resident apothecary, he thought it advisable that more blood should be taken: On Friday she complained of being low spirited, she seemed to state that she was in great danger; I saw her again the same evening, she told me she thought she was going to die. On Friday morning she was visited by Sir Ladbrooke Harvey, he thought her if any thing better. I saw her again, the inflamatory symptoms encreased. He saw her again on the Saturday evening, he saw there was actual inflamation, he ordered me to bleed her copiously. On Sunday morning the inflamation was much encreased, and twelve o'clock at night she died; she was opened in the presence of Mr. Lawrence and myself, and the appearance was as if the lungs were much condenced through actual inflamation; on further examination we found that five or six true ribs were broken, of which the sixth rib peferated the plura, and pressed against the lungs; that was the only appearance inside; outside she was much bruised on her hips and shins.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the occasion of her death - A. She died of inflamation from the injury; the injury had caused the inflamation.</p>
               <p>Q You do not know but it might have been done by a chair being throwed against her, might it not - A. Yes; she told me it was on account of jealousy.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time she told you was she in a dying state - A. No. When she was in a dying state she told me she was in great danger, nothing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The husband used to visit her - A. He did; I was not present; he came once or twice.</p>

            . Q. What do you know about this matter - A. I live in the house. On Sunday they had company to dinner; they went away about eleven o'clock at night; that is all I know. I heard a little noise afterwards, nothing more than usual. Mrs. Penton when she had a little drink she would dance and stamp about. The last time I saw her was on Friday evening; she said, she was very ill. She always said it was her own fault, her husband would never say nothing to her if she did not begin it first; that was really the case; he was a very quiet indulgent man. When she was tipsey she was very quarrelsome, and very aggravating. I know what was the matter with her before. The woman went with her to the Hospital. She never told me who broke her arm; I do not know that she knew herself; she might have tumbled down. The man was a good husband as could be; she was always tormenting him.</p>

            . I am a servant at St. Bartholomews Hospital, and a constable. On Friday, going round with Mr. Hudson, the house surgeon, he called me of one side, and said the woman was in a bad state, she was labouring then very hard for breath; the surgeon said, Penton, the husband, should be taken into custody. I went then directly, and asked the woman if she thought herself in danger; she said, she did; she said, she had a few words with her husband, jealousy took place; he up with the chair, and broke her arm, and her ribs; she said they both were very much in liquor; she did not say any more. I then spoke to the surgeon, and apothecary they ordered me to take the man into custody; I went, and waited at a public-house opposite where Penton lived; between nine and ten Penton came in, he said, is that you Mr. Bray; I said, yes. He said, I know what you have come for; is my wife dead; I said Penton, she is in a very bad state, and you must go with me; I then took him to a public-house, and left him in the care of another officer while I went to search the premises to see if there was a chair broken; we searched the three pair of stairs that he worked in; there was no chair broken there, but in the one pair I found a chair broken; I then came and spoke to the prisoner; he said jealousy was the occasion of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. I suppose she said to you as she did to the others, that it was all her own fault - A. I have known the woman eleven years, she was a woman very much addicted to drinking.</p>

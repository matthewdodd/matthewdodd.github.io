                  </hi>. I live in Chapel-street, New-road—on the 20th of Sept. I saw the prisoner in Church-lane, Kensington, coming out of Mr. Salmon's premises, with a plank on his shoulder, drunk and staggering—I thought he would have fallen with it—I asked what he was going to do with it—he said it was lent him, and he was going up to Bayswater—I went to the George public-house and called Simpson—he and I went about a quarter of a mile—we found the prisoner with the plank and brought him back.</p>

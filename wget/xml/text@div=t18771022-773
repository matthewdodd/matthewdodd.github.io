                  </hi>. I am a French polisher, living at 48, Golden Lane—I was going home about one o'clock on the morning of 14th September, when I saw <hi rend="italic">the</hi> prisoner and another man and woman in Golden Lane—tho prisoner was showing his arm to a police constable—the woman went</p>

               <p>into the police station in Old Street, while the prisoner waited at the bottom—in the hearing of the prisoner, she said to the policeman, "What can I do with that young man, for he won't let me go neither one way nor the other? I would rather you lock me up than I go with hum"—the policeman said, "You go your way, and he will go his"—the prisoner went towards Whitecross Street, and 1 and the woman went down Wilderness Row, which are in different directions—when we got down Wilderness Bow some distance, I saw the prisoner, who ran across the road to us—we tried to avoid him, but he caught us up—he ran in front of the woman, and made a blow at her, saying, "Liz, I have done for you now, I will do my <hi rend="italic">drag</hi> for you"—the woman screamed, "Oh!" and I caught hold of her to assist her—the prisoner said, "I'd as lieve stick a knife into you as look at you"—I tried to assist her across the road, but she fell back in the middle of the road, and I was obliged to let go—a policeman came up, and she was conveyed to the station—I saw the prisoner with the policeman, and heard him say, "I'll hang for her"—he gave the policeman a knife, and said, "I have dune it; I will swing for her!"—as far as I saw, the woman gave him no pro<lb></lb>vocation.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before he struck the blow I did not hear him say any<lb></lb>thing to her—I said before the Coroner, "He got in front of her, and said, 'I'll do for you,' and then struck her in the breast"—I cannot say if it was the same constable at the police-station door that the prisoner was showing his arm to in Golden Lane—he had some bandages round his arm,—while he was showing his arm, the woman crossed over to the police Station—I also crossed over, and the prisoner stood listening, but did not say anything—the policeman refused to let her in, saying she had done nothing wrong—it was all in a minute or two after we commenced going in opposite directions that the prisoner rejoined us—the woman asked me to go home and sleep with her, saying he would not touch her if anybody was with her—I had been sleeping in a common lodging-house, and I gave the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the G division of police—on the morning of 13th September, about one, I was called to the Old Street station, and found a woman lying on one of the benches in a state of unconsciousness from which she never recovered—she died in about ten minutes—the front of her clothing was saturated with blood—there was a punctured wound about five-eighths of an inch in length over the left breast, from which the blood was flowing—at that time I was only able to trace it about an inch downwards, but I afterwards made <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) corresponds with the wound—it had penetrated the bony substance of the third rib, and gone into the left ventricle of the heart—considerable violence must have been used—she died from the effects of that wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was extensive adhesion of the left lung, the result of which was to throw the heart considerably forward on the wall of the chest—with the heart in that abnormal condition it would require a wound of lesser depth and force to penetrate it than under ordinary circumstances—the wound went into the cavity of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Considerable violence must have been used, because the knife penetrated the bone—as a rule, when the rib is struck it yields, or breaks, or the substance is struck off, but in this case it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220042"></xptr>
               <p>went directly through the bone—had the heart not been displaced the wound would have penetrated the lung—that would not necessarily have been fatal.</p>

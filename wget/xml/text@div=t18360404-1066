                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Foreign Post Office. On the 4th of March I was on duty at the window—i came on duty between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, and remained till six o'clock in the evening—Mr. Arrowsmith was with me part of the time—we told up some money at three o'clock in the afternoon—that was part of the money we had received in the course of the day for forwarding letter—we separated the gold from the silver and copper—there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in copper—when I had counted the money I placed it in a drawer by my side—the gold was on the lid of my charge box, by the window—a person could not reach it from without by putting his arm through the window—after counting up the money Mr. Barmen and Bailey the messenger were in the office besides us—Bailey was not near the box after I put the money there—the prisoner is a Presidents in the Foreign Office—he came to the office about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon—the money was then lying where it had been before—I was at the window, and Mr. Arrowsmith was at the fire-place—while I was there Mr. Campbell came to the window, outside—he belongs to the Post Office—he had something to say—after he said what he had to say to me, the prisoner came to the window and spoke to him—I went and stood behind the window and when Mr. Campbell went I closed the window—I left the alphabet which we call the window, and went to the fire-place, leaving the prisoner in the alphabet where the window is—(I bad counted the money twice before Mr. Campbell came up—Mr. Arrowsmith counted it with me—we had a reason for being particular in counting the money—the prisoner came to the window two or three minutes after we had last counted it, and it was not touched by any person from the time I counted it till he camel—the prisoner stood at the window two or three minutes—he then came and opened the door of the screen, and looked out, and then closed the door again—the screen is between the window and the fire-place—it would hide day body at the window from the sight of any one at the fire-place—he came out afterwards, to where we were standing, and we returned to the window—he staid in the office—we counted the money again, and found that one sovereign was missing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had there any body been near the place who could have taken the mo<lb></lb>ney form the time you put it in to missed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nobody</p>

               <p>except myself—the prisoner was near enough to have taken it—I had some packet of letters counted and made up—they were counted by the amount of postage, in parcels of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—shortly after I missed the money I found one of the packets was much smaller than I had left it—that was shortly five o'clock—I found 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of letters wanting—the money I produce from the office must tally with the letters I produce—the prisoner knew that—shortly after seven o'clock, he came to me and told me the parcels after me)—he parcels of letters 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. short—(he counted the parcels after me)—he told me if I would write an allowance for that amount he would sign it—I did so, and he signed it—this is it; "Allow 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., J. Barnes"—it is dated on the back—it is an old ticket of mine—that is the docket he singed—it makes even the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. wanting—I am sure I had not miscounted the letters that day—the signing of this paper for the 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would make up the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which would ac<lb></lb>count for the sovereign—this "J. Barnes" is the prisoner's hand—writing—this making an allowance is a very unusual circumstance—i never knew it happen before—I have been in the office fifteen months—the proper course if a mistake is made is to re-tell the letters by a third person, and deduct the amount deficient from my charge ticket.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did such an abstraction of those letters much diminish the size of the parcel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a great deal—I noticed it myself, I cannot answer for other—if clerk had told them up he might have missed them at a glance—I missed nearly half a parcel—the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. parcels are generally of the same bulk—when I missed the letters I made up the deficiency with other letter, which I took from some that had not been told up—I cannot tell the postage on any single-letters—I am the junior clerk in the Foreign Office—there is a sum of the King's money given to me by the Superin<lb></lb>tending President—we do not appropriate it to out own uses—it is 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—it is sometimes less, but never more; at least, I do not have that money—Mr. Turnbull, the marker-up, is appointed to control it—there are two makers-up, I believe—the superintending President authorizes the maker-up to give me that money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I wish to know whether any of the Crown money is not appropriated by you occasionally among yourselves, or some of you, for your own par<lb></lb>poses?</p>

               <p>quickness—Mr. Barnes is not a very quick counter—I do not know whether he is as quick as me, I never tried—I sometimes make mistakes, it is Mr. Barnes's duty to reprove me when he is on duty—he has done so rather frequently—there are sixteen clerks in the Foreign Office—there are servants, who clean out the rooms—this is a public room in the office, to which all have access, on business, but not otherwise—visitors are ex<lb></lb>cluded—presidents, clerks or messengers not on duty are not excluded—persons that do not belong to the office, coming there to ask question are excluded—i believe that is a regulation of the office—I never saw stran<lb></lb>gers there—a stranger calling on Mr. Barnes would be sent round to the waiting-room—i should say he would be refused admission into the office—I have seen him bring his son in—I know it was Mr. Campbell came it a the window—I opened it—that was my duty—Mr. Arrowsmith was as the fire-place all that time, leaving me and Mr. Barnes behind the screen, out of his sight—Mr. Campbell staid there two or three minutes—I heard the conversation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many clerks are there between you and the situation of President to which you are supposed to aspire? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Thirteen—they would all take it before me in regular rotation—I have heard of one appointed made by the Postmaster-general independent of that ro<lb></lb>tation—the prisoner is already removed—the stolen sovereign has nothing to do with the 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my charge—that is given to me for incidental ex<lb></lb>penses, and not at all connected with the money received for postage—the prisoner did not reprove me for any mistake that day—if any body took the letters away, they would know the amount of them—if any body outside had opened the window, the spring would have made a great noise—no such noise occurred while the prisoner was there—when I said the sum in the box was 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I corrected myself immediately—i did not leave the al<lb></lb>phabet, after counting the money the second time, till after the prisoner came, and then I went to the fire-place—the prisoner was asleep after the so<lb></lb>vereign had been missed, and before I gave him the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—there was no one but Mr. Arrowsmith, my self, a messenger, and the prisoner is the office till the sovereign was missing—if Mr. Barnes brought a friend with him, he would he admitted into the office.</p>

               <p>counted money into the drawer—there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in gold among the counted money, on the lid of a charge-box—i counted it, it was all gold—four sovereigns and three three half sovereigns—this was in the window-room, which is parted off by a screen from the rest of the office—i should think the gold was three or four feet from the window—nobody could reach it from the outside—the prisoner joined us again about three minutes after we had counted the money—we had then returned to the fire-place, and were talking—there was a rap at the window, Mr. Young went to at<lb></lb>tend to it—it was Mr. Campbell, from the Secretary's Office—Mr. Barnes and it was Mr. Campbell and he would go and speak to him him<lb></lb>self—he went to the window—Mr. Campbell did not stop long—I heard the window close, on which I called Mr. Young to me—he immediately came—the prisoner remained in the window-room for about a minute—he then opened the door of the screen, observed us sitting down by the fire, and returned into the window-room, and the screen-door closed—it closes with a spring—he staid there about two minutes from the time of him open<lb></lb>ing the door—he then came into about the middle of the office, between the screen and the fire, and joined us at the fire—Mr. Young and I immediately went to the window, in about a minute after his coming out—about four minutes elapsed between Mr. Young's coming out of the window-room and my going in with him—the prisoner was then in the office, near the fire—we counted the money—there were only three sovereigns and three half-sovereigns—nobody had been within the screen but the prisoner from the time we counted the money till we returned to the window—there was only one messenger in the office at the time, and he was sitting at the further end of the office—i must have seen if he went into the window-room, for I was sitting opposite the door—there is only one door to the screen—the screen completely closes the window in, but does not run from wall to wall—a person cannot get into the room in any other way but through the door, unless he climbed over it, and it is nine or ten feet high—or through a small window at the other end, and then I must have seen him pass that way—I could see the messenger from where I was standing—I must have seen him if he had gone into the screen—he had no business there that I was aware of—my attention was particularly called to the transaction—I had mentioned something to Mr. Wagstaff.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any thing whatever to prevent you, if you thought he had taken the sovereign, to have had him searched on the spot, and called in assistance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was an objection—there was nothing to prevent my doing so if I chose—I was desired by Mr. Wagstaff not to mark the money—there was no search made—the sovereign was mentioned to Mr. Barnes himself by the solicitor next morning—i do not know whether Mr. Young was present—i think he was there was no search made for the letters that night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If Mr. Barnes had taken letters that must they not have been detected on his person, if he was searched? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, they might not, because he might have sorted them off to their different destination—there would not be say postage inquired for—Mr. Barnes charges the postage to the junior—he might have left them if he contermplated a fraud; but it could not have been discovered that the had taken them; he might have sorted them off without it being discovered that the had taken them—it would have concealed his part in the transaction—the sorting of the letters is done at the left-hand side of the of the room from the fire—they are sorted off in two boxes on the left-hand side from fire-place—they are two boxes, with the separate countries written on the different boxes—Mr. Barnes having got the letters, might have sorted them off in these boxes, without its ever being known that he had that them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any thing to prevent your going to Mr. Wagstaff and in<lb></lb>forming him of the fact, and getting an offer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know how to act exactly—there was nothing to prevent my reporting it to Mr. Wag<lb></lb>staff and he might have done what he pleased—there is always an officer in attendance at the Post Office—I could have followed Mr. Barnes till six o'clock to see what he did with the letters; but Mr. Young's duty was at the window.</p>

SCARLETT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Take this plan in your hand (<hi rend="italic">handing him one</hi>) the window opens into a hall? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; Mr. Campbell came to that window—a person putting his hand in at the window would first come to a stone✗ ledge—he would have to reach his hand over a wall, which is three-quarters of a yard—there is then a wooden ledge, inside the room—a person's area must be about a yard and a half long to reach the box—the peculiar situa<lb></lb>tion of the window would prevent a person reaching his body in—Mr. Wag<lb></lb>staff had desired em to be very particular in observing the different thing I had accused Mr. Barnes of—Mr. Wagstaff was not on duty, I believe, at the time I made this discovery—i made a reported to him that night—then were two bundles of letters with the money—we do up a bundle, amount<lb></lb>ing to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that is the usual amount of a bundle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does it never vary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the usual mode—I never knew it very, but it might have been done so on this occasion—I cannot swear they were counted up—we never tell them up till they come to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the last bundle might be less then the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SCARLETT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you observe the size them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they were nearly of an equal size—they appeared 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bundle—if the money had been taken away and the letters left, it would have excited suspicion—I did not look at the letter afterwards—the sorting begins at six o'clock—it would not be a remarkable circumstance to sort letters before that—if these letters had been taken, they might have been sorted out, and sent to their destination, so that they could be found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Secretaries' Office. On Friday, the 4th of March, I went to the window of the Foreign Office, at the out<lb></lb>side, in the hall—I rapped at the window, k and Mr. Young came—it was nearly a quarter to five o'clock, it might be a few minutes earlier—Mr. Barnes came to the window within a minute or two afterwards—I had some conversation with him—I was at the window altogether about five minutes, or from three to five—I left Mr. Barnes at the window, and Mr. Young behind it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in the Foreign Office on the 4th of March, when this matter occurred? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was sitting by the messenger's fire—I had a view of the screen-door—I heard some<lb></lb>body come to the window about half-past four or five o'clock—to the best of my belief it was about the time—Mr. Barnes went through the door to speak to the person at the window, but the moment the person went away, he immediately came towards the fire—I should think he was hardly two minutes inside the screen speaking to the person—it might be three minutes—I heard the window close when the person left, and immediately Mr. Barnes came away, the door closed—he came into the office where I was—I was looking at the door in the screen—I did not see Mr. Barnes came and open the door, and shut it and go back—he never left the office while I was there, and I never left till eight o'clock—he went either to the five-place or his desk, but I believe to the fire-place—he did not go to the door of the screen again, to the best of my belief—I never saw him there afterwards—I do not remember Mr. Arrowsmith leaving the office—I left at eight o'clock, and they were all of them there then—Mr. Young remained there till about seven o'clock in the evening I should think—to the best of my belief the prisoner did not go through the door in the screen after the time I have mentioned, during the time Mr. Young was there—there has frequently been money dropped by accident in the room—I once found three or four sovereigns and some silver in a piece of brown paper, which I gave to Mr. Barnes, the President—the paper was not tied up—I heard something when I was sweeping the office, and took it up, and gave it to Mr. Barnes—I found two sovereigns on the desk once—they were the property of Mr. Kelwell, another clerk—I returned them to him—I once found half-a-sovereign in the middle of the office, and gave it to the Pre<lb></lb>sident, and to the best of my knowledge it was never owned.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>I was examined by Mr. Peacock on the business on the Saturday—I was not at Bow-street—I was subpœned here by the Post Office.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner, in a long address, entered into the same arguments as on the former trials—with reference to the charge in question, he most posi<lb></lb>tively asserted his innocence, and stated that he was not half a minute within the screen at the time stated by the witnesses—that afterwards, on examining a parcel of letter made up by Mr. Young he found them to amount to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. instead of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and accordingly gave him a docket for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>—that there was scarcely a night he was on duty, that he had not written dockets for various sums, instead of it being an unusual circum<lb></lb>stance, as stated by Mr. Young. He received an excellent character as on the former trial.)</p>

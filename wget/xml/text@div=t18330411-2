            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the 25th of February, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, in Brick-lane, Spitalfields; I saw him with a small bundle, which he appeared to wish to conceal from me: I stopped him, and asked what he had got - he said he had got a pair of trousers: I asked if they were his own - he said they were; I then asked where he bought them - he said in Globe-road; I asked the person's name he bought them of - he could not tell me, nor the number of the house: there was nothing but the trousers in the bundle - I took him to the station-house, searched him, and found the coat on his back, which Barnet afterwards claimed at Worship-street; I found the napkin in his trousers pocket - Barnet described it before he saw it, and gave me the name and number; there were two companions with the prisoner, who ran away when I went to lay hold of him; they went off both together - they had no bundle: I took him to Worship-street, and that afternoon found out the prosecutor - I saw the box which had the staple broken; the street door had no marks of violence on it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The other two were not with me. Witness. I am certain there were two persons in his company, and when I stopped him he was trying to hide himself behind them with the bundle - when they got off they hallooed to him to come along, and asked what he wanted with that fool.</p>

               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

On the 3d of December, between seven and eight o'clock, from the information of some boys, I overtook the prisoner with a cheese under his arm in Harper street; I pursued him to Boswell court; he dropped the cheese in Harper street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him drop the cheese - A. No; a lad picked it up that is gone to sea. I saw him have the cheese, that was when I first saw him; when I laid hold of him I told him he had stole a cheese; he said nothing. The officer has had the cheese ever since; it weighed about eighteen pounds.</p>

            . I was standing nearly opposite of Mr. Taylor's door, I saw the prisoner go in Mr. Taylor's shop first, take something out of the shop, I think it was a piece of cheese, he came out and gave what he had taken from the shop to another one; there were three standing at the door while he went in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you saw him take something from the shop - A. I am quite sure, and he handed something to one of the other three. The prisoner went into the shop again and took a whole cheese; then Sealy and two more went down Theobald's road, the other ran up Red Lion square, shaking his head at Smith, another boy, and me, we were standing together; we went and told Mr. Taylor, Mr. Taylor came with us and we shewed him the men; I saw him overtake the prisoner; the prisoner dropped the cheese in Harper street; I saw him drop it.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witnesses to character.</p>

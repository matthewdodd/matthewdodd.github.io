               <p>Should you have known him if he had not been dirty? - Yes, I saw his person, he had on an oil skin round hat, and a rough waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Palmer. I had been into Devonshire to see my friends, and I came back by the Bristol and Bath stage, I was an outside passenger, on the roof, my box was in the basket, when I came to the inn, I missed my box, and I saw my box in the street, and I called to the coachman, and said that is my box; the coachman is not in town.</p>

               <p>When White came into the Three Cups, he asked which was the prisoner, he said, if I was the person, I must be all over dirt, there was no dirt about me but a few spots behind, it was a rainy night, there was no dirt on my breeches: my master has been waiting ever since Wednesday. White said, he would serve me as one Sideaway was served.</p>

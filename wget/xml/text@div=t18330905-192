            . I saw the prisoner go to the house, lift up the window, and take out the copper; he did not go in - he went up the town with it, and turned towards the Junction-road - I called to him "Master, put down that copper" - he put it down, and said "Here, my dear, I shall go." - he then ran off, I pursued him crying "Stop thief," the policeman and another man pursued him - the prisoner fell down and the policeman fell over him; the prisoner got up and ran again, but was taken - I never lost sight of him; I am sure he is the man.</p>

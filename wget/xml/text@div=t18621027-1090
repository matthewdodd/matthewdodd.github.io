On the morning of 22d October, about ten minutes to 4, from information I received, I went with Ridger, another officer, to the City Arms public-house, kept by Mr. Windust—I was admitted at the front door by Mr. Windust, and on crossing the bar, I found the door leading from the bar into the passage forced open—I searched in the passage leading to the private door, and found this dark</p>

I live at 4, Bishop's-court, Old Bailey, and am a cab-driver—on the morning of 22d October, about 4 o'clock, my cab was on the rank in Smithfield—I was in a coffee-house at Smithfield-bars—the prisoner, Charles Williams, called me out, and said he wanted me to drive him and two others to Windmill-street, Haymarket—when I got out I saw two other men, one of whom I believe to be John Williams—one of them got in at the other side of the cab, the other one had got in before—I shut the door, and as I was turning the cab, the policeman Sparkes came up and spoke to me—as I was going towards the station-house, one of the men opened the door on one side of the cab, and made his escape in the direction of Long-lane—the other opened the other door, and escaped towards Skinner-street, Snow-hill—Charles Williams was about to follow his example, but I jumped off the box, and, with the assistance of Sparkes, secured him—I did not examine the cab, but I told the constable to do so—I did not see any centre-bit in my cab—there was one produced at the station—there was no centre-bit, to my knowledge, in the cab when I last examined it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, G</hi> 210). I was on duty on the morning of 22d October, about 4 o'clock, and saw John Williams come out of Eagle-court and turn up Albion-place—he was followed by Warrington—I ran through St. John's-square-passage into St. John's-lane, and found him in Warrington's custody—I went to Albion-place, but could not find any money; I then went into St. John's-lane, where I picked up two brown paper packages containing some coppers, and there were a great many lying on the ground—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the brown paper—there were very few coppers in the papers, but a great many lying on the ground—I then went into Peter's-lane, where I picked up another brown paper, nearly empty—there were a good many coppers lying on the ground there—I returned again to Albion-place, where I found a great number of coppers had been dropped through gratings into kitchen areas—I got 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., altogether in coppers.</p>

I was on duty in Victoria-street, about 2 o'clock in the morning on 22d October, and saw John William in the ruins there—I asked him what he was doing down there, and he said he went down there for convenience—I said that he had better come out of there, and with that he walked away—he had on the red comforter which he is wearing now; that was all I could see of his clothes.</p>

I was on duty in Holborn on the night of 21st October, and saw Charles Williams standing at the corner of King's Head-court, about half-past 11 o'clock—I followed him down to the corner of Shoe-lane, in the direction of Farringdon-street</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Charles Williams.</hi> At Guildhall, a man was called, who said he saw the three prisoners come out of the public-house where the robbery was com<lb></lb>mitted, and proceed up Victoria-street He is not brought forward now, because he could not identify us. Sparkes said he first saw us in St. John's-court, which is in an opposite direction to Victoria-street, so we could not have been coming from Mr. Windust's house. I think it is very hard that the man is not here to-day.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw three men come out of Mr. Windust's door, and proceed up Victoria-street, at twenty minutes to 4—I was going to work, and I saw the side door open and suddenly shut—that made me turn round, and they went up Victoria-street—I could not tell at all who they were—I gave information directly to the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Charles Williams' Defence.</hi> Mr. Windust attempts to swear to five out of the eight packages. If you look at one of them, you will find that neither of them correspond with the time table. Those packages which were done up in paper by the police-sergeant, were done up to show that they were found on me, and they swore at Guildhall that they were found on me. As to the centre-bits, if any of the Jury are mechanics, they will know that nine centre-bits out of ten will fit any stock.</p>

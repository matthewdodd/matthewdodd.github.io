On Sunday the 6th of October, 1771, I had the stock looked over, to see if he had done me justice; he was trusted in my business; I found there was a deficiency in the stock and suspected him; a gentleman wanted to see a diamond ring he had pledged for twenty guineas; the prisoner pretended he could not see it because he had lost the key of the small till where it lay; I accused him for what we call the backsides of the trade, that is the profits, and he said he would make me full satisfaction on Monday morning; he came home about half after eleven, or a quarter before twelve o'clock; I was gone to bed; Greenwood let him in; I heard his voice, then I fell asleep; he went out again, and I did not hear of him for a twelvemonth; the next morning I ordered a smith to come and pick the lock of the till, and I missed a stop silver watch that was my own, a gold medal, twenty gold rings and a silver tea pot, that were pledged the latter end of August; I saw an advertisement from Southampton, with an information of a suspicious person that had a gold medal there. I got a warrant and went to Southampton; I found him there in gaol for debt; the sheriff would not let him be taken away that time, so I came up, and went down again for him, and brought him up, and he was committed at Hithe; I enquired after my property, and at Mrs. Rawlins's, a public house, I saw this gold medal; the last time I went down, I got intelligence that my stop watch was with one Mr. Everidge, at Hawley, near Southampton; I charged the prisoner with stealing the things; he said he was sorry for it, he could not help it, the Devil possessed him. (The medal produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. To the best of my knowledge I believe it is the medal that was pledged with me. (The stop watch-produced.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I can swear this is my watch; the watch was put in the window for a show four or five months before he absconded.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination, he said,</p>
               <p>"that</p>
               <p>"there was a kind of an agreement between</p>
               <p>"them in 1770 to come into partnership; that</p>
               <p>"they were to have a partnership if the prisoner</p>
               <p>"could raise money; that he took the house,</p>
               <p>"and that the prisoner carried on the business</p>
               <p>"for him during his confinement; that he was</p>
               <p>"to give him fifty guineas for the first year,</p>
               <p>"and if it answered, he was to give him a</p>
               <p>"hundred guineas afterwards; that the articles</p>
               <p>"of agreement for the partnership, did not</p>

               <p>"a partnership; that they opened a shop in</p>
               <p>"November 1770, and the prisoner was to be</p>
               <p>"his servant; that the prisoner took money</p>
               <p>"out of the till to pay himself; that he told</p>

               <p>"did not mean he should have a share in the</p>

               <p>"was; that he does not know whether or no it</p>

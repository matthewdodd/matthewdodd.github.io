I am the wife of Manoel De Sa Pimentel—I live in Northumberland-street, Paddington—my husband was an inmate of Bethlehem Hospital in 1848—I got him out in Feb. 1849, as he had a wish to get out—I had known the prisoner Simpson some time—I spoke to him on the subject, and he said he could get me a keeper to take care of my husband when he came out—my husband has some money, the dividends on which</p>

Bank-note, and some sovereigns—on the day after that, he was very troublesome, and we got another keeper—Simpkins said it would be better to put him back to the asylum—Simpkins went with me to get an order for his re-admission—on our return, Simpkins called at I public-house, and he met the prisoner Bond—he seemed to know him, and they said they would find two strong men to assist Turner, my husband's keeper, but they never said they would come themselves—on the Friday, Simpkins came into our parlour, and said, "Oh, Turner, you have done it!"—he said, "What have I done?"—he said, "You have told your mother that we were going to rob Pimentel to-day," and he kneeled down and said, 80 help him God it was not true—Bond and the other men rushed into the room, and Simpkins locked me out—I tried to get in, but he would not let me—Simpkins then called for paper and pen and ink, and then I got in, and then was the money on the drawers—Bond was looking at the note, and he put the note and money into his pocket—Simpkins asked me for the certificate of my marriage; I took it out of my pocket, and he took it and put it into his pocket, that was before they had got the money—before they left the room I asked if they would not give me some money, and they would not—I afterwards went to Simpkins' house to ask for my money—he took up a knife to me twice, and gave me most gross language, and called me horrid names—I never got my money.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 255). I took Bond into custody on 19th May, in Oriel-place, College-street, Chelsea.

                  <hi rend="italic">Bond's Defence.</hi> On the Wednesday morning in Feb., I was going through the street, and was called by Simpkins; I was introduced to the parlour, and had conversation with Mr. Pimentel as to where he had been, and where I had been; on the Friday morning, when we went into the room it was Tur<lb></lb>ner who had the straight waistcoat—Mr. Pimentel picked me out, and said, "I will place my money in his hand;" he gave me six sovereigns, and he took a pen and ink at my request, and took an account of it; I received the money, and this dividend-warrant in trust; I said, "What is to be done, am I to pay Mr. Simpkins?"—he said, "Yes"—"Am I to pay the expenses of to-day?"—he said, "Yes;"—"Am I to pay the rent?"—he said, "Yea;" Mrs. Pimentel was then in the room; I took a piece of paper, and wrote what was to be done; I asked him if Turner was to be paid; he said dis<lb></lb>tinctly, "No;" I asked if I was to give the residue of the money to his wife, and he told me I was to keep it till he returned from Bethlehem; he</p>

                  </hi>, Jun. I am an engraver, of No. 9, Austin-friars. I was at home on the evening of 27th Sept, and about half past 5 o'clock I went up to the third landing, where I saw the prisoner in the act of getting some things out of a box—there were two boxes; one covered with leather, and one tin box—the lid of the leather covered box was taken off and several articles taken out—the leather covered box was on the tin box—there were two bodies of dresses, three towels, a piece of crochet work, two curtains, a piece of needlework, and a silk waistcoat, and, I think, a cloak—they were the property of my father, William Bendall White—I saw the prisoner sitting upon the box; I asked him what he was doing—he said that he wanted Mr. Cook—I could not rightly understand the name—I asked him what he was doing with the box—I understood him to say, "What box?"—I came down stairs; he followed me—I called a young friend, sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—I had been up about thirty-five minutes before; the boxes were then safe—the house is let out in offices, so that any one can get in—there are no offices on the third floor, but a gentleman on the first floor has one of the rooms on that floor—my father is the housekeeper.</p>

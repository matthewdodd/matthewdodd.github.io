                  </hi>. I am a salesman at Messrs. Perks, Shad Thames, and live at 18, Trinity-square, in the house of Mr. Whittel, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington—on the morning of 10th April I left my home as usual, and, I believe, I left in the chest of drawers in my room, four waist-coats, two shirts, and other articles—t afterwards saw a portion of them at, the station-house—I returned home at half-past I on the morning of the 11th, and found my room in a general state of confusion—it is on the first-floor back a bedroom—the drawers were emptied, and the clothes scattered all about the room—I did not examine sufficiently to miss any articles at that time—I called the servant—I Afterwards saw the prisoner in custody at the police-station, and these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which are mine—the pri<lb></lb>soner had some of the things on—I believe they were taken from him at the police-station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Did yon not say when yon came to the station that you believed those were the clothes, and that if they were they would be marked? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I examined the shirt—I did not notice any marks, but I did not examine it thoroughly—I did not know at the time where they were marked—I asked to take the shirt home with me to compare it with some that I had—I was not half an hour away, I believe—I will swear I brought back</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Whittel, of 18, Trinity-square—on 10th April, we went to bed at twenty minutes to 11—I made the house secure, in the usual way; we are rather careless—the front kitchen window was closed; I cannot say it was fastened—the window-shutters were to, and a desk and work-box were against the shutters—I went into Mr. Madge's room as I went up stairs, and it was perfectly straight, as usual—at about 2 o'clock—I was called up—I went down stairs, found the kitchen shutters were open, and the work-box and desk on the floor, and the contents turned out—there was a mark on the area railings, as if some one had put their foot over and come down the wall; there are no steps or gate to the area—if a person got into the area, he had nothing to do but throw up the window to get in—I afterwards went into the front parlour—I looked under the table, and there was a man there—there was light enough for me to perceive that he was in his shirt sleeves, and had no shoes on—he rushed past me to the front door, which was open, and rushed out—I do not know who had opened the front door.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What time was it when you were awoke? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As near as I can guess, about a quarter to 2—about twenty minute* elapsed from my first being awaked to the person leaving the house—I was up stairs, looking over the place.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 130). On the morning of the 11th April, I was on duty in Trinity-square—I heard a cry of "Police," and went to No. 18, and first went into the front kitchen—in the parlour I found four waistcoats and two shirts, which had been conveyed there from the bedroom—those were afterwards claimed by Mr. Madge—I went to Mr. Madge's room, and found a coat, two dirty shirts, and a pair of blucher boots there—Mr. Madge, at the police-station, first told me the articles found were his; then he afterwards said, "Let me hare them and put them on"—they fitted him pretty well—I had ordered the prisoner to take them off—in the pocket of the prisoner's clothes I found a seaman's discharge, and some matches—when I took the prisoner to the station-house, he had on some of the prosecutor's' clothes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you accompany Mr. Madge to the station-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I said, "Here he is"—from the description Mr. Madge gave to me, I told him to come to the station-house, and most probably he would see the man—the description was, a person going away without shoes and stockings, in his shirt sleeves, and without a hat—you were ordered to take off the clothes, and he tried to find a name on them, but without success—he then asked for the shirt to take home and compare with the others—the shirt did not go out of my sight—the mark on the shirt I did look for, but it was almost invisible—there was a gas light there—Mr. Madge said he had every reason to believe the articles were his.</p>

               <p>On Saturday morning I got up about five o'clock, and I went into Whitechapel; in Bishopsgate-street I met a young man an acquaintance, at the top of Houndsditch there stood a carpenter whom I knew by sight but not his name, he asked me where I was going, I said to work, he said go and lend me a hand, I have a bedstead to make, and have just bought the pillars, they stand at the corner, go and fetch them says he, they are at the door there says he, come make haste; so I took them on my shoulders and brought them up to the street, I thought he was behind me; and Mr. Cosfield came and asked me if I was going with them.</p>
               <p>Who was this man? - A carpenter I have been in company with different times, I do not know his name, nor where he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290110"></xptr> lives ; the man sent me for the posts, but whether he is here or not I cannot say.</p>

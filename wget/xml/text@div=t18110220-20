               <p>JAMES GILLMORE. I am an officer. On the 3d of January, at night, the prisoner was in custody at Queen square office. In consequence of a pair of shoes being stopped at a pawnbrokers she had sold these shoes to a woman of the name of Greenfield; she then said that a young man whom she had never seen before had given her these shoes to sleep with her. On the 24th I had further information, I searched her apartment; I saw her hand in her pocket, she was endeavouring to give something to Greenfield. I took possession of that pocket which contained a little red pocket book; in that pocket book I found two duplicates for two pair of shoes, pawned on the 3d of January.</p>
               <p>Q. They were for the shoes for which the pawnbrokers have been examined - A. Yes. The prisoner said some young man had given her the duplicates.</p>

            . I live on the same floor. Coming down stairs I met Mr. Bly; he took a key, from a comrade of the prisoner's; looking round the room I saw a handkerchief; Mr. Bly took the handkerchief; he never said to me what was in it.</p>
               <p>MR. BLY. On Sunday morning the 3d of July, about ten o'clock, the prosecutor came to me and said the prisoner had robbed him of his watch. I went to search the room. Between the tiling I found a handkerchief; in the handkerchief this watch was hid; I brought it to the prosecutor, he said it was his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the money - A. No.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got up in the morning and went into the public house; this gentleman came and took me up. I asked him five shillings to sleep with me; he said he had no more than three shillings. I saw no watch; if I had known where the watch was, from eight o'clock till ten, I should have known where to have made away with it.</p>

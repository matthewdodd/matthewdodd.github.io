            . I keep the Fox and Anchor Inn in Charter-house-lane; on Wednesday the 7th of September the mare was brought to my house about four in the afternoon by the prisoner; he put her up, and said he would call again the next morning; I never saw him from that time till the Tuesday following, which was the 12th; on the Saturday there came a man that said he came from the man that brought her, to know the expences; that man came again with spurs on, and no boots, and a whip in his hand, and said he came to pay the expences, and to take the mare away; I said, I should be glad to know what sort of a person you take me to be, to deliver the mare to the person I knew nothing of, without authority from the person that brought her; he went away: on the Monday morning I saw the advertisement in the paper, describing her; in consequence I wrote to Mr. Cooke in the Borough, where the advertisement directed; he came and said it was the very mare that was advertised for: on the Tuesday morning the prisoner came for the mare, my wife sent a message to Mr. Cooke, to let him know the man was come; I came down stairs, he desired I would make my bill out; I told him it was so much corn, and five shillings he borrowed of me when he came with her; I had got a constable ready, we secured him, and in four or five hours Mr. Wells and Mr. Cooke came; he said he knew nothing about stealing the mare; when he brought her, I think he said he was a farmer at Harrow, and had sold a load of hay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how long he had had her?</p>
               <p>Taber. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>I had been to Camberwell, and returning from there about half an hour after eight on the Monday night, there was this mare upon a little green with a bridle and saddle on, and a whip tied to her stirrup; I hallooed to see if she had throwed any body, I could find no body; I took and rode her, and put her up on the Wednesday at Mr. Taber's house; he says I borrowed five shillings of him, I had six shillings of him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Taber Did he tell you any thing about finding the mare?</p>
               <p>Taber. No, he did not.</p>

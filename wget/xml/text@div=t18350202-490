                  </hi>. I keep a public house at Enfield. On the 15th of January, the prisoner came to the house, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and asked for a bed for the night—he had some refreshment—remained there till about ten o'clock, and was shown to bed; and in the morning he was rather late in getting up—I sent the servant to call him, but just at</p>

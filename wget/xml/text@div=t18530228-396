                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live in Redcross-square. I was going down Tower-street, and saw Evans pick the prosecutor's pocket; he lifted up the tail of his coat, and took the handkerchief out—Bennett was about three yards behind Evans—I had seen them both following a gentleman about half a minute before that, walking about three yards behind each other—after Evans took the handkerchief, he crossed the road, and I told the prosecutor what I had seen—Evans crossed the road, and went down Waterlane, and I there saw Bennett walking by his side—I heard the prosecutor call out, "Stop thief!"—Evans ran away, and was stopped at the bottom of Water-lane, and Bennett was stopped at once by another witness.</p>

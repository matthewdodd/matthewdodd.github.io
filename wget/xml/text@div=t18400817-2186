I took the prisoner on the 13th of August—Dawson, a pawnbroker was with him, and gave me a spoon, and said he had stated in his presence, as he was going over the heath with him, to ascertain whether what he said about the spoon was correct, that it was of no use to have any further trouble about it, that he bad brought it from his father, and in taking him to the station-house he said he had not brought it from his father, but took it from a lodger—I found the earrings, brooch, and locket on him—he said they belonged to the same person as the spoon.</p>

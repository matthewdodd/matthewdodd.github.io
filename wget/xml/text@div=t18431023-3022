The prisoner was in my service for two years—between six and seven o'clock in the morning of the 10th of Sept. 1842, I gave him a box, containing two gold-beaters' moulds, and three half-ounces of gold, in a partly manufactured state—he worked down stairs in the shop, and I saw nothing more of him till he was taken—I went into an upper shop, and between seven and eight o'clock the bell rang for me—I went down, and his partner gave me information—I found he was gone—I then saw his box, and found it was empty—I sent to the police-office—I did not see the prisoner again till the 13th of Oct., thirteen mdntbs afterwards—I then saw him oppo<lb></lb>site Haggerston church—I collared him, and said, "Halloo, I have got you at last"—he said, "For God's sake, don't take my liberty from me, I will pay you"—I said, "We must investigate this matter further"—he after<lb></lb>wards begged of me to give him his liberty for the sake of his wife and children—I said, "What is the use of talking of your wife and children, when you have been of no use to them the last thirteen months? you have not been near them."</p>

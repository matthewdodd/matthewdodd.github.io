            . I live in the Curtain-road, Shoreditch. On the 28th of December, about a quarter past nine o'clock, I was going down <placeName id="t18220109-25-crimeloc131">Sun-street, Finsbury</placeName>

I passed on about ten yards, and received a blow on the side of my head from a person behind; I did not see who struck me. I looked round, instantly, and my bundle was immediately snatched away - it was quite light, it was just under a lamp, I saw his face very distinctly, and remembered seeing his face sometime before; he ran down a court, I cried Stop thief! and pursued, but lost sight of him; another man followed him, and was knocked down on the ground. I went through the court, and then went home - my father and mother came back with me, and met the officer, who said he had got the man and property. The bundle belonged to Mrs. Marshall, who employed Mrs. Wollams, a dressmaker, who gave me the bundle. I cannot say whether the man who struck me took it - the prisoner is the one who took the bundle, I am quite certain of him, I speak to his features.</p>

            . I was coming out of the White Horse, public-house, into Swan-court, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I remained in the court, and saw a bustle go up in the corner, and in a few minutes, three men passed me; they said I was nosing. I told them to go about their business; they used abusive language, and then went off. I called for a light, and went in the corner, where I saw three men go, and in the one pair of stairs room, I saw the property laying in a dish - I did not know either of these men; I gave it to Walton.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the bundle from Wilson; I was coming home, about half-past nine o'clock, and hearing of the robbery, I left the bundle at a public-house, and went with Wilson to the George, public-house, Angel-alley, and apprehended one Ramsay. I went out and found who had lost the property - in about a quarter of an hour, I took two men near to the George-public-house, by Angel-alley; one of them was the prisoner. As soon as he was brought to the watch-house, the prosecutrix identified him, as the lad who took the bundle out of her hand, she had described his person before this.</p>

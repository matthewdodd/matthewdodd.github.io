                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Hollis-street, Cavendish<lb></lb>square. The prisoner was about twelve months in my service—she was discharged about the end of September—I had missed things, particularly about six yards of brown cloth—I afterwards missed all these articles, and went on the 9th of November with Avis, the officer, to Mr. Berry's, in Ox<lb></lb>ford-street—I saw her box there, and asked her to open it, which she did, and there I found the silk and cloth in her presence—Mr. Berry brought me a piece of cloth she said she had bought in the City, for a guineas a yard, but when we found in the other box such a quantity of property she admitted it was mine—the property was concealed in three boxes—It is all mine.</p>

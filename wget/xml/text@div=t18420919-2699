                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Henry Bradshaw Fearon, a wine merchant, in Bond-street. The prisoner was in his employ—on Monday, the 28th of March, I saw a bottle in one of the cellars, where it ought not to have been, which excited my suspicion—I marked the cork of the bottle, and when the men bail left the cellar, I went and the bottle was gone—I left directions to watch the prisoner—I saw him afterwards, followed him, and took him back to the counting house—I asked him, if he had any bottle or bottles about him—he said, "No, I have not"—I insisted on searching him—he objected, and retreated from the counting house backwards through the warehouse, till he got to the door—I then put my hand on his wrist and right shoulder to prevent his going out—he broke from me, and ran across the street, and back again—I ran after him down a gateway towards Grosvenor-mews, through Sadler's livery-stable-yard, and up Brook's-mews—I there saw him pull a bottle from under his leather apron on the left side, and dash it to the ground—shortly after I saw him pull another out, and dash it to the ground—I got the corks, and one was the cork I had marked—I believe the bottles and brandy to be Mr. Fearon's. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi>You have got the cork which you yourself marked, after you had seen it placed there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was a cellar where wine is kept, and not brandy—we have brandy in bottles, they are labelled and are kept in the warehouse up stairs in sight of the counting-house, but I am sometimes absent—the bottle I marked was not labelled as a brandy bottle—I cannot speak to it as Mr. Fearon's—I suppose it to be Mr. Fearon's brandy, because it was on his premises—I examined the bottle that was broken, and it contained brandy—the prisoner gave his address No. 9, Stangate-street, Westminster Bridge—I did not taste any of the brandy—I knew it by the smell—this is the cork that was in the bottle.</p>

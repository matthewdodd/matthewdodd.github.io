                  </hi>. I am a boatman, and live in Derbyshire. On the 27th of February I came to town on business, by the boat—I was in Edgware-road, about ten o'clock at night, with Smith, one of my boatmen—the prisoner came up to us as we were standing—she asked me where I was going—I said, where my mate was, as I was a stranger—she wanted us to go home with her and sit down by the fire, and be comfortable—I went—I spent sixpence, and had some beer, and then came out—I went to a beer-shop and had a pot of beer—Smith was with me, and a woman—we then went to another shop, and had two quarterns of rum—we then came out—the prisoner still kept pulling me, and persuading me to go home with her, and at last I went with her to an up-stairs room—I did not give her any money—I laid on the bed with her for a few minutes—I had at that time a canvas purse with seven sovereigns and four half-sove-in it, in my right-hand trowsers'-pocket—I felt the prisoner draw the purse out while I was on the bed-side—she had just got off the bed—I accused her of it, and tried to get it from her—there was no light in the room then—she had put out the candle—she had the purse in her hand, and she put it out of one hand into the other—I did not see it in her hand, as it was dark, but I felt it in her hand—I made a noise, and Smith and the other woman came up—the woman brought a light with her—the pri<lb></lb>soner was then standing by the fire, and my purse was at her feet—the woman picked up one sovereign and one half-sovereign—I picked up one sovereign—my purse was not tied, it was only twisted—I lost three sove<lb></lb>reign sand two half-sovereigns—I was quite sober.</p>

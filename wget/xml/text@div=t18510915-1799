                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Langdale, who keeps the Custom-house Stores public-house, 79, Lower Thames-street. On Thursday evening, 4th Sept., a little before 11 o'clock, the prisoner came there with two friends—they had four 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worths of gin and water amongst them—they remained very nearly an hour—the prisoner then wished to be served with some more, but I wished the house to be closed, and told him so; he said he-would not go until he had more—I called in Stride, the policeman, who was passing, who came in and coaxed the prisoner to go—after a little time he went away—he had a pipe in his mouth—he was smoking the whole of the time—he was not drunk, but had been drinking—he had nothing, to the best of my belief, but the gin and water.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 556). On the night of the 4th Sept. I was on my beat in Lower Thames-street—Mrs. Lungdale called me into the Custom-house Stores and told me, in the prisoner's presence, that he had used very insulting and abusive language to her—he said he did not know what he had said for him to be removed—I said, "Take my advice, and leave the house," which he did in about a minute and a half, and went about forty yards from it, and stopped there (my beat went about fifty yards further than that)—I went towards him—he said he would go back to the house—I put my hand on his shoulder in a friendly manner and advised him not to go back, for if he did he would have to put up with the consequences—he took his pipe from his mouth and struck it in my face, saying, "You b—r, take that"—seeing it coming, I knocked off the end of it, and the middle part of the pipe entered the side of my nose—he ran away very fast indeed—he did not appear to be drunk in the least, he stood well when I spoke to him, and seemed to know perfectly well what he was about—I followed him about eighty yards, but did not overtake him—my sergeant took him, and he was taken to the station—I have not been on duty, but have been under the doctors hands ever since—I have suffered a great deal of pain.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 557). I was on duty in front of Billings<lb></lb>gate-market, and saw the prisoner there talking to Stride, who advised him</p>

               <p>to go home—I saw him running in a direction from the custom-house towards Billingsgate-market, Stride followed him, calling out, "Stop him!" he turned down the market, where there are a great many stalls and tables on both sides, where I am sure a drunken man could not have run it is so narrow—he was stopped by sergeant Tregaskis—I went up and receired the prisoner—he is the same man I saw running.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeont, and surgeon to the City-police force. About half-past 12 o'clock on this night Stride called on me at 11, Finsbury-place—I found he had received jagged wound, of about a quarter of an inch in extent, on the left side of the face, just above the upper lip, close to the side of the nose—I probed it; the probe struck on some hard substance, at some depth, resembling the stem of a tobacco-pipe; I found it necessary to enlarge the wound, to expose the upper jaw, and to break down some portion of the upper jaw, to introduce the for<lb></lb>ceps, and then, after about three-quarters of an hour, I extracted from the upper jaw the stem of a tobacco-pipe two inches long, firmly impacted in the hollow of the jaw—I dressed the wound; inflammation followed, and he is still under my charge—there was no immediate danger, but it was impossible to say what the remote effect might be; it was a very serious injury, the force must have been very great indeed, it pierced the bone of the jaw; it slanted upwards, and if the jaw-bone had not stopped it, it would have entered the eye.</p>

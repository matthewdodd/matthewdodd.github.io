I am a furrier and warehouseman in Wood-street, Cheapside, The Prisoner is a stranger to me—I lost eleven stocks—they were safe in my warehouse on the 19th of April, and were missing between that evening and before eight o'clock the next morning—I went with Mr. Archer down to Bonsor's house, at the White Hart, Vine-court, Spital<lb></lb>fields, on the 18th of April, at about one o'clock, and found him at home—there was some cotton lying on the table—we called for a glass of ale—Archer seemed to know the prisoner—the prisoner said, "Mr. Archer, will you buy that article, can you make room for it?"—he said, "What is the price?"—he said, "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., "I think—after a little bit, Archer said, "Have you got any silk by you?"—he said, "Yes, I generally have "—he said, "If you will call to-morrow morning I will talk to you, "or some<lb></lb>thing to that effect—I found no property of mine there at that time, but I afterwards saw some sample stock at Mr. Archer's house.</p>

In consequence of information I received, I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's house, on the 28th of April—it is a public-house—there was some loose cotton on the table—Bonsor asked if I could become a purchaser—it was ultimately agreed that I should be at his house at ten o'clock next morning—I went, but was too late—he was gone, I went again next morning, which was Saturday—I saw him, and told him I was about entering into the stock trade, and asked whether</p>

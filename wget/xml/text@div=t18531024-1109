                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at No. 168 Fleet-street. The prisoner lodged in my house with her husband, and her mother occasionally—I think it was in May last she came to lodge with me—for some time previous to the 20th Oct. I had missed money from my till—I did not know who to accuse; I discharged one of my errand boys—I marked 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of money, and on the night of the 13th Oct. I put 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the till; the next morning it was all gone—I had marked the money after the errand boy was gone—I called in a policeman, who watched for five nights—on the night of the 21st Oct., 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which were marked were left in the till—I found that the whole of them were gone at 8 o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is the husband of this lady? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is with Mr. Kirkham, a jeweller—I believe she is within t week or two of her confinement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe that upon matters of pilfering she has been affected by the state she is in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is more than probable, almost certain, that it was under the influence of her pregnancy that she did this—that is not uncommon—medical men always know that females in that state are affected with peculiar longings and desires, and are likely to do many things that they otherwise would not do—they are scarcely accountable for all their actions, because many of them are done without a motive—I sent a letter to the pie-siding Alderman on the subject—I wished the prosecution to be withdrawn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How much money altogether have you missed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say between 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I could not say exactly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you think that a person who admits that she has taken 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that that may be caused by a state of pregnancy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There may be great excuses for it; I could not say that it would cause it—I should not think it was pos<lb></lb>sible that she was aware that the policeman was watching—I did not miss any money during the time the policeman watched—the second night, after he left, I missed the money—she lodged in my second floor—she could get in my shop by coming down stairs—the shop is always open—there is no private entrance—my till was not locked—from many circumstances I believe the prisoner was scarcely conscious of many actions of which she has been guilty—there was so much folly in them—I go by other circumstances that I have since become acquainted with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever observe any other action of her which betokened the absence of a sense of right and wrong? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in making the infant's robe, cutting up expensive lace caps, and trimming the dress with them, when she might have purchased the thing for much less—that, in my judgment, betokened the absence of a sound mind—in Aug., 1851, when I was called to attend her, she suffered much from a severe affection of the brain, almost amounting to inflammation of the bruin.</p>

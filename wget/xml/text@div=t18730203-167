I live at 17, Newcastle Street, Strand, and am a com<lb></lb>mission agent—in consequence of certain instructions that I received I went, on 1st November, to No. 3, Tichborne Street, which is Dr. Kahn's Museum—I purchased this copy of a book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prisoner Davidson—he was sitting in the pay box as I went in—he had two piles of</p>

               <p>books before him, one small and the other large—I asked nun it I could see Dr. Kahn—he said, "Go up stairs to the left, and you will find him"—I saw a young man there and asked for Dr. Kahn, and he showed me into a room; it was almost dark; a door opened on the opposite side, and Dennison came in and screwed up the gas—I said, "Dr. Kahn?" and he bowed—I said, "I have purchased a copy of your book, but before consulting you I should like to know whether you use mercury in your prescriptions"—he said, "Not usually, hut I do not altogether disapprove of mercury"—I asked him his fee—he said it was a guinea—I then bade him good after<lb></lb>noon, and came away—I did not pay him the guinea; I said I should first like to know his treatment, and I said further that I had not read over the book and I wished to do so—on Saturday, 7th December, I was present at the premises when a seizure of the books was made by Sergeant Butcher—on that occasion I saw Romilly there, in the room where the books were got—he took the keys from his pocket and opened the places—there was a large cupboard and an oak book-case looking thing—there was nothing in the book-case, only in the cupboard—I did not go through the museum on that day; some time before I went out of curiosity, not with reference to this case—I did not have a hand-book of the museum given to me; an advertisement was given to me.</p>

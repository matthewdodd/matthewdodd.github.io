            . I live in Cromer-place, Somers'-town. On the 1st of July, about twenty minutes past five o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Albany-street, New-road, and saw the prisoners White and Ryan drawing a truck, Shannon was behind - and as they approached Mr. Hall's building he followed them on the footpath ten or fifteen yards off. I took particular notice of them all - the two came through the posts, and 
               <persName id="t18240715-147-person1304">drew</persName>
             the truck up near the building; whether Shannon went into the building, I cannot say but he was walking up and down, I only looked towards them occasionally, and am not positive - I saw White and Ryan go in, and come out in five or eight minutes with five window sashes, and put them on the truck, and draw it in a direction towards Norton-street; Shannon was then following them. Ebbs came up - I told him and he alarmed Mr. Hall, and went in pursuit, and at ten or eleven o'clock I saw them in custody. I am confident that all three are the men.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. The witness pointed the prisoners out to me - I saw two men drawing a truck, and one walking behind; I went and rung Mr. Hall's bell, then followed them and kept getting nearer - I overtook them by Wells-street, about half-a-mile from the building - they had just broken a square of glass in the sash, and were all three putting them to rights. I went up and said Mr. Hall was coming, and I would thank them to stop, one of them gave a sort of alarm, and they all started off in different directions - I followed White and secured him by the Middlesex Hospital, without his being out of my sight; and on turning round the other two were brought up. I had seen all three assisting to drag the truck.</p>

            . I was building some houses for Charles Theophilus Hall, in Albany-street - these sashes are his property: I delivered them on the premises. They were only put into the frames, not fixed.</p>
               <p>SHANNON's Defence. I saw a man in Norton-street, with the truck: these two young men were putting the sashes right - I went up, and said they had better put them a different way.</p>
               <p>WHITE's Defence. I was out of employ, and went to the Horse Shoe, public-house with my fellow prisoner: a man there said he should want two men early in the morning, and would give them 3 s. each, and not detain them above an hour - we were to meet him at five o'clock in the morning: we went, and saw him with the truck; he told me to draw it over to this building - he brought the sashes out, told us to cross over, and he would overtake us - some of the glass broke, and we stopped to adjust them: the witness came up; I considered then that we were led into an error, and said,</p>

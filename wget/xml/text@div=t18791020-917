                  </hi>. I was in Norfolk with Mr. Betts when this discovery was made, and I wrote and said it was to be submitted to Mr. Campbell—the prisoner seemed very much distressed, and I said "The best thing you can do is to make every reparation in your power by dis<lb></lb>closing every fact"—he offered to make over what property he had, consisting of various things, and I said that I would look into the matters and investigate them and lay them before Mr. Betts, and I did so—he mentioned three houses at Holloway, but I am not aware that any assignment was made of them—I found that they had been mortgaged to their full value—I sent a gentleman well versed in such matters to look at the timber, and found what with the embargo for rent, and the quality of the timber, and the time it had been lying there, it was as worthless as the houses—I told the prisoner that the pretended assets had vanished into thin air, and that his representations were false—that was some time after April—I think it was after Mr. Howell's report that Mr. Betts decided on prosecuting the prisoner.</p>

Betts and Co. all the timber lodged with you in my name, W. H. Wiilison"—I consulted Mr. Betts about it; I wanted to discover who the aiders and abettors of Wiilison were—I did not inform Mr. Campbell till ray letter of January, 1879—I never saw a report from Mr. Howell that I am aware of—I was in Marseilles when the summons whs taken out—the prisoner said that he did not think the houses would fetch the money advanced on them—I think they were in Oldfield Villas, Birkbeck Road; I do not think there were any others—I suggested to Mr. Luckin, the auctioneer, that the Sale ought to be postponed till matters were looked into—the prisoner told me in April, 1878, that he had brought an action against a Mr. Aylett; Messrs. Tillyard were the solicitors I believe, and I suggested at his request that Messrs. Attenborough should be the solicitors, and that the action should go on for Mr. Betts's benefit—I do not I know that it was. settled by a pay<lb></lb>ment of money to Mr. Attenborough and his costs deducted—I beliive Mr. Betts paid Messrs.

I am in Mr. Betts's employ—I superintend the books and look generally after the business—by the entries in the booh I first began to superintend them in June, 1877; I continued the work which Mr. Campbell had in hand up to that time—I checked the posting of the money into the ledger from the prisoner's cask-book and checked the receipts appearing in the cash-book against the prisoner's paying-over book—I made entries in December, 1877, on the right-hand side of the cash-book from the paying-over book—on 1st January, 1878, there was 693<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. against the prisoner, and I asked him how he accounted for having such a large amount in hand—he said it consisted of varioui amounts which he had out, and it would rectify itself by-and-bye—at the end of February, 1878, I noticed that Borwick's cheque for 535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I knew had been received, was not entered in the cash-book—when that cheque was added it showed a balance against him of 760<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—I spoke to him about it and he said it had been forgotten, and then it was entered out of its proper date—the preceding entry is 24th February, and Borwick's cheque is entered on 18th February—the paying-over book shows the payment of various sums by the prisoner between those two dates—this is an entry from which he would hand in the cheque when he got it—the entry in the paying-over book is "18th February, cheque 535<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—there is no description of the person from whom it was received—the same thing occurs in March with reference to another cheque—I recollect Mr. Campbell going to the factory in April, 1878, and I received instruc<lb></lb>tions to cull on the customers and write to them, which took six months, as they were so numerous, and while I was so occupied I was taken ill; that was in January, 1879—I did not assist the accountant who was called in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I used to look over the books once or twice a week, but I did not ascertain the amount of cash in hand because we were not interfering with Willison, it was left entirely in his hands—I had never gone through the books up to that time to ascertain the state of the accounts—Willison, senior, had nothing to do with them—the prisoner had been for a number of years in connection with our establishment, and about August, 1878, he referred the police to Betts and Co. for inquiries about a licence, and I said to the officer "I cannot give an answer, I must refer you to the firm;" I referred to Mr. Campbell, and then told the police I should not say anything for or against the prisoner.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Son, and Edmunds—we received instructions to prosecute the prisoner from Mr. Betts after Mr. Howell's formal report—that occupied some time and the matter was placed before a Magistrate in April—there is no truth in the suggestion that we have benefited by money received from Aylett by the prisoner—on 8th May, 1878, I went to Holloway and saw Campbell, Cheswright, and Willison; a conversation took place with reference to what were supposed to be irregularities in Willison's accounts—he knew me and I knew him and his father before him for years—a conversation ensued in reference to the action against Aylett; he said that Aylett owed him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and desired me to take the matter up for him; I declined to do so; out of good feeling to him I suggested that he should have all the benefit of it, and allowed him to go on with the action, and therefore the first solicitor's costs had to be paid, and I induced Mr. Cheswright to allow me to check those payments; the end of it was that only enough was received to pay Mr. Atten borough's costs—the money I advanced him has never been paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We suggested that Messrs. Tillyard's costs should be paid—Mr. Willison gave his reasons for changing the solicitor, but as the solicitor is present I do not wish to repeat them—I distinctly swear that it was not suggested that the benefit of the action, whatever it might be, should go to Betts and Co.—nothing has been received by us.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I have a note of the statement here; I do not wish to state it—Mr. Betts had no knowledge of the matter, and would, I am sure, repudiate the receipt of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a public accountant, and have been so 20 years—early in Septtember, 1878, I was called upon to investigate the books of Robertson and Co., of Batavia Mills, and arrived at a deficiency of 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether.</p>

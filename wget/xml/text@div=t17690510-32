She said she had some friends in Staffordshire she wanted to have some talk about, and wanted me to go in and drink a pot of beer. I said, Come with me, we can go into any of these houses here. No, said she, there is no good beer here; come along with me, and we will have a pot of as good as any in town. I went along with her. She took me to a house where there was a little woman in it. (I never was there before.) It was <placeName id="t17690510-32-crimeloc211">near Black-Boy-Alley</placeName>

There was a bed-stead, and a blanket or something on it. Smith came in and said, How do you do, countryman, how does all friends in Staffordshire? One of the women said they will not trust for the beer, without they have the money. I took out my purse, and gave Smith a shilling, and desired her to bring me change. As soon as she went out of the door and pulled it too, the woman of the house said she would go for the beer. She went out, and pulled the door after her; then Mary Harris up with her hand, and struck me cross my breast back-handed, as I was sitting on the bed; then both the prisoners seized me. I hallooed out murder as fast as I could. Harris seized my right arm, and held it down upon the bed. Smith catched hold of my mouth, and said, Blast your eyes, what are you hallooing out! I put my hand up to break her hand from my mouth. She catched fast hold of my arm, and put the other hand down to my left hand breeches pocket and took my purse out with ten guineas in it and a ten pound bank bill. It was a yellow canvas purse. Then Harris ran to the door, and catched the door in her hand. I jumped up after her, and as she was going out I caught hold of her. She struck at me. I put my head on one side, and the blow came upon my breast. She pulled the door too, and caught my hand between the door and the door frame. The other prisoner was got into the street, but I held Harris, and would not let her go. I held her there and hallooed, Is there no good Christian who will send for a constable? There was a woman in the alley said, Have you got any money? I said I have got no money, but I will pledge my watch for money, if any body will but assist me. Harris said, D - n you, you dog, if we knew you had got a watch, we would have had that and all. The little woman that pretended to go for the beer, she came in the mean time, and threw the beer in my face two or three times. Then she went into the house, got a candlestick, and came out and struck me with it several times in the alley. I held Harris all the time. She said she would go into her own house. I let her go in, and put the door too. They had got a black woman in the house, they brought her to me, and said, There, take the D - l. Harris wanted to get away. I caught hold of her again, and held her till the constable came. They struck him with a candlestick several times. A woman in the alley ran for a constable. I do not know but, if it had not been for that woman, they would have murdered me. Harris and the woman that fetched the beer were taken at last, and put in the Compter. The next morning, being Friday, the other prisoner Smith was taken in a house hard by where they robbed me. I knew her again by a cut a-cross her left arm, and a mole under her left eye. I took notice of her when she called me countryman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get your purse or money again?</p>
               <p>Shatten. No, I never did, nor my 10 l. bank note neither.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Shatten. I was as sober as I am now. I was going to the White horse in the Fleet-market to my quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you by that money?</p>
               <p>Shatten. I had sold a horse for thirteen pounds, on the Tuesday before, and I received a ten pound bank note, and three guineas, and the other money I had in my pocket made the money up ten guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any familiarities between you and either of the prisoners?</p>

He said he had a watch: then one of the women said, If we had known you had a watch, you should not have had it so long. That was either Harris, or the other woman that is not here. They strove hard to get away. The man said he would lose his life before they should. They desired him to go into a room. They then brought a black-a-moor to him. There was a young man came to assist, but they broke his mouth, and made it all on a gore blood, and used the prosecutor basely. The young man went out and fetched a constable, and Harris and the other woman were secured. The next morning Smith came into the neighbourhood. They were looking for her.

When I came home, I went there, and the prosecutor declared they had robbed him, and threatened to murder him; also that he was in danger of his life. Harris said he had robbed her. He said they had robbed him of ten guineas and a ten pound bank note. I said to the woman, You are a base woman, therefore I'll take the man's word. I took her and another woman, and had them to the watch-house, and left them in charge of another constable. I did not take the other prisoner, she was gone, but she was taken the next day.

I laid hold of her, and kept her from fighting. I said to Mrs. Wilder, Are you going home? She said, No. When I came to the door, there they cried fire and murder ! I said to a man, What is the matter? He said, The man says he has been robbed. Said I, By who? He said he did not know, but it was in my room. I went in, and when I came out again, the man laid hold of me and said I was the person that held the door while the other robbed him. He held me sometime. There came another woman, then he let me go, and said she was the person. She got out of his hands, and he laid hold of me again. I gave him a push with my right hand on his shoulder, and desired him to let me go in at the door, and not to stop me in the street. He let me go in. I desired the boy that was there to go about his business, and another woman that was by struck the boy. As to any money, I never saw no money at all.</p>

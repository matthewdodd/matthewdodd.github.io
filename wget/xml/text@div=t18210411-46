            . I have a cottage, in the parish of Staines, Middlesex. I have a wife but no children. On the 23d of March, I got up at four o'clock and went to work. I left my wife at home, I returned a little after two o'clock to dinner, and met the prisoner with a bundle under his arm, and a shovel on his shoulder - Hather and Baker were with me; he tried to hide the bundle as he passed us, but he could not, so he threw it down and ran away; I pursued after, him, I picked it up and found it was my property; I kept my eye on him till he was caught. The bundle contained the articles stated in the indictment, which were in the house when I left.</p>

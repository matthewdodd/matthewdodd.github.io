                  </hi>. I am surveyor of pavements in Hans-town, Chelsea. Walford was employed by the contractor for the district, and was working under me—the old stones belonged to the Commissioners—Walford had no authority to lay down any stones in Mr. Ketcher's yard, in Union-place—neither new nor old—I have seen these stones in Union-place—I belive them to be the property of the Commissioners—they are worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I was at the station, and saw Walford wheeling three pieces of paving-stone to Ketcher's house, on the 10th of June—I gave information—I went afterwards to Ketcher's house, and saw one of the pieces of stone which I had seen—he said he had had them on the premises for some years past—the stones put down appeared to be the same as those from Sloane-square—one had a corner broken off.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 7, West-street, Finsbury-circus, and keep the whole house, part of which consists of an office, below stairs On the morning of the 5th of February, between eight and nine o'clock, I discovered the office had been broken, and missed a quantity of camel-hair pencils, some bottles of perfume, some tea, and 150 cigars—on the 15th of February, in consequence of a message from Mr. Reeves, of Cheapside, I went to his shop—he is an artist's colourman—I remained there about half-an-hour—the prisoner entered the shop while I was there—Mr. Reeves</p>

               <p>produced some camel-hair pencils to me, which I recognised as my own, and part of what I had lost—the prisoner was standing in the shop, and the pencils were lying on the counter when I first saw them—Mr. Reeves, after I was introduced to the prisoner, asked his name, and after giving his name, he asked where he got them from—after some hesitation, he said he got them from a person named Smith—he said he had got about thirty-five gross—I told him they were mine—he said he had bought them of this person; that he wanted to make a commission on them; and if I would go along with him, he would take me to that person—I declined going—he was then given in charge to a policeman, and was taken to the station—a policeman accompanied him, myself, and some other persons, to an eating-house, kept by a man named Puttock—he there pointed out one of the boxes, where the witness Davis and myself went with a candle, and picked up three pencils similar to those I had lost—the prisoner had men<lb></lb>tioned the name of Harry Puttock to me when we got to the corner, of St. John-street, Smithfield—no Harry Puttock has been found—he is gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Reeves, of Cheapside.

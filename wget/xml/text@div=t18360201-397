                  </hi>. The prisoner is my husband, and is a carman. On the 29th of January I lived at No. 1, Bett-street, Ratcliffe-highway, in the parish of St. George in the East. I have not lived with my husband since the 28th of July, we have been separated from that time—I have been living there, I do not know where he has been living—I keep a green grocer's shop—I saw my husband on the night of the 29th of January, about half-past seven o'clock—I did not see him till he spoke in the shop—I had been serving a customer, who I think went out at the door as he came in—I was behind the counter, having been serving a customer, I was putting the money in the till, and in a moment Rogers spoke—I did not see him till he spoke—he was then stretch<lb></lb>ing his hand towards my face—when I looked at him he was hold<lb></lb>ing his arm across the counter, towards my face, and something went off like a pistol—I did not observe anything in his hand—when he stretched his hand out I put up my hand and threw myself back, and then something went off like a pistol, and a flash of the came into my face—he made use of a bitter oath, and said. "You bl----d b----h I will blow your brains out. I have long threatened to do for you; I don't mind going to the gallows if I can get my ends of you. "He then turned and went out of the door into the street—I tried to get round the counter to shut the door—he had gone out, but the came in again and met at the end of the counter, he then put his hand round my waist, and began to beat me about the head in a dreadful manner—there appeared to be something heavy in his hand, and as he struck me it appeared to cut me, he then called me a bl----d b----h three or four times over, and said, "I don't mind going to the gallows if I get my ends of you"—he then went into a little room ad<lb></lb>joining the shop by the side of the counter, he began to throw and knock the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you gone before the Magistrate on account of his ill-treatment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he has threatened to kill me and murder me several times, hundreds of times, I may say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that after the differences arose from jealousy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I had not been married three months before he knocked me down—the jealousy was about nine months ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the jealousy about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He used to go with other women, and come home and ill-treat me—I was not exactly jealous—we had often words concerning that.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you last have him before the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A fortnight ago last Saturday, I think.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, was there no conversation between you before he lifted his hand with the pistol? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had not spoken to him—I did not see him till he spoke—I will swear nothing passed between us before he held the pistol to me—there was nobody in the shop at that time, or any where, to see the pistol—I do not know whether he was sober—I cannot say, for I scarcely looked into his face—I do not know whether he was intoxicated.</p>

               <p>for I was so frightened that I cannot swear—I screamed out violently, and Mrs. Dinker was the first person who came, a person, named Hearn, was the next—Dinker was the first that entered the door—I think she heard me scream—I did not see any ball—the fire came into my face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If nothing struck you coming out of the pistol, will you swear he did not hold it over your head to frighten you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was towards my face—I did not see the pistol—I am convinced it was pointed towards my mouth—I was standing up at the till—he was on the other side of the counter, and he was reaching across the counter towards my mouth—I saw something like a pistol go off, and a flash of fire came into my face, but nothing hit me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live three doors from Mrs. Rogers. On the 29th of Janu<lb></lb>ary, I was sitting in my front parlour with my children at work—I heard a dreadful scream of murder—I jumped up and threw my work out of my hands, and ran to the assistance of Mrs. Rogers—when I came to her door I saw her bleeding from the head and hands—she said, "Oh, Mrs. Dinker, he has shot me"—I saw the prisoner in the little room adjoining the shop—I ran into the shop, and went between Mrs. Rogers and a little counter, and rushed toward the little room—I saw him at a table where Mrs. Rogers had been ironing—he then rushed forwards with something bright in his hand, and as he came out of the door towards Mrs. Rogers, I caught him by the two shoulders of his waistcoat, and said to him. "You shan't".</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Shant's what? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not strike her—his hand was lifted, and he had something bright in it—I caught him by his two arms, and thrust his arms down, and as I pushed them down, something fell out of his hand—I thought when it was in his hand, that it was a flat iron, it fell between the side of the door and the little counter—he rushed out of my arms again into the little room, and was knocking the things about in the little room—I turned round and Mr. Hearn came in and passed me, and I ran to the station-house—that was all that passed while I was in the shop—I left the prisoner in the little room—when I came from the sta<lb></lb>tion-house, I saw the policeman coming running, I told him, and he came back with me—he took Mr. Rogers from beneath the counter, and took him away—I stopped till the doctor came, and on the back of Mrs. Rogers' head were four cuts, which appeared to be that length (about two inches)—they were bleeding very much indeed—she lost a great deal of blood—it was just exactly as if you turned a bullock's heart out—I never saw such a thing in my life—I am certain I could see the bone of one finger, and every finger—there was not one I could see but what was cut, and there was a large cut on the back of her hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police sergeant. I remember Cox bringing me a pistol about half past seven o'clock on Friday, the 29th of January—the cock was, down, and the pan open, and all over sulpher—some of it ap<lb></lb>pears now—it appeared as if powder had ignited very recently—within a very few minutes—I examined the barrel immediatley—I got the key of the pistol from the prisoner's pocket, and unscrewed the barrel—I found the bed of the barrel full of powder, and a ball lodging on the top of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any means of accounting why it had not discharged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was a new pistol, and might be foul with oil in the touch-hole—I had some conversation with the prisoner—I said nothing to induce him to make any declaration—as soon as he was brought to the station-house, I ordered a man to assist in searching him—a bullet-mould, the pistol-key, and a loose ball were found in his pocket—I sent the officer to the house to look for the pistol—he brought it in three or four minutes—the prisoner said there were two pistols, but he had lost one—he said he had pur<lb></lb>chased a pair of pistols in the Minories, and the night before the occurrence he was drunk in the street, and lost one, that a prostitute took it out of his hat—he then said that he was very sorry that he had not blown her brains out, and likewise his own b----brains out, which he would do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where did he say this to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the station—Cox was not there—part of this conversation was between eight and nine o'clock the next morning—he did not tell me he was tired of his life—there was nothing in the pistol to account for the ball not having been dis<lb></lb>charged but what I say—I have been in the army twenty-five years, and have had a new gun, which has missed eight or nine times running—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010010"></xptr>
               <p>cannot tell why the ball was not discharged—it could not arise from the unsteadiness of a drunken man's hand, for it was properly loaded and primed right, and he had cut the ball smaller with a knife from a larger one, instead of making it with the mould—he did not appear under a great deal of excitement—I know the man well—I have had a great deal of dealing with him—he was in a violent passion no doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he under the influence of passion, or liquor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Passion—he had been drinking—I could smell the liquor, but he was per<lb></lb>fectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you swear you smelt the liquor, and yet he was sober? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a man who has been abroad can take a good deal—I know him well—he has been in the army—in the Second Queen's, I believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know he was very much distressed in his mind by the unhappiness between himself and his wife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he was ordered by the Magistrate to keep away, and allow her so much a week—the woman has got money in the Bank, and he got the book from her, and got it out, and I believe he wanted to have more—I have no acquaintance with his wife—I know nothing of her, but her coming to the station, and booking the charge—I pitied her—I did not know the prisoner in the army—I have had no quarrel with him—I never spoke to him in my life—only in my duty—I never struck him at all—I never saw any policeman strike him—we were generally obliged to have six or seven men to take him to the station-house—he was fined 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the other day, for violence to our people—he is a powerful man—he would kick and injure a man; and when he was brought to the station-house, the last time we had him there, he was hanging by the window, and would have put an end to himself—that is a long time ago—it might be eight or nine months ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has not his conduct for some time been that of a man labouring under excitement and delusion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say—I have seen him thousands of times, but I never spoke to him, only when brought to the station-house—that may be three times I have had to take the change—and several times I have persuaded him to go home to his lodging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he do eight or nine months ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He at<lb></lb>tempted to commit suicide in the cell when he was in custody about his wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PAYNE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he at any other time attempt it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—I never heard of it—I never <hi rend="italic">bothered</hi> about him—I have known him brought to the station-house a great many times, but only locked him up three times—he has been brought fifteen or sixteen times, but I have only detained him three times—I did not take him but he was brought to me—I never had my hand on him in my life myself—a policeman appre<lb></lb>hended him and brought him in—he was always like a mad fellow at those times. but I cannot sat what he was labouring under.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He appeared sober though he had been drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I could smell rum or some kind of spirits.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that before he was under the excitement of passion; did you ever see anything about him to lead you to believe that he was not in his proper senses, or was he rational, so as to be perfectly responsible for what he did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I always considered he knew what he was doing—It was a very fine gunpowder—it appeared a full charge—the powder was good—I put some of it in the fire—he was always a mad outrageous fellow—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183602010011"></xptr>
               <p>would kick whoever came near him first—he is very violent—one of the worst men that was ever brought to the station—I have been in that situation six years, and believe he was the worst that I saw there—when brought in custody he would make his escape by kicking and being very violent—a medical man examined the prosecutrix's wounds, he is not in attendance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I have been married now going on eleven years to my wife, and have been a hard working man—I have earned a great deal of money, and have taken home from 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and I think that is a man's duty, and as much as a labouring man can do—I was working for Mr. Allen in Bett-street, and he was a good master, and I had a good mistress—I used to have to go to put the chaise harness to the horse to drive my mistress down to meeting—there was my wife used to kick up a row, "Why should I do this work on a Sunday more than any other man?"—I used to have to go to the house and clean my master's boots and shoes, at his house, and I had for a length of time—she got jealous of the servant-maid—the servant-maid used to laugh and talk with me, and she then swore I knew as much of the servant-maid as I did of her, and that was the first beginning of her jealousy—Mr. Allen took and sold the concern up to Gray's-inn-lane—I walked backwards and forwards to Gray's-inn-lane night and morning for three years, besides going out with my dray, and took from 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day—I never robbed my master of a single farthing—one malicious <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> happened to go home—(I went home every night, except three nights, when I was at a bean-feast)—she happened to meet him, and she asked him where I was—he replied and said, "I believe he is in the hay-loft, and is sleeping along with another woman; so there was another kind of a jealousy then arose up between us—she came up on the following morning—there was my master as I was just coming out of bed, where I was intoxicated over-night—my master would not let me go out with the dray in the morning—he said I was not fit, and he would send another man out—so he did—I was in the shed, washing the casks which he had set me to do—she happened to to come up, and began to abuse my master, because I had slept there—my master then told me, "Rogers, I do not like to see your wife come up in this manner, why did you not go home?"—I told him how it was—I said, "You know how it was, I got intoxicated, I went up in the loft where I slept, because I would be in time for work in the morning"—he said, "Well, I shall send you down to Golden-lane"—that was at the time the intermediate beer came up—I was earning good money, and took her home good money—I went to Golden-lane, and had to sit up brewing—I had to brew in the night, and go out with the dray in the day-time, which I did for three nights, and had not hardly a bit of bed, except on Sunday, when I had a resting-day—I had to go there on Sundays, to draw the beer at dinner hours—she began to <hi rend="italic">kick</hi> up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with me, and swore that I had no business there, "Why did not master employ somebody else to draw the beer, and put a person, and keep there regularly?" but I was obliged to do what my master ordered me, and what he bid me—master and I had a few fallings out, and I left him, and went to Mr. West of Hoxton—there I got 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week standing wages, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for every customer I got—I could make up my money then to very near 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and I used to give her, (that wretched woman, I used to give her,) so help me God, 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 29<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I kept myself out of the remainder—I used to have to treat my customers, to keep them together, and gain customers for my master—well, master left off at this time as porter fell, and I did not</p>

               <p>expect the would be good enough to give the customers—I left them, and went into Mr. Hanbury's employ, where I had worked before—I was a <hi rend="italic">trounce</hi> once—before the clerk told me, if I had a mind to come, I might, as a regular <hi rend="italic">trounce</hi>—I went to him, and had nine tons that day, and they gave me 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was going out with four hogsheads of stout to the Catherine-wheel, in Bishopsgate-street, right opposite Spitalfield's church—when I came there, I happened to tread on a piece of cabbage-leaf, which flung me down, and the wheel was within a very little of going over me—I had to catch hold of a lamp-post, and I caught the toe of my shoe against the curb—I wrenched my knee, and went down—it was eleven o'clock at night, and I could not go at one o'clock, which I ought to have done, for my knee was swelled, and was so bad—I sent to let the clerk know about it—in the room of going to the clerk, she went into the yard, and Mr. Hanbury gave her an order for me to go into the hospital, and I was there eleven weeks before I could get my knee well—she swore she would not work—if I did not turn out to work, she would not keep me, after all the money I had been earning for her—I never strove to go into a brewer's house any more—well, I went and worked for Mr. Bryant, in Prince's-square, and worked for him six years—I did the very same with Mr. Bryant that I did at the others, cleaning shoes, knives and forks, for him and the servants—I had orders to do so, and I did do it—my master would give me a character from that day to this, and a good character, till there was three or four rascally fellows—one's name was <hi rend="italic">Will</hi> Mitchell, the second James Withers, the third James Hall, and the fourth <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Mitchell—this <hi rend="italic">will</hi> went and told my wife that I had a very great concern with the servant-girl—which God Almighty knows I never knew or heard of, no more than a child just come from its mother's womb—he went and told her—he borrowed a coat of me on the Sunday, and said he would bring it home in the afternoon, which he did at the time I was gone to chapel in Wellclose-square, (to parson Smith's)—when I came home, she asked me where I had been—I said, to chapel—"Chapel! no," she says, "you have been out with that d—nasty stinking w—, and if I meet her, by G—I will murder her"—those were her very words—if not, may God strike me dead—I asked her what was the matter—she said, "You have not been to chapel; you have been with that stinking W—"—I said, "What stinking w—do you mean now?"—I said, "If you had gone to chapel with me, you would have seen if I had been with a w—or not"—I said, "Take and dress yourself, and go out and be comfortable with me on Sunday like another woman; let us be comfortable with one another"—but in the room, of that, she stops at home—well, this villanous fellows told her that I knew as much about the girl as I knew about her—well, soon after it came to master's ears, and he said, "Rogers, have you been making a b—W—Y house of my house?"—"A b—w—y house?"—"No," says I, "I never made a b—house of your house"—he said, "Have you not been along with the servant-girl?"—"What?" said I—he said, "But every time I am out I understand you are always in my house, and you have made a b—w—y house of my house in the middle of the day"—"In the middle of the day!" I said, "Who has told you that?"—he said, "I have heard it"—" What day was it on?" said I—he said, "the day you cleaned the windows" I had been ordered to clean the windows outside, and the cook said to me, "You must come and clean them inside, for I must get the fenders and fire-irons, cleaned"—and I did, and the nursery-maid came down with the children to dressed to take them out: as soon as she came down—she</p>

               <p>had no shawl or handkerchief on (this Mitchell was coming past with Miller and Hall) she sat the little dear baby down on the sofa, and said, "Rogers, mind the baby that it does not fall off the sofa, while I put my handkerchief and shawl on, for I am just going out"—of course, I did so, and these fellows went and rose the report that I had the girl down on the sofa in the middle of the day, and told my master so, as soon as he heard that, he discharged both me and the girl from the premises—she always said if she met the girl she would murder her—I knew no more about the girl than the Lord in heaven; and after I was dis<lb></lb>charged I made up my mind, being so hurt, that I would go to Graves<lb></lb>and along with the girl—I did, and we spend the day comfortably together—end yet I knew nothing at all about the girl—I knew I had got a wife and why should I go with the girl—it was a hard thing to get turned out of my place, and I went out of aggravation, and came home, but never knew any thing about the girl—it was her doing to kick up a row that caused me to be turned out of all my places—so then, of course, we had a few words—well, one Sunday night I had been out and came home—she was standing against the door—I had been to see a work<lb></lb>mate or two of mine—it was about ten o'clock at night, I suppose—that was the first time I was given in charge—as soon as I went in doors—she was standing in the door, and a policeman with her, talking—she standing on one side, and the policeman on the other—she began with me, and wanted to know if I had been out along with my damsels again—I said, "No, I have been to see a mate or two of mine"—she said, "You are a liar"—I said, "I am not," and I said, "You are always saying it, I will give you a knock in the face," and I up with my fist, and gave her a push in the face—I only pushed her—the policeman was standing there—I did not strike her violently—she called out "Murder" immediately—the policeman came and took me—I was taken to the Magistrate, and he heard the case, and said, "Now my man what have you a mind to allow this woman a week, and separate?"—I thought we were to divide our things with each other—I was lawfully married—why should a man not have half as well as a woman?—what does a man marry a woman for?—he marries her to maintain her, and I always did, and always would, unto the utmost of my power—I always strove to keep a good house and home over my head, and got into a good club, and every thing—when I was taken, the Magistrate heard my case—I went back after my things—I brought a box, and took all my things out, and tied them up in an apron—I took them to the Magpie and Stump all <hi rend="italic">higgledy piggledy</hi>—all flung out into the street, as if they were a parcel of old rags—I went to look to see if I had got them all right and found I had not—I went and bought a box, and came back again—I was rather in liquor I will acknowledge—after I got the box I wanted one shirt, three pairs of stockings, a pin which I wore in my shirt, and some numbers of the "Pilgrim's Progress"—I went back for them, and she sent for the policeman, who knocked me down—with his staff he knocked me down on the ground, just as a dog, and dragged me of to the station-house—there I was again hauled up before the Magistrate, and he sentenced me three months to the house of cor<lb></lb>rection, and there I was three months—one fortnight I was picking oakum, and ten weeks at work in the open shed, and when I came out of the pri<lb></lb>son the governor gave me a character, said I was a worthy good man when I told him about it, and what it was for—well, I came, out and</p>

               <p>and got some work, as soon as I got out—and was at work about a fort<lb></lb>night; I happened to go down Belt-street again—I went to the Euston Arms to get some supper, and who should come in but my lady—" Rogers said she—I said, "Well, what do you want?"—"Are you a mind to make up my allowance? she said, "What you made an agreement for, my half-crown a week?"—No," says I, "where you are, I will be, if you like to come with me I will maintain you; or, if you like for me to come with you, but not a farthing will I give you till then"—she said, "You, won't wont you? by G—I will make you up all the time you were in prison"—Will you says I—on the Monday week following my shoes had got dry, being laid up so long—I got into work and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, and the soles came down right away from the shoes—I went to the saving's bank (I am not ashamed to say it) to draw 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and bought a bran new smock-frock, the waistcoat that I have on, and a new pair of high shoes, ready and fit to go to work—I went to Mr. Bryant, and stated the case to him—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi>, have you been home yet?"—I said, "No"—he said "Why don't you strive to go home and make up matters, and live with your wife comfortably?"—I said, "That is what I should like to do"—he said, "Well try what can do"—I was a little in liquor—I went home; and when I got near the door, she came and slammed it against me, and said, "You rascal, you shall not come here"—I went from the place again, and they came and dragged me off again like a dog, and took me before a Magistrate; and they took me to Clerkenwell—there was two months more of it—there was a poor devil—see how a poor fellow has been used—a man had better be dead than alive, ten thousand times—I went in, as soon as I went in the Governor gave me work to do—I did not starve—I had meat, and half a pint of beer, thank God; and when I came out the Governor gave me a character, and said, "You are a worthy man;" he persuaded me to go home, and said, "Now, try once more, and see if you can't make up matters"—so I did, and just the same occurred again—I made no more to do, but went to the officer at Lambeth-street to see the Magistrate—the officer said, "What do you come here now for, Rogers?"—I said, "For my case"—he said, "You were lawfully married to the woman, why not go to your house? I would tear it all to atoms but what I would go in—I would lug the house down over their ears, and knock the policeman's heads off, if they came near me"—I went to the house—there it was, "You shall not come in"—I went back again—I was ordered to taken an officer with me to see I went in without making any disturbance or any piece of work—I went and got the policeman 155, who was on duty, but whether he is here I do not know—I went in and sat a few minutes, when she made no more to do, but ran and seized me in a moment; but the policeman would not take me in charge—he said, "He is in his own house, stop there"—she made no more to do, but caught hold of me, and tore my shirt—caught me with her talons and scratch<lb></lb>ed me down the face—what flesh and blood could put up with it?—no man living on the face of God's earth could put up with it—I would sooner take a dagger and stab myself then put up with it—I have been scandalously and brutally used—I would sooner be sent out of the country—I am strong and able, and can go to work—I do not care what work it is—I do not want to be in England again—my character is gone for ever, and what use is it for me to stop here—when I went again to the Magistrate—(there stands one, oh, you false swearing <hi rend="italic">varmint</hi>, you undertaker ((<hi rend="italic">pointing to a witness</hi>) the devil will have you some of these days—you have had a good many bodies, let</p>

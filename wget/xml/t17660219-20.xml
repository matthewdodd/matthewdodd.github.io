            . I had drank rather too hard, with two gentlemen waiting for the stage-coach going out; then I took coach to go to the Talbot-inn in the Strand, in order to lie there, and go out in the morning with the stage coach, this was on Thursday the 6th instant. The jolting of the coach, and the liquor together, took my senses away. I know I lay in a room by myself, I missing my watch in the morning after, did not go in the coach, but staid to inquire after it. It was the very day I had received it of the watchmaker that had cleaned it. I applied to the beadle of Goldsmiths Hall, and delivered out hand-bills, and in consequence of that I found it, (produced and deposed to) it is an horizontal watch; I gave 15 guineas for the movement finished up: the gold cases were my own before, the maker's name is Berridge; the chain was stopt by Mr. Smith in Holborn, where I saw it, (produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. I am a goldsmith, and live in Holborn, last Monday was se'nnight, about 6 in the evening, one

I said I should see if it was advertised, and ordered him to call again on the Thursday: after he was gone I recollected I had a warning from Goldsmiths Hall. I looked at it, and found it was about a gold watch and chain lost. I sent to the hall for information, they let me know they thought it to be the prosecutor's property; he was sent for, and said it was his. I desired him not to advertise it, fearing the man that brought it would not come again. On the Thursday he came again; then I stopt him, and carried him to Guildhall: he desired to go in at the Castle, to speak to some of his friends, and then he would confess the whole; then he said he had the chain of Tricket, the prisoner at the bar.</p>

            . The prisoner M'Kenzie and I were together at the Talbot inn in the Strand, we were in a little room on the left hand going in, the gentleman took out his watch to look at it, and laid it down in the window; he was in liquor: after that I went home with M'Kenzie to lie along with her, there was Tricket in bed, he struck a light, and she pulled out this watch; Tricket took and turned it about, and wound it up, and smiled, and said it was nothing but a metal watch; he said he must not go to offer it soon, but it would fetch but a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Tricket?</p>
               <p>H. Taylor. He is a watchmaker. I left Tricket and M'Kenzie in bed together, between 10 and 11 the next morning.</p>
               <p>Tricket. That evidence was very much in liquor, she fell slump on the bed, said she we have got a watch; we got it at the Talbot inn, from a gentleman.</p>

On Sunday the 9th day of this instant, I had been at the other end of the town, I called upon Tricket, he said he was going to the play at night, and he had no money, and if I would go to sell this chain, he would treat me with a play at night; then I took it to Mr. Smith, he said he had it of his Suky; they live together.

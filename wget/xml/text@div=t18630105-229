                  <hi rend="largeCaps">JOHN LEACH</hi>. I am a railway porter, living at Howley-place, Paddington—the house belongs to John Henry Tremenheere—about 2 in the morning of 11th December, I was aroused by a sound like glass breaking—I kept quiet some time, and heard a rustling in the garden, and on looking at the window, I saw the shadow of a man's head on the blind; the moon shone very bright—immediately after that I heard a noise at the doer—I dressed myself in the dark and got a light, and as soon as I got it, a man jumped over the wall—I went out at the front-door, and got the assistance of two police constables; one remained at the end of the terrace and the other came back with me—as soon as we got back to the garden, the constable we had left at the end of the terrace called for assistance—I immediately went back and found the prisoner struggling with the policeman—I struck him, and he said he would go quietly, when I said I would strike him if he did not—we then took him to the station, and afterwards went back to the house—we found the closet window had been entered—I had fastened that window up myself between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, before I went</p>

               <p>on duty—the window was not broken; the catch had been forced back—it was not the glass of the window I heard breaking, it was some flower—pots that were inside—I thought it was glass.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 71). At half—past 3 o'clock on this morning, I was in Howley—place—Leach spoke to me, and I stopped at the corner while he and the other constable went to the garden—I had been there about five minutes, when I saw the prisoner get over three or four garden walls, and then out of a villa garden into the road—I stood very steady at the corner till he came close to me, and as soon as he got opposite to me I took bold of him—he resisted very much, and I called for assit<lb></lb>ance—as soon as I took bold of him, he said, "What are you doing of; how dare you to touch me"—I said, "I saw you get over two or three walls"—I took him, with assistance, to the station—I took off his shoes and found a lot of garden dirt upon his feet—I searched him and found some silent matches and a knife.</p>

At 9 o'clock on this day, I went to the back of the house, 12, Howley—place—I found a window had been forced up and the catch forced back, and I found marks of a knife right under<lb></lb>neath the window—I also found marks of feet without shoes in the closet, and traced them over the walls—at No. 18, I traced them to a place where he had evidently been sitting down—I put my hand down in the ground, just where the mould was loose, and found these two skeleton—keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

               <p>Q. What passed between you - A. I went to my door, and saw them at my man's door - it was about an hour before dusk. I asked them what they wanted? I saw them plainly - they looked at one another a little, and then said they wanted my man; I told them he was in the shed with my husband, then shut the door, and saw no more of them. We had no other sheep but Dexter's thirteen; they were delivered in the name of Dexter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. The drover who brought them said they were Dexter's - A. Yes; the men came about five o'clock - I have no doubt of Still being the other man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BUSH. Q. At the office you said you could not swear to me - A. I swore to him immediately, and said he tried to hide his face, so that I saw his side face only, but I had seen him a great many times before.</p>

            . On Monday night, about five o'clock, I saw thirteen sheep, which were delivered by a drover in Mr. Dexter's name. On Tuesday night, as I was sitting by the fire, two men came up to the window; I am sure Bush was one of them, the other man was short and thick; they asked me for Mr. Dexter's sheep? I did not know either of them before. I said,</p>
               <p>"They are in the pen, go and take them." I went in, sat by the fire again, and saw no more. Next morning I found the sheep were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this - A. About half-past five or six o'clock - it was nearly dusk then; I only knew Bush. I live in a cottage with my father, opposite Bones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BUSH. Q. Did you see me take them away - A. No. I saw them go up to the pen. I am sure he was one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the other man like Still - A. Yes, my Lord, it might have been him - I did not see the marks on the sheep.</p>
               <p>SARAH M'GREGOR. I lodge at No. 3, Hamilton-row, Battle Bridge. On the 2d of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, a knock came at the door, and I let Warren in - he keeps a green shop at the house; I sent my daughter for the key of the shop-door. Very soon after some sheep were driven in - Bush stood at the door; they were driven through the passage into a shed at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with them - A. I saw Bush - nobody was with him then; he had either a stick or whip in his hand - I do not know who drove them; I saw the sheep when I was at my window up stairs, but when I went down to open the door, Bush and Warren stood at the door; I let Warren in at the street-door, and sent my daughter for the key of the shop-door, which was brought - they could not open the shop. Bush said to Warren,</p>
               <p>"Push your foot against the door" - I said,</p>
               <p>"You must not do that." I tried to open it with the key, and while I was doing so, I saw Still. The sheep were then in the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of the person of Still - A. Yes, I saw them at the house that day between eleven and twelve o'clock - they lunched there; Still went into the shed with his pocket full of skewers - I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, Still and his wife were then in the back parlour, with Warren - Bush was in the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the sheep next morning - A. They all hung up in the shed; I never counted them, either at night or in the morning - they were skinned. There were two halves, and the rest carcases. The halves were part of two sheep, which had been cut across.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. My husband is a musician. Warren absconded the night the sheep came. Still visited him.</p>
               <p>Q. Bush and Warren drove them in - A. I let Warren in, Still came in afterwards. He frequently came to visit Warren.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. Q. How long after the sheep came did Still come - A. About a quarter of an hour; he went through the passage with the skewers in his pockets. I do not know what business he is.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sized man is Warren - A. A middle size, and thin - about the height of Bush; he is an old man, and rather stoops. Still and Bush both lunched there - about eleven o'clock they all went out together. I did not see them again until they all came back.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH M'GREGOR. I am daughter of the last witness. On the 2d of November, in the evening, I went to fetch the key, when I came out Bush stood at the door with a whip in his hand, there were no sheep at the door, nor had any been brought in then - they were brought in in my absence. I went into the shed about half-past eight o'clock, and saw a man skinning the sheep - he has not been found - Bush was holding the candle to him; a boy was also in the shed. Still, his wife, and Warren were in the parlour. I counted the sheep next morning, there were eleven whole ones, and two hind parts. Still sent me for two pots of beer, which I fetched; he asked me to take a pint into the shed to the man; I did, and then saw Bush there - I saw no more.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw Still in the shed slaughtering the sheep - A. No. Still visited Warren. I never saw his wife there before.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. Q. Did you see Still in the shed - A. Yes, after I had carried in the beer, he had his coat off; his back was towards me - he was doing nothing. His coat was on when I saw him in the parlour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him come in at first - A. Yes; he had his right-hand pocket full of large skewers.</p>

            . I live at No. 2, Field's-place, Battle-bridge, opposite M'Gregor's house. I am a butcher. On the 2d of November, about eight o'clock at night, I saw some sheep, Bush and Warren were with them; a sheep ran away from the door, I saw Bush run and fetch it back. Warren and Bush drove them in. I thought they were going to open a butcher's shop. In the morning I saw the shop opened as before; I went into the shed about eight o'clock, and saw thirteen whole sheep hanging up, dead. I afterwards saw Bush at the office. I went and informed Cadby, and at night eleven sheep, and two pair of hind-quarters were brought to my house.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH M'GREGOR re-examined. I saw Bush carry one part of a sheep away, and the man who skinned them carried the other.</p>

            . I am an officer of Clerkenwell. I went to No. 3, Hamilton-row, on Wednesday, the 3d of November, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and found eleven whole sheep, and two hind halves, but no skins. I carried them over to Crick's. I and Read apprehended Still between six and seven o'clock that night. I was going to the office with Elizabeth M'Gregor, about a quarter before eight o'clock, and took Bush in a field, he pretended to be easing himself. We told them both what they were taken for. I did not ask where the skins were. Mr. Dexter afterwards saw the carcases in my presence. When I took Still he said he knew nothing of the sheep. I understood he rented the stable of No. 3 - he said he did not rent it.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Paddington-street, Marylebone. On the 1st of November I sent thirteen sheep to Bones' to graze. I sent them by a Smithfield drover - he is an old man, near fifty; four of them were Lincolnshire wethers, and nine were half-bred - they were ewes and wethers. I do not exactly know how many of each.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the carcases - A. Yes, at Hatton-garden. I saw eleven sheep, and two pair of hind-quarters. Four of them were Lincolnshire wethers, the other nine are half-bred. About three of them are ewes, and the rest wethers.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment whether they were yours - A. I have no doubt in my own mind; I bought them on the Monday, and had handled them all. I had bought ten of the Lincolnshire in all - these four corresponded in weight with those I had killed before; each weighed from eleven to twelve stone, and so did these - the nine were a part of a lot of twenty-five. I had killed sixteen, which weighed from eight to nine stone each, and so did the carcases that were found; I saw them at the office on Friday, the 5th of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a half-bred sheep when the skin is off - A. Certainly, by the make of them.</p>

On my return I stopped at the Plough, public-house, Kelsal-green; Mr. Clancey was there, and Mr. Pollard, who is a butcher, and resides in Marylebone-lane. I waited there till about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and enquired if I could purchase any potatoes, then went to Mr. Bell's, Westmoreland Arms, public-house, Manchester-street, Manchester-square, staid there till nearly eight o'clock, and drank several glasses of brandy and water with some friends there, then proceeded home to my stable, No. 8, Smith's-place, Skinner-street, Somers'-town - it was then about nine o'clock. I cleaned my horse, put it up for the night, and then said to my wife,</p>
               <p>"I shall go to Warren, and tell him I have bought no potatoes." She said,</p>
               <p>"You had better take those skewers which you promised to Mr. Warren," which I accordingly did; when I got to the house it was nearly ten o'clock - I found both the doors open, and went into the parlour to Warren; he had a pot of beer by his side. I told him I could buy no potatoes, and sat down; he wished me to lend him 1 s. to get some beer, and I gave the girl one to fetch some; he sent most of it backwards. I staid there till near eleven o'clock, then went home and went to bed. I saw no more of Warren.</p>
               <p>BUSH'S Defence. I was at Edwards's, who keeps the Plough, public-house, Kelsal-green, from four o'clock till about a quarter after six; I then walked home to Edgware-road, at the corner of Connell-place, where my mother lives - it was then about seven o'clock. I was coming down Battle Bridge, and saw Warren, who had some sheep at the door, and asked me to lend him a hand with them. I helped him into the yard with them, and went down to Smithfield, called as I came back, and he asked me to hold the light to the man in the shed, which I did for half an hour, and then went away, got home about eleven o'clock, and did not see Warren or Still afterwards. When I was taken into custody, I was returning from West-street, Smithfield; a gentleman asked me where Still was? I said I did not know, for I had not seen him since last night. He took me to the office; he did not collar me - I did not attempt to run away. Sheppard said at the office that the other man was pock-marked.</p>

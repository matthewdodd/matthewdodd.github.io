               <p>Q. Have you lost any lead from any building of yours - A. Yes; on the 15th of July I was informed that there were two men taken up for stealing of lead. It is a stable on the east side of <placeName id="t18120916-175-crimeloc946">Grays-in-lane-road</placeName>

I went to the stable, and found the lead was nearly all gone from the gutter. I saw it on the 14th of July; it was safe then. I saw the lead again, it was taken to Hatton Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of lead was there lost - A. I should think as much as three hundred pound weight; it cost me about 15 l. I went to Hatton Garden; in looking over the lead, I found one piece was marked with blood, as if the party who had cut it had met with an accident.</p>

            . I am a gardener. I work for Mr. Smith, at Dalston. On the 15th of July, between four and five in the afternoon, I saw the prisoners; they came to a place where I was loading dung. The lead was discovered to be in the dung.</p>
               <p>Q. What place was it in - A. In Grays-inn-lane. One of the prisoners went round the cart where I was loading the dung; he kicked the stuff over the lead.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you perceive that there was lead lying there - A. Yes; I found the lead among the dung as I was loading the cart; he was kicking the dung over the lead, as if to hide it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they stay there till you had loaded the cart - A Yes, I left them there. I acquainted the head groom of it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HAMDEN. I am a groom, close to the light-horse volunteers. I received information respect- the lead. In consequence of that I spoke to Mr. Woolger; he keeps the gate of the light-horse volunteers stables. I saw the prisoner very near the spot. I went to Hatton Garden, and got an officer. Woolger watched the place, to see that nobody took the lead. I returned with Read the officer; the prisoners were then down in a field, behind the Welch-school.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is this dunghill from the prosecutor's stables - A. About a hundred and fifty yards, close to the spot.</p>
               <p>LUKE WOOLGER. I am gate-man to the horse volunteers. On the 15th of July, Hamden informed me that there were two suspicious characters. I saw the two prisoners sitting down upon a bank, near where the lead was. I saw one of the prisoners tossing the dung, as if to cover the lead, and before Read, the officer came, the prisoners removed from the dunghill, and went behind the Welch-school.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the two prisoners in custody; I knew Manning before. I saw the lead before I saw the prisoners, just by the light-horse livery-stables, covered over with some dung. I found the prisoners behind the stables, in a field that runs down by Bagnigge-wells; they were lying under the brow of the hill. I took them to the place where the lead lay. I asked them if they knew any thing of the lead; they said, they did not. I searched them; I took a knife from one of them. There was some blood upon the lead; the prisoner, Brown's, small-clothes were tore, and his thigh was cut.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went to the stable, and found the part that was not cut off, it matched with that which was cut off. I believe the lead to be mine.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I met Manning; we walked down Grays-inn-lane. I sat myself down on a bank; he said, did you ever make hay. I said, no. He tossed the dung about. I went away in the fields and sat down.</p>
               <p>Manning's Defence. I was with Brown. I went and laid down in the fields. I knew nothing of the lead. I was taken upon suspicion only.</p>
               <p>Brown called one witness, who gave him a good character</p>
               <p>Manning called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

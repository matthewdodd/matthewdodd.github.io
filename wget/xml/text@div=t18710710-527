About 5.15, on the morning of 3rd July, I saw the prisoner in Duke Street, St. James's—I saw him go to No. 17, open the door, go inside, and close the door after him—he was in about a minute, or a minute and a half; when he came out, he crossed over, and went to No. 14, Ryder Street—he took a key from his right hand coat pocket, put it in the lock, and tried to open the door, but he did not open it—he then went to No. 23, Ryder Street, and again took the key from his pocket—he tried to open the door, but did not—he went from there to 15, Bury Street—he tried that door, but did not open it—he then went to 32, St. James' Square, and tried the lock of that door—he went on into Pall Mall and Trafalgar Square, where I stopped him—I asked him what he was doing in Bury Street, Duke Street, and Ryder Street—he said he had not been in Bury Street, or Ryder Street; he had come straight down St. James's Street into the square where I had seen him—I said "I am a police-constable, and I have seen you there, trying several doors; in fact, you opened one"—he said, "You are mistaken"—I said "You have the key now with you"—he said "I have not got a key on me at all"—I said "Yes, you have; you have got it in your right hand coat pocket"—he said "Yes, that is the key of my house in Kingsland"—I took him to the station, and he was put in the dock before the inspector—he then said he lived at North Street, Whitechapel—he was not known there—the inspector asked him what he was doing there? and he said he was going from Paddington to Billingsgate Market—I went to 17, Duke Street, and tried the door with the key, and it fitted.</p>

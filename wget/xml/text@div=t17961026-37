               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to the soldier in consequence of that information given you by your son? - A. I did; I was going to lay hold of him by the collar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what you charged him with, at that or any other time? - A. I told him he had been robbing me of starch; he got up off the cask, and up with his first and knocked me down; the other soldier then went away.</p>
               <p>Q.At the time you left the starch was it safe? - A. Yes; all safe; when I came back one of the heads was pulled on one side, and a good deal of starch gone out.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you examine his hands or cloaths? - A. One of his hands appeared white.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if it was stained with starch? - A. Yes; after that I laid hold of him by the collar, and he dragged me about for the space of a quarter of an hour, and beat me and called upon the soldiers to rescue him away; I suppose fifty soldiers came round him; I was determined to hold him fast.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did they rescue him? - A. Not at that time; I got the assistance of Mr. Green and Mr. Wells, and gave charge of him to them, for stealing the starch, and lent a hand to get him into a cart; and then I left the constables to take care of him, and went back to take care of the starch.</p>
               <p>Q. When you examined the starch, how much was there missing? - A. About 8 or 10lb.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does the starch belong to? - A. I do not know the persons it belongs to; about ten minutes after he was put in the cart, I heard that he had been rescued; he came down with the other soldiers to the quays, with a baker's scraper, and asked for me and the constable, and said, if he could get hold of that sat headed bugger, he would kill him; and I ran away; afterwards he was secured, and I appeared against him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing? - A. Yes; soldiers! soldiers! and then the soldiers took the horses from the carman, cut the rope, and took him away in triumph.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his hands? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take him afterwards? - A. Yes, after he was rescued; I being all over dirt, was obliged to go home and get some other cloaths; about two hours after I heard he was parading about the quays; and with the assistance of a serjeant I took him again.</p>

Yes, for stealing search; after we got him into the cart we went into Thames-street; the prisoner called out for soldiers all the way we went; when we came near the Tower they threw brick-bats very fast, I was hit several times; one struck me on the head, which sprung out the blood; I was obliged to go to the surgeon to be dressed.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house, at 11 and 12, Kent Street—between 12 and 1 o'clock, on the morning of 30th December, the prisoner came there rather the worse for liquor, and made some disturbance—I went up stairs and ordered him out—he remained up stairs about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and he came down—I was in the parlour at the time—he came to the door and said "Give me my money back?"—I gave it to him in his left hand—he raised his right hand and stabbed me in the chest, saying, "I will be your murderer"—he struck me once or twice after that—I felt I was stabbed—he went outside and then tried to burst the door open, and he said "If I get you outside I will have your life"—I opened my waistcoat and I found a severe stab—I went outside and saw a policeman on the opposite side of the road, and went over and said "Take this man into custody, he has stabbed me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant at this lodging-house—I was with the prosecutor in the parlour when the prisoner came down to the door—the master was standing at the door, and he says to the missis "Give this lodger his money, I shall not have him here"—and he gave him his money and the prisoner put it in his pocket and said "I will pay you before I have done with you, and he brought his hand out of another pocket and he brought out something and struck the master twice with it—I did not see what it was.</p>

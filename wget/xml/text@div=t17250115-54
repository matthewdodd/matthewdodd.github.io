She answer'd, No. Why then, says he, D - your Blood, you Bitch, I'll have your Life. She beg'd of him not to murder her; but he struck her three or four times with a Stick, and knock'd her down. He then turn'd up her Petticoats to feel for her Pocket, and did what he would with her. But finding no Money, he beat her again cruelly, and swore that he'd do her Business for her; and not withstanding her Cries and Entreaties, he drag'd her into the great Road, laid her in the Cart-rout, beat her again, and took away her Cloak. She cry'd out; and a Man coming by, prevented his doing her farther Mischief.

The Woman had made shift to get to the next house, which was a Tavern, and there they brought the Prisoner to her. <rs id="t17250115-54-verdict287" type="verdictDescription">

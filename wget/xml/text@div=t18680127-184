I keep the King's Arms—on 16th January the last witness called my attention—in consequence of what she said, I followed the prisoner to the Gresham Stores, in Liverpool Street—he went in at one door and I at another—I heard him call for a screw of tobacco, which was a penny—I heard some money fall on the counter—I then saw the land<lb></lb>lord give him some change—I then spoke to the landlord, and he looked in his till and took out a bad half-crown—the prisoner was going out of the door, when Mr. Taylor stopped him—he then charged him with giving him a bad half-crown—the prisoner gave some money back to Mr. Taylor—I gave him into custody—he said nothing—the half-crown was given to the constable.</p>

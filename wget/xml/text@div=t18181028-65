               <p>Q. Did you, after this, in the prisoner's presence, tell Mr. Tunnicliffe that the prisoner had been there before - A. Yes; before the constable came I told him that I had taken another note of him half an hour or an hour before. I took the same note that the prisoner had given to me, out of the till. I had been in the shop from the time the prisoner first came. I am certain nobody else had been to the till. Nobody had been in the bar but myself. I took the same note out, and gave it to my master, who marked that also.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. You put the first note in the till, among others - A. At the top of the others.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL TUNNICLIFFE. I keep a wine-vaults in Bishopsgate-street. The last witness is my servant. She brought me a note which she said she had taken of the prisoner. I knew it to be forged. I immediately went to the bar, and charged him with having passed a forged note, knowing it to be forged, which he denied, saying, that he had taken it for eggs of his master, Mr. Bays, egg-dealer, Leadenhall-market. My servant then said she had taken one of him about half an hour before. He was present. I asked her if she could identify the note. She said Yes; and brought it to me, I knew it to be forged. He denied passing it. I asked his address; he said Gilbert Warren, at Mr. Bays, egg-dealer, Leadenhall-market. I endorsed the notes with the address he gave me-(looking at two.) These are them. I sent for Mr. Bays, he came while the prisoner was there, and said, in the prisoner's presence, that he had not lived with him for four years. He made no reply to it. I had him taken into custody. He was searched in my presence, and some silver found on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He referred you to Mr. Bays to know who he was - A. He said that he then lived with Mr. Bays.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Bays say that he knew where he did live - A. No.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL SHEPPARD. I am a constable. I was sent for to take the prisoner. I searched him, and found four good half-crowns on him. I asked how he got the note? He said he took it for the sale of eggs, in Leadenhall-market, and that he lived with Mr. Bays.</p>

               <p>Q. Since he left you have you had any intercourse with him - A. Not any. I had not seen him from the time he left me till I saw him at the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>MARY PHILLIBROWN. I am a victualler, and live at Aldgate. The latter end of August (it was after the 25th), the prisoner came to my house with two more men; they had a pot of stout between them, which came to 7d. The prisoner paid for it with a 1l. note. I asked him his name; he said Warren. I asked his address. He said, "Say Bays's, Leadenhall-market." (Looking at a note.) This is the one he paid me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GLOVER. I am a bank note inspector. I have been in my situation twenty-five years. (Looking at the three notes.) They are all forged in every respect, paper, plate, ink, and signature. The two nttered to Clarke are both off one plate, and exactly of the same description. That uttered to Phillibrown is also forged in every respect, but off a different plate.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About five weeks before I was taken I went to receive some money from the captain of a ship, with my brother; on his being paid, he gave me a 10l. and a 1l. note. I got the 10l. note changed for a 5l. and five 1l. notes. I afterwards changed the 5l. note before I left the house. Since which I have been selling eggs about.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Bell, public-house, Rotherhithe. In August one of the East India ship's companies were paid their wages there. The prisoner and his brother were paid there. His brother received the notes. I did not see the prisoner receive any money. I changed him a 10l. note, and gave him a 5l. note, and five 1l. notes. After that I saw him change the 5l. note. I wrote the name of the captain of the ship on the 10l. note. It was in the latter end of July, or the beginning of August.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The note was his brother's - A. Yes. I did not look at the notes.</p>

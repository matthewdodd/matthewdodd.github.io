                  </hi>. I keep the Friend-at-Hand beer-shop, in White Lion-street, Chelsea. A man named Pattinson took a bed at my house on the 14th of January—he slept in one of the front rooms—I saw the prisoner drink<lb></lb>ing in our beer-shop the following day—I came home from church about three or four o'clock—I had seen Wright once or twice before—he is a carpenter—I employed him to put a board up, and was to pay him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I carried a box, belonging to Pattinson, up to his bed-room door—any body sitting in the tap-room could see where I carried it—there was a dis<lb></lb>pute between tow man there, and the prisoners went out to purchase a board—they brought it in—Wright came up to that same room to place it, and brought his basket of tools up with him—when bed-time arrived, I showed Pattinson to his room—I found the box broken, and told him he was robbed—I told him to wait, and I would go and see if I could find the parties—I told the policeman, and they took the parties, two that night, and two the next morning—Rickards went out about eight o'clock—he then came in, and called for a pint of beer, and then I missed him—I did not know where be went—I had seen the prisoners up stairs.</p>

I went to the beer-shop on the 15th January—the two prisoners went to purchase a board to repair the tap-room, and it was put up by Wright—I afterwards went up stairs with Wright, and he said there was a box full of clothes there, and asked me how we were to get rid of them—I told him I did not know—I would have nothing to do with them—he did nothing to the box in my presence—I did not see it lifted up—I do not know whether it was open or shut—he said if I would go into the next court he would throw them to me—I said I would have nothing to do with it—I went down and sat there till I was turned out—I thought I should get knocked about if I spoke of it—I was turned out with the rest afterwards, for making a disturbance with a man of the name of Roberts.</p>

The back part of Mackey's beer<lb></lb>shop joins the yard of the house where I lodge—there are two walls be<lb></lb>tween like a passage—on the night of the 15th of January, I saw Richards go through the entrance of the doorway of Mr. Barnes's yard—he was dressed in light trowsers and shirt-sleeves, and was scrambling a bundle of things before him—he had no hat on—I went in doors, and in ten minutes after I went out with a candle, and there were some bricks knocked off the wall—the bricks were removed at a place that adjoins Mr. Barnes's yard—I saw this flannel belt, on the ground in the yard—it was at the place where I saw Rickards come along—he could get from Mackey's premises to Barnes's yard, by getting over the wall.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Norton Folgate, and am a licensed victualler—I knew the prisoner as an occasional customer—I have my business cards at the back of the bar, and sometimes they are lying about, so that a customer can take one—my washing was sent to Mrs. Keagle, of Union Street—she lives next door to a rag shop—on 3rd October I sent my barman to Mrs. Keagle for the washing—he came back without it, and brought this card—it is one of my business cards—the writing on it is not mine, nor was it written by my direction—the value of the linen was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after 3rd October, and before the prisoner was taken, he was at my house on three or four occasions—I had seen a little boy named Nevin, who gave me a very accurate description of the man to whom he gave the things, and I asked the boy to my house, that he might see the men, but on two occasions the prisoner had left the house before the boy could come—on Friday, 9th October, the prisoner was in the house, and I got the boy there—I asked him which was the man, and he pointed the prisoner out to me, and said "That is the man"—I had fixed on the prisoner from the descrip<lb></lb>tion the boy gave me—I told the prisoner, about half an hour previous to that, that I believed he had been robbing me—I charged him with having fetched the clothes from the laundress, and I said I would not let him go till the boy came—he said "Do as you like"—he was perfectly indifferent—I gave him in custody afterwards. (<hi rend="italic">Card read</hi>: "Please send all the things you have got done.")</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As far as I know the clothes were got from the laundress by the boy on the Saturday—I have not been in the habit of sending different people for my washing—I know the potman has been, but not other people—I have seen my cards blowing over the bar and lying about the floor—between the Saturday and the day I gave the prisoner in custody, with one or two exceptions, he was in my house every day—the boy gave me a description, and I made up my mind that he was the man from that description—when the boy came I said "Show me the man," or I might have said "Which is the man"—I won't undertake to swear that I did not say. "Is not that the man?"—I don't think I did—he was standing in one of the boxes—there were about a dozen people there—I don't think any of them are here—the prisoner told me he did not know anything about it—I think the boy said he received the card from the man between 5 and 6 o'clock—I have not noticed that the boy has made two different statements with regard to the time—I did not go with the constable to the station; I followed shortly afterwards—I never remember the boy telling me or saying it was between 3 and 4 o'clock—I had never seen the boy before to my knowledge—the laundress found him—my barman is here—on the Satur-day the goods were got from the laundress the prisoner was in my bar—I</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prisoner came in shortly after I had come home on the Saturday, and that was the first time I had seen him that day—the boy's description led me to suspect the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 15, Union Street—I am laundress and wash for Mr. Holder—on Saturday, 3rd. October, the boy Nevin came to my house nearer 5 than 4 o'clock—he brought Mr. Holder's card with his name and address on one side and on the other a request that I was to send all that was ready—I packed up the linen and it was given to the boy; I saw him go away with it—about 9 o'clock the same night Mr. Holder's barman came for the linen—I told him I had had a card and gave it to him—I have seen the prisoner before—he has come frequently to my place to bring linen and fetch it away for Mr. Holder, sent by the barman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not ask the boy who sent him with the card—I thought the card was quite sufficient—I naturally supposed he had been sent by Mr. Holder or the barman—when I saw the boy afterwards I asked him what sort of man it was—he said it was a young man dressed in dark clothes with one of those loose round-looking hats, that was all—I made it my business to inquire the description of the man, and I got the best description I could from the boy.</p>

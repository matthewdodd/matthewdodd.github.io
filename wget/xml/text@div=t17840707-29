            , on the 4th of January last, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment and much more, which they said were too tedious to mention.</p>
               <p>What is the value of the things that are mentioned in the indictment? - I valued them at five pounds, they told me I must make a value; the prisoner came into my bed chamber at six in the morning, I asked her what she wanted, she told me she wanted a scrubbing brush and flannel, which she had left there the night before, I told her to take it; I got out of bed immediately and I said it was very dark, she said yes, it was but six o'clock: the night before she said to me, Madam I am very short of clothes, I wish you would give me leave to wash my gown to night, I told her by all means, she seemed rather confused and threw the gown across the table; I returned to my bed and left her to go on with her work, and at eight I got out of bed to ring the bell, I missed nothing; she was not there, I returned to bed and thought she was gone out somewhere, but in turning my eye towards the bureau, I found the drawer where I had placed my linen that came home from wash the night before, open and empty; that alarmed me, I jumped out of bed and went to the dining room, and found the place compleatly stripped, I screamed out that I was robbed, I left the dress I wore the evening before, and that I missed also.</p>
               <p>When did you find any of your things again? - Never till I found her, I believe it is a month yesterday since she was taken; I offered a reward for taking her, and about nine o'clock on Wednesday morning I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070057"></xptr> informed she was in Vine-street, I went into the house where she was and several more women, the constable said to me Mrs. Langrish look which is your servant, I turned up her bonnet, she downed of her knees immediately, and said for God's sake have mercy upon me, I asked her what mercy she could expect, and I told her the only way she could have mercy upon me, was to discover what things she had got.</p>
               <p>Court. Now we cannot hear what she told you? - The constable then took a coach, and we went to several pawnbrokers before we came to the right, at last we went to Mr. Jarvis in Fetter-lane, and the trifling things that were found were found there, only two pictures and an umbrella; the other things were found by taking up a woman that was servant to her after it seemed.</p>

               <p>Do you know the month? - I am not quite sure whether it was January or February she got me to be as a servant and gave me a shilling a week, and she was taken very ill indeed, and by that means she got me to pawn some clothes which I thought was her own property; in Fetter-lane I pawned them two prints, and a pair of snuffers and stand, which were not found; I pawned a table cloth and umbrella in Fleet-lane, I pawned a book and handkerchief, and I pawned a little tea board for 6 d. at Morell's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you know the prisoner before? - Never.</p>
               <p>Not heard his name perhaps? - Never.</p>
               <p>Could have never spread any ill report of him? - No.</p>
               <p>You have been a preacher twenty years? - Yes, twenty-three.</p>
               <p>Before the Justice what reason did he assign? - He had a grudge against the French.</p>
               <p>Was any examination taken in writing? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner asked, where was you yesterday at half past eleven? - Yes, he was asked, was you at the French chapel, he said I was, and he said yes, upon every question that was asked him.</p>
               <p>When he was asked what he did there, what did he say? - He said, he shot at the minister, because the French had injured his character; he asked why did you shoot at him, and he said, to be revenged of the French; when he was asked how he came by the pistol, he said, he bought it about a fortnight ago.</p>
               <p>Did he before the Justice discover any sign of insanity? - He seemed composed, and seemed to answer no more or less, than in the compass of the question with great precision.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Why did he shoot at me, as for me, I shot in my own defence.</p>

In June 1780, he was seized with a fit of insanity, which his friends imputed to a shock he had sustained from the riots; he took it in his head that the French had offended him, he appeared so much disordered that he was attended by Mr. Pearson, an Apothecary, and by him recommended to a mad-house at Hoxton, he was afterwards removed to St. Luke's, where he continued for a year, and was returned to his friends as incurable, he became very troublesome, and lodged at Mr. Fremeau's, where he became so very troublesome, he was taken before Justice Wilmot, who recommended him to quit Mr. Fremeau's house; he continued in the same state to the present time, though with some lucid intervals, so as to enable him to do some work at his loom: a paper was also found in his lodgings, written by himself, which plainly shews the state of his mind.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The reason as I went to Mr. Durand's French church, was, he hurted my character, and shot at me, and prevented me getting my living.</p>

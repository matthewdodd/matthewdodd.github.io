On the 31st of January, I sent him with a cheque upon Messrs. Cox, Biddulph and Co, for 208l. 6s. 8d., (looks at a check,) this is it. He was gone an hour and a half, or two hours, he had to call at the stamp-office for some stamps; when he returned, he said he had lost 205l. of the money, that he had put in his trowsers pocket, leaving the 3l. in his waistcoat pocket. I asked why he had put it there, he said, he put it all into his waistcoat pocket, but at the stamp-office, he took the 205l. out of his pocket and put it into his trowsers pocket, that he had a hole in his trowsers pocket, which was the reason he did not put the change there, that he had gone to the bankers. and got the number of the notes, which he gave me. On the Monday, I had some conversation with him about it, he was very impudent, and said his character and mine were on a par. He was discharged, and a week after (which was Monday the 10th.) I received information from the Bank.</p>

             re-examined. In consequence of information, I went to Liverpool - I got in on Tuesday night, the 11th inst. and early on Wednesday morning, I applied to the police, and the prisoner was taken in three quarters of an hour; he denied taking the property, and said it was his own money he had laid out, that he had only saved two hundred Spanish dollars - we found five hundred dollars at his lodgings there. On shewing them to him, I asked if he knew Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Reynolds; he said, he found I knew more than he suspected, and was willing to confess that he took the money, and gave the 200l. note to Mr. Reynolds. He bore a good character before this.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer's labourer, and live at Stratford—on 20th November, about half-past 12 o'clock in the morning, I was near the Harrow public-house, and saw three or four men running away from the prisoner towards Bow—when I got close to the prisoner he muttered something, and put a knife into my left cheek, and behind my left ear—nothing had been said by him or me—he ran away—I sent a boy to run after him, and sung out, "Stop thief!"—a policeman stopped him and brought him back—I did not see anything in his hand—I wanted to get out of his way—a surgeon dressed my wounds, and I have been under his care ever since.</p>

Early in the morning of 20th November I was on duty in Stratford, and heard a cry, in consequence of which I stopped the prisoner, took him back to the prosecutor, searched him, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) open in his right hand coat-pocket; it was a kind of shooting-coat with pockets outside—he said that he had been robbed of his watch and chain—I then took him back to the spot where the affray occurred, and found this portion of a watchguard lying on the ground.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I live at Stratford—the prisoner was brought to my house with two wounds, one was on the left cheek, an inch and three quarters long, dividing one of the small arteries—it was not very deep, because the rising portion of the jaw-bone would not allow it—there was another wound on the side of the neck, in a parallel line with the one on the cheek, but not parallel to it—it could not have been from the same blow—this knife might have inflicted the wounds—I have seen him once since, professionally—there is no danger now.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Britannia beer-shop, Dorset Street, Spitalfields—on 30th July, about 11 o'clock, the prisoner and his wife came in—she was very drunk, and used bad language—I ordered her out—she said "You b—, I will not go"—I said, "If you will not go, I must turn you out"—I opened the door with one hand, and she went out—the prisoner got up and said, "You b—, that is my wife"—I said, "I cannot help it if it is;" and he struck me with the wood of this sword-stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) on the arm—he was then just outside—I pushed the door to—my mistress said something; I turned round to speak to her, and the door was pushed open, and I was struck on the head with this sword—the blood ran down, and I saw the glitter of the steel—he went away, and I afterwards saw him in custody—I have suffered very much since, and sometimes I turn quite giddy—I have not seen the surgeon here—I lost a good deal of blood I had never seen the prisoner before.</p>

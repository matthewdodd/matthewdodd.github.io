            . I am a salesman of Smithfield. On the 30th of January, at a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, I found these two cows tied up to my rails with many others - I did not see who brought them - the prisoner came to me in about half an hour, and said there were two cows for me to sell, and he did not wish to have then turned out, as he wanted money to take up a bill; I sold them for 33l. to Mr. Marsh, who was to send his drover for them, but Jeal claimed them in about half an hour; I pointed the prisoner out to Branscombe, the officer, in the market, and he took him; I saw nobody else claiming any right to them but him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not see them brought to your stall? A. No; I am certain he did not say he had only come for another person - he said, they must be sold as early as possible, for he wanted to pay a bill; he neither said they were his or they were not - I paid very little attention; I should have paid the money to him, for I have known him personally for many years, seeing him three or four times a day in the market, and considered him a very respectable man; I considered him a jobber.</p>

            . I am a shepherd, and live at Woolwich - I know the prisoner. On the 30th of January, just before one o'clock in the night, I saw him at Plumstead, nearly a mile from the marsh - he had two cows, driving them towards London - it would take about three hours and a half to drive them to town - I saw nobody with him; I walked after him about one hundred and sixty yards, then went across to him and said, "Hallo, what are you for market?" he said, in a coarse way, "Yes;" I walked by his side some distance, till I got up to a light, and then knew his person well - I did not know his voice; I am quite sure he is the person - I have known him three or four years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. By what light did you see him? A. By a gas-light - I left him immediately I went by the gas-light; I did not call him by his name; I knew who he was when I got to the light.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you mention that you had seen him? A. On Monday afternoon, when I heard the cows were lost; I merely said I had seen Burley driving two along the road.</p>

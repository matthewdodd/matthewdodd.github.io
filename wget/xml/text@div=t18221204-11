             - she invited me home; she pressed me, and I went. The other prisoner went into the room with us. I gave them 6 d. each, and Travers said they would have 1 s. more before I went out; I said, I would if she would let me out. I took my purse out to give her 1 s., and Wood knocked my purse out of my hand - the other woman held me behind. I tried to seize Wood, but the other prisoner let her out - I struggled with her for five minutes before she got out, and tore her gown - the room was on the ground floor. I ran into the street, where several people were standing, and asked for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040007"></xptr>help nobody would assist me. Some man knocked me down. I seized Wood, but another man pulled me back, and she got from me. I lost sight of her for half an hour - I saw her again in the street, and she was secured. A waistcoat was taken from her, which she said belonged to a gentleman in her room - we went to the room; it was not the room I was in. I saw Travers in custody next morning. There was a candle in the room. I never saw them before; but am certain of them. I lost twenty-seven sovereigns and a cheque for 15 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Who did the money belong to - A. Different people who I had received it for. I was quite sober, and did not like the place when I got there.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street. On the 26th of November, about six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prosecutor in Winfield-street. He crossed the way, and seized Wood, saying she had robbed him - he appeared sober, but distressed at losing his money. In taking Wood to the watch-house, I found a silk waistcoat under her arm, which she said she was going to pawn for a man in her room. Upon going to the house I found a genteel man there without a waistcoat. I searched Wood soon after. The prosecutor said he had torn her gown at her bosom; she undid her gown, it was not torn. I took Travers next morning. The prosecutor saw her at the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You met her in Wentworth-street - A. Yes. If she had the sovereigns about her, I must have found them.</p>
               <p>WOOD'S Defence. I was with the gentleman who gave me the waistcoat an hour and a half.</p>

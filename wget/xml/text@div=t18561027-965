               <p>ending 5th Jan., a man named Thomas Wells was in my employ—he came into my service on the Wednesday—according to this book, he did not work the whole of the day on Wednesday; he worked seven and a half hours that day—this is in Neary's handwriting—the entry is opposite the name of "Day"—on the Thursday and Friday he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> stated to have worked the full time, that is ten hours—all this is placed opposite the name of "Day"—there was a man named Day in my employ that week, I think he was employed at Aldershot—the men working at Aldershot are not in this book—there is an entirely separate account kept for the men at Aldershot—ten hours is also placed against Wells on the Monday and Tuesday—he was not at work for me on either of those days—I do not know that of my own knowledge—by holding this book up to the light, I can discern a pencil line carried from Day's name on the Wednesday, covering over the Monday and Tuesday, and connecting the name of Day with the seven and a half on Wednesday—he was paid 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per day—if he had worked from Wednes<lb></lb>day to Friday, the amount that should have been carried out would have been 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the amount actually carried out here is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making a difference of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the last column the red ink line has been scratched out, and a black one put in—that is the pounds line, where the "1" is now inserted—there is <hi rend="italic">also</hi> an erasure in the shillings line, that is perfectly discernible by the absence of the red line—the last name but two on that column is "Thomas Wakeling"—this is for the week ending 7th March—Monday is the first day on which he is stated to have worked for me—he is stated to have worked ten hours that day, ten hours on the Tuesday, Wednesday the same, Thursday seven and a half hours, and Friday ten hours—Saturday would not appear in this page, it would go on to the following week—the total amount brought out here is four days, seven and a half hours, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—supposing that he came on the Wednes<lb></lb>day, and worked seven and a half hours, and ten hours on Thursday and Friday, the amount he would have been entitled to would be 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the red ink line separating the pounds column from the shillings has been scratched out, and the "3" put in; it has evidently been written on an erasure, the "1 "is quite distinct before that, and has been scratched out—Wakeling was paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a day's work of ten hours—if two days were added, it would make the amount 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. here—the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been added.</p>

Scott Russell and Co., making an iron roof—it was necessary to purchase lead for that job—I believe Neary had to purchase lead for me, I do not know it of my own knowledge—that would be an extraordinary occasion—I do not know whether that was done in a great hurry, I was not with him at the time—I do not know when this account was made up—I do not know whether it was rendered some time afterwards—Mr. Stap is my brother-in-law; I do not know whether he can tell—I do not know that this account was rendered to me by Neary at least three or four months ofter this date of Jan.—I know that I have not charged him with stealing 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was examined before the Magistrate—I think I have preferred charges against him to the amount of 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I cannot recollect the amounts, the amounts in these indictments are small—I think he was in my service three or four years, I cannot recollect exactly—he left at one time, and returned afterwards—he asked to come back—I have had dealings with Fossey and Steel, timber merchants—I had a large contract with them in reference to some wooden houses that were going out to the Crimea—I compounded with them, in 1854, for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I then owed them between 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I forget the amount—at this time there is a claim on the part of Fossey and Steel of some thousands of pounds against me; I believe between 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that claim was made, I think, last Aug. twelve months—it was pending at the time the prisoner was in my employ men t—Fossey and Steel have become bankrupts, and their assignees are now pressing that claim against me—I have indicted Fossey for other matters—those matters amount to more than 1502., and more than 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I discharged Neary on 7th June last, because I found that he had been giving information to Fossey and Co.—I am not in the least afraid of his being called as a witness against me in the action—it is perfectly imma<lb></lb>terial to me—I never said I would ruin him—I called him a scoundrel—I did not shake my fist in his face, or do anything with my fist; I hope I should not be so ungentlemanly—I never said that I would rain him—I did not say, "You may go and starve, as you have starved before, and die in the workhouse"—I did not use any expression of that sort in the pre<lb></lb>sence of Mr. Stap—I have not the slightest recollection of it—I do not think I could—I do not think I said anything to him about dying in a workhouse—it is a difficult thing to swear to every word that a man utters—I really cannot answer whether I did or did not use such language; I have no recollection of making use of such expressions—I do not think it at all probable that I could say such a thing—I did not tell him that it wonld be much better to go across the seas, than to give evidence against an employer—I think I never said that; I have not any recollection of making use of such expressions at all, in any way whatever—I have no</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, and have occasionally worked for Mr. Walker, at the foundry at Millwall. I went into his employ shortly after Christmas—I think it was about the second day after New<lb></lb>year's day—I went to work about 10 o'clock in the morning; if I had been employed previously to that day, I should have gone to work at 6 o'clock, and worked till half past 5—I received 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a day that week; I received two days and three quarters; that was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I went to work on the Wednesday—Neary paid me the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been in the habit of working for Mr. Walker.

            . I am a working-man, and live in St. Luke's. I moved these book cases on a Saturday; I do not know the date, as I can neither read nor write; the prisoner came to my master's stable for a horse and cart to remove the goods - there were two of them together; I received them into the cart at No. 75, Coleman-street - two book cases were put into the cart - I should know the men who helped them in, the prisoner was one of them; the things were taken to Mr. Wilcox's, Moor-lane, and the prisoner helped to take them out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear the name of Wilson or Douglas in the course of conversation? A. No; I am servant to Murphy, whom the cart was hired of; the prisoner had a person with him when he hired it; I cannot tell whether he appeared the servant of that person.</p>

            . I am a cabinet-maker, and live at No. 5, Rose and Crown-court, Moorefields. On Saturday morning, the 14th of July, about a quarter or half-past nine o'clock, the prisoner and another came and asked if I would buy two book-cases; I asked where they were - they said in Moor-lane, and if I went with them, they would show them to me; I went and found them at Wilcox's, laying by some boxes, all in pieces; they are enclosures for recesses - nothing but the fronts; I said No, they could not suit me; they said I should have them cheap - I said they were destroyed in being got down, and would never come together again; I was going away - the prisoners came after me, and said I should have them cheap- I asked what he wanted for them, and will not be certain whether he said 30s. or 3l. - I offered a sovereign; he said that would not do, and went back - he then ran after me, and said I might have them for the sovereign - I got a truck, and brought them away; the prisoner and the other man came home with me - I changed a 5l. note, paid them, and I do not think it was a minute before Mr. Griffiths and Wilcox came together to my house; the book cases were at the door - Mr. Griffiths claimed them; I should know the other man again - he was a thin man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The things were made of deal? A. Yes, except the fronts; if taken to a sale, I do not know that they would fetch what I gave for them - if I fitted them up to a recess, they might cost 12l. - I afterwards heard that it was Wilson who was with the prisoner; I believe I had that information from the gentleman at your side (the prisoner's solicitor) - I did not suppose the prisoner to be the other's servant; I gave him the money - I could not get change without 5s. worth of halfpence, and the prisoner came over and asked me to give him 5s. for the halfpence - what was done, was with the consent of the other party.</p>

            . I carry on business in Moor-lane. On the 14th of July, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner and another came to my shop, and asked if they might put some recesses into my shop, as it rained very hard - I said I could not spare my shop; they pressed it, and said they were coming from Mr. Saul's with the recesses, and under that impression, I gave them leave; in about twenty minutes, as I was going to breakfast, I saw Murphy's cart loaded at my door - I told the other man I could not have them in my shop; they said they would take them away immediately - I said I should expect to see them moved before I came from breakfast; when I returned the truck was there, loaded with them - the prisoner and the other man was helping Adams to load; I was fetched away, and when I returned the truck was gone - we found it being unloaded at Adams'; Griffiths came there, and claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you are not sure the goods are the same? A. I never looked at them - the other man asked me to let them be on my premises; he was a tall thin man - the prisoner seemed to act under his direction, from what I saw.</p>

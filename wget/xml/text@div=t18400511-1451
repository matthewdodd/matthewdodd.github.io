                  </hi>. I live in Vernon-buildings. On the 6th of May, at a quarter-past twelve o'clock at night, I was in Gordon-square—the pri<lb></lb>soner came up, and put her arm round my neck, and immediately I missed my pins—I told her she had robbed me, and asked if she would give them up—she would not—I said I would call a policeman—after calling two or three times, she threw the pins on the ground, and said, "There are your pins, let me go"—the policeman came up, and I picked up three pins at her feet—I missed a fourth, when the officer went back, and found it on the spot where she had been—I deal in jewellery, and usually have two pins at the bottom of my scarf.</p>

            . I live in Fore-street, Gravel-lane. On Sunday, the 25th of August, about four o'clock, I lost four half crowns, a shilling and sixpence; I was at the Three Compasses.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there - A. I cannot say. I was with two or three acquaintances, they had a glass; I was taken ill; I went backwards and fell asleep. I cannot tell how long I had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who took the money away - A. I cannot say; I found Johnson's hand in my pocket; when I was in the privy, that awoke me.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how long you had been there do you - A. I cannot say to half an hour; I was asleep when the two prisoners came into the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you perceived your money in your fob - A. A little before I went into the privy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoners taken up - A. Not the same evening; I was not in a right trim to follow them at that time; I saw 
               <persName id="t18110918-91-person682">Johnson</persName>
             the same night; I charged her with robbing me of my money; she said she had not got any of it.</p>

            . I saw Angle's hand in the prosecutor's pocket, he was asleep then, and continued asleep until I went out of the yard. Johnson was at the bar.</p>
               <p>Johnson's Defence. I was in the public-house when there was an alarm of a man sitting indecent in the privy; he was called out; he passed me at the bar, and said nothing; in the evening I was in the tap-room, he accused me of being one of them.</p>
               <p>Angle's Defence. I am innocent. I was charing at this house; they were without a servant; he was asleep in the privy in an indecent manner.</p>

On the Saturday night, the 10th of June, we were robbed, and on the Thursday after, I was informed somebody was taken, and I went down to the office in Worship-street, and there I saw a neckcloth that had been cut in pieces, belonging to my husband, a cloth cap, one muslin cap, a very old handkerchief, I have got the fellow to it in my pocket, and one pair of stockings, that is all that I have found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. All you have discovered is a neckcloth, and cloth cap, not worth above two or three shillings altogether? - A. They are worth very little, only a new pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. All put together are not worth four shillings? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Gibbons. This handkerchief I know to he mine, this new pair of stockings, there is no mark, but I know them by the shape of my husband's leg, I gave three shillings and three-pence for them, and he wore them but about three hours, the caps had my own mark upon them.</p>

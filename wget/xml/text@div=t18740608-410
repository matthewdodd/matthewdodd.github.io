I am a bus maker, in my father's employ, at 4 and 5, Church Row, Aldgate—I have known the prisoner two years, as a labourer—on 30th May I went to the workshop at about 6.45 a.m., and the prisoner came to the door and said, "Will you take care of a sack for me?"—I said "Yes"—I went out, and saw the sack in the passage of the next house—Mr. Goldsmith's premises are about 100 yards off—I fetched the sack into our workshop—a detective spoke to me, and I was taken in custody and afterwards discharged.</p>

On 30th May, at a little after 6 o'clock, I was on duty in Church Row, Aldgate, and saw a sack lying in the passage of No. 4—I watched it about an hour, and saw Durell go into the passage, take the sack by the neck, and pull it into a room on the ground floor, which is used as a workshop—in consequence of something he said, I went to Mr. Thiers, the prisoner's master, and found the prisoner there—I told him I should apprehend him for stealing a sack of oats, and that Durell said that he had met him that morning, and told him he would find a sack of oats in the passage, and would he take care of it for him—he said that he knew nothing at all about it—I took him to the station, where Durell was in custody—he said "That is the man who told me to take care of the oats"—Durell was discharged the same morning, and made evidence of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman in the white-lead department at Messrs. Walker's. On the 11th of May, I received a verbal order from Burns to pack two firkins of lead—I packed it—and noticed a cart backed up to the warehouse gates—the prisoner had charge of it—I asked him whether he came for pipe or paint—he said for paint—white lead means paint in the trade—I asked him who it was for—he said for Mr. Middleditch—I saw the two firkins craned into the cart—I weighed them, and gave the weight out on the slate—I am sure the prisoner is the person—there was nobody else with the cart—he received the goods.</p>

               <p>Q. What were these persons in prison for? - A. For desertion; I delivered them at Coventry to a party of the 13th light dragoons, and received back two prisoners from them to convey to the Savoy; they were deserters.</p>
               <p>Q. Having received these two deserters, what did you do? - A. I received the same orders from the adjutant of the 13th light dragoons, to prime and load before them, which we did; the deceased,

             marched in front of the deserters; I was in the rear, and so was the prisoner, in file with me; the deceased ran to the right, up Hart-street; I ran after him; by that time Baxter was behind me; I went several yards, I cannot say how many, I was in a slurry at the time, and cannot say how many yards, it might be eight or nine.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards might he be before you? - A. He might be between twenty and thirty yards, he gained ground considerably upon me, for I was loaded at the same time; Baxter was behind me, and I did not know what he was about till I saw the man drop in front of me, before I heard the report of the piece; I turned round to see where the report came from, and likewise to see if the other prisoner was safe.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance was Baxter at that time? - A. A considerable distance; he was with the party at the time; I went up to the deceased and found him quite dead.</p>
               <p>Q. What accoutrements had you? - A. We were loaded with our belts and guns, and our knapsacks with necessaries.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you could have secured him by pursuit? - A. Certainly we could not, we were so fatigued, for we had been up three nights watching over them, because we could not get a prison to put them in, and we were afraid of being punished if we lost them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any passages that he could have gone up and escaped? - A. Yes, I believe there was one very near where he dropped, I am not sure, I am not much acquainted with that part; at Dunstable they tried to break out of the cage from us, and we were obliged to alarm the town.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no particular knowledge of the deceased? - A. I never saw him before in my life that I know of.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What would have been the punishment upon you if you had let him escape? - A. It depends upon what the gentlemen of the Court-martial please.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I think, by the articles of war, it is death, or such other punishment as the Court-martial may think fit.</p>
               <p>Witness. I told them, the men, to prime and load every morning, and the deserters told me they knew that part of the duty very well, for they had been upon such duty themselves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. He knew, therefore, the consequence of his attempting to run away? - A. Certainly; I received a paper with them, which we call a rout, and delivered it to the provost.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I bear the commission of Provost-marshal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280048"></xptr>to the brigade of Guards; I received from Macdonald a certificate of two deserters to be received.(Produces it, it is read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose they had suffered a deserter to escape, what punishment would have been inflicted on them? - A. According to the diseretion of a Courtmartial.</p>
               <p>Q. Can they go so far, by the articles of war, as to punish with death? - A. I believe 
they can.</p>



               <p>Q. What punishment do you recollect to have been inflicted for such an offence? - A. I have known four or five hundred lashes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You have been used to receive these certificates? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it quite regular? - A. Not quite; there is a not a bene in that rout which is not in routs in general; the difference is, that these two men had been tried by a Court-martial, and found guilty, and were to be sent to Chatham to serve abroad.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant-major, and three other witnesses, who gave him an excellent character for humanity and good nature.</p>

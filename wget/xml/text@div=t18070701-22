            . I was coming home to my lodgings on a Sunday morning three weeks ago, between one and two o'clock in the morning; I knocked at the door of my landlady to let me in; Conway came up to me and knocked me down, and after getting up he knocked me down a second time without any provocation; I never mentioned a word to him; my landlord came to the door, he desired me to come in, he opened the door and took me in; after being in doors some time, I went out of door to water. Conway and Slater catched hold of me and pulled me into Slater's passage; Conway brought his sword and cut me on the cheek.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he bring the sword from. - A. Out of his own room; I cried out for assistance, my landlord came to assist me, Conway struck him with the sword, and Slater laid hold of Carrol by the shoulder; the prisoner said, here comes the long b - r, and I'll run him through; he hit Carrol in the middle of his left hand; the night constable came and saw him all of a gore of blood; Conway and Slater run away after he had cut me and Carrol, when the watchman came into the court.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of his sword. - A. Carrol took it away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body assist in taking it away from him. - A. No, no one; my hand was bad, I was not able to assist, the sword was taken from Conway before Carrol's wife came; he took it by meer strength. Carrol's wife took the stick from Slater.</p>
               <p>Q. She did nothing in taking the sword from Conway. - A. Not as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. You said that Carrol had taken the sword from Conway before his wife came. - A. I think he did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when Conway struck you with the sword. - A. I was down when he struck me with the sword, and I catched the sword in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Slater about at the time that Conway struck you with the sword. - A. He laid hold of me in his passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Slater now. - A. I saw him last Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the prosecutor of this indictment - how happened it you did not take Slater up, you say he held you when you was struck with the sword. - A. We could not take him up when we could not find him; we tried to find him on Monday, we could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he not at work at his business. - A. I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nothing pass between you and the prisoner before he knocked you down. - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no dispute with him before. - A. Never at any time, he did it without any provocation at all. I did not see him when he struck me first.</p>

            . Q. Now tell us what was the dispute between the prisoner Conway and your husband, and when was it. - A. On the 14th of June, about one o'clock in the morning, Davis was coming home to his lodgings; I was up, he knocked at the door for me to let him in; with that Conway came and knocked him down, when I opened the door to him.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether he was knocked down before you opened the door to him. - A. I cannot say, he was knocked down twice after I opened the door to him; my husband came out and took him in, Carrol went and put his hand to Conway's arm, and said go home good man; I think he went with him as far as the step of the door, after Davis went in. He was in a considerable time and then he went out again; with that Conway and Slater pushed him into the passage; I went out of the door when I heard the noise, I saw Slater and Conway pulling him into Slater's passage; I did not go nigh them till I saw Davis coming out all of a gore of blood. He cried out murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband at that time. - A. He was in his own apartment; he went to his assistance to bring him in.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Davis when you saw him of a gore of blood. - A. He was coming out of Slater's passage, he came into my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when your husband went out to his assistance. - A. He was in Slater's passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your husband gone out to him before you saw him on a gore of blood. - A. Yes, upon Davis coming out, I asked him where Carrol was, he said he believed he was killed; I went into Slater's passage, I saw my husband held by Slater, and Slater's wife had a candle in her hand; and held him with the other hand; I did not see him strike him; Conway had the sword across Carrol's body; I went inside of them, I laid hold of Conway's arm, till Carrol took the sword out of his hands.</p>

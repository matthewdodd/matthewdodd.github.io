            . I am a pawnbroker, residing in South-street, Manchester-square. I have a violin and bow, and a silver watch-the watch was offered to pledge about two o'clock in the afternoon of the 22d of January, by the prisoner. I had information that they had been stolen. and detained the prisoner. He had only the violin and bow with him at the time. He said, that he gave 30s. for the watch some years back - He afterwards said he gave a Jew 12s. for it last Monday. He wanted me to let him go. I went to the shop-door to look for the man - I had sent for the prosecutor, and he ran out at the side-door. I stopped him, and took him to the watch-house. He then said, he had left some things in a bag behind the counter, he desired me to get them-they were the violin and gaiters; he had the gaiters on his legs when he came into the shop, but while I detained him, he took them off, and put them into the bag.</p>

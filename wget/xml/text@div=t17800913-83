               <p>How soon was this after Hughes said there was a strange man packing things up? - About ten minutes; a quarter of an hour at farthest.</p>

               <p>What is the value of these pistols? - Eight guineas; they were not to be disposed of under twelve guineas.</p>
               <p>The place they were taken from was part of Mr. Squibb's dwelling-house? - It is the warehouse, it adjoins; but I believe it is not under the same roof, there are two roofs.</p>

               <p>Denew. He was very much in liquor; they were taken from him in Burlington-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you receive any instructions from Burton with respect to Miller - A. Yes; I did what Mr. Burton directed me. I saw Miller on the 4th of March at the Flatting Mills, Great Wild-street, Drury-lane; I asked Mr. Miller if he had any goods, meaning sixpences and shillings; he said yes; I told him I wanted an order for a friend that was going in the country, as much as two pieces; a piece is a guinea's worth; it means two for one; he said he had not them about him; he had got some; he very readily gave me one shilling and two sixpences, bad ones; I mean all bad; I gave him one good shilling, that is all I purchased at that time; another appointment was made on the same day, in the evening to meet at the Lemon Tree, at the top of the Hay-market.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you meet there - A. I was desired; Mr. Miller did not come; we were to meet there for the same purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Burton - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any thing from Burton - A. I received a queen Ann's half crown from

             the officer; he gave it to me to purchase some more bad money at the Lemon Tree. Mr. Miller did not come then.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you receive any thing from Burton - A. On the Monday morning; Mr. Miller promised me that as he had disappointed me at the Lemon Tree, he would meet me in Oxford-street, at the sign of the Hog in the Pound; I received two good shillings of Mr. Burton; they were marked.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on Monday the 6th of March did you see Miller, and where - A. At the Hog in the Pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with you - A. Mr. Burton went with me; Mr. Burton and I parted before we got to the Hog in the Pound. I met Mr. Miller, I asked him how he came to disappoint me; he said he could not get the goods ready; I said are they ready now; he said no. - How long, Mr. Miller, do you think it will be before you let me have the two pieces? he said about two o'clock. I came out of the public house; we walked down the street; I said Mr. Miller have you none about you; he said yes, I have nine; I said I would take four; Mr. Miller gave them me and I gave him the two marked shillings that I received from Mr. Burton. Mr. Miller and I went into the next wine vaults; Mr. Burton followed and took Mr. Miller and me into custody. Mr. Burton took from Mr. Miller five bad shillings; he took the four shillings that I purchased; he asked me where I got them; I said of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any answer to that - A. He said how could you do so, when you know what a family I have got.</p>

            . Q. You are a constable - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know the last witness, did she apply to you, and on what day - A. On the 4th of March; she said she knew a person that was in the habit of selling bad money; I gave her a shilling and went with her to Great Wild-street; I marked that shilling. I went with her there, opposite of the flatting mills; she went in and stopped some time, then she came out again; she marked a shilling and two six-pences which were bad, and gave them to me; which she said she bought of the prisoner. She told me that an appointment was made, that she was to go to the Lemon Tree in the Hay Market, at eight o'clock in the evening. That appointment was not kept by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you agree to meet on Monday at ten o'clock in the morning, at the Hog in the Pound - A. She called at my house first on Monday morning, I gave her two shillings, I marked them before her; she went to the Hog in the Pound, I remained on the opposite side of the street; she was about five or six minutes before she came out. We had agreed upon a signal when she came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed before she went into the house, for the purpose of what she was to do - A. Yes; for the purpose of buying four counterfeit shillings. She came out and the prisoner with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. I never saw the prisoner before the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. When they came out together, did she give that signal that you had directed - A. She did. I followed the prisoner and the last witness into the liquor shop; I told Miller that he was my prisoner, I must search him, and see what he had got in his pockets; he said very well, I am done; and perceiving something in his right hand, which was shut; I found in that hand five bad shillings and three good six-pences, and the two shillings which I had marked and gave to English; these were altogether in one hand. I then confined his hands and sent for a coach. At the time the coach was sent for, he said Mrs. King, how could you serve me so, you know what a family I have got.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the woman - A. I searched the last witness; I found four bad shillings in her possession. I asked her how she came by them, in the presence of the prisoner; she said she purchased them of Mr. Miller, he made no answer to that. I took them both to the office in a coach; I delivered four of the bad shillings that I found in the prisoner's hand to my brother officer, Jackson; keeping one myself; and the four I found upon Mrs. English, I kept myself, and the marked money that I gave to Mrs. English, I have got; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that that is the marked money that you gave to Mrs. English to give to the prisoner - A. I am positive of that; these are the pieces of marked money that I gave to Mrs. King originally, there are three small dots upon it.</p>
               <p>Q.Before Mrs. King had gone into the public house had you satisfied yourself that Mrs. King had no other money about her - A. I had; I saw her pockets turned inside out.</p>
               <p>Jury. How can you swear to these little dots, there is a cross also - A. Yes; that is marked by the other person that I gave them to; I put the dots myself; I speak to that, and the cross I speak to.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Have you any doubt that these are the marks that you put on - A. I am certain to that being the money that I delivered to Mrs. King; I searched Mrs. King in my own apartment; she had no other money about her whatever.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180905170051"></xptr>Mr. Alley. You are a constable - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I will now ask you whether Mrs. King applied to you, or you to her - A. Mrs. King applied to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not been acquainted with Mrs. King before she applied to you - A. I saw her two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that she had been tried here - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had you would not have employed her - A. I might not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say, if you paid her well, she would tell you of a person that dealt in bad money - A. She told me that she knew of a person that dealt largely in bad money; I dare say I might say she would be paid well for her trouble; I take it for granted the gentlemen that undertook the business would pay her for her trouble. I thought it my duty. I undertook it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. She told you that she would very willingly try to catch the prisoner - A. We went for that intent, at least I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You laid the plan, you had no confidence in the woman - A. No; I marked the money before I gave it her; and I should if it was to any other person; I should have marked it to my own sister, if I had her for that intention. I can swear that the two shillings I gave her, I found them two upon the prisoner when I searched him; and on the woman I found these four shillings in her possession, in the presence of the prisoner. I am confident that the prisoner had five counterfeit shillings in his hand, and the two shillings that I gave her he had in his hand, and three good six-pences. I produce the one counterfeit shilling that I had.</p>
               <p>Jackson. I have got the other four, I produce them. I received them from Burton.</p>
               <p>Burton. Them are the four found upon the woman, and there are the two good shillings found in the prisoner's hand, and the three six-pences.</p>
               <p>MR. FRANKLIN. Q. I believe you are one of the moniers of his majesty's mint - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these four shillings taken from the woman, Mrs. English, and tell me whether they are counterfeit or not - A. They are.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you positively state that I was the person who took your handkerchief? A. I can swear you was running, and gave a handkerchief to the other boy - you ran till I got within five or six yards of you; you said, in the station-house, you were going to get a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Your handkerchief was gone? A. Yes, and I saw some red in the handkerchief he gave to his companion - there was red in mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw two boys running up Drury-lane; I heard a cry of Stop him! I ran - that gentleman came up, and accused me of picking his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 9, Cheater-street, Kennington, and am a plasterer. On 26th June, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I was going past the prisoner's house in Lorimer-terrace, with Morgan and Allen, and heard a cry—I did not notice it particularly, but Morgan did, and went into the house; I went in after him, and saw him in a scuffle with the prisoner—he had nothing in his hand at that time that I saw—Morgan was being pulled about—I saw him out of the house—as we were leaving, I felt something come on my shoulder—I immediately turned round to see what it was, and felt something hit me on the forehead—I could not see what it was—I received a wound, which is here now—the skin was out.</p>

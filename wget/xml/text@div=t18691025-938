                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Glenn, who keeps the Grosvenor Arms, Hounslow—Sarah Ann Smith, the deceased, was my sister—she had for some years past lived at our house, the Grosvenor Arms—she was married to the prisoner—he was often absent at work and looking for work, for a month or two at a time—he is a stone sawyer—he had been away four weeks on the Monday that he came home on the Thursday—his wife was at our house when he came home on 23rd September, about 5 o'clock—she had been out in the early part of the day; she loft between 7 and 8 in the morning, and came home again about 12—I do not know where she had been, she did not tell me that—the went out again after that, and came borne about 3 o'clock, or it might be 4, I cannot say—I could then see from her manner and appearance that she had been drinking—I do not think she was exactly drunk, but she was the worse for liquor—the prisoner came home about 5 o'clock, and asked for a pint of beer, which I gate him at the bar—I said, "Why don't you come into the kitchen?" because he always used to go into the kitchen—he said, "No, this will do for me," and I think he went into the tap-room with it—his wife was then lying on the sofa in the kitchen, which is on the same floor as the tap-room—he had not seen her or asked for her when he asked for the beer—a little later on he went into the kitchen where she was and lit his pipe, but I did not hear them speak to one another—I did not hear them speaking, I was too far off—I cannot say how long they remained there—the next time I saw them they were standing at the bar together, between 10 and 11 o'clock, but I heard nothing pass between them—I then saw him knock her down with his fist at the bar where they were standing—he said, "I have <hi rend="italic">bunged</hi> one eye up for you, and now I will bung the other up—that was after he struck her—I had not observed anything the matter with her eye before that—he then took this hand-chopper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) out of his pocket, and said, "This will <hi rend="italic">do you"</hi>—she was lying on the floor, and I stood in front of him that he should not do anything more to her—when he had used those words he put the chopper back into his pocket again—it is, I think, a tool used in his trade—he did not strike her again, that I saw—she got up soon after, and Went out at the tack door—I went into the kitchen to get her up to bed, and while I was in the kitchen I heard a rustling at the bottom of the stairs, and before I could light the candle, I went to see what it was—there was a light in the bar, and I found my sister lying with her head towards the wall, and her feet towards the stairs (the staircase is in the direction of the back door)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186910250061"></xptr>
               <p>—the prisoner was dote to her, touching her—I put my hand to her chest, and found she did not breathe—I said, "Sarah does not breathe"—he said, "Nonsense, she is only faint; I have seen her faint oftentimes before"—I tried her again, and found she did not breathe, and I called my husband, who looked at her, put his hand to her forehead, said she was dead and told the prisoner to go away for a doctor immediately the prisoner went out, and my husband went after him—the prisoner returned a minute or two before my husband—he went towards the beer cellar when be came back—that is on the same floor with the kitchen—my husband came back soon afterwards, with Sergeant Hooper, and a constable—the distance between the foot of the staircase and the wall against which her head laid is four or five feet, I should fancy.</p>

               <p>suffering from the effects of drink, I do not think she was drunk, she had been drinking—ours is a beer-house, the tap, the kitchen, the cellar, and the parlour are all close to one another—we have not a beer engine, we have to fetch the beer in jugs from the cellar—he came in and lit hit pipe when the was lying on the sofa—Sophia Barlow was in the kitchen—the prisoner was quite sober then—immediately after he had lighted his pipe he went into the tap-room—I know Sophia Barlow went into the room—I do not know whether she persuaded his wife to go to him—I do not remember a conversation between Smith and his wife and Barlow, about a soldier running away from Hounslow Barracks—she did not say something to him in the kitchen, nor did I say to her "Hold your tongue, you fool, you know too much"—I never named such a thing—I do not know whether she was using foul language at that time, but she used to do so when she was drunk—there was nobody else in the bar during the evening—I do not know whether there was anybody in the tap-room, I did not go in—my husband and I serve, and Sophia—Sophia lit the gas and served in the evening—I only served a coachman with a pint of beer—I saw on soldiers that night—my husband was serving, but he was in and out several times—it was between 10 and 11 that I saw him strike her, in front of the bar, on the right eye—I cannot say to a few minutes—I then interfered to prevent his using further violence—I stood in front of her and pushed him away—that was the only blow with the fist that I saw—but he took the chopper out, and I saw him lift his leg to kick her on the left shoulder and the left side—I will swear that—I could see that hit foot touched her shoulder or her side—this is my mark to this statement—I do not recollect it being read over to me before I signed it—I think what I had stated was read over to me by a gentleman in Court—what I have said here is true, and I cannot recollect but what I said the truth before the Magistrate—that was on the 25th September, two days after it happened—(<hi rend="italic">The witnesses deposition stated</hi>: "He knocked her down four or five times, and kicked her awfully")—he kicked her very much on the floor.</p>

I am a laundry-maid, of 4, Allen Cottage, Tring Road, Hounslow—on Thursday, 23rd September, I went to the Grosvenor Arms, Hounslow, and the prisoner came in a little before 5 o'clock; I was then in the kitchen—he knocked at the bar, and I saw him have some beer, and then he came into the kitchen, lit his pipe, and went away again—his wife was sitting on the sofa when he came in, just leaning against the edge of the sofa, not asleep—she seemed very much excited and confessed, but I do not think she was tipsy; I mean the result of drinking; she had been drinking that day—she said nothing to her husband, and he did not speak to her—at a little before 8 I went and lit the gas in the tap<lb></lb>room—I do not know whether the prisoner and his wife had been together between 5 and 8—I left the house and got back just before 8—when I lit the gas Smith was there, and I told he wife, who was in the kitchen, that he was there, and she went in end eat by him—she was then in about the same condition—I heard no more of them; I left the house—it was just before 9 o'clock—no quarrelling had occurred up to that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you talk to Smith at all during that evening? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—we had no conversation about any soldier at all—there was no conversation in my presence about a soldier running away from Hounslow Barracks—I know nothing about a soldier—I did not bear Mrs. Smith are bad language to her husband then, or at any other time—I have known her, on and off, about ten months, and never heard her use bad language—Glenn was about the house all the evening—I did not see three soldiers there, there was one, who followed me in and lit the gas for me, I did not notice any more—I went out of the house that night with one soldier, he is a married man, he is the one who lit the gas for me—I did not sea any more soldiers—I went to this beer-house to see my friend, Mrs. Perren, and</p>

I am a market gardener, and make the Grosvenor Arms beer-house my home—on September 23rd I arrived at home at 9.30—I entered the tap-room, and saw the prisoner and his wife there; he was standing, and she was sitting down; there did not appear much the matter with them then, but the woman was the worse for drink—she talked to him a little, but I do not remember what about—about 10 o'clock they went out of the tap-room together, and were at the bar together—I did not follow them, but I could see from the tap-room that the man knocked the woman down—I saw him knock her down with his fist—no one else was there at the time—I had not heard anything said by anybody, and I was near enough to hear if anybody had said anything to them—I was as near the bar as I am to you—I saw Mr. Glenn inside the bar, but he did not talk to them—Mrs. Glenn was in the kitchen—she went up to the deceased when she was knocked down, that the man should not hit her again—the deceased continued down for half an hour or twenty minutes, sitting on the ground where she fell—she asked for someone to pick her up, but I was afraid to go for fear the man should serve me the same—she stayed there a quarter of as hour or twenty minutes before she got up—she then got up of herself, and went out at the back door—the prisoner was there in the passage between the parlour and the back door, doing nothing—that was the way she would go she had to pass him, but there was room to pass without touching each other—after that I went to bed—as I passed the prisoner he was putting something in his pocket, a bit of iron or wood about twelve inches long—that was about two minutes after she had passed him—when he knocked her down he said that he had not done with her yet—I heard that distinctly—after that I heard nothing more till I heard Mr. Douglas's name mentioned in the middle of the night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am coachman to Mr. Barber, who lives in the Bath Road, Hounslow—on 23rd September I was lodging at the Grosvenor Arms—I got home about 8.45 at night, went into the tap-room, and saw Mrs. Smith sitting on the settle on the right-hand side in the tap-room—she had a black eye—I cannot be certain which, but I believe it was the right—she was very drunk—she was sitting on a settle, a sort of fixed seat behind the door—she had her handkerchief up to her eye, and was crying—Mr. Glenn was in the room, and the prisoner and two or three soldiers—the prisoner and one of the soldiers were playing at skitties on the baga<lb></lb>telle board—I heard the prisoner's wife ask him if he would let her have some beer, and I believe he made her no answer—he did nothing to her while I was in the tap<lb></lb>room—I stayed in the tap-room tin I went to bed, at about 9.30—the four soldiers had then left, and Mr. and Mrs. Glenn, and the prisoner and his wife, were all four standing at the bar—I did not hear anything till I got up stairs, but there was a bother among them all, I believe—I did not hear what was said, but there seemed to be a general quarrelling—I heard Mrs. Smith say, "I will go up stairs, and you sha'n't come up into my room," and she used very bad language—I had not heard anybody else say anything that I could distinguish before she said that—I did not hear anybody say anything afterwards, but I heard her halloa as she fell, I believe she fell down to the bottom of the stairs—I did not see her fall—I heard her run up three or four steps, and then heard a scuffle at the bottom of the stairs, and then she halloaed, and I heard the noise of a fall—I did nothing, I stayed in my room till the policeman came—I cannot say how soon he came, because I got into bed and dozed off to sleep—from the time she fell till the policeman came, Which was two hours, or two hours and a quarter, I did not hear any blow struck.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant T</hi> 38). About a quarter before mid-night, on 23rd September, I was on duty in High Street, Hounslow, and heard cries of "Police!" from the direction of the toll-bar—Mr. Glenn made a communication to me, and I proceeded with him towards his public-house—I went in first, and saw the deceased lying with her head and shoulders against the wall, and her feet at the foot of the stairs—she was dead—I felt her feet and hands—it was exactly 12 o'clock when I got to the house—I asked if anybody had gone for a doctor; I was told "No," and I sent for one—I asked who the party who had done it, and was directed to the cellar, by Mr. Glenn—as I went into the cellar I saw the Back door of the cellar being shut; I rushed out at the back door, and through into the garden, and, twenty or thirty yards up, I saw the prisoner getting over a fence into the main road—I caught him when he was half way over, and told him he was charged with causing the death of his; he said, "All right, I will go quietly with you"—I took him into the cellar—he said, "I have been away from home six weeks, looking for work; I came home to-night, and found my wife with some soldiers; she used bad language to me and ran away, and I got up to run after her; she was running up stairs; she had got up three or four steps, and I pulled her</p>

I am a surgeon, of Honslow—on 23rd September, about 12.30, I was sent for by the police, to the Grosvenor Arms, Hounslow, and found a dead woman at the foot of the stairs—she had been dead, I suppose, some hours—the surface of the body was cold—I found severs bruises on the right arm and elbow, a bruise under the collar-bone, and a small, severe bruise on the temple; a black (right) eye, and a laceration of the eye-lid, not so recent; a bruise on the left elbow, and an injury to the left shoulder; but no bruise—next day, with assistance, I made a post-mortem examination—there was a blow on the head, which I had observed the night before; but she had a great quantity of hair—when I opened the head I found that the sutures were divided, and a large quantity of blood had escaped from a large blood vessel, which was lacerated, and was the cause of death—there was no external laceration opposite the fracture; but there was an extensive bruise—I have seen the instrument; it might produce what I saw; but it is not probable.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

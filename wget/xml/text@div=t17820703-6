               <p>I live at a house opposite the prosecutor's. On the day Mr. Lewis's house was robbed, I saw the prisoner walk by Mr. Lewis's door two or three times; and he made a full stop, and looked at Mr. Lewis's child, which was then sitting at the door. He walked to Cross-court, which leads into Broad-court; then he walked back to Mr. Lewis's, and looked into the window. He made a full stop; and then he pushed open the door, and went into the house. I never saw him come out again. I thought the prisoner might have been a sweetheart to one of the maids. In about ten minutes after I saw the prisoner, I heard of the robbery.</p>
               <p>(Upon his cross-examination, he said he was at his master's garret-window when he saw the prisoner in Broad-court; that he saw the prisoner's face very plain; that he described the man's person, and his dress; in consequence of which the prisoner was apprehended some weeks after.)</p>

               <p>I was at that time servant to Mr. Lewis. The plate was kept open, upon a side-board, in the parlour.

               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.)</p>

            . I am a constable. I was returning from the Sessions House, and overtook the prisoner in Weymouth-street, with this bundle, hanging over his shoulder; it was about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 15th of February. I said,</p>

               <p>"What have you got there?" he said he had some things, and that he was going to the west end of the town. I said,</p>
               <p>"Where?" He said to the Oval, in Upper Gower-street; that he brought them from his brother's, who was butler to Miss Doughty, in Bedford-row; that the coachman desired him to take them for him, but that he did not know the coachman's name, nor did he know the man's name he was to take them to. Two carriages came by at the time, and he made off with the bundle; I instantly followed, overtook him in about two minutes, and found his account false.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to Bedford-row to enquire after my brother, who had lived with Miss Doughty, I met a groom whom I had often seen, he asked me if I was going to the west end of the town, and gave me them things to carry to the Oval.</p>

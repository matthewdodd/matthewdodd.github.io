               <p>Q. About what time in the morning were you awaked? - A. I heard my name called a little before four.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you come down stairs? - A. I came down stairs directly; as I was coming down stairs, I saw one of the parlour windows open.</p>


               <p>Q. Had that window any shutters? - A. Yes, outside, and on the table I saw the knife case empty.</p>
               <p>Q. At what window did the person get in? - A. The kitchen window.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that window fastened? - A. The shutter was bolted with a bolt at bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that shutter forced? - A. It did not seem to me to be forced; there was a vacancy, owing to the sun having drawn it, by which an instrument might be put in, and it might have been opened.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that shutter had been bolted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go in search of the person? - A. Yes; as soon as I had dressed myself I went in pursuit of her; I saw her in an alley about half a mile from my house; she saw me, and ran away; I pursued her, and called out, stop thief! I pursued her down the lane, and when she had got into the middle of the lane, she threw a brass candlestick at me; I still pursued her, and caught her; she asked me to let her go, and she would tell me where every thing was; she told me they were in a garden; I asked her if it was my garden, and she would not give me an answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take her back to your house? - A. She took me to the place where the bundles were.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that place? - A. In the alley where I first saw her; I found two bundles there; there was a low sence over the garden, where she had put them; I took her back to the house; there was a round table standing in the kitchen, and she took from her pocket three brass candlesticks, a decanter, two silver table-spoons, two silver salt-cellers, three glass salt-cellers, a silver tea-spoon, and two silver salt-spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring the bundle away which she had shewn you? - A. Yes; I led her down the lane to my house, and sent the bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the prisoner as to the manner in which she got into your house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Before she said any thing, did you tell her it would be better for her to confess? - A. No, I don't remember any promise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make use of any threat to induce her to confess? - A. No; she said she had no accomplices; there were a great many people about, who said, why did not she go to place, and earn an honest living; and she said, if Mrs. Gordon had given her a character, she could have got a place; I did not then know that she had lived<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180309140009"></xptr>in my service; she told me she came in at the kitchen window.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any poker found? - A. There was a small old poker found just by the window; I did not see it found.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it fitted to the window-shutter? - A. Yes, I saw the officer fit it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have been an instrument by which the shutter might have been opened? - A. Yes.</p>

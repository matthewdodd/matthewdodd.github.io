On the 24th of December, at half-past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, and bought cheese, butter, and sugar, which came to about 3 s., and tendered me a 1 l. bank note. I asked her her name and address? she said</p>
               <p>"Jones, No. 1, Great Saffron-hill." I gave her the change, and she went away. I wrote her name,</p>

I suppose 30 or 40 notes were taken that night. The prisoner was taken the latter end of the week. Three persons serve in my shop. I marked the note and put it into my pocket, I did not mix it with others. I am certain she is the woman.</p>

            . I am a publican, and live in Golden-lane, St. Luke's. The prisoner has often been at my house three or four times a day. I knew her by the name of Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever pay you a note - A. She came one day and changed a note; it was very new, and had no mark on it at all. I do not think she bought anything. I wrote</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Johnson, No. 72, Golden-lane," on it, as a man named Johnson, who lived with her, told me that was her name. It was afterwards returned to me as forged. I inquired, and found she had moved. I saw her again at the police office, in custody - (looks at a note) - this is it. I paid it away twice after I received it.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you pay it away twice - A. I paid it away, received it again the same evening in change, and paid it away in giving change for a 10 l. or 15 l. note. I have known the prisoner about eleven weeks - she never offered me any other note. The man she lived with once paid me one - I wrote the same direction on it; I do not know where that is. The person I paid the note to is not here - his name is Shooter. I received it before Christmas, for I paid it to him on the 12th of December. I did not ask the prisoner for any name, but wrote that on it - (looks at a note) - it is the note I took of the prisoner. I wrote the name and address as soon as I took it of her.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes - (looks at the note) - it is forged. It is not Bank paper, plate, nor A. Consett's writing. There is the appearance of a watermark, which is impressed. The other notes are also forged, and of the same description with the last, and off the same plate. The date-line is different. The only way I can account for that is by a small plate being slid in with the date, or the 13th of August being burnished out, and another date inserted in the original plate. The numbers are stamped as they are in a genuine note, but the letters No. is engraved - in a genuine note it is printed. One is signed Tabor - it is not his hand-writing; the other is signed A. Jones - there is no such person a signing clerk.</p>

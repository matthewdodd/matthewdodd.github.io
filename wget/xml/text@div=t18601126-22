                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>). On the night of 8th November I was on duty in Gresham-street, and saw the male prisoner standing close to the door of Mr. Hawke, the hatter, and the female prisoner standing in front of him—I watched them for some little time—they walked away into Moorgate-street, and Finsbury-pavement—I then got another officer, stopped the prisoners, and asked what they had been loitering at the door in Gresham-street for—the male prisoner said he had been watching a young man and woman on the opposite side of the way, at a warehouse, the door of which was partly open—I asked him what he watched them for—he said he thought they were there for an improper purpose—the prisoners were then brought back to Mr. Hawke's house—I had some conversation with the servant on the opposite side—I then took them to the station—on going along Aldermanbury, near a court, the male prisoner said to the female, "You can go and do what you want, Elizabeth"—I said I could not lose sight of her—he said, "Oh, yes, you can, <hi rend="italic">governor"</hi> and he jumped up at my throat, took hold of my scarf, and twisted it—I then took hold of him; a scuffle ensued—he called out to the female to make her escape—upon her endeavouring to do so I pushed the male prisoner on the top of her, against the wall, and stopped her—I called for assistance, which came—the female prisoner laid on the grating of an area and screamed violently—I heard something drop into the area—after taking her to the station I returned, and found in the area this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi>, and these seven skeleton keys.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Robert Henderson's Defence.</hi> On the 8th of this month my wife left me at home to go over the water to see an uncle; on her way home she met with a person who she had known for some time, who gave her these implements to mind. I met her in Gresham-street, but was not aware that she had them until we got into Aldermanbury.</p>

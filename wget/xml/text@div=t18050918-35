               <p>Q. Do you know the two prisoners at the bar? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners the persons that collected<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180027"></xptr>your rents? - A. The woman prisoner was chiefly employed to collect the rents.</p>
               <p>Q.Was your house broke open in February, 1804? - A. It was.</p>

               <p>Q. How did it appear to you that the house had been broken open? - A.

               <p>Q. Upon this discovery of your house being broke open, you were able to find easily what person broke it open? - A. I was, my wife can testify that.</p>

               <p>Q. What clothes? - A. My own wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they? - A. Two cotton gowns, two calimanco skirts, two cotton skirts, twelve pair of cotton stockings, two flannel petticoats, eight linen shirts, a silk handkerchief, a five-pound Bank note, and two pair of shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were packing them in the chest? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing at all about these things? - A. Yes; I took thirty one-pound notes out of a pair of shoes, and put them in my pocket; she said, it would be safer to leave them in the chest, but I put them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. She went out before you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you communicated to her that you were going to chapel that evening? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that on Sunday? - A. No, on Monday.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lock your chest when you went away? - A. No, I did not, I left it unlocked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see that you left it unlocked? - A. She did; she went away, and I did not see any more of her till I came out of my own house to go to chapel; then I went into her house to see what o'clock it was, and it was seven; when I went in, they would have me stop, and I stopped a quarter of an hour, and then I went out to chapel.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It was perfectly dark then, was it not? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you desire them to look after your house? - A. I did; I said I was going to chapel, and I would be very much obliged to them to answer the door if any body knocked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the husband at home at this time? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from your house to the chapel? - A. It is about three minutes walk; the chapel is in Grey Eagle-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you return from chapel? - A. I returned from chapel a little after eight o'clock; I went to my own house first after I came from chapel, and found my outer door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that door been shut by you when you went to chapel? - A. Yes; I locked both the locks, and when I came back again it was wide open; I went into my house, and looked into my chest, and it was empty; then I sent for my husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the prisoner afterwards? - A. I sent for my husband that minute, and he, as soon as he came in, ran to the prisoners' house, but he could not find them; they came to my husband afterwards to see what had happened, my husband sent for them; they seemed to be very sorry, as though they knew nothing about it; the girl can tell you more than I can what they said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them what you had lost? - A. Yes; I went and shewed them the chest, the same chest that I had put the things in, in the presence of the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any property since, and when? - A. I did not see any thing till I saw it with a search-warrant on the 12th of August; I had information; I got a warrant, and had some things produced.</p>
               <p>Q. What was produced to you on the 12th of August? - A. On the 13th, a gown that had been dyed, and a shirt of my husband's, a petticoat, and a calimanco skirt; the rest were found at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>Q. What was found at the pawnbroker's, were they your property? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. You, I believe,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180028"></xptr>was in the habit of intimacy with the prisoner at the bar, were you not? - A. She came backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>Q. As a friend she came to your house, and when she saw you put the thirty one-pound notes into your pocket, she very kindly observed to you, that you had better put these notes in the chest than take them out with you in the night to Spitalfields? - A. She did not say in the night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she make the observation, that you had better leave them there, that you might have your pocket picked? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, that after you came home, and found your house broke open, the prisoner and his wife came in as soon as your husband found them, and they seemed very sorry, as though they knew nothing at all about it? - A. They did.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you say about it? - A. We said it was a great pity such a gown should be dyed, it was so much admired; I came home and told the prisoner herself it was a pity it should be dyed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the man present then? - A. No; she made answer and said, it was only to wear every day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. I believe there is nothing very wonderful of a woman that wanted a gown dyed, of her having it dyed dark? -</p>
               <p>Court. That is all argument.</p>
               <p>Q.(To the witness.) Did you ever see Mrs. Taylor wear that gown before she sent it to be dyed? - A. No; she wore it afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Taylor or not purchase the duplicates? - A. Yes, she purchased the duplicates for a crown-piece; she said they were pawned in Gravel-lane for twenty-seven or twenty-eight shillings, she did not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not, I believe, see these articles, did you? - A. Never; I know no more.</p>

               <p>Q. Where do you live yourself? - A. In Castle-street, Whitechapel, No. 6; I go out to cleaning, and work at tailoring.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner but once before? - A. No, never in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. It is a good while ago? - A. Yes, last October, I lived with Mrs. Jones, and I lived with her all the time she was sick; she died a week before Whitsuntide last.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore there was from October down to the present time, and you recollect all about buying the duplicates? - A. I remember the words very well, Mrs. Taylor asked if it was her own property; she said, that the person that sold the duplicates was in distress, her husband was pressed, she had three small children.</p>
               <p>Q. Mrs. Jones is unfortunately dead? - A. She is.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the patch in the front of the shirt under the left shoulder, did Mrs. Upton, in your presence, put in that patch? - A. I cannot say to that; nothing but the sleeves and the bits on the shoulder were not felled on the inside; they are not new neck-bits, but old neck-bits.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mrs. Upton put in these old neck-bits? - A. They were in before; Mrs Upton put in new shoulder-straps and new wristbands, as near as I can guess, about six months ago; Mrs. Upton will be a better judge than me about the time.</p>
               <p>- UPTON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Bolland. Q. You know the last witness, Mrs. Cox? - A. Yes, she employed me to work for her.</p>

               <p>Q. How long ago? - A. About six months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the patch under the left arm? - - A. There is no felling, and I did not fell it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the patch - did you put in that patch on that shirt? - A. I did, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any patch there before you put it on? - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear positively? - A. Yes, I should be sorry to speak any untruth; there was no patch there before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How lately had you been applied to to speak to this fact - have you seen the prisoner since she has been in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where? - A. Not in Newgate; I saw her in this yard, in the underneath place.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you talked about these things, did not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. No conversation with the prisoner, nor any one else? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Never talked about the shirt to no one? - A. No, only I was asked by Mrs. Cox; she came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180509180031"></xptr>my daughter when they were in Hog-lane, and asked me to go, but I was not examined.</p>
               <p>Q. You were asked whether there was a patch under the left shoulder - you did not know before my learned friend put the question to you what you were come to prove? - A. No, I mended the shirt, and made the other about a week afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know that you were come to prove that there was a patch under the left shoulder - you did not expect to be asked any thing about that? - A.Nothing at all; I expected to be asked whether I knew the shirt, and this is positively the shirt that I mended for Mrs. Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. This is about six months ago? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And this is an old shirt - had you ever mended any other shirt for Mrs. Taylor? - A. Never; was an old shirt.</p>
               <p>Q.Had it any other patch about it? - A. I had the same patches that it has now, all but that just under the left shoulder; I put new wristbands in these sleeves, and I was ordered to put in new neck-bits, I would not, I thought it was not necessary.</p>
               <p>Q.Where do you live? - A. No. 8, George's-court; I live with my son and daughter, I have a trifle coming in, about eight shillings a month.</p>
               <p>Q.What is your son? - A. He is a master jeweller, and keeps three apprentices.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you have had no conversation with any body but with Mrs. Cox? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.When you were first applied to to give evidence on behalf of the prisoner, you refused to come? - A. Yes, I refused to come; my son and daughter were not willing that I should come, they thought it was such a mean thing.</p>

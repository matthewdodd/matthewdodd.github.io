                   in the Night, with an Intention to steal
            </rs>. Peter Dumolin depos'd, That he lives in a Cellar which the Parish pays the Rent of, and his Door was broke open about Three in the Morning, but he could not remember either the Day or the Month. The Watchmen depos'd, That they found the Cellar Door broke open, and a piece of it set against the Wall over the Way.

             depos'd, That Carrick and Smith, alias Newcomb (both executed) brought him into Company with the Prisoner, and one Sturges, Newcomb told them that he had Intelligence that Dumolin, an old French Man at the Seven Dials, had 50 l. hid in the left side of his Cellar, they went together in quest of it, but by the way attempted to rob a Pawn-broker's House, but being prevented, they pursued their first Purpose; they broke off a piece of the Door that the Lock shut into. The Watch coming their Rounds hindered their Entrance, they set the piece of board against a Wall, went off and stood at the corner of the Street with their Pistols: The Watch found the piece of Door, and looking about to see where it belong'd to, but not finding the Place, went away.</p>

               <p>They then ventured down the Celler, but the Watch again disturbed them, and they went off; this Evidence then got a piece of Candle at a neighbouring Ale-house, but it being short burnt his Fingers as he went down the Stairs, and so he let it fall; they then felt about in the dark but could find nothing; and the Watch coming round again occasioned them to retire the third time, which put an end to their present adventure, for the Celler door after much search being found open, Dumolin was alarm'd, and the Gang were forced to make an intire retreat. There being no Evidence against the prisoner but Lock, who was one of a Scandalous Character, the Jury <rs id="t17221010-23-verdict120" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Q. Do you remember, on the evening of Sunday, the 25th of February, looking at his poultry? - A. No. I fed the rabbit that evening; I left it safe, it was a doe rabbit.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you attend particularly to this rabbit? - A. I fed it every evening; I locked it up, the last thing, about eight o'clock that evening, in the tool-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to the poultry at all? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was the poultry kept? - A. In the same yard, a little further, in a different house. The next morning, about seven o'clock, I found the door of the place, where the poultry was kept, open, I had left it shut the evening before; I missed seven live hens, and one live cock; I then went to the tool-house, and found the rabbit was taken out, the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you next see any of your master's property again? - A. The evening of that same day; Monday, I saw this same doe rabbit, and several fowls, taken out of Bedfont river, in two baskets, between seven and eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far is the river from Dr. Whitefield's? - A. About a quarter of a mile. I believe some of the fowls were my master's, but the wings and tails were cut. I saw the prisoner Sharp immediately after, and the other two prisoners about half an hour afterwards, or three quarters.</p>

               <p>Q. How far from Dr. Whitefield's? - A. About a quarter of a mile, or hardly so far; they were driving two asses, with baskets on one, and panniers on the other; the next evening, Monday, about half past four, as high as I can guess, I saw Davis and Hindes come down from Staines towards Bedfont, with one ass, and in a quarter of an hour the other prisoner, the old man, came up, with two baskets upon his shoulders; then Sharp came up through the Shot first, and then Davis, went into Mr. Spurnell's Stony-close, and I saw them take the fowls out of the hedge, and put them into the the baskets; Hindes staid at the gate with his ass; I went and alarmed Bedfont, and then pursued them; and I saw Sharp on the top of the river bank, he threw some of the fowls out of the basket into the river, and then they were taken.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Hereford-street, Fitzroy-square, and am a cheesemonger. On the afternoon of 3rd April the prisoner came to my shop for a quarter of a pound of cheese—I am certain it was him—he gave me a half-crown, which I saw was bad—I said, "I will get you change"—I called my wife to get change, and I went round the counter to the door, to prevent the prisoner making his escape—I said to him, "This is a bad half-crown, and you know it; I shall give you in charge"—he said, "I hope not; I have just come out of the country; that is the only money I have got"—I kept the half-crown and waited some time, but I did not see a policeman—I permitted the prisoner to go away—I put the half-crown on a shelf in the window, apart from all other coin—about eight o'clock the same evening I saw Dicks, the policeman—I called him in and showed him the half-crown—he put a mark on it in my presence, and gave it me again—I kept it in my own possession till the 11th of April—I then gave it to Dicks, and on the next day, the 12th, in consequence of what Dicks told me, I went to the station—I saw some persons in custody—I recognized the prisoner imme<lb></lb>diately—I took that particular notice of him while he was in my shop, that I should have known him amongst a thousand persons—he was in my shop from five to ten minutes—I think there were five or six persons at the station besides the prisoner—I did not take notice of them—the Inspector asked me if I was sure the prisoner was the man—I said, "Yes."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, E</hi> 10). On 11th April I went with another officer, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, to 87, John-street, Tottenham-court-road—I knocked at the door—it was opened by a female—I told her I wanted to see Mr. Taylor—I went up-stairs, to the first-floor</p>

               <p>back room—I opened the door, and saw a female—I asked her if that was Mr. Taylor's room—she said it was—I went in, and saw the prisoner in bed—the female was dressed—I asked the prisoner if his name was Henry Taylor—he said it was—I told him I was a police-sergeant, and this was a police-constable who was with me, and I came to take him into custody, for having in his possession a quantity of housebreaking instruments, and I believed some base coin as well—he said, "I am sure, sir, you will find nothing here"—I told him to get up and dress himself, and desired the officer to take him into custody—I then commenced searching the room, and under the bed, near the head of it, I found this carpet bag—it was then padlocked—this is the padlock(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I showed the bag to the prisoner, and said, "What is this?"—he said, "I know nothing at all about it; it does not belong to me"—I said, "Have you got the key of the bag?"—he said, "No;" and he again said, "I know nothing about it"—I said, "Very well, I shall cut it open, if you do not give me the key"—I cut it open, and pulled out a number of skeleton keys, this packet of sixty half-crowns wrapped in brown paper, and another packet of twenty crown-pieces wrapped in white paper—the prisoner said, "I know nothing at all about them; this is some kind friend"—I told him I should find the key, or I would endeavour to do so—I found a box which was locked—I asked him for the key of it—he gave me five keys—one of them opened the box—in it I found a great number of articles of wearing-apparel, which the prisoner said belonged to him—he said, "It is my box; there is only my clothes in it"—I found in it a glove, with seven skeleton keys in it, a piece of candle, and a ring with two keys on it—I said, "This one looks like the key of the bag"—he again said, "I know nothing about it; it is some kind friend."</p>

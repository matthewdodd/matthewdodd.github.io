                  </hi>. I live in Norfolk-street, Strand—the prisoner was my waiter. On the 23rd of Feb. I went to his house in Lancashire-court, Bond-street, with an officer—I found three books, and afterwards the prisoner in the room—these three books are mine, and one is the property of Mr. Gordon Batten, who lodged with me, but had left.</p>

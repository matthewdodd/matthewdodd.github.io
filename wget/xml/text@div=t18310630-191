On the 16th of May I left home at half-past ten o'clock in the morning, leaving nobody in the house; I fastened all the doors - I bolted the back door, locked the street door, and took the key with me; the kitchen window was shut, but not fastened - it is a sash-window - no part of it was opened; I returned about a quarter to eleven, found the back door open, and the kitchen window also: I missed four half-crowns, five shillings, and a sixpence from my box in the kitchen, which was not locked; I had put the money into it that morning - I also missed two tea-spoons, a mustard-spoon, and a silver watch of master's; the garden door at the back of the house was locked when I went out - on returning I found the beading by the lock broken, and the door open; there is a bridge about three minutes' walk from the garden door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure you did not leave the kitchen window a little open? A. I am confident it was shut quite down.</p>

            . I am a painter. About a quarter to eleven o'clock in the morning of this robbery, I was on the bridge, about fifty yards from the house - I saw the prisoner standing on the bridge with a young lad not quite so tall as himself; they were talking together - I saw the other one take some shavings out of the prisoner's basket, put them into his lap, and go to Mr. Jordan's; I saw him open the front garden iron gate - he went in, and shut the gate after him; he came out, and came back to the prisoner, put the shavings into the basket, and waited on the bridge while the prisoner went in the same way, through the front garden gate; I could not observe what he did inside - he shut the gate when he went in, but left it open when he came out, and returned to the other boy; they went towards Hoxton new church, talking together - I think I have seen the prisoner once or twice before, and am sure it was him; I could not see the kitchen door, nor the back garden gate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not certain that you had seen him before? A. No - I know he was on the bridge; he put his arm through, and undid the gate - that is not the gate that was broken: I saw the prisoner again on the Wednesday - I did not suspect any thing till I heard of the robbery.</p>

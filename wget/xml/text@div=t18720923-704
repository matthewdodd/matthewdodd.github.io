                  </hi>. I am a porter of 2, Great Suffolk Street, Borough—on 10th August I was in Blackman Street with my wife, between 10 and 11 o'clock p.m.—I saw the prisoner come up in a very hasty manner, and I received a blow on the left breast—I staggered, and pursued him some little way—I missed my chain and seals, worth 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but knowing the neighbourhood I did not pursue him further—on the 26th I was called to the station to see nine or eleven men, and picked the prisoner out from them as the man who robbed me—I have no doubt he is the man—I have seen him before about the Mint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not somebody say "Is that him?" when you were in front of me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear it—I did not say that I knew you by your back because you were a man of the same make as myself—my wife has weak sight, and could not identify you.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer M</hi>). On 10th August I received from Priestman a description of the man who robbed him, and on 26th August I saw the prisoner in the Mint—I said "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, I want you for stealing a chain a week or a little move ago, in Blackman Street"—he said "I know-nothing about it"—I said "You will have to accompany me to the station"—I took him there, placed him with nine others, and Priestman picked him out—he was wearing a very low hat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have not you had opportunities to take me if you wanted me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I have not seen you from that time till the Tuesday morning—I did not see you at the Alfred's Head before that, or I should have taken you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>, On this night I was not in the Borough at all, I was playing at skittles at Mr. Weleh's. A young man was with me. I never saw the prosecutor till the day he came to recognise me. He might have seen me time out of time going down different parts of the Borough. As for robbing him, I never did such a thing in my life. I was told in Horsemonger Lane that the man who did rob him is doing some imprison<lb></lb>ment. I am innocent as a child.</p>

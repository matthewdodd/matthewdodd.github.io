             in the entry of the house, calling out for her husband; I do not know that he was in the house- she kept calling out for him some time, then went through the house into the yard, and broke a window; I then heard a scuffle, and went to see what it was - I saw her standing on the step of the door; the prisoner came out - Brown and her got disputing, wrangling, and abusing each other; I think I saw her attempt to strike the prisoner, but I am not certain - I believe she did, and told the Magistrate so; I did not see the prisoner strike her, but I heard her fall in the passage, whether from a blow I cannot say; she was pushed out, got up again, and began talking to the prisoner again, calling her a brute, to have her husband there all night - then the prisoner took her two hands, and shoved her backwards; I do not know where the husband was - the deceased was intoxicated no doubt.</p>

            . I live in this house. I went down, and saw the deceased lying on her left side, near the kennel; the prisoner was standing by her, and when I was going up again, the prisoner beckoned to me, and asked me to let the bed down, for her to lay the deceased on - she was bringing her through the passage, to put her on the bed; I let the bed down - she let go of the deceased, who threw herself across the foot of the bed on her face, and said, "Oh, my my poor head!" I went up again, and heard her say, "Don't beat me any more."</p>

            . I am a dyer. I was coming along Vine-court, and saw Brown lying on the steps - I saw the prisoner push her down the steps into the street; she laid with her head and shoulders in the street, and the prisoner turned her over out of the passage quite into the street - she merely turned her heels round; she appeared intoxicated, and I believe the prisoner was so also - the deceased got up and said, "That brute has had my husband in her house all night:" I said, "Don't murder the woman - let her alone;" she pushed her down on the stones - I said,"Go in and shut the door, if you don't want her in;" the prisoner said, "No, I won't leave her here, I shall go and see her home;" she knocked at the deceased's door several times, while she laid in the street - I then went away.</p>

             I am a surgeon, and live in Spitalfields. I saw the deceased on the 9th of November, about four hours after her death - she had a bruise over her left eye, and a few slight scratches on the face; it appeared to have been done by the nails - she died of a fractured scull; there was a considerable quantity of extravasated blood on the brain - it was certainly caused by a fall; there was a small quantity of fluid in the stomach, which smelt of gin- she appeared to have been a stronger woman than the prisoner, and if sober, able to overcome her.</p>

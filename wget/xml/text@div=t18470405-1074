                  </hi>. I am a chemist, and carry on business in the Blackfrears-road. On the 17th of March I sold the prisoner a pennyworth of pills, he gave me a bad shilling—I found the shilling was bad as he was leaving the shop—I went to the door but could not find him—I wrapped the shilling in a piece of paper, and ultimately gave it to the policeman—I saw the prisoner again on the 27th of March—he came into the shop for a seidlitz-powder, and offered me a bad six pence—I went round the counter, told him it was a bad one, said I should detain him, and that he had given me a bad shilling before—he wanted to get away—I told him I should not allow him to do so—he then offered to compromise it—he offered me a half-crown to take the shilling and the sixpence—I did not consent to that arrangement—the constable came—I gave him the bad money, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

The prisoner came on the 22nd as my servant—on the following Saturday I had a shawl in my shop—I missed it on the 26th out of the wrapper—I afterwards saw it produced—I know it by the pattern and marks—I had had it nearly twelve months—it is soiled in the folds.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I looked into the prisoner's box on the Monday, but could not see the shawl—I looked again on the 30th of April, and found it in a silk handkerchief—it lay on the top of the other things—I asked where she got it—she said she bought the ticket of a woman who had gone to Ireland, and redeemed the shawl for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that she redeemed it at Greygoose's, in Crawford-street—she produced a duplicate of another article which she had pledged—she said she had pledged a small shawl for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to make up the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can swear to the shawl.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> Did I tell you I redeemed it for a woman who was going to Ireland?—I told you I did not know the woman in question, but I bought the ticket of her, and gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to redeem it—I gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the ticket—I was down stairs for a quarter of an hour, went up to my room, and you were at my box—you asked me to leave the house—I said I</p>

In consequence of an information that I received, I went to a public-house nearly opposite Giltspur-street Compter; I called upon Mr. Clark, the City marshalman, to meet me there; I marked a half-crown piece and two shillings on the edge, with two marks on each piece, with a knife; that half-crown that I first marked, and the two shillings, I gave to Comber; I put two marks nigher to each to each other upon that half crown piece that I marked the second time than the former; I gave that half-crown piece to Gill.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these marks such as to enable you to speak to the coins when you saw them again? - A. Yes; I shewed all the marked money to Riley; after that I desired Comber and Gill to go to Cock-court, Snow-hill, according to the information I had received; I gave them the marked money, and desired them to purchase counterfeit money for it if they could; they went out, and we followed them, to see if they would go into Cock-court; we waited outside in the street till we saw them come out of Cock-court; we went one way and they went the other, and we met at this public-house in Giltspur-street again; we went into the parlour, and Comber produced seventeen counterfeit sixpences and five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these? - A. I suppose these may be them, but I did not mark them; they were all bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and see if they are bad? - A. Yes, they are all bad; I desired him to take particular care of them; Mr. Clark came into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080055"></xptr>room according to appointment, and then Clark, Riley, Comber, and I, went instantly to the house in Cock-court; I went up before Clark, and ran up stairs; Clark went in below stairs with the prisoner, Ryan; Mrs. Joice was in bed up stairs; I saw no man in the house at that time; I desired Mrs. Joice instantly to give me her pockets; her pockets were about her in the bed, or under the bolster, for she handed them to me instantly; there was a quantity of silver in a purse in one of her pockets, and a quantity of halfpence loose, and seven guineas and a half, and a seven shilling piece in good gold in a box, as well as I recollect; I tied the pockets very tight, and took them all with me; I took the prisoner into custody, and when I went to the public-house, I examined the silver to see if the marked money had been in the pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the silver in the purse? - A Yes; I saw the shilings and the half-crown that I gave to Comber to purchase, and also the half crown that I gave to the other person,

               <p>Q. Did you hear any rattling down stairs, or any thing of that kind? - A. I cannot positively swear; I was in a hurry searching the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those picked up by Comber on the stairs? - Do you believe them to be counterfeit? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You did not find any bad money? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. The money you found in this poor woman's pocket was all good? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not observe this bad money tumbling from the ceiling? - A. No, I was searching the room and the cupboards at the time.</p>
               <p>- RILEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. On Sunday, the 28th of April, I went, in company with Rogers, Clark, and Comber; Rogers and Comber went up stairs in this house in Cock-court; Clark and I staid below; I assisted Clark in searching the prisoner, Ryan; she was very loth to be searched; I held her hands, while Clark searched her; after Clark had done searching her, I heard something like the rattling of money upon the landing-place of the stairs; Comber was out of the front room upon the landing-place before I got to the top of the stairs; he was then picking up a quantity of pieces resembling money; he gave me fourteen pieces resembling sixpences, and three pieces resembling shillings. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Rogers. These are are all bad.</p>
               <p>Riley. I saw Clark take something from Ryan, but I did not see what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any money that Rogers marked? - A. Yes; two half-crowns, and two shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Where were you when you say you heard the rattling of money, were you in the room, or out of the room? - A. In the room, with Clark.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut? - A. The door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Comber at that time? - A. Up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently you could not see him? - A. I saw him pick up the money after I came out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, for any thing you know, that money might have been thrown there by Comber himself; and he picked them up when you came out? - A. I cannot say any thing to that.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a City-marshalman: I went with the other witnesses on Sunday the 28th of April, to this house in Cock-court; I went into a room below, with Riley, where Mrs. Ryan was, and another woman; I endeavoured to search Ryan, but she very much refused it, she was very unwilling to be searched; I first of all searched her right-hand pocket, where I found one good shilling, and some halfpence; in her left-hand pocket, in this paper, I found seven bad shillings, and forty-three bad sixpences. (Produces them.)</p>
               <p>Rogers. They are all bad.</p>
               <p>Ryan's defence. It is the first offence, and it was out of distress that it was so with me; as to the money in Mrs. Joice's pocket, that was money that I gave her; I hope you will look into my distress.</p>
               <p>Joice's defence. The other woman lodged with me, and she gave me the money in payment for rent. Ryan, <rs id="t17990508-30-verdict182" type="verdictDescription">

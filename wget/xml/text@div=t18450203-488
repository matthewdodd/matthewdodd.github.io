                  </hi>. I am an articled clerk to an architect. On the 9th of Jan. I was walking through the Exchange—I felt a tug at my pocket—I felt, and my handkerchief was gone—I saw the prisoner a little way be<lb></lb>hind me, and a lad walking by the side of him—I said to the lad, "You have got my handkerchief"—the prisoner ran off—I pursued down a lane leading to Lombard-street—I there saw the policeman had got hold of him—I got my handkerchief from Jackson—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw the prisoner run from the prosecutor—I ran down Pope's-head-alley—I did not see him rightly throw the handker<lb></lb>chief away, as there were three or four persons passing, but it came from that direction where he was—the other persons were running—they were going to the Post-office across the road—I picked the handkerchief up on the wooden pavement.</p>

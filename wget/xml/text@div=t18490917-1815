                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM VOWLES</hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 275). On Sunday night, 19tb Aug., I was on duty near the Bald Faced Stag, at Chigwell—in consequence of something Mr. Macnamara had told me, I observed a bag of chaff and oats near a small gate—I then went to Stammers' cottage, and while there, Stammers came up with the bag under his arm—I asked where he got it from—he said, "From the Bald-Faced Stag"—I asked who gave it him—he said, <hi rend="italic">" Tom</hi> Finch, the ostler"—it was about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock—Corley was with him—I believe he lodges with him.</p>

I was at the station-house at about a quarter to twelve o'clock, when Vowles brought Stammers in—I then saw Corley near the station, and asked him what he was doing there—he said he came to say he gave the corn to Stammers—I asked him who authorized him to do so—he said the foreman to Mr. Macnamara—I took him into custody.</p>

I live at Woodford, and am foreman to Messrs.

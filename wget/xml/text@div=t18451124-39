                  </hi>. I am as later, and live at No, 27, Dorset-street, Newington causeway. On Sunday night, the 9th of Nov., I was returning home through Bath-street, City-road, about a quarter to ten, and met the prisoner coming towards me—I was on the pavement, and so was he—we ran up against each other—I asked him if there was not room enough for him to pass—he made use of some word, I forget what at present, and I shoved</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184511240059"></xptr>
               <p>him into the road and passed on—he followed me about 200 yards, and chal<lb></lb>lenged me to fight—I accepted the challenge—we squared up to each other—I hit him two or three times, and he hit me on the breast—I then went away from him down New-street, 400 or 500 yards—I saw him coming after me—he was singing out" Police," and said he would follow me wherever I went—I asked him what he was following me for—I said he should not follow me, and I went back to him again—I saw him take something out of his pocket, which seemed to me to be a knife—I went up to him, and he said if I came near him I should have the contents of this—I wm going to strike him, and he was going to strike; seeing the blow coming, I put up my hand, and received a cut on my left hand—it bled—there were a good many people there—I did not see what became of the knife—the police came up, and he then said he wanted to give me in charge for bitting him—the police took him in charge—I went to the hospital, and was attended by Mr. Remnant.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Bath-street, and I saw the prosecutor and prisoner—I saw the prosecutor strike the prisoner—I did not see the prisoner return the blow—the prosecutor struck him again, and then knocked his hat off—the prosecutor then walked on, and the prisoner followed him, and said he would follow him wherever he went—they went some distance, and the pro<lb></lb>secutor struck him again—the prisoner said, if he did not keep back he would give him the contents of this—I saw a knife in his hand—he struck the prosecutor with it on his hand, and then chucked it away—it was a pen<lb></lb>knife, I think—the point was down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It was a small knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the prisoner called out "Police" after the prosecutor struck him—when he turned back on the prisoner, the prisoner stepped back, and the prosecutor followed him.</p>

               <p>at Rotherhithe—the prisoner and her husband lived in the same house—they had three children; the deceased was the youngest, and was two months old—it died last Sunday week—I first saw it that day between 11 and 12 o'clock; he was then in his mother's arms in the passage—the prisoner bad been taking a little, but was not to say intoxicated—the child was then in perfect health—I saw it again in his mother's arms in the street at half past 2 o'clock, with beer thrown over her, and she said her husband had thrown a pint of beer over her—there was nothing the matter with the child then—I saw it no more till about a quarter to 8 o'clock in the evening—I then saw the prisoner in the street screaming violently, and saying that her child was dead—she had the child in her arms; it was apparently dead—I tried to stop her, but her mother came and took it out of her arms—she was a little in liquor, but nothing to speak of—I do not consider that she was at all unable to take care of herself or her child—I do not think she was more intoxicated then than she was in the early part of the day, she was pretty much the same—I did not see her take anything—she is at times given to drink—she will go weeks without sometimes, and then she will take it for two or three days together—I saw her without the child in the afternoon; I think it was then in bed, and she went up to bed to it—I did not see her from half past 2 o'clock in the afternoon till a quarter to 6 o'clock, and she said she had been lying down, and had left the child in bed, and at a quarter to 8 o'clock it was dead—on the Monday she told me that she went up stairs to look at her baby at a quarter to 8 o'clock on the Sunday, and found it lying with its tongue working in its mouth; that she tried to suckle it, but it would not suck, and she lifted it up and thought it was in a fit.</p>

On Sunday, 24th June, I heard of the child's death, and went with the prisoner's husband to the house of the prisoner's mother, in Rotherhithe-street, where it was then lying; it was dead—the prisoner was very much the worse for liquor—she appeared to be recovering from a worse state of drink, from the shock caused by the child's death—I asked her if she could account for the death of the child; she said that she went up to bed in the afternoon, and laid down with the child; that she came down again to get her husband his tea, and went up again, she believed, in consequence of the child's crying, and the child was putting its tongue out of its mouth—I asked her if she was aware of any marks upon the child's person; she said no, she was not; she did* not know anything at all about it—I then showed her the child's side, where Mr. Simpson, the surgeon, had shown it to me; there was a very large black mark on its right side, seven or eight inches broad, covering the whole of the right side from the hip to the armpit—she said she did not know anything at all about it—I have seen the prisoner very often; she drinks very much at times—she could not stand well on this night from drunkenness.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon in Coburg place, Rotherhithe. On Sunday evening, 24th June, I was called to go to the prisoners mothers house, with Sergeant Roberts, about half past 8 o'clock—I saw the child; it had then been dead, I should say, three or four hours—from what I heard, I should fancy it died from suffocation—I found no blood on its person there was a mark completely round the loins; that was caused by pressure</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020071"></xptr>
               <p>—it might have been caused by overlaying the child—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and was of opinion that Heath was caused by suffocation; not by the hands of a person, but by overpaying—the bruise on the loins was not connected with the cause of death; alight pressure might cause that in so young a child—I saw the prisoner at the house; she was intoxicated, and I should say not capable of taking care of the child.</p>

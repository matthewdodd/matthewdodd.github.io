On the 16th of May, I was up stairs; my servant came and said a man had been up, and stole a piece of kerseymere-my shop is up one pair of stairs, the entrance is in Birchin-lane-it is part of the dwelling-house, I live there. I came down to the shop and found the prisoner there in custody; he begged of me to let him go - I gave him in charge. The door in Birchin-lane was open-it is the same house, and is my dwelling-house.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Spooner. I was sitting in the shop, while the apprentice was up stairs at breakfast-it was about half-past nine o'clock. I stood in a part of the shop which is not in sight of the door. I heard a noise in the shop, turned round, and saw the prisoner going down stairs with a piece of kerseymere under his arm. I immediately went after him, and caught him before he got to the bottom, held him there, and called for assistance, which came. We took him into the shop - He dropped the kerseymere on the stairs; it was under his arm when I laid hold of him.</p>

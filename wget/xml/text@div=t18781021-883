On 7th October I was with Detective Tansey in Queen Victoria Street—I saw the prisoners and a woman who has since absconded, together—Barratt was carrying a baby—I saw them go into the Barnard Castle, in Queen Victoria Street—they remained there about three quarters of an hour—when they came out they turned to the right and then to the left—Barratt gave the child to the woman who is not here, and they walked along Queen Victoria Street and went into No. 77, a baby linen warehouse—they came out after a short time and walked to the bottom of Friday Street—Ryan there left the other two women—she went up Friday Street, and waited outside Mr. Crute's warehouse—a few minutes afterwards Barratt and McCull came and joined Ryan at Crute's place—I saw them speaking together—the prisoners went into the warehouse and remained about twenty minutes—they then all three walked up Friday Street talking to one another—I followed them into Cheapside—they walked along to the west end of Cheapside, and stopped in front of a shop—they all three looked in, as if looking at the silk in the window—McColl stooped down and took this cloak from under her clothes, put it under her arm, under her cape, and then all three walked off—while she was doing this one woman was close on each side of her, covering her as well as they could, and in a position to see what she was doing—they went a few yards, and I stopped them—they were together when I spoke—Barratt turned back in a moment—she did not hear what I said at first—when she was stopped by Tansey, and they were both together again, I said I should charge them with stealing it from Mr. Crute's warehouse—Barratt said I had made a mistake.</p>

On the afternoon of 11th October the prisoners came into our warehouse—Barratt asked me for a child's jacket—I said I hadn't any, and sent her on to the next department—I saw them go upstairs—in a few minutes I saw them come down again; they passed through and went out together—the cloak produced is Mr. Crute's property—I saw it safe ten minutes before they went out, on the handrail of the stairs, with the ticket "special order" on it</p>

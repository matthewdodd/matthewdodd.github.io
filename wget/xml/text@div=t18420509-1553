                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Nock. I am now living at his father's house in Church-street, Kennington—I have four children—I remember some months ago, my husband handed over the lease of the house to his father—it was previous to his making the assignment of the furniture—he was not able to pay the rent of the house, and I have been obliged to let lodgings—there is not the slightest ground for imputing any impropriety, or undue familiarity between me and the prisoner—on my oath—I am on intimate terms with his wife—I am the person who gave directions for the removal of the furniture—he had no interest whatever in any one portion of the furniture, or its removal—he removed it by Mr. Nock's father's sanction—because I could not reside any longer with my husband—it is the second time I have left him from his ill treatment.</p>

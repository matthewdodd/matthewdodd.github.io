On Thursday she came to me and desired me to get it again, she said it was not their own, and they were in a hobble; she said three of them got it from a house in Knightsbridge; I got it out for them and delivered it to Johnson, and she gave it to Soames.</p>

               <p>Johnson's Defence. These young women and me were coming down. Piccadilly; we met the prosecutor and three other men; they stopped us and took us into the Running Horse, Piccadilly, they gave us a great deal of liquor; as we came out of the house they asked us to go with them, they offered us too little money; they said why should they treat such as us and have nothing in return; they knocked this woman down and used us ill. We found this bundle in the street, and we pledged them. The prosecutor came down to us, he asked us if we had such a thing; we said we had pledged them; we were short of money, and we had laid the money out. He took us in custody, because we could not take them out again.</p>
               <p>Miller and Soames' Defence - the same.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is this true, that there was a quarrel between you and one of them was knocked down. A. No, they left me in the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the parcel when they went out. - A. I did not take any notice of it when they went out.</p>
               <p>Q. What state was you in. - A. I had been drinking. I was not tipsey, it was late, I was sleepy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet them in the street before you went into this public house. - A. Yes. A person that was with me, he knew one of them, he asked them to go with him; we all went in near at one time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain of this, that they went out of the public house before you. - A. Yes, I did not see them afterwards that night.</p>

               <p>I went into a public-house, called the Bleeding-heart, on the 1st of May, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, in <placeName id="t17960511-40-crimeloc213">Parker's-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. What business had you that day in Parker's-lane? - A. I had no particular business there.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to this public-house without any business? - A. Yes; with intent to have a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have related all that passed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. I am positive of it.</p>

               <p> I am an officer; I took the prisoner up; I did dot find the watch at all.</p>
               <p>Court. (To the Prosecutor). Q. How long might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179605110106"></xptr>you be with the prisoner at the bar? - A. She was out of doors from the public-house several times.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you with her in her room? - A. About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the first of May, I was standing between twelve and one in the forenoon, at the sign of the Bleeding-heart door, that gentleman came down along with a young woman, and seemed very much in liquor, and said, he was going to have a drop of beer with the young woman, and if I had a mind to have any I should be very welcome; he called for a pot of half and half, that was drank, and he missed his pocket handkerchief; he said, he had been at the Yorkshire Stingo, and he did not doubt but he had lost it there; he asked me to go with him to my room, and he offered me sixpence to have connections with me; I asked him if he was not ashamed of himself, a man of his appearance, to offer me such a trifle, and told him to go along down stairs; he had three guineas in his pocket; I wish him to be asked if he had not, and I might as well have taken his money as his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any money? - A. Yes; 3s. 5d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He went again to the same public-house, and enlisted for a soldier, which he would not have done, if he had not been in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not lose your watch at that house before you went to the girl's house? - A. I am sure I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. You, being a married man, ought to have been ashamed to have been in such a house; there is great room for repentance. - A. There is, my Lord, and I am very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you or not in liquor? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, the story is disgraceful; and, if you are satisfied, I am.</p>

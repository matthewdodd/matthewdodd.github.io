               <p>Q. How came they to let him go again. - A. Mr. Nalder can explain it all to you; I took them home on the Saturday to my house, and on Wednesday morning I took them to Rumford.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Did not I tell you that I was sent there by my master, and that I must not sell them before seven o'clock. - A. You said you expected your master there at seven o'clock, and if he did not come there you was to sell them.</p>

             sworn. I am a salesman in Smithfield-market; after this young man bought these cattle, he came and asked me whether he was to pay the money for them or not; I told him not to pay for them by no means, because they were worth more money than he asked for them by three or four pound, I told him to apply to an officer, he applied to Mr. Nalder; I told Mr. Nalder the best way would be to lock the heifers up, and the man too; I have seen the heifers since, and they are the same that Mr. Strong bought.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that them heifers that you saw since, are the same heifers that this man bought of the prisoner. - A. I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

             sworn. Q. You are a city marshall. - A. I am; on Monday the 31st of March, about nine o'clock, I went into Smithfield, I had been in the market but a few minutes, I was applied to by two or three people, saying, that there was a man in the market who had offered these two beasts to sell, and that they had no doubt but he had stole them; I went up to the prisoner, and asked him how he came in possession of these heifers; his answer was they were the property of Smith, who lived between Leicester and Northampton and as Northampton fair was on Tuesday he had sent him on with them to Smithfield-market; he was to sell them for twelve pound, or as near twelve pound as he could get, his master was going back to Northampton; he said that on Sunday morning, he met his master at Whetstone, who had about a score of the same cattle, and had sold all but them two. I then asked him what his master was, he told me that he was a jobber in cattle; I immediately told him that his master, as a jobber in cattle, knew better where to sell them than Smithfield-market, they being lean, I suppose one would calve in about three weeks; he gave no answer to that, but he had obeyed his master's orders; I told him I was so far dissatisfied with the account thas he gave me, that I should certainly take him into custody; I took him into custody, and secured the cattle, he was examined at Guildhall; I took him in custody, and he remained in custody till the Saturday, he was then liberated by the order of alderman Boydell, he pleaded poverty, and out of the money I received for the cattle, I was ordered to give him fifteen shillings, to convey him back to Northampton; on the Thursday following the prosecutor waited on me, hearing that I had the man in custody the week before, I gave him then an account of the man; I received information that he was seen working in the brick-field, at the lower part of Hoxton; I went to the lower part of Hoxton, and there I met with him; he has since had an opportunity of writing to his master, and they have wrote to Northampton, by the order of Mr. Kirby, and no man has come forward; I took him last Friday, this very day week, in the brick-field; the heifers were delivered by the alderman to

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My master is a man that deals in cattle in general, of different kinds, some good and some indifferent; I met him at Whetstone, he ordered me to go on with him, when we got partly out of the Heath, he says, I am a good mind to go to Northampton, you go to Smithfield, and if I am not there by seven o'clock, you sell them; so I came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160031"></xptr>on, and put them in the pound, I asked one of the drovers to bring them down and tie them up; that gentleman asked me the price first, I told him I was not to sell them till seven o'clock, if my master is not here at seven o'clock I may sell them at the price he told me; I stood by the beasts till eleven or twelve o'clock to take care of my master's property; if I had known it was wrong, I had plenty of opportunity of escaping.</p>
               <p>Q. If you lived with a jobber that comes to town, when you was discharged why did not you go down to him instead of going to work in the brick field. - A. I wished to be here, as I expected him coming up; it was my intention to be near in town, if in case my master come he would come forward, so I got work in the brick field.</p>

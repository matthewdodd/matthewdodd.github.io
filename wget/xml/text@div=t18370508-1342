Eliza Hocher came to me about a six pence—she put it on the counter—I took it up myself—I bit one half in two again, and then put them on the shelf, where the casks were standing—when I came in and saw the prisoner I recollected her as passing a bad shilling at my house, and I then watched her to another, and she swallowed two shillings at that time—I told her of it—she seemed confused, and said she was not the person—Ayres, who was there, followed her by my desire.</p>

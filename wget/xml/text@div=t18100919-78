On the 13th of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner, with another man, came into my shop, the prisoner brought in a new pair of trowsers and tried them on, they were not mine. I asked him the reason of his coming into my shop to try on trowsers, why did not they try them where they purchased them, and not to take up our time; seeing me offended, he seemed to make an offer to sell his other trowsers; I told him, I did not want to buy any thing, to make haste out of the shop. I then ordered the lad to go on with his work, in getting the goods out of the door, I was assisting; I then got outside of the shop, when I perceived the goods, which hanged on the top rail of the window, pulled over off the rail, altogether. I ran into the shop, and said, was it not sufficient for you to come in and take up our time, without robbing us, come make haste, get out of the house, not knowing at that time, that he had got any of my property with them, we shoved them out. When they had got out into the pavement, my youth observed he had a pair of velveteen breeches under his coat; I looked, and saw a deficiency of a pair of velveteen breeches; I followed him, and found him in Mr. Baron's shop, he put the breeches on in their shop, under the trowsers, I pulled the trowsers up and saw they were my breeches, he has torn the mark off, I knew them to be mine. He was taken to Lambeth-street office and searched, the handkerchief was found upon him, I saw it taken out of his side pocket, I am positive it is my handkerchief. When I charged him with stealing the breeches, the prisoner said I pushed him out of the shop with the breeches; when I pushed him out, I did not know he had these breeches.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see this man and his companion come into the shop - A. I did, they bought nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go out of the shop of their own accord - A. No, they were shoved out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them while they were in the shop take and thing - A. No; as they were going out of the shop, I saw a pair of velveteen breeches on the prisoner's arm, part inside of his jacket, and part out; I informed my master, he examined his stock and missed a pair. We pursued the prisoner. I know the breeches to be my master's property, and the handkerchief likewise.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I was shoved out of doors I had no small clothes on, and when they brought my clothes out of doors, they brought them breeches with them. I was in liquor the night before, I did not know where I was.</p>

                  </hi>. I was lodging at the Cock, New-street, Bishopsgate, on 7th Oct. I came up with the prisoner from Newcastle—on Tyne to see the Exhibition—I knew him very well, we came up together as friends—we went to the Punch coffee-house early in the afternoon—I bad a carpet-bag and a basket with me, containing wearing-apparel and books, and six sove<lb></lb>reigns and six half-sovereigns—the prisoner said I might as well leave my things there, and when the servant Connolly brought the coffee, the prisoner said, "Will you take care of these things? we shall be here and call for them again presently"—she took them away—I and the prisoner then went to different places, and we went to near Astley's Theatre to inquire for a friend of mine—I went into a shop to inquire, leaving the prisoner waiting outside, and when I came hack he was gone—I inquired for my things at the Punch coffee-house about 9 o'clock the same evening, and they were gone—I have not seen them since—the prisoner had more hair on his chin then than now.</p>

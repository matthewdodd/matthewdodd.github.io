               <p>Q.What opportunity had you of seeing the prisoner? - A. I knew his voice by his speaking when he got into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of night was it? - A. A moonlight night, the moon had been up some time.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect him by his features? - A. I knew him nearly four years; I have no doubt about his person, he was a private soldier in the artillery, at Woolwhich, and he and I were fellowprisoners together in the King's-bench, nine months, when he lived with a Mr. Bentley, in prison.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you talk to him as if you had known him? - A.No, or he to me, I don't think he had any knowledge of me, I saw him the Monday fortnight following, at Bow-street, when I swore to him.</p>
               <p> - EASTWOOD Sworn. - I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street, and met the prisoner in the King's private road, this side of Sloane-square, on the 20th of March, about a quarter past ten, at night; I stopped him on suspicion, and found on his person a pistol, loaded with broken glass and powder; he would not give any account of himself.</p>

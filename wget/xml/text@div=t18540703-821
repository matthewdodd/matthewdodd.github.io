                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, D</hi> 28). On Sunday, 18th June, I was on duty in the Harrow-road, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the morning, and saw the prisoners—Williams had a bag on his shoulder, and Humphries had something under his left arm—I called sergeant Warren, and we went after them; they were going towards London—we stopped them in Old Church-street, 200 or 300 yards from where I first saw them—they had seen me before, because I was standing at the post at the corner of Hermitage-street—I asked Williams what he had in the bag—he said, "It is my own, I bought it and paid for it at Harrow"—he said, "I have got two loaves, a dish, a pair of old shoes, and a shirt; you can look at them"—I told him I doubted about his buying them, and he must go to the station with me and tell the inspector—he said, "I am b—d if I do, you shall carry me first"—I took hold of him, he resisted, and we both fell together; on Paddington-green we had another fall—I eventually got him to the station, searched him, and found a female's nightgown over his shirt, and a coat and waistcoat underneath the coat and waistcoat he has on now—also a brass watch chain, a purse containing 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he had on a pair of Wellington boots—I after<lb></lb>wards examined the premises of Mr. Smith, No. 7, Kilburn-terrace—I found marks on the soft mould in the next garden which had been done over on the previous night—these two odd shoes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I found in the bag, corresponded with the footmarks—I compared them first by putting them into the marks, and then made a mark by the side.</p>

I was called by the last witness, and pursued the prisoners—we came up with them—Jenkins took Williams; I seized Humphries by his cap, he left it in my hand and ran away—I never lost sight of him—he was stopped by another constable, carrying this teapot under his arm, in a handkerchief—I said, "What made you run away?"—he said, "Because I did not want to be taken to the station; the teapot belongs to my sister"—I took him to the station, and found he had on these two shirts of Mr. Reed's over his own shirt, this shirt stud in his jacket pocket, and these women's boots, one in each jacket pocket, a silk handker<lb></lb>chief on his neck and another in his pocket—one of them was given up to him at the police court, a blue one; this is the other (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he also had 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a knife, and a common latch key, which I have tried to the door and it does not fit—he said at the station that they were living at Harrow, and we should not find out where, and if we did, that they had <hi rend="italic">sloped</hi> the lodging, and the old <hi rend="italic">bloke</hi> would not prosecute—I afterwards went to Mr. Reed's, No. 7, Kilburn-terrace—I examined the kitchen window; the fastening was broken, and hanging down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Southall. On Saturday, the 9th of Nov., I was employed to drive a flock of sheep belonging to Mr. Coleman, to Smith field—as we went along one of the sheep fell lame, and I left it on the road-side at Acton—I spoke to James Tiller about it</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police constable T</hi> 119.) On Monday morning, the 10th of Nov., about a quarter to one o'clock, I was on duty at Acton—Hopgood spoke to me, and gave a sheep into my charge to send on in a wagon which I was coming up—I left it lying by the road-side while I went round my beat—when I came back in half an hour it was gone—the wagon had not come up—I looked into a field, and walked a short distance down—I looked over the hedge, and there saw the prisoner and two other men in the act of killing the sheep—as soon as they saw me they all ran away—I followed, and took the prisoner into custody 200 yards off, in a field of broccoli—he said when I took him, "You think you have got a pull"—I did not know what that meant—with the assistance of another constable I conveyed him to the station, with the sheep—I produce the skin of the sheep, also the prisoner's waistcoat, stained with blood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dealer in cattle, and live in Buckinghamshire. I sent a flock of sheep to Mr. Weedon, who sent them by Hopgood to Smithfield-market—when they arrived there one was short—I saw the skin produced by Tiller next day, and can swear it was the skin of my sheep—I bought eleven, which I marked myself—one was a brown faced one, and this was the very sheep.</p>

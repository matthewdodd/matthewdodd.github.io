               <p>Jelfe Lamb. On the 29th of March, I had been to a relation's house to supper, when I came home our people were gone to bed, I went to return to where I had been, and had not gone twenty yards from our door, when the prisoner met me, she asked me where I was going? I said, home, she said, go with me; I said, where? she led me through several Alleys, till she came to a house in <placeName id="t17520408-59-crimeloc305">Stony-lane, near Petticoat-lane</placeName>

               <p>Barlow Sayer. Mr. Lamb came and told me he had lost his watch, and desired I would go and search for it: we met the prisoner in Leadenhall-street, he said that was the woman, so I secured her : when we were coming along Lombard-street, in order to bring her to the Compter, she told us, if we would desist, she would tell us where the watch was; we got her into the Compter, the next day going before the sitting Alderman, she told me, if I would be favourable, she would send a gentleman to me the next day, and Mr. Lamb should have the watch, (she did not say she had taken it.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The gentleman came to me yesterday morning, he told me if I would be easy with her on her trial, she would give me a note that I should have my watch again: his name is

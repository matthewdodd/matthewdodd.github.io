            . I am a saw maker, and live in Golden-lane. I was not at seven o'clock that morning, and saw the prisoner running down the lane, and the prosecutrix after him, she called, stop him - I went up and saw him strike her and knock her down; she asked him for her handkerchief, he swore he had no handkerchief, and knocked her down again, and walked away, leaving her on the pavement; the policeman came up and was going to take her; the prisoner stood swearing that he had not got the handkerchief, and the prosecutrix crossed over to him, took hold of his breast, and said he had the handkerchief there, but he had not - I saw this handkerchief half way out of his pocket; I told the policeman of it, who put his hand and drew it out - the prosecutrix said it was her's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Don't you think any one else could have seen this yellow handkerchief as well as you? A. Yes, the prisoner was not sober - I cannot say he was drunk, but he was not sober; he knew what he was about, and so did the prosecutrix - she did not see the handkerchief, but she had been knocked about in that cruel manner which makes a deal of difference - the prisoner was hiding the handkerchief - I have heard the prosecutrix swear it was nine o'clock in the morning, and then she had been an hour in the wine-vaults, but it was seven.</p>

             (police-constable G 23). I came up and saw a mob, and the prosecutrix told me the prisoner had robbed her of her handkerchief; I asked if she meant to give him in charge; she kept pulling at him to give it her - I endeavoured to disperse the people; I saw the prisoner with his back against the shutter, endeavouring to get rid of the handkerchief at the back of his pocket - I asked the prosecutrix what colour her handkerchief was; she said, a yellow one torn at two corners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the last witness there? A. Yes, he came up just afterwards - whether he was there when the prosecutrix said this, I don't know - she told me three or four times that it was a yellow handkerchief - I had never seen her before - it was between seven and eight in the morning - she had her cap on when I saw her, and to black eye.</p>

             (police-serjeant G 8). I was at the station-house when the charge was brought in; I know the prosecutrix well, and have known her for some time - the prisoner denied all knowledge of the handkerchief - I asked the prosecutrix to state what charge she had against him, which she did; he then said somebody must have put it into his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to say that after the handkerchief had been taken from him by the last witness, that he said, he knew nothing of it? A. Yes, he said at first he knew nothing of the handkerchief; but after hearing what the prosecutrix said, he turned round and said, somebody must have put it into his pocket - the prosecutrix sells apples about the street - I was at Worship-street when she was brought up and committed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not guilty of taking it, she gave it me, and a bunch of flowers, and her cap - she gave me another handkerchief, an old red one, but the officer told her to stick to one handkerchief, and she would overthrow me - she confessed that she put this handkerchief into my pocket when I was tipsy.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 199). On Thursday, 13th March, about 11 o'clock, a.m., I was on duty opposite the Finsbury Park Tavern, and saw two lads standing on the near side of the Metropolitan tramway, that is, on a siding—they were apparently talking, and were about thirty yards from the Blackstock Hotel—their backs were to approaching cars—I saw a oar approaching, it was close to them, not more than a yard from them at the time I halloaed out; they hardly had time to hear me before the near-side horse knocked the deceased down—the other boy got clear—the oar was going at about five or six miles an hour—they come in very sharp—I saw the boy under the horses' feet, and ran over at once and looked for the driver—he was about half-way between the horses and the oar, looking in this, direction, looking away from the horses—I think he was putting down his whip on the car, his left hand was to the reins and his right was coming from the car—he might have seen the boys forty or fifty yards up the road, but I do not think he did—this was about ten yards from the place where he would stop; some of them go a little further on the siding and some stop short—I pulled the boy out and heard him shouting "Oh, my poor leg"—he was taken to the Great Northern Hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see the oar till it was within a yard of the boy—it went on four or five yards after striking the boy, not more—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187304070026"></xptr>
               <p>only opportunity I had of judging of the pace was while it went six yards—the shunting is a single line of rail—another tram oar was on the siding some distance further on—the other boy had got about two yards from the line before the deceased was struck; he moved in front of the horses, and I had no difficulty in seeing him—on wet mornings you cannot hear the trams, you can only hear the horses—this was not a wet morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The break was on when I pulled the boy out—the other car was thirty yards or more ahead—I never measured it, but I am sure there was a car in front, on the siding.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this a crowded place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not on week days—it is close to the entrance of Finsbury Park—the handle of the break is close to the coachman's right hand—I do not know whether the other break is used by the conductor, it is used when the horses are yoked to the other end—I took the number of the prisoner's badge, and his name and address, and called a doctor at once—the prisoner's whip was lying on the irons on top of the oar—he had nothing in his right hand—the road was rather on the incline the way he was driving—one or two conductors were on the other side of the way—I did not hear the prisoner shout or do anything.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 11, Clifton Terrace, Stroud Green Lane—I saw the two boys standing together on the siding, and saw the tram<lb></lb>car coming up at some distance, but I did not think the boys were on the siding—I saw the passengers get out after the boy was run over—I am sure of that—this boy's name was Cray—I was about thirty or forty yards from the boys, at the corner of Blackstock Hotel—I did not see the prisoner there till he shouted to the boy—I heard no shouting before that, but several persons shouted afterwards; I did myself—the front wheel went over the boy and the other wheel slid him along some distance—I do not think the driver could see him: he was in the attitude of putting his whip down, I thought, and was holding the reins in his left hand—I do not suppose he knew that he was knocking down a boy—the siding is eighty or ninety yards long from where it leaves the main road to where they go out at the other end—they stop in general at Finsbury Park Tavern before they get to the horse-trough—the car had not got to the place where they stop when it knocked the boy down—(<hi rend="italic">The witness pointed out on a plan the spot at which the boy was blocked down</hi>)—he was seven or eight yards before you get to Finsbury Park Tavern door—I saw a car ahead between the front of the door and the horse-trough, the front of it might be <hi rend="italic">agin</hi> the horse-trough—the car was going five or six miles an hour, more or less, when the accident happened—the break was in front of him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was another car further on before you get to the horse trough, and he would have to slacken or he must have run into it—I thought the boy was beyond the metal—I was very much frightened—I have seen the drivers put the whip on the rails.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, of 37, Queensbury Road, Essex Road—I was near the lamp opposite the Blackstock public-house and saw two lads standing on the metals of the tramway, some minutes before the car came up—I was waiting for a gentleman to come by the car, and was talk<lb></lb>ing to the last witness—I first saw the oar fifty or sixty yards before it came to where the accident was, and before it got to the tavern—I saw it approaching the boys, but I did not think they would stop in the way, in fact, I could hardly tell whether they were on the metals or not, it is a sixty or seventy foot road—they were about twenty yards from me—I saw the near side horse knock the boy down, and saw the horse attempting to kick—the horse went, on with the car—the driver was looking back towards the inside of the car, because the passengers had not got out—he was either looking back or putting something back, his head was away from his horses, he does not sit, he stands—you may enter the oar from both ends—I don't think he saw the boy at all till he was knocked down—I saw him apply the break after the boy was run over, and that caused the boy to be skidded along some few yards before he was extricated—I decidedly saw the acci<lb></lb>dent before the driver himself saw it—the break seems to stop the whole four wheels at once, as if it was connected from one end of the carriage to the other—the near side lore-wheel ran over the boy—there was some call<lb></lb>ing out to the boy from both sides, but not before he was hit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am quite certain the break was not full on before the boy was reached, because if it had been the wheel would never have passed over him, from what I can see of the construction of the thing—I know it was not applied' before, because I saw him turn round and put it on after the boy was down—I did not see whether it was his whip or what it was he was putting down, or whether his attention was called into the oar—I did not halloa out—the other boy was about two yards from him, he just stepped out of the way to save himself—the trams have bells, and I could not <hi rend="italic">be off</hi> hearing this one coming.</p>

I live at 1, Campbell Road, Seven Sisters' Road—I was with Cray on the tramway—I was not between the metals, but he was—his back was towards the trams coming from London, and he was looking towards the Manor House and the tea gardens—my back was towards him, and I was looking across the road—I was not talking to him at the time, but I had been about three minutes before—I saw the car coming along as it was shunted—I saw that he was in danger when it was coming into the siding, and I called to him twice—I was then about three yards from him—he did not hear me—I don't know whether he was deaf—I say that he did not hear because he did not move—he was between the two metals then, and I saw the pole hit him on his back, and then saw him lying under the wheels—I did not see the wheel go over him—I went round to the other side; I was not on the Finsbury Park Tavern side; I was between the siding and the main tramway, just where they run into one another, going in the direction of the Blackstock Hotel—I was frightened, and went away.</p>

I am house-surgeon at the Great Northern Hospital—the deceased was brought in on the 13th, suffering from compound fracture of the right thigh bone, with great injury to the soft parts, the muscles, and so on—I found a very great wound, a crushing of the whole of the muscles of the thigh, which had caused blood to flow, and there was a wound behind the left knee; he was also suffering from the shock—I attribute death to the shock supervening on the injuries.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Siney; I was the last up in the house the night of the robbery; it was this day week, in the morning; I saw every part of the house, all the doors and windows fastened up; I went to bed about twelve o'clock; I came down about eight o'clock in the morning; there are two staples to the door, and both of them were wrenched off, and then they must have jumped over the counter to get into the bar; I missed four tea-spoons, a silver table-spoon, a quantity of halfpence and penny-pieces, a quarter of a pound of tea, and some rhubarb; I believe I had seen Brown at our house the beginning of the spring, but not lately.</p>
               <p>JOHN DENNIS sworn. - I am a patrol: This day week in the morning, I saw the two prisoners at the bar walking together, about half past two o'clock; as soon as I came up to Brown, Sadler crossed the way from him; I laid hold of Brown, and asked him what he had got in his hand; he made me no answer; I told the prisoner Sadler to follow him, he did so; then I took them both to the watch-house in Giltspur-street, and searched, and inside his shirt I found four tea-spoons and a table-spoon, and in his pocket I found a metal salt-cellar, a piece of rhubarb, and a parcel of tea; I asked him where he got them; he said he found them in the ruins in Jewin-street, in a bundle; I asked him why he concealed the spoons; he said, because they should not make a noise in his pocket; I asked him if Sadler was with him when he found them, and he said he was; Sadler denied being in company with him: I have kept the things ever since.</p>

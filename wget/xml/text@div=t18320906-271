             (Police-constable K 177). On the morning of the 9th of August, about 3 o'clock, I saw the prisoner by the side of Limehouse-cut, which is a branch of the river Lee - I observed a bundle under his arm; he walked rather quickly - I asked what his bundle contained; he said twine and biscuit, which he had brought from Gravesend; I called another Policeman, and the prisoner sprang into the water - the other Policeman found this quantity of canvas, about twelve yards from the spot, but the prisoner had not that when I saw him - in about two hours after I saw the prisoner again near the same spot, wholly immersed in the water, except his head - seeing he was discovered he endeavoured to escape, but I leaped into the water, swam across, and took him getting up the bank on the other side; when I saw him he was about two hundred yards from the prosecutors' warehouse.</p>

             HARTON. I am one of the partners of the firm of Messrs. M'Culloch and Co.

I could not have rigged a ship by myself, and if I have been there to work let them bring forward a man to show it - I went down on the 8th of August to his Majesty's ship Dispatch to get employ, but she was full-handed - I stopped, and had dinner on board, at Gravesend - I got some biscuits, and came up by a Milton barge; I found that twine laying down - I took it up, put it under my arm, and walked on with my biscuits in my hand - I met a Policeman, who spoke to me, and let me walk on - I then came to another, and he asked me what I had got; I told him some biscuits - he drew out his staff; I, being in liquor, was alarmed, jumped into the water to make my escape; I got into the mud, and could hardly get out again - when I got out I gave myself up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 531). I was called to 35, Upper Rosoman Street on the 28th September—I saw the prisoner lying at the foot of the bed, with a severe cut on the left arm, and her daughter was also near her, also bleeding from the left arm—about 2 feet from the daughter's head there was a knife—I waited till the doctor's arrival, and he ordered them to be taken to the hospital—after I had been in the room about two minutes the prisoner exclaimed "Why have not I killed them all? I have left two of them now for him to care for!"—the child was three years old.</p>

                  </hi>. I was one of the surgeons at the Royal Free Hospi<lb></lb>tal—the prisoner was brought there on the 28th September, with a child—the child was suffering from an incised wound of the left front fore-arm, about two inches in length and one inch in depth—it was very faint from loss of blood, not quite insensible—it was found necessary afterwards to amputate the arm—the prisoner was suffering from a wound on the left arm—she was insensible when she was brought in—she was insane—I am sure of that.</p>

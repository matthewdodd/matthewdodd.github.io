On Friday, the 3rd of November, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Mount-row, which leads out of ' Davis-street, near Berkeley-square—I saw a mob coming up out of Mount-row, and the prisoner beating another man with a short stick—I did not see the man fall—I observed the stick drop from the prisoner's hand, and saw him put his hand to his right-hand coat-pocket—he drew out knife, and stabbed the man with it—I saw him stab him, and saw the prisoner put his knife into his pocket again—the deceased walked round once or twice, and said he was stabbed—he was capable of walking—I went forward with Fisberry, my fellow-servant, and took hold of the prisoner—I asked him where the knife was which he had stabbed the man with—he said, "In my pocket"—I put my hand into his pocket, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter and glazier, and live in Davis-street. The deceased James Randall lodged in my house for nearly eight months, down to the 1st of November—he was a valet, I believe, but was out of place the whole eight months—I believed him to be single—he did not board with me—he was about forty years of age—for a fortnight before the 1st of November his conduct excited suspicions in my mind—during the eight months he lodged with me between six and seven lads had come into my house, and they had always gone into his sleeping-room—one would come, perhaps, two or three times, then I saw no more of him, and then another came—they used to come either early in the morning or late in the evening—on the 1st of November, about nine o'clock in the evening, he came in with a youth apparently about fifteen years of age—</p>

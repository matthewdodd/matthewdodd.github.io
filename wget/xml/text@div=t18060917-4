             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I live at No. 91, Great Saffron Hill, I kill pigs by commission. On Friday the 29th of August, Evans came to me about six o'clock in the evening, he asked me if I would kill nine pigs; I told him I was tired, I had been to work all day; I asked him the size of them, he said they were from five to seven stone, I told him if any body would go and assist me I would kill them; he said they were at Hoxton, and the water was all hot, and there was a man that would go with me to help kill them; on that consideration I got my tools ready and went along with Donnovan, who was then standing in the street; he pointed out Donnavan to me, Donnovan took me to Hare Walk, Hoxton, to the house of Mrs. Titus; Evans informed me they were the property of a person in the Fleet prison for debt, and that the wife of that debtor was afraid of an execution,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170006"></xptr>and had moved them off to have them killed; Donnovan shewed me the pen in which the pigs were to be killed, I saw there were more than nine pigs, I spoke to Mrs. Titus, she objected to having them killed there, she said the place belonged to a man that kept an ass there, Donnovan was present and heard it, Donnovan requested that she would not turn them out that night, but keep them till the next morning; I went home, and in little less than half an hour after I got home, Evans called on me and asked me the reason why I was not killing the pigs; I told him the reason, that they must be fetched away, and it was too late to kill them for the morning market; he asked me to kill them on Sunday morning, I told him I would not kill them on Sunday morning for any man; he asked me if I would keep them in my cellar; he came again about a quarter before ten, and in the room of bringing nine pigs he brought seventeen, I asked him the reason why he brought so many, Evans said they were all the woman had, I was to kill one for him that night, and he was to fetch it on the Sunday; eight I was to kill on Monday for Tuesday's market, and eight on Tuesday for Wednesday's market.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Sunday did Evans come to you. - A. No, on Sunday morning I saw Evans, I went to his house, I asked him the reason why he had not come for the pig that I had killed, he replied, there is a pretty hobble about these pigs, they were all stolen, he had been to Croydon market on Saturday, and heard it there that they were stolen from a cow keeper at Paddington; he advised me to cut up the pig I had been killing of and make the most money of it I could, and take that money for my trouble; he would come in the middle of the night when all the people were a-bed, and take the other pigs somewhere else; alarmed at the situation that I stood in, I immediately went home and communicated to Mr. Lester what Evans had told me.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had communicated this to Mr. Lester, did you and Mr. Lester go and find out the prosecutor. - A. I did, and he sent his son.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those pigs that young Mr. Kendall saw at your house, the pigs that Evans and Donnovan brought to your house. - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. So you get your livelihood by killing pigs by commission. - A. I keep a butcher's shop on Saffron Hill, I have lived there ten years.</p>
               <p>Q. When Evans told you that you were in a hobble, that they had been enquiring for them at Croydon market, and that they were stolen, you went home and communicated this to Mr. Lester. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever killed pigs for him before. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you they were stolen. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you an opportunity of going to the office to give information, was not that his intentian. - A. I do not know what his intention was.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. In consequence of information that you received, did you go with Chesterman to apprehend the prisoner Evans. - A. I did, I apprehended him in Brewer's yard, Chick lane, I told him the charge; he said that Donnovan came to him in the night mentioned in the indictment; and begged him to come to him at the end of Tottenham Court road, to help drive some pigs; he said he met Donnovan there with seventeen pigs, which they drove to Hoxton; after that they fetched the pigs away from Hoxton, and brought them to Chesterman's house. I afterwards apprehended Donnovan.</p>
               <p>The prisoners left their defence to their counsel, and called no witnesses to character.</p>

About seventeen days after this occurrence, about two o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoner Smith at the window; he came straight up, and looked at that part of the window where the tray was on the day they came - it was near the door; he was in the street: Gaselee, our porter, was in the shop at the time I saw Smith looking in at the window - I said something to him, and sent him out to where Smith was standing; a lady came in at the time, which prevented my going out: I am certain Smith is the person I saw looking in at the window. On the 15th of October I saw both the prisoners in custody at Mary-le-bone office - it was about a week after Smith came to the window.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Does any body but yourself serve in the shop? A. Yes, Greenhow - he was in the shop, and saw the prisoners; Gaselee cleans the plate, but not the jewellery: there is a boy named Read, and Mrs. West herself, but nobody is allowed to go to the glass-case unless we are out; we put so many rings in a row - if one is stouter than another there might be one less: the one in question was generally in the center of the tray, but I cannot say what line it was in; I saw it safe at half-past four o'clock the day before, and we shut up shop at nine o'clock at night - I had no occasion to go to the glass-case afterwards till I locked the tray up: I did not then see any vacancy but what the three occasioned, but will not swear I saw this very ring there after half-past four o'clock. I did not know the prisoners before - they were about ten minutes in the shop; no other customer came in while they were there, but directly they went out others came in: the two rings were not taken from the same row as the three- I put back the one they did not chose. I am positive Curtis is one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. When the ring was missed, did you not inquire among the young men in the shop, if they had sold it? A. I inquired of Grenhow if he had sold it the moment he came in, which was about four o'clock, but not of any body else. I did not tell Cobham, the constable, when I had seen it last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When did you see Cobham? A. On Monday evening, the 15th of October; I did not tell him I had not missed it for a day or two after they came - I took the two rings out of the tray myself, to show them; the tray stood about half-way down a pane of a glass-case on the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inquire of Mrs. West if she had done any thing with it? A. I did afterwards - I wished to make every inquiry; I saw Smith at the window for about a minute; he could not have seen me send the porter out- some things hung in the window, but I could see distiactly between the chains, and am positive it was him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182810230021"></xptr>our shop is opened about seven o'clock in the morning - I sleep there, and was in the shop about seven o'clock the day they came, and was there all day; I am sure I put the tray into the window after they went out, before the other customer came in.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. The three rings had been out for two days? A. Yes; I am sure I saw the cluster-ring at half-past four o'clock the day before they came: the ladies came in about two minutes after the prisoner left - Smith left the window, and passed the door before Gaselee went out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was Mrs. West in the shop when the prisoners came in? A. No - she never serves in the shop; I am certain she did not serve that day, nor the day before.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mrs. West. I remember the day when the ring was missed - I knew the ring very well; I had seen it the afternoon previous, about half-past four o'clock, in the tray: it was a large diamond ring - as far as I can recollect it was placed in the third or fourth row in the tray, not quite in the centre; I took it out at that time to show to a gentleman - I then put the tray into the window; I am quite sure that when I put it in the ring was in it: I was in the shop when the two persons came in about twelve o'clock next day, and in the shop all the time; I was not particularly engaged - the shop is small, but of some depth inside; I was close to the two persons, behind the counter, and outside also; I cannot speak to their persons, as my attention was not particularly drawn to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were in the shop the whole time? A. Yes - I might be doing something; we watch customers as well as we can: I paid no attention to them - I am not in the habit of looking at people; I saw the ring safe the afternoon before - I will not swear to the prisoners in the dress they are now in.</p>

            . I am porter to Mrs. West. About four days before the prisoners were taken I was directed to go out and watch the prisoner Smith, and if I saw an officer to give him in charge; I went out, and saw Smith just below the next house; I was at the further end of our shop, and did not see him till I got out - I followed him as far as Wine-office-court, Fleet-street; he walked all the way, and stopped at the court; I was on the opposite side, crossing the road - he came back, and I came back also; a waggon or two were passing, and when I got over he was gone - I am sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You saw a person beyond the next house? A. Yes - that was the first I saw of him; his back was towards me: I walked on the same side of the way, till he crossed on Ludgate-hill - I have not seen him since till to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell people before you came here, that you would swear to him? A. They said Smith was the man - I said I would swear to the man when I saw him - that I should know the man if I saw him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you asked before you came here, if you should know the man? A. Yes, by the shopman, and said it was possible I should - that is the man (pointing to Curtis;) I am sure he is the man I followed down Ludgate-hill: I only knew his name by what I heard from other people - I followed the same person as the shopman pointed out.</p>
               <p>HENRY SMITH re-examined. The prisoner Smith is the man who came to the window, and he is the man I directed the porter to follow - (pointing to Smith.)</p>

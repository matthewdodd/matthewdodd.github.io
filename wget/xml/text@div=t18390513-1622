                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Abigail, of Lambeth-street, Whitechapel. Last Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, I was walking through Well-close-square with ray daughter—I had 2 half-crowns, 1 shilling, 3 sixpences, and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence—I am positive I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—while we were talking about money matters, three young men were walking towards us, and met us—they did not speak to us—I should know one again—that is Farrell—he struck me a violent blow on the side of my head, which knocked me down—I had my money in my left hand—I had not spoken to him at all—I endeavoured to get up, and he knocked me down again—he hit me on the head the second time—my money dropped from my hand the second time—I saw the person who struck me stoop after it had fallen—I did not observe whether he picked any thing up—there is a gas<lb></lb>light in the square—I called, "Police," and he walked away very quickly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183905130123"></xptr>
               <p>—they both went away together—I looked for my money, and found 2 half-crowns, 1 sixpence, and 2 halfpence on the ground, about ten minutes after I dropped it—I did not have a candle to look for it—the policeman came up, and showed a light.</p>

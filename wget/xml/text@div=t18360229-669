                  </hi>. I live in the parish of Low-Layton, in Essex, and am a housekeeper there. On Thursday evening, the 25th of February. I was the last person up in my house—I went to bed about eleven o'clock—I had left the house properly secured—all the doors and windows were fastened, except the pantry-window, which had iron bars outside—my ser<lb></lb>vant came up and informed me, soon after six o'clock in the morning, that</p>

               <p>the house had been robbed—it was then light—it was day-break—I arose immediately, and went down—some persons had got in through the pantry-window—the iron bars were torn from the wood-work—I did not miss any thing from the pantry, but I missed a bracket-clock which had stood in the dining-room, which was worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am sure—I missed a pair of plated candlesticks, worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; a pair of snuffers and stand, worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; one table-spoon, one tea-spoon, one salt-spoon—they were worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; in my judgment—there was a silver tea-spoon taken from the caddy—there were three coats missed altogether—two of mine—one was one of the wit<lb></lb>ness's—I have pupils—I gave information to the constable of the parish as soon as I was dressed—I was with him, and saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> about 300 yards from my house, going towards the village of Laytonstone, on the way to London—the prisoners M'Vee and Davis were in it—I stopped it there was an apron to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which was thrown open, and I was struck with the sight of my own clock—I saw nothing else—there was a dark lantern left in my house.</p>

On Friday morning, at twenty minutes to six o'clock, I got up, and met two men who I knew by sight having some gin—I went in—they asked me to drink—I said yes—they asked me if I would earn a few shillings—I said I would—we had two glasses of rum apiece—they asked me if I would go down <hi rend="italic">so and so</hi> with a cab, and they would pay me for it—they told me where this property was laid, on the Forest, down a lane—they said they would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay the cab, and if I could get it cheaper I was to have the remainder—I hired a cab for 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. but be<lb></lb>fore I went I called on M'Vee to accompany me down—I knocked at his door three times—he got up, and I asked him to go and take a ride with me—he said he would if I was back before breakfast-time—I said I should be—we went to the public-house where the two men were drink<lb></lb>ing—they called for half-a-pint of rum—we had a glass apiece, and we got into the cab—on going along, I told the cabman if they gave me the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I would give him 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I then left the cab, and went and found the pro<lb></lb>perty, and sent M'Vee back for the cab—it came down, and I put the property in it—when I went down for the clock the boots were with it—I put them on, and left my own shoes there, which I believe the officers found—they told me to put them on, being too small for one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Carter's Defence</hi>. I was taken in Ratchliffe-highway, on suspicion of this robbery.

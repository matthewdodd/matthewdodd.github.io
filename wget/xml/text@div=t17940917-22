I know the prisoner at the bar perfectly well; he came to my house the 3d of July, to the best of my remembrance; I would not take to myself to say it is the day, but it was the early part of the month; I think it was between the hours of twelve and one in the day time; he came to my house and gave me an order for two gallons of cappillaire in an hamper, and to be directed to lady Allen, of Finchley; accordingly I told him it should be fulfilled; he asked me the price? I told him; we agreed on the price, the price was twelve shillings a gallon. Accordingly after agreeing on the price, I says, I don't know that I can send it to day; he said, it would do tomorrow; I thanked him for the opportunity, being busy at the time; it was to be sent to the Horse and Groom, Finchley. Accordingly he tendered me a note; I took the note in this manner and looked at it; this is the note he gave me, to the best of my knowledge. He says, if you don't like the note you may take the money on delivery of the goods; I was not satisfied myself with not taking the money till the delivery of the goods, I rather preferred taking the note, therefore, without any doubt took the note, preferring it to running the risk of the money; I kept it till the next morning. On my bed, in the night, something struck me that the note that I had taken was a bad one; the next morning I sent my son to Sir

               <p>Q. Do you recollect any body coming to your house on that day? - I recollect one Thomas Moore coming about the hour of two; he asked me if I had provided for dinner? and I replied, I had not; he said he had ordered home some salmon. I remember his taking a bill out of his pocket, and some cash, and said, he had been to order some cappillaire, in Brook-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this was the 3d of July? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the prisoner at the bar that day? - He was with me all the whole day, never was out of the house.</p>

            Then you are the wife of Mr. Cattipodi; you know who I mean? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to ask you very much where you live, and if your husband is at present with you? - He is not at present with me.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not here? - No, he is not.</p>
               <p>Q. You refuse to tell where you live now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether you are aware that I have power to apply to his lordship to insist on knowing where you live. Recollect, you have brought it on yourself. Where do you live at this present time? - In Angler's-gardens, Frog lane, Islington, No. 3, next door to Mr. Black.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Cattipodi, the elder, live there? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he ever lived there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately has he lived there? - A week ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not he lived there within two days? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. You surely can tell that? - Yes, he has.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he live there yesterday? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he sleep there last night? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you set off by swearing your husband did not live with you. You talk about Mr. Moore, you know Mr. Moore very well, if he is so domesticated as to come to your house to dine with you? - I knew him when he was a hatter, up at Highgate.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his hand writing at all? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he lives? - I do not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he lives with you? - No, he does not indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a person is Mr. Moore? - A tall thin man, rather darkish visage.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us where to find him? - No.</p>

            Have you applied to him to appear? - I don't know where he is.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might it be since you see him last? - Really, to my knowledge, I have not seen him these three weeks, and then I met him in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened that? It does not occur to you? - It does not.</p>
               <p>Q. It would be very material for you to prove that he was the person, and your son was not. Did not you ask him where he lived, and tell him that your son was in trouble for the very circumstance he mentioned to you? - I did tell him my son was in confinement for the cappillaire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he offer to come forward and clear your son? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you wish to know where to find him for that purpose? - I don't know where to find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him? - I did, but he did not tell me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him to come here? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was this? - He is a dark man, black hair, black beard; he is quite swarthy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he likely to be taken for this man in light hair? - That I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. A very different man by your description.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alby to Richard Ramsden. Did not you tell Peter Cattipodi that the person who came and got this cappillaire, was a swarthy man? - I gave him no answer at all, for I told him I could tell him nothing about it, for I did not take notice; he asked me if he had not such breeches on? I told him I was not able to say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. So he asked you a great many questions, what sort of a man be was? and you told them you could not tell him as you said in your first examination and they tried to make you do it? - Yes.</p>

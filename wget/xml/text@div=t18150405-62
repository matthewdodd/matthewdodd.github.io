On Wednesday, the 15th, the prisoner came down to me, and said, the Italian lady was gone out: she said, she would go and have a rout, she asked me to go with her, I refused: she said she would bolt the door; I went up with her; I stood at her door; I did not go into the room; the prisoner went into the lady's room, she unlocked the door with her key: I saw her take the trinket box off the table; I saw the prisoner with a seal in her hand. That is all that I saw.</p>

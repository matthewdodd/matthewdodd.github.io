                  </hi>. I am a cooper. On the 9th of September I had been drinking at a public-house with a friend—I got drunk, and in going home I lost my way, and met the prisoners, I cannot say where—they tripped me up and put something before my mouth like a handkerchief, and they were about my pockets—one got his hand into my pocket—I was on the ground—a policeman came up—I had never seen them before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policman. At one o'clock in the morning of the 9th of September I was at the bottom of Pearl-row, South-street, Borough-road—I observed the prosecutor and two others—the prosecutor appeared drunk—they were all three together on the pavement—I knew the two prisoners, and as I went towards them I saw the prosecutor in the set of getting off the ground—he had been on the ground—the prisoners were standing there—he charged them with throwing him down, putting a handkerchief before his mouth, and putting their hands into his pocket—they said it was false, they had done no such thing, for he had fallen down—I directly took them both into custody, and after I had gone about three hundred yarda I met Piper, and he assisted me—the prosecutor collected himself in the interval, and laid hold of one of the prisoners by the neck of his coat—I found on Hardaway 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., a handkerchief, and an old apron—and on Brown was found some money, and a false nose for the purpose of disguising his countenance.</p>

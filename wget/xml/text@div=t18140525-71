I lost the cloak on Monday the 9th of May, between eight and nine in the evening; the two prisoners came into my shop; I suspected them, having lost something the day before. When they came in, the prisoner Giles looked at a gown that was hanging up in the shop; I took her by the shoulder, and desired her not to move the things that were hanging up. The prisoner, Cook, offered a pair of shoes and stockings, both new, which I supposed not to be her own. I desired her to take them away; they would not do. I then turned away from the counter, with my back towards them. I was informed by a witness that something was pulled down; I said to the prisoner Cook, what have you got there. She went towards the door. I perceived her throw something out of the door. I got over the counter. She had then a great coat on. I said, what have you got; she said, I have got nothing about me. I desired them to go about their business. In a few minutes afterwards, a boy, a witness, came with a cloak. The cloak is mine. That is all I know.</p>

             pull the cloak down by force. She tried to unpin it; she could not. I told Mr. Hill I thought there was something dropped. She walked to the door, and threw something out; I did not see what it was. She stooped down, and tried to put something under her petticoats. Mr. Hill got over the counter, and brought her in. She opened her coat.

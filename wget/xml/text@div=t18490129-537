On 26th Dec, about eight at night, I was on duty, and saw the door of the King's Arms, at the corner of White-cross-street and Chis well-street, open, and saw fighting going on inside—there were two soldiers, of whom the prisoner is one, and a number of other people—three women and one man were turned out, and then the two soldiers—they stood outside the door—I was about twelve yards from them, and when I came towards them the prisoner said to me, "If you won't let me fight them, you b----r, I will fight you"—I said, "Oh, no you won't, comrade, take my advice, and go away;" with that he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with his foot and kicked me in the private parts—I recollect no more, till I found myself in a chemist's shop—I was afterwards taken to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, remained there about a quarter of an hour, and then went home, and Mr. Mather has been attending me—the prisoner was quite drunk—I went on reserve duty again last Monday week.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the police force. On 27th Dec Haynes was placed under my care—he had received an injury in the penis, both testicles, and the contents of the scrotum and the urethra were ruptured; the parts were very much enlarged and swollen; he was under my care for a month—there was no external wound, except that the lining membrane of the urethra was ruptured, that caused a small flow of blood for two days mingled with the urine.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined Q.</hi> He is recovering now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I hope he will permanently recover—there is no external wound—the external blow caused an internal rupture to the blood-vessels of the urethra—there must have been a breach of the skin which lines the urethra—supposing an external blow on any part of the stomach, so as to produce an internal rupture, there might or might not be an abrasion of the skin internally—there was a rupture of the continuity of the membrane lining the penis, which is a skin precisely the' same as that which lines the cheek, and the external and internal skin of the lip.</p>

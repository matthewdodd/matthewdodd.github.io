             sworn. - My husband, Robert-Wayman, is in the North; I live at <placeName id="t18030706-55-crimeloc317">Poplar</placeName>

               <p>Court. Q.Was there any mark on any of the money? - A. Yes, I think there was, but I cannot tell; I have forgot it, money is so much alike.</p>

               <p>Q.Recollect, you have been before a Justice, and described it to him? - A. I cannot recollect at all; I said there was some mark, but I cannot recollect what, I have got so much on my mind.</p>

               <p>Q.Was it marked with letters? - A. Yes, but I cannot tell what; I will swear I don't recollect it; there are many shillings marked alike.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you heard the prisoner that morning? - A. I heard him go out in the morning about four o'clock, but I cannot say he was the person who took it.</p>

               <p>SARAH TAYLOR sworn. - I am sister to the last witness, and saw her count her money on the table on the Wednesday evening, but did not see where she put it; I suppose she put it into her pocket; I observed one shilling marked; she was very tipsy, and did not know what she did; I have seen the shilling since, and it was marked L. B. N. I saw Browne, the officer, with it, and saw him take it out of the prisoner's box in his room, while the prisoner was in bed.</p>

               <p>- BROWN sworn. - I am an officer: On Thursday morning, the prosecutrix came to Shadwell-office, and said, she had had her house broke open, and described the money, by the marks, to the Magistrate; I examined the prisoner's box while he was by, and found nineteen shillings in silver, and one shilling marked, but not in a glove; I asked Ann Wayman if she knew any of the money; she said, one shilling was marked L. B. N. the B was a cypher, and she picked out the shilling, but she told the marks before, and so did her sister; the prisoner said it was his own money.(The shilling produced and identified by Taylor.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is money I worked hard for; I have lately buried my wife, and have a child at nurse which I pay for; I never touched money not my own any more than I did this; I had a shilling this morning with three letters on it, but I cannot read, no more can Mrs. Wayman.</p>

               <p>For the prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - Taylor came into my house this morning, and said, she should not come against the prisoner, if the officer had not fetched her out, and put words into her mouth, and was very sorry for the prisoner, and what she should do she did not know; she was crying, and positively declared that she would run away from the officer, and not appear against the prisoner.(Grace Hill confirmed the testimony of the last witness.)</p>

               <p>Q.(To Sarah Taylor.) You have heard what Harris has said; is it true that you said you would not have said what you did before the justice, if the officer had not put the words in your mouth? - A. I did not know the nature of an oath; I said, I did not know what I then said.</p>

               <p>Q. Is what she says true? - A. I don't think I said so.</p>

               <p>Q. You cannot positively say you did not tell her to? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Jury. Q.Was the prisoner in the habit of coming into your room to eat or drink? - A. Yes, when his wife was alive, but was not in the room that evening that I know of.</p>

               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18030706-55-verdict318" type="verdictDescription">

             sworn. - I am a patrol; as I was going my rounds on Sunday evening, the 5th of October, I met the prisoner, and two more, in West-street, commonly called Chick-lane; upon my coming up, they ran away, and I followed them; the prisoner at the bar threw this parcel down in the kennel; upon that, I called to my partner,

            , to pick up the parcel, but he did not; I called out stop thief, and the prisoner turned up a place where there was no thoroughfare, the King's-arms Yard; I followed him, and kept in sight of him all the way, till he got behind some logs, where he hid himself, and there he was taken by Morgan and Dodd; I went back to the place where he had thrown down the parcel, where I found it in the kennel, (produces the property); I have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What distance was this place from Goswell-street? - A. About half a mile.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this a place through which he could possibly have escaped? - A. No; without he got over the gates.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you say, before the Magistrate, that you saw one of the other two men drop it? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that that was the man who dropped the bundle? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see his face? - A. Yes, I did, by the lamp.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Any bit might have met with a similar accident? - A. Yes; but I am certain they are mine, because I have had them in the house a considerable time; the whips are my own make, they are quite out of the present fashion; I know the snassle to be mine.</p>

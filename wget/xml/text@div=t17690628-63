               <p>Q. What is the nature of your business?</p>
               <p>Ward. We buy a good many ingots of jewellers. Here are two that the prisoner brought us (producing them) on the 25th of May; one is nine ounces four pennyweights, and left in order to be valued.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they?</p>
               <p>Ward. They are gold and silver partings. The quantity of a pennyweight I took from one end, to try it. One I paid him six pound eight shillings and eleven-pence for. Here is another that never was bought. On the 26th he came for the money, about one o'clock, when our foreman said the prisoner had made use of base means to deceive. Then I took a piece out of the middle and sent it to Mr. Bradbury to be assayed; that bore but two shillings and sixpence an ounce; the other was fourteen shillings and a penny. This was delivered to us as being all of a value. Finding this difference, and that the prisoner was gone, I imagined he would come again in a little time. On Wednesday the 31st of May, a person, who said he was foreman to he prisoner, came with another ingot, and in cutting the ends off, we found it was alike at the ends, but the middle was much like the other. We told him we found a difference in the ingot, and should be very glad if Mr. Lutmore would come himself to know how such an affair should be settled. I think the day after he came, and seemed to be greatly surprized there should be a difference in the ingot. I told him there was, and I was surprized to think he should use us in that manner. He said he was sorry it was so, but if we would melt the ingot down, he would pay the difference, saying he had it of a German Jew. I told him, if he did not produce this German Jew, he must expect the consequence of the law, and added, I was surprized he could take things of a German Jew that he knew nothing of till they were tried. I asked him how much he thought he had defrauded us of within these twelve months; he said about five or six and twenty pounds. I desired him to wait till Mr. Plumb came. When Mr. Plumb came, then the prisoner said he would bring the German Jew, but he never came. We received a letter that he was absconded. I went to enquire, and found he had absconded in a very base manner. Mr. Cox, who has another ingot in the like manner, which he had of the prisoner, he took him up, and brought him to our compting-house. It being late that Saturday, nothing could be done. He was taken before Mr. Alderman Kirkham on the Monday, and asked to give an account in what manner he came by this ingot, or how these ingots came to be in that manner, the ends good, and middle of a base composition. He produced no Jew, nor gave any account. We expect they should be of equal value, the ends and the middle. If they are rightly cast, they must be so. We never try but at the end, except we have a suspicion.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176906280049"></xptr>Q. What do you imagine the middle of this bad one to be a composition of?</p>
               <p>Ward. I imagine the middle to be tooth and egg, and a little silver put into it. Each end is very rich; they amount to fourteen shillings and a penny an ounce; and the middle not above two shillings and six-pence. It is always understood they should be alike. We have tried the ends and middle of two since, and they were within a farthing an ounce.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bradbury. I had a piece of this ingot sent me to assay on the 25th May, from Messrs. Plumb and Brown; I assayed it, and reported, that at the ends it appeared to be very good, and the middle very bad. (He takes the pieces in his hand.) The ends appear to be much richer than the middle.</p>
               <p>Ward. When the assay came home, it weighed after the rate of fourteen shillings and one penny an ounce. I cut a piece out of the middle, which when that came home the difference in value was eleven shillings and ten-pence an ounce, or thereabouts.</p>

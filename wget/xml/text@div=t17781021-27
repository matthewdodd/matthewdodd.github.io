I sent the prisoner in to clean our room on the 7th of October, in the morning about twelve o'clock, and she stole the things mentioned in the indictment. I was near the door selling fruit. I sent her in to clean the place; she was in the room about two hours. I had given her the key to go in; when she brought me the key again I went in and missed the things from out of my chest, which was left unlocked. I found her afterwards at a public house near Stepney; she had a cloak and silk hat of mine in a bushel basket covered with straw; she had pawned the rest; she would not tell me where she had pawned them; I am sure the cloak and hat were mine.</p>

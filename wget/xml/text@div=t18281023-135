            , of Chatham, "Six months," meaning that the account had not been standing six months, the goods having been sent in May, and they would not be paid for till November; he went again in April last, and then he writes against it "Next journey:" in April or May last we desired a conference with him on the subject of his accounts; he produced a long list, in pencil, of accounts which he had received, and not paid in, as was his duty to do, but had purloined - I think it very likely he used the word embezzled; we told him if he would give up every instance of what he had embezzled, we would not prosecute him, but go on his former security, which was a bond of indemnity - he said he had never received any account of any one person who lived out of London but what he had mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a statement did he give? A. A pencil memorandum, and some verbal statements; this written list (looking at it) was not made out in his presence, nor shown to him; he said there was every single instance on which he had received money from the country, and not accounted for it; no account of 1l. 12s. from Mr. Lawrence, on the 15th of September was received - here is his book of receipts of that day, and there is no such account in it- I never received it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you the person who spoke to him at that time? A. Yes; I can swear he never gave me an account of the 1l. 12s.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. You say that not only Mr. Lawrence's money is not down here in the book, but from your own recollection that he did not account for it to you? A. Kidley's account at Chatham was 1l. 15s. 6d., but he did not receive the whole of it; I believe he received 1l. 3s. Mr. Hathersick was the gentleman who succeeded the prisoner, and he went round the journey to investigate the accounts - he is not here; this letter we received from him - it is addressed by the prisoner to him, and is in the prisoner's hand-writing; the sums mentioned in these indictments were not mentioned by the prisoner at the time of the investigation, nor at any other time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. This man had been in your service five years, had he? A. Yes, thereabouts; I know nothing of a firm of Russell and Warren - I have heard of them about eight or nine months: at the time of this investigation we had security to the amount of 500l., in a bond of indemnity, for any deficiency of the prisoner's - the parties were solvent, and paid us on the 5th of June; if the prisoner had stated these accounts in his investigation, they would have been paid no doubt - we did not turn him away till the 31st of May; we have never had him back since that; when we spoke of his accounts he was away for a week - we wrote to his friends; he came and made up a story; we took him again, and he went this journey - I think we took him about a month ago, in September; we could not find him before - the officer said he was on the look out for him; I did not know he was on the journey for the other firm till afterwards - we had a warrant out against him.(The letter was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR, - Agreeable to my promise, I write, but am sorry to say, not with the cash, as I cannot get it these three weeks; since I had the pleasure of seeing you, I have heard that Mr. Warren intends to prosecute me, if any more accounts are brought against me, and they are only waiting your letter to hear: now, my dear Sir, I know your kindness, and the unpleasant situation you are placed in; my liberty and prospects in this life are entirely left in your hands. If you take the accounts in against me I am done, which I am sure is not your wish; I pledge you my word all shall be paid long before the next journey is due; if you will send me the accounts, I will get a friend to pay them at different times, saying they wanted to Mr. account, or in any other way you may think proper; you have only to say on the bills - "not at home;" I am sure you would not be the means of sending me out of the country. It is not for myself I care, but my poor motherless child; for God's sake, Mr. Hathersick, let me know what you intend to do, and when and where I may take the liberty of sending you a letter; will you be pleased to send a letter for me to the barn by Sunday night's post; I leave here at ten o'clock to night by a sailing packet. I hope you will excuse this scrawl, and not say that I am in London.</p>
               <p>I am, Sir, your humble servant, J. HENDERSON.</p>
               <p>For God's sake do what you can for me. I have heard from London, and know they only wait for your letter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What was the deduction for? A. A part of the goods, a cask, and discount; the prisoner has called on me once since on behalf of Messrs. Warren; I cannot exactly say when - it was early in this year, to the best of my recollection; I was entitled to six months credit.</p>
               <p>MR. RYLAND. Q. Did the prisoner call on you on the 3d of April last? A. I believe it was about that time - he did not ask me for this sum; I told him I would pay him next journey; I owed them nothing then - he has not called for any other trader in blacking.</p>

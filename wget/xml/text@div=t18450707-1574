About one o'clock in the morning, on the 24th of June, I was going home, and met the prisoner near Alfred-place—she wished me to take a walk with her, which I declined, as I was waiting for a friend—I walked a few steps, and she began fumbling about my person—I found my purse was gone—I charged her with it—she said, "For God's sake don't say anything, here it is"—she gave me the purse and went off—I looked at it, and recollected I had missed a sovereign—I told the policeman—we went in search of her, and I gave her in charge.</p>

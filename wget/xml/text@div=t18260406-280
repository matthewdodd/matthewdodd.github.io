On the 25th of February, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was at work in his shop, and heard a rattle at a pane of glass which had been broken, and over which a paper was placed - I heard the cry of Stop thief! I then missed a pair of stays from the window - I went to the watch-house, and the prisoner was there - the stays were brought in soon afterwards - there were two pieces of paper at the window pinned together - and one of them had been pushed in.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . About half-past eight o'clock I was with Bertraun, in Oxford-street, and saw the prisoner with another person; the prisoner took the stays from the window, and gave them to his companion - they ran across Woodstock-street - Bertraun followed them, crying Stop thief? the prisoner threw down the stays, and I saw him stopped by a watchman. I went with Bertraun to a doctor's to take a mad-dog - I then went to the watch-house, and saw the prisoner - I am certain he was the person.</p>

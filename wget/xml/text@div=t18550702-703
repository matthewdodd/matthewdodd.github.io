                  </hi>. I am a seaman, and about a month ago was discharged from the ship <hi rend="italic">City of Manchester</hi>. On that day I went to live at the prisoner's house, No. 1, Shorter's-street, Wellclose-square—on 11th June I pawned my watch for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and paid away all but 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the course of the same day—I had been drinking, and about 2 o'clock in the day I went up to my room to go to sleep—the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was then in my right waist<lb></lb>coat pocket—there were two half crowns, two shillings, and some sixpences—I did not lock my room door—I laid down and went to sleep, and when I got up again I felt for my money, and it wassail gone—I went down, and asked the servant about it—the prisoner was not there, she was down in the kitchen; and in consequence of what the servant had said, I went down and asked the prisoner if she would give me my money back again—she said, "I do not know anything about your money; what do you come to me for?"—I said, "I know you took the money; there is the servant, she tells me she saw you take it; you wanted the servant to go and take it, but she would not"—she then struck the servant hard on the face, it bled, and I went out to the police court directly.</p>

               <p>and spoke to her about it—she had not been in my bed room—she had not. been <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with me, and dressing up a doll—I know nothing about my mistress ordering her to keep out of my room—the prisoner keeps a sailor's lodging house, and I am one of the lodgers—six of my shipmates lodged there also—there was another man in the same bed room with me when I was asleep—he is not here; he is gone home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a seaman, belonging to the ship <hi rend="italic">City of Man-chester</hi>. I was lodging at the prisoner's house at the same time as the last witness—I went there on the same day as he did, and lodged there ten days—he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on this day, about 2 o'clock, and then had 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. left—I saw him count his money when he went up stairs, and put it in his waistcoat pocket, and lie down to sleep, and as soon as he went to sleep I went out, and pulled the door to, but did not lock it; there was no look to it.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived as servant to the prisoner, at No. 1, Shorter's-street, Wellelose-square, for a week. Lund and Salmon came to lodge there as soon as I did—I went with Lund to pawn his watch, on a Monday, about 1 o'clock, because he said that he did not like to go by himself—he came back with me, stopped in the house about an hour, and then went out, and came back in half an hour—he said he felt rather tired, and went to lie down—while he was lying down the prisoner went up stairs—I went up about a quarter of an hour afterwards, as was going to have a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with one of the sailors, not this young man—I was dressing up a doll, and I went into the room, and allowed my mistress what 1 was going to do, and she smiled at it—I saw her at Lund's bedside, with her hands in his waist<lb></lb>coat pocket; she took out a shilling, and I said, "Do not you take that shilling; he will only miss it, for he counted his money out to one of the other sailors"—she said, "You take one;" I said, "No, God forbid that I should rob the sailors, for they are robbed quite enough; you had better put it back"—she said that she would, and I saw her put her fingers in the pocket, but I do not know that she put the shilling in—presently he came down, and said, "Esther, I have been robbed," and I told him, and when I went into the kitchen, the prisoner struck me on the nose, and made it bleed—I took my things, and went home to my mother—I took none of the money; my mistress wanted me, but I would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi>. Do you generally go up into sailors' bed rooms to <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but the sailor was rather dull—I thought I could make him rather lively—I dressed up a doll, and went up to have a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with him; not in the same room with Lund, over his head, but I went into Lund's room to show my mistress what I was going to do—I did not know that my mistress was there till I went in—I went into her bed room first, and she was not there, and then she called me, and that was the reason that I went in—I did not expect to find the sailor alone, who I was going to have a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with; there were other mates there, and I was sot going into the room, I was only going to put the dell outside the door—of course, it would not have been proper to have gone in.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came Lund to go to the pawn shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> His watch was in for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he wanted a few more shillings; he gave me the 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I went and got it out, and said, "I will show you a pawn shop"—it was pawned before by a young woman whom he knew—I do not know her—I had no drink with him—I had been a week in the house—I was not searched—I said to my mis<lb></lb>tress,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020042"></xptr>
               <p>"If you think I have done it, search me before I go out of the house"—I said that because she said to herself that I had done it—somebody had told me that she had charged me with being the thief—before this, I lived at No. 6, Fane-street, with my mother; she and I had a few words, and I Jived with a young woman, a few weeks at the waistcoat work, in Penitent-street—no one but this young woman lived there—people did not visit me there—I do not know the name of the woman who keeps the house—I found out that it is a brothel after I had been there a little time—I never opened the door to the people, and I never <hi rend="italic">done</hi> wrong while I was in the place—the door was always open; it was a cigar shop—I am seventeen years old.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

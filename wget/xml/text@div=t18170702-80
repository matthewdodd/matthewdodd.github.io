            , who is the son of one of them. I gave him a 3s. piece, a half crown, and a sixpence, which I marked-he was to go to the prisoner's house to purchase base coin-Lines was with me. I saw him go to the prisoner's house myself; he keeps the house. Caine stopped there about twenty minutes. We placed ourselves about twenty yards off-on his coming out, he gave me a signal that he had got the money; we went up and laid hold of him; the prisoner had got the door in his hand letting him out. I searched Caine in his presence, and found a paper, containing 12s., which I produce. They were folded up separately. I asked Caine where he go them from? he said at first he did not know. I asked him if he got them from the prisoner; he said, in a low tone of voice, that he did-the prisoner heard me ask him. I then searched the prisoner, and found 21s. in good silver on him - I did not find those that I had given to Caine. I went up stairs to search, but found nothing; I afterwards went up again, and found a board loose in the floor of the garret, I took it up, and found the marked money which I had given to Caine; I also found a quantity of base coin. The prisoner was with me - He said he knew nothing about it. There was no other person in the house-there are only three rooms in it, one above the other; I took him into custody, and returned and researched again, and found a melting-pot in the cellar, and in the garret I found a vice and a black-lead pot. I took up another board in the garret, and found a great many papers which appeared to be of the same kind as that the money was wrapped in.</p>
               <p>JOHN CAINE. On the 11th of June last my mother was in custody. I afterwards saw Lines and Jones. He gave me a 3s. piece, a half-crown, and a sixpence. I went to the prisoner's house and found him there - He shut the door, and took me into the kitchen. I told him my aunt was very bad, and could not come herself, and I was to have 6s. worth of Derbys. I did not know what it meant. He told me to speak softly, and he would go and fetch them for me. My aunt had sent me once before, and told me to ask for Derbys. I put the money that Jones gave me into my waistcoat pocket, and gave it to him. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020037"></xptr>locked me up in the kitchen and left me there; he came down to me again, and gave me a paper, telling me to put it into my pocket before I got to the door. I put it into my waistcoat-pocket. He said the people could see them there; I said they could not. When I got to the door, I scratched my head, to give

             a signal that I had got them, which I had agreed to do. Jones stopped me on the step, and put his foot against the door to prevent its being shut, and asked me what I had got? I told him nothing, as I was afraid of the prisoner's striking me-there was no other person in the house. He searched my pocket and found them there; I never opened them-it was the parcel that the prisoner gave me.</p>

            . I am a beadle of Limehouse. I and Jones sent Caine to the prisoner's house; I saw him go in and come out, and had him in sight all the time, except while he was in the house. On his coming out, Jones took a paper from him. I afterwards went into the house, and found a paper, up stairs, which contained the marked money that was given to Caine. Jones found a paper containing ninety-eight bad shillings, and four punches with letters on them, with which the old shillings were marked; I also found a paper containing eight counterfeit shillings and six 1s. 6d. tokens, apparently new, and three separate papers, containing forty bad shillings in each, imitating the new coinage.</p>

            . I am an assistant to the Solicitor of the Mint. The twelve shillings taken from Caine are all counterfeit, and resemble the new coinage. The three papers, containing 40s. each, are also counterfeit, and of the same die as the twelve - They are each wrapped in separate papers, to prevent their rubbing. They have never been in circulation.</p>

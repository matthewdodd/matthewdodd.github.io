About three, or five minutes after, I followed the prisoners down Cheapside, and saw them between King-street and Lawrence-lane; they were going towards the Change. In about five minutes after I left my shop, I noticed them, and I thought they noticed me, and I crossed the way, I watched them into Devaynes and Hingeston's, the corner of King-street; immediately as I saw them in the shop, I went home, and desired Pitfield to come with me, and desired him to go and make enquiry what they had purchased; and I saw them come out and cross the way. I missed Pitfield, but I found him afterwards, and desired him to follow them, and I went home. I gave information in Bow-street, they were found in a court in Wych-street, they were at tea, there was nobody else in the room. I saw Jealous put his hand towards Mrs. Field's mouth, and take a shilling, but I cannot say where it was from; their pockets were both emptied; I saw a shilling on the tea-table, but I cannot tell how it came there: Pitfield has the money that I gave him.</p>
               <p>Court. All the money you received from Field? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who paid for the dimity? - I believe Field paid two shillings for the Irish, and Sharpe paid twopence.</p>
               <p>Did any conversation pass between them? - Field asked her for it.</p>
               <p>Sharpe had no concern in the dimity? - No</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, Prisoner's Counsel. Did you know those persons before they came to your shop that day? - No.</p>
               <p>You objected to some of the money, Mrs. Field changed them? - She did.</p>
               <p>The shillings you thought were discoloured in the pocket? - Yes.</p>

               <p>On Thursday the 10th of February I received nine shillings from my master, which he desired me to weigh; I did weigh them, and found them not so heavy as eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Did you keep them separate? - I put them with two that my master took out of the till, that he suspected he had taken from them. I cannot distinguish which those two were, but the eleven have never been mixed. (Produces them.) Mr. Denning pointed out the two women to me in Cutter-lane, and I followed them down two or three back streets, into Newgate-street,; they were together all the time, they went into the Crown in Newgate-street, I did not see them offer any money there. I traced them from the Crown in Paternoster-Row; I observed Field go into a druggist's in Paternoster-Row; she came out, and they went into White Lion-court, Wych-street, to a private house, I believe it was: after that I came back to my master, and he went to Bow-street: I was in the room when the officers took them, that was about six o'clock; I saw Jealous turn some money out of Mrs. Field's pocket into a hat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you weigh the nine shillings together? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Denning give you the two shillings at the same time? - No, a few minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>You would not have known them except Mr. Denning had pointed them out? - No.</p>
               <p>There was a great distance of time had elapsed, between the time you were at the Crown and the time you got home? - Yes, an hour, or an hour and a quarter.</p>

I went out on the night of the 12th of December, at seven o'clock, and I returned at about twelve. The boy let me in, and on my coming in, I shut the door to, and double locked it. I had then some conversation with the boy, and then went to bed. I was awakened between four and five o'clock in the morning, by the patrole and my apprentice who came into my room. The patrole told me he had found the door open, and he believed the house had been robbed. I got up and came down stairs, and in the front room I found the drawers had been opened, and the things had been taken out; I can't say how they had been opened, but the front of the secretary had been wrenched open. In different parts of the room, bundles of linen, books and things, had been moved out of the place where they had been left. I missed some halfpence, and in consequence of something that I heard from my apprentice I suspected the female prisoner; I desired the boy to stay in the house with his mistress, and I told the patrole to go to the end of the court where the prisoners lived, and to stop any suspicious characters that might pass by, I went to Lambeth-street office, and asked where I could find the nearest officer,and I was refered to

            . I called him, and he answered me, and I told him to come immediately for that my house had been broken open. He came with me to my house, and saw the state of place in the same manner I have described. Thence we went to the house where the prisoner lodged; I did not miss anything but halfpence at first. In the hurry we could not tell what we had missed. We knocked at the door, and we were near twenty minutes or half an hour before we could obtain admittance up stairs in the room where the prisoners lodged. The female prisoner was up and dressed; the prisoners were only lodgers. The patrole hallooed out from below, that a bundle had been thrown out at the window. The prisoner occupied a front and a back room. They are father and daughter. The patrole brought the bundle up, and two miniature pictures. I identified them immediately, they were the miniatures for myself and my wife. In the bundle there was one scarf which I could swear to. We took the two prisoners and the bundle up to Lambeth-street, and on searching them, we found nothing on them, but took the two keys of the rooms, and went back to the house. In the window of the front room, I found a viel, a lace cap, and two pairs of silk stockings, one pair white, and the other pair black; they were my property. Outside the window of the back room, we found the halfpence tied up in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181601100032"></xptr>a shawl, and a piece of silk was under the halfpence; the halfpence had been in a tray outside the door in my house. The old man was undressed and in bed. We produced a chissel to him, and he said he said he believed it to be his; I have dogs, but they did not bark that night. All my family were gone to bed when I came home, except the boy, who let me in. I left the key on the inside of the lock, when I double locked it.</p>

            . I remember the night of the 12th or the morning of the 13th. In the discharge of my duty I tried every door as I passed along. At about a quarter before two, the Tower clock had just gone the three quarters of an hour. I shoved my elbow against Mr. Baxter's door, and almost fell in. I knocked twice at the door with the handle of my cutlass, and said, house a boy; and a female voice answered, thank you sir; and somebody shut the door. I went past the door three times, and tried it and found it fast until about twenty minutes before five, when I found it open again. I knocked at the door, and a young man came out in his shirt, and said thank you patrole; I believe he is the apprentice. He asked me to get a light, and he said all was not right. I went to the watchman's box, and got a light, and took it to the house. As soon as he had shut the street door, he said, the back door is open, all is not right; the back door was about half open. We proceeded up stairs, and called his master; at that time we passed through the dining room, and saw the things all in confusion. Mr. Baxter got up, and he told me to go to the court where the prisoner lived, and not to suffer any body to pass either in or out, and I went and watched. He afterwards went away. I waited until Mr. Dalton, and he came back. We all went to the house together, we were some time before we could gain admitance. A bundle come out of the front window, I immediately took possession of it, and carried it up stairs, and gave it to Mr. Dalton.</p>

With that he went up stairs, and I went to bed again, and fell asleep. In about an hour afterwards, between sleep and awake, I thought I heard a female voice say, hush, the door is fast; that voice resembled

            . I remember the night of the 12th of December, or rather the morning of the 13th, I went up stairs, and found the things all in confusion, and the things tied up ready to be carried away. I saw a chissel there; I have it in my possession; it exactly corresponds with the marks on the drawers. After this, I went with Mr. Baxter to the prisoner's house; after knocking at the door twenty minutes or half an hour, we got admittance; in going up stairs, we heard the casement open; I desired the patrole to go outside the door in case any thing should be thrown out of the window. I went into the room. and found the window open, as I expected; this was the second floor front room. I had not beed in the room more than half a minute before the female prisoner came in nearly dressed; the man was in bed. I searched the room, and then the patrole brought the bundle of clothes up to me, and afterwards the pictures. I searched the window, but was not very particular, because I supposed the bundle contained the whole of the stolen property. I took the prisoners to Lambeth-street office, and locked them up. We then came back again; I unlocked the front room, and there I found two pairs of silk stockings, a lace veil, and a cap. I then went into the back room, and out of the back window, into the gutter; I found one pound sixteen shillings in halfpence, and a piece sarsenet; they were tied up in a shawl. I locked the room up, and took the rest of the property to the office. I shewed the chissel to the man prisoner, I asked him if he had lost any tools, and he said, not that he knew of. I pulled the chissel out of my pocket, and said, is not this yours; he said, he had one like it. There was a lanthorn on the table, which I took in my hand; I opened it, and found in it a match; I felt to the candle, and it did not appear to have been long put out.</p>

            's Defence. In the unfortunate situation in which am I placed, it is difficult for me to convince a jury of my innocence. On the night in question, at a little before ten, I retired to rest, fatigued with a hard day's labour, leaving my daughter sitting up at work. Having lived a sober life, ever marked by honesty and integrity, let my horror be imagined, when I was awakened from my sleep, charged with being an accessory with my own daughter in a burglary. Painful as the task is to me, it is my duty, when I am put upon my trial, for an offence of which I am totally innocent, though unfortunately labour under strong circumstances of suspicion, to declare my innocence, and plead my bitherto unblemished character. The articles must have been brought into my premises between the time of my going to bed, and my being awakened. I refer to the prosecutor for a character. I am at a loss to describe my feelings; yet I know my innocence. I have been ten years a house-keeper in the neighbourhood in which I lately resided. I throw my unfortunate case on the Court and Jury, and shall rest satisfied with their decision.</p>

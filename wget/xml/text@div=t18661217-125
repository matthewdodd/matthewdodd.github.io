I am a seaman, of 6, Bourne Street, Stepney—on the 30th November, about half-past four in the afternoon, I was passing Trafalgar Square, Stepney, and saw several men—Whybrow came up and struck me several times in the face, and snatched my silver Albert chain from me, for which I gave 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I caught hold of him, and saw him pass it to Hyde—I caught hold of Hyde, and Whybrow struck me—I ran and caught Hyde in Trafalgar Square—I looked at Whybrow par<lb></lb>ticularly, because he asked me what I was looking at—that enables me to speak to him particularly.</p>

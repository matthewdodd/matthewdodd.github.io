               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You use pewter and solder to tin your copper vessels? - A. We use no solder, only pewter.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other apprentices? - A. Yes; two.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the pewter is in a proper state to tin your vessels, there is some labour required upon it? - A. He only melts it at the time he wants to use it, but he had made use of the pewter which he wanted the day before.</p>
               <p>THOMAS-LONG SHEENE sworn. - I have lost a considerable quantity of pewter; in consequence of my son's information, I went down stairs and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179912040030"></xptr>asked the prisoner what he had got; he said, he had got nothing but a pair of snuffers, which he had in his hand; he said, he had nothing in his pocket; I searched him, and in his pocket, I found two pounds of pewter, and a pound and a half of solder; I then sent for a constable, took him before the Alderman, and he was committed; he has been with me five years, I took him out of charity and cloathed him, and gave him one shilling every Saturday night to keep him honest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did he not tell you, that he had taken that for the purpose of tinning your own vessels? - A. I do not recollect that he said any such thing; he had not business to put it in his pocket, nor had he any use for it at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they not obliged to make use of some preparation before they can use it? - A. None whatever, except to melt it; it must be melted every time it is used.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What time of day was it? - A. About half past one, when all the men were at dinner.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I got some sal ammoniac and pewter, to tin a dozen of sauce-pans, which I tinned that day, I put it away to make covers for the sauce-pans; next day my fellow-apprentice insisted upon having the sal ammoniac; I said, he should not, and I put it in my breeches pocket, and my master happened to see me, and when he came up and asked me what I had got, I pulled it out immediately.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 3, Albert-square, Clapham-road. On 2nd Nov. I was in Fenchurch-street, from half past 1 to 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I was stopping for about a minute, looking into a print shop—I had a <hi rend="italic">porte-monnaie</hi> in my pocket—I had been into a biscuit shop about a minute before, and I had it then quite safe—whilst I was standing at the print shop I felt something touching my right side, where my pocket was, and, on looking round, I saw the prisoner—I said to him, "You have picked my pocket"—he said, "No, I have not"—I said, "You have," and I caught hold of his left hand, but he struggled, and got his hand away from me, and passed it in front of me—I caught hold of part of his coat, which tore in my hand—I lost my umbrella in holding him—I called out as loud as I could, "Help! help! this man has picked my pocket"—some persons came up and asked if I wished to give him in charge—I said I would—a youth came up, and said, "I have picked up this purse; I saw the prisoner throw it away"—it was my purse—two gentlemen held the prisoner—he was never out of my sight—I never let go of him till the gentlemen said, "You may leave go, we have got him"—this is the purse—it contained four sovereigns, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a cheque, for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it contains that now.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 6, Bedford-place, Old Kent-road, and am clerk to a merchant. On 2nd Oct., about a quarter to 2 o'clock, I was passing down Fenchurch-street, and saw Mrs. Cooper—just as she ran across the road she had hold of the prisoner's coat—just as he got across the road I saw two gentlemen catch hold of him—I saw the prisoner throw the purse away just as the gentlemen seized him—I picked it up, and gave it to Mrs. Cooper—this is the purse.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 584). I saw a crowd, went up, and saw the prisoner in the custody of two gentlemen—the prosecutrix said the prisoner had picked her pocket, and gave the prisoner into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was coming along Fenchurch-street, walking in front of the lady; she turned round and caught hold of both my hands, and said, "You have robbed me of my pocket book;" I said, "It is false; I have no pocket book about me;" she said, "You have," and caught hold of my coat, and two gentlemen came and took me; the boy picked up the purse fifty yards from where I was.</p>

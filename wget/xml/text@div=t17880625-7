               <p>I went out at two o'clock and shut my door, and locked it, when I came back which was half after eight, I found my door locked as I left it, and on entering the house, I found the sash had been thrown up, and the things thrown about.</p>
               <p>Are you quite sure the sash was shut down when you went out? - Yes, as sure as you are there; the sash will not stay up, it has no pullies, it had fallen again, and a pane was taken out of the side; there was a piece of paper where one of the panes was broke, he broke this paper and took out this pane, and got in himself, I found my tea-chest on a chair, removed from where it stood, and the jack weight was taken off the jack and tied up in a towel, on the floor, there was a silver watch taken off the nail, and put on again, moved from one end of the nail, to the other, the prisoner confessed it was taken off.</p>
               <p>When did you see it before? - Only half an hour before, when I went out.</p>
               <p>Had you taken such particular notice of it that you can tell on what part of the nail it was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you before he confessed it, upon your oath, observe that the watch had been moved? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So that you could have sworn that, if he had not confessed? - Yes, the prisoner was in the room, I caught hold of him, and called for assistance, there was a pin that fastened the sash that was taken out, no pane was broke, I had papered it up, and that paper was broke, I got assistance and took the boy into custody, I had seen him before in the lane, I did not know to whom he belonged, when I went in I saw nobody in the room; I went up stairs and found the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Do you know his age? - He said he was fourteen.</p>
               <p>Was the tea-chest new? - No an old one.</p>
               <p>What was the jack weight worth? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Or the towel? - Of no great value.</p>
               <p>When you caught the boy did you say any thing to him about being hanged for this, or threaten, or promise him? - No Sir, I did not promise him any thing, I only asked him what he deserved; and he was carried before the justice the same evening.</p>

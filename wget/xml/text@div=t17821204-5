If you expect to gain any favour from the Court, or any mitigation of your punishment by pleading guilty, you will be disappointed; the Court will not consider such a plea as any extenuation of your crime, but you will be equally liable to be he executed, as if you had been tried and convicted; therefore it is in your favour, rather to take the chance of trial, and this your plea will not be at all to your prejudice." -</p>

               <p>Court. When did you see the things last? - I saw some of the things mentioned in the indictment a few days before, they were kept in drawers, some of which were locked, and some not; and I locked my door in the evening of the same day: when I found I could not get in, it rather surprized me, and by pushing open the door further, I saw a hole in the cieling where somebody had been in at the top of the house, and chairs and trunks were put to keep the door fast that nobody might come in; I was in the room about dark that night, and there was no hole then; when I got into the room, I called up my wife, and I got up through the hole that had been made in the cieling, upon the tiles, and sent for a neighbouring man a Bricklayer, and we went upon the house, and upon the next house but one; we found nobody on the house: when we had been upon the top of the house about ten minutes, two men came and knocked at the door, and asked if we had not been robbed, I said yes.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you see the prisoner? - I saw the prisoner after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Court. What conversation had you with the prisoner? - He was crying and confessed the matter, this he had done before I was sent for.</p>

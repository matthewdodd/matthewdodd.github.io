                  </hi>. I am a driller, and lived in December at 1, England Cottages, Millwall—I had known James Barber and his wife—I had worked with him, but was not doing so at that time—on Saturday, 3d December, I left off work about 4 o'clock, at the shipbuilding yard, Millwall Iron-works—I had a glass of wine, but that was all the drink I bad that night or day—I saw Mr. Barber about 11 o'clock opposite the Glengall public-house, which is about one hundred yards from where I live, and the same distance from his own house—I went looking for two men at the club-house, and afterwards went to Barber's lodging—it was then getting on for 12 o'clock—I saw Mrs. Barber at 4, Cahir-street, and walked with Mr. and Mrs. Barber to Mrs. McGeehan's, in Kingsbridge-place—we found a person named</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100004"></xptr>
               <p>Conolly there, who also was known to me—I remained there twenty minutes or half an hour, and left to go home about half—past 12, as near as I can guess—Mr. and Mrs. Barber left at the same time, but not Conolly—we had to pass the turning to Kingsbridge—place to go to their house—there is a pillar post letter—box at the corner of the turning to England Cottages—it is just opposite the Ironmongers' Arms—I walked with them as far as the pillar post letter—box, and then stopped to shake hands—I noticed two policemen standing on the pavement opposite the pillar letter—box—one of them, the prisoner, crossed the road alone, came up to me, looked me in the face, gave me a chuck in the neck, and said, "What are you doing here at this time of night?"—there had been no noise or disturbance on our part to call for his interference, I was only shaking hands—Barber said that if he was doing his duty, or something like that, he would not carry on like that—he turned me rather round—the other man then came across the street, and Mrs. Barber shouted, "James, run"—they were in contact when the other man, William Brown, lauded on the pavement, and as soon as she shouted the other policeman said, "I will soon do for you, "and struck her on the temple with his baton—he was tried in the other Court for that assault—I caught Mrs. Barber in my arms, and the blood came on to my sleeve—Barber ran five or six steps backwards, as far as the dealer's shop, and the two policemen were making at him—they had their truncheons in their hands—I saw him run away and the constables after him—Mrs. Barber shouted a second time, "James, run, or they will murder you"—he ran, and the two policemen made after him, one saying to the other, "Now, mate, stick to me"—I went into my house, and Mrs. Barber rushed out of my arms and said she would follow James, or they would murder him—after I had been indoors Rome time, I went out to Mrs. McGeehan's—it had just gone 1 o'clock when I got there—I found Mr. and Mrs. Barber there—I noticed that Mr. Barber's hand was swelled—I think it was his left hand—he said that be should—not be able to work—his watch was broken and the—hands wore bent, it had stopped at four minutes to 1 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first go to the police—court as a witness for Barber to make this charge of assault on his wife; was it a week or a fortnight after? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think about a week afterwards—it might be a fort—night—I cannot tell you to a day—Mrs. Barber was the first person to ask me to go to the police—court; but she was not able to go, and Mrs. McGeehan took it in hand and went—when I went to see Mrs. Barber she was in Mrs. McGeehan's parlour, in bed—that is about five minutes' walk from her own lodgings—I never heard that there was a charge by the police against Barber for assaulting Brown, till Barber came from North fleet the second time, and he said that he believed the police were looking after him—that was a week or a fortnight afterwards—it was a week afterwards that he came to his wife, who was in bed in Mrs. McGeehan's parlour—he was in the kitchen when ho told mo ho believed the police were after him—that is not on the same floor as the kitchen, you go down lower to it—I do not think Mrs. McGeehan was in the kitchen—Conolly was there and one of Mrs. McGeehan's sons—Barber said that he would take proceedings against the police, and I said that it was very proper, for they deserved it—he said, Mrs. Barber asked mo to go as a witness the next day after it happened, but he did not follow it up, because he was afraid of losing his situation—no nobleman's name was mentioned on any occasion in my presence till it came before that gentleman—I never spoke to the Marquis of Townshend till this case came on, and then he only asked me how I was on two occasions,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186504100005"></xptr>
               <p>but said nothing about thin matter—he has never paid me a shilling—I know no more who is going to pay me than the man in the moon—I heard that Lord Townshend took the case up, but whether he is finding the funds I do not know—I had not seen Clares or Brown before, to my knowledge—I saw them next on the day we went to the police-court, and they knew me very well.</p>

Humphreys and Morgan were acting in the matter at that time—Barber got a summons, but I did not—I did not go to the police-court more than once about a summons for myself—it was after Barber had been tried that I first knew the Marquis by sight, and Brown was tried the next day—I had given evidence in Barber's case—I have had 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether from the Court—I lost about four shillings a day every day I was there—that was more than five days; nearly three times five.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boiler-maker—in December last, I lived with my wife at 4, Cahir-street, Mill wall—I worked at Northfleet, at Mr. Charles Mare's yard, contracting for the caulking of ships, with my mate—on Saturday, 3d December, I left work about 4 o'clock—I had some men at work under me, and went to a public-house to pay them on leaving work—I had a glass of sherry to drink there, and before I left Northfleet I went to the Dover Castle, the club-house of the boiler-makers—I there had a bottle of ginger-beer—I am a teetotaller, and had no intoxicating liquor that night—when I got home, at half-past 4 o'clock, I saw Mrs. Barber—I, had a furnished room taken for her at Northfleet, as she was in bad health;—she came up with me to Millwall—we got there between 7 and 8—we left when the 6 o'clock train arrived, and went to 4, Cahir-street—I cannot say how long I remained there with my wife—I had a little business to transact, and went out to look for three men in the employment—I saw Patrick Smith at a little after 8—it was about half an hour after my tea—he was coming down past the Glengall—I then went home and saw my wife, and in three quarters of an hour or an hour left the house with Smith—we went down to his house, and I think he went in—I then went into the Ironmongers' Arms to look for two men to go to employment in North-fleet, and some more men came and asked for me—I then went home and found my wife there, and Mrs. Mc Geehan—Mr. Cannon is the landlord of the house—he was not there, and I do not think Mrs. Reid was there—Smith came to the house after I went there, and my wife and I, Mrs. McGeehan, and Smith went out, and walked down to Mrs. McGeehan's, No. 8, Kingabridge-place—no one else was there but Mrs. McGeehan and Conolly, my mate—we were consulting there about a little affair for an hour and a half or thereabouts—Smith and my wife came out with me, leaving Conolly behind—it was then between 12 and 1 o'clock—we had to cross the end of the street in which Smith lives, to go home—when we got to the pillar letter-box we stopped—we were quite sober, and there was not the slightest noise made by me or my wife—I noticed two police-constables on the other side of the street, the prisoner was one, he crossed over, looked in Patrick Smith's face and hit him in the neck with his</p>

               <p>hand—I could not catch the words he said as I am a little deaf, but it was something about the night, and he struck him on the face with his open hand—I told him he was not doing his duty or he would not do that, as he was a peaceable, quiet man—he turned about and struck me on the mouth and I struck him back again, and gave it him very hot too, and he deserved it and no mistake—the other policeman then came across the street, that was William Brown, who was tried here in January and got fourteen days. (<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 233)—he bad his truncheon drawn and made at me—my wife told me to run or they would kill me—Brown then stepped past Smith and struck her on the temple deliberately with that baton that he carries—before I began to run I went four or five yards backwards, facing the two policemen—I was fighting a good retreat for four or five yards—I was not slack—I ran straight home for fear they should get me down and give me a benefit—Mr. Cannon, the master of the house let me in, and ray wife came in about three or four minutes after<lb></lb>wards dabbled all over with blood, her shawl and her chemise—the blood had been flowing from her temple—she told me to go for a doctor—she was bleeding like a cow which had been stuck—I took a stick and left the house, the policemen were then close to the door with their truncheons in their hands—they made blows at me and struck me over the kidneys and broke my watch—the man on the left-hand side, Brown, struck me also and I struck him—I was not three seconds from him; I had to defend myself, I let no man strike me and I not strike him back—I knocked him down and he richly deserved it—he got two months' for it and I got fourteen days—I think the prisoner made the best of his way out of my road in case he should get the same—I then went to Mrs. McGeehan's, Kingsbridge-place, my wife came there shortly afterwards—after I ran away the first time I saw Patrick Smith at Mrs. McGeehan's—I was excited and do not know what time that was—my watch was going before the blow which broke the glass, it could not have gone after the glass was broken for the bands and face were knocked in; she stopped at four minutes to one—she was a six-guinea watch—I think Patrick Smith, when he was at Mrs. McGeehan's, saw the hand on which I had the blow—I went with my wife in a cab to Poplar hospital and she was taken back to Mrs. McGeehan's in a cab—I left her there and went back on Sunday morning to my work at Northfleet, she was very bad at that time—Mr. Serjeant dressed the cut but she was under medical treatment before that—some time in the follow<lb></lb>ing week I think, I went with Mr. Morgan to the police-court to get a summons on the part of my wife against the police-constable—I did not get one and I did not go again—I do not know whether a summons was granted after Sir R. Mayne had been written to—next time I went to the police-court I was examined as a witness on a charge against Brown for assaulting my wife, after which I was charged with assaulting Brown—this man did not know me till he saw me going up to give evidence for my wife and then he came forward against me and charged me, but I own to it I do not deny what I have done—I had had no words or quarrel with my wife that evening—I never followed her with a stick or a poker, threatening to strike her with it—she said nothing in my hearing about "You murdering brute"—that is a fabrication these gentlemen have made up themselves—I was too kind to my wife to quarrel with her, for she was not in a state of health to quarrel with, she was under Mr. Debenham—I did not strike her at all—I braver heard that I had struck her till the trial at this Court.</p>

I live at 6, Mornington-road—I am traveller to Mr. Miller, a wine-merchant—on the evening of 3d December, I had been round Blackwall, Poplar, and Limehouse, on business—I met my brother and some friends—we went to the Kingsbridge Arms—I heard 1 o'clock go, and I should think it was eight or nine minutes past 1 when I left—I had occasion to pass Cahir-street, and when I was on the left-hand side of it I heard a female screaming "Murder!"—it was then from fifteen to twenty minutes past 1—I spoke to a man—I said, I was afraid there was murder going on—he said it was only some drunken quarrel—I said, "I am going to Potter's Ferry, and will look out for a policeman"—I found one just by the steps of Mare's Iron-works—I made a communication to him—he went off towards Cahir-street, and I went to Potter's Ferry—that is the man (Brown)—I am here in consequence of a bill which I saw in a shop in Millwall, requiring the witness who spoke to the policeman.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is that one of the bills? (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I saw two or three of them in shop windows—I first saw them I should think about 14th or 15th February—the man I spoke to was aroused by the screams, the same way as I was—he was dressed in a fustian jacket; he was standing in the street—I did not go with him because I was very late—I have been in Mr. Miller's service six years;—I read the newspapers very little—I had no curiosity to look in the papers to see if anything had happened—I did not hear of Brown having assaulted Mrs. Barber till I saw the bills, and then 1 went to Mr. Leet, the solicitor—I am in Mr. Miller's employ now—I had not seen my brother for a month before, and have not seen him since—his employment now is at Islington—I have not seen any of the persons I saw that night—my brother and my aunt were at the Kings-bridge Arms—they would know the night as well as me; they are not here—seeing the bill, called it to my recollection that I had heard a cry of murder—I was not taken to see Brown at all—I had never seen him before 3d December.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What enables you to fix upon this as happening on 3d December? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had to meet my brother; he wanted to sell me some<lb></lb>thing, and he wanted some money for the Monday—it was a case of distress—he had a large family, and he had some tickets of a photographic machine which he wished to sell me, and on 6th December I purchased the tickets of him—I paid him on the 6th; the tickets were in the Kent-road, at Mr. Wade's, a pawnbroker's—I have not brought it with me—I know it was Saturday the 3d, and not Saturday the 10th, because my brother wrote to me, and I have the letter—I have not brought it with me—I hardly know whether I have it now, because I have had to remove—I know it was the 3d, because I have never been so late and had so much trouble-in getting a boat—I am positive as to the date—I have not the pawn-tickets here, but I have bad to make an affidavit as to the date, because it was past the time, so that impresses the date on my mind.</p>

                  </hi>. I am divisional surgeon to the Police—I live at 101, East India-road—on Sunday morning, 4th December, about 4 o'clock, Brown came to me—I found him suffering from two lacerated wounds on the scalp; they were in the same line, but there was a piece of sound inte<lb></lb>gument between the two—he had lost a good deal of blood—the edge of a poker would produce such a wound.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector</hi>.) On the morning of 4th December, at a few minutes after 3 o'clock, I saw Brown and the prisoner at Poplar police-station—they made a complaint to me which I put down in the book before 6 o'clock, and made a report to my superintendent at once—in consequence of that charge I went to 4, Cahir-street, with Gower and the prisoner and another officer—I asked which was Barber's room, and went into it in con<lb></lb>sequence of what Brown told me—I went to look for Barber—I found several spots of blood in the passage near the parlour-door down stairs—I asked Mrs. Reid how it came there—she said that Barber and his wife had been fighting—I have been in the police twenty-two years.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 372). I hzave been in the police eight and a half years, and acting sergeant for the last two years—on 4th December, I went with Allison to 4, Cahir-Street—I know William Brown, who was formerly in the force, and I know his beat—I had been round his beat that morning, and missed him from it—I met K 257 coming from the station; in conse<lb></lb>quence of what he told me I sent for my inspector—the door was opened by a young woman, and I saw Mrs. Reid there—I saw spots of blood in the passage—the inspector said, "Whose is that?"—Mrs. Reid said that Barber and his wife had been fighting—none of the people there made any com<lb></lb>plaint against any of the constables as to an attack having been made upon Mrs. Barber—I have known Brown about three years.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I accompanied Inspector Allison, Somers, and Clares to 4, Cahir-street, on 4th December—we arrived at about half-past 3 or 4 in the morning—the inspector discovered some blood, and said to Mrs. Reid, who was in the passage, "How did that blood come here?"—she said, "Barber and his wife have, been fighting"—the others left, and I remained by the inspector's orders to see whether Barber would return, and apprehend him for an assault upon the prisoner.</p>

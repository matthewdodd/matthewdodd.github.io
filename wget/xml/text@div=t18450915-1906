                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Rotherhithe. I met with the prisoner on the 27th of July, at the Windmill public-house, Lower-road, Deptford—I had seen her once before—I tapped at the window, called her in, and asked her to drink—we sat down till about ten o'clock—I then went with her towards home—I had my watch safe then—when I came back it was gone—I did not go with her into any house—I did not miss the watch exactly at the time I left her—I cannot; say when I missed it—I was rather the worse for liquor—she was sober for what I know—I could not swear whether I dropped it—I did not have it out after leaving the Wind<lb></lb>mill—I know I had it when I left there—I recollect seeing the chain as I came out.</p>

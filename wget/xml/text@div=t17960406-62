               <p>Court. Q. Did you do so that evening? - A. I did, there were a few articles of no great value that we don't lock up; I returned a little after nine o'clock, I knocked several times at the door, and could not get admittance; I then enquired of a person in the neighbourhood, if she had seen the servant; I have never seen her since, till she was apprehended; about eleven o'clock, I got two neighbours to force open the door; when I got in, I observed one of the covers of the shew-glass turned, and the side of it broke, and several articles, ear-rings and other things stolen; I then went to the jewel room, where I had hung the key of the iron closet, and unlocked it, and missed the diamond articles that I had locked up before I went out.</p>

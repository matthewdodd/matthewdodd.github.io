                  </hi>. I am the daughter of John Thomas, who keeps the Coach and Horses, in Broad-street, Lambeth. On the afternoon of 6th Nov., between two and three o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another man at our house—the prisoner came to the kitchen-door and asked if my father was at home—I said he was not in the way—he went into the tap-room, the floor of which forms the ceiling of the cellar—I did not see the other man go in—I afterwards heard a dancing and great noise in the tap-room—I sent the potman to see what it was—he called me, and I looked in and saw a hole made in the tap-room floor—I did not say anything, but retired to the bar and watched—the noise ceased—I then went to the door, and found it either fastened or some one standing against it inside—my father returned about this time—I then went to the street-door and saw the prisoner running up the street with the brandy in his hand—I had not seen him go out—I ran after him, caught him, and brought him back—he said, "It is all right, I have only got a drop of beer"—my father came up, and he was taken.</p>

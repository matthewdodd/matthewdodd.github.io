            . This receipt is the prisoner's handwriting - it is dated the 28th of April, 1829, for 21l. 17s. 6d. - the prisoner's salary was 200l. a year; he was paid a little over that - on one occasion he applied to me for some money, and I made the observation that he had overdrawn his account; he acknowledged that he had; he never claimed, as his right, more than 200l. a year; he should have accounted to me for this 21l. 17s. 6d. on the same day, but he has never accounted to me for it - I have examined my books; in the next balance-sheet, which the prisoner rendered at Midsummer, 1829, he has charged Messrs. Nelson, Adams, and Nelson with 54l. 1s. 6d., which includes this sum of 21l. 17s. 6d. - here is an account in the ledger of 104l. 1s. 6d. due from them, and against it 50l., paid on account, which left the balance 54l. 1s. 6d.; the items are partly in my writing, and the casting up is the prisoner's - he stated, in October, that he had received the 54l. 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever speak to him about this specific sum? A. No; I got this 54l. from the ledger, which is taken from the journal; the latter part of which has been kept by Mr. Thomas Weston.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then that balance was made by the prisoner? A. Yes, from the book.</p>

            . I am executor under Mr. Weston's will. I had a conversation with the prisoner about deficiencies in the accounts - there was a long list of sums stated to be deficient, amounting in the whole to near 1500l. - this is the list; I saw it produced to the prisoner, and in it there is "Messrs. Nelson, Adam, and Co. 54l. 1s. 6d.;" I can tell by the ledger that this included the 21l. 17s. 6d. - the account is made up of five items, which amount to 104l. 1s. 6d., and on the other side, in the prisoner's hand-writing, is "October 20, 1827, cash 50l.," leaving a balance of 54l. 1s. 6d. - his salary was 200l. a year, and his account is in this book, in his own hand-writing, from which it appears that he has sometimes over-drawn his salary; I think in April last he applied to me for an advance of salary, and stated that 200l. a year was not enough for him to maintain his family - he certainly never said he had a right to more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you tell that this sum of 21l. 17s. 6d. is part of the 54l. 1s. 6d.? A. Yes, because the two last items in the account amount to 21l. 17s. 6d., which are on the 8th and 10th of December, and in teh October before he had received the 50l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When was this meeting with respect to the deficiencies? A. I think the last week in last October - he was desired to explain his accounts.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did he explain? A. Yes; he was 1476l. deficient in his accounts, which he explained by his having been sixteen or eighteen years in the house, and considering himself entitled to 300l. a year.</p>

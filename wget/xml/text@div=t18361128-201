                  </hi>. I am a plumber. On the 11th of November, about 5 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop with some pipe—he asked if I would buy it—I asked him if it was his own—he said yes, and he wanted to sell it, as his wife given herself up to drink lately, and had made away with some of it, he thought he had better turn the rest into money—he said he had had it by him some time, and that he had been at work for a former master who gave him this lead instead of wages, as he was thinking of having water laid on at a future time—he told me where he lived, and that he worked for Mr. Oliver, on Black<lb></lb>health-hill—on the Wednesday following I heard Mr. Oliver had lost some lead, and as it was similar to this I gave information.</p>

That on the Time mentioned in the Indictment, Henry Griffin and his Wife being in Shoreditch, at the House of Samuel Orchard, the Deceas'd, 'till after eleven a-Clock at Night, and they having at Haggerstone, Thomas Dillo, Thomas Batten, and Samuel Orchard, agreed to bear them Company over the Fields to <placeName id="t17241014-17-crimeloc86">Haggerstone</placeName>

That as they were going along they met with William Pritchard, Thomas Pritchard, and William Risdel, who gave them some affronting Language, calling them Taylors, and King John's Men, and Risdel very rudely and violently would kiss Mrs. Griffin, which they permitted for Peace Sake, and parted: And afterwards they heard them say, as they were a little Way from them, What had they three to do with the Woman? they would take her from them and came to them again, and would have Mrs. Griffin from them, who was then holding by the Deceased's Arm, and did violently pull her away, though they told them she was Mr. Griffin's Wife, That she not being willing to be carried away, was knock'd down; and Mrs. Griffin depos'd, That it was Risdel that knock'd her down, giving her several Blows on the Face and Head with his Hand, which hurt her so that she could not bear to touch her Head with a Comb for a considerable Time: But her Husband getting her away, while Thomas Batten was fighting with the Prisoners Pritchard and Risdel, she could give no Account of the killing of Orchard. Thomas Dillo depos'd, That upon this Violence offered to Mrs. Griffin, the Prisoners fell upon them: That the Deceased had a Stick in his Hand, but one of them got hold of it, and would have pull'd it out of his Hand, upon which he assisted Orchard, to pull the Stick, and it broke, and then he ran away from the Prisoners; but they followed him, and Pritchard stopp'd him, and said he should not go, unless he gave him a shilling. That he was running to the Town to get Assistance, for one of the Pritchards and Risdel were fighting with Thomas Batten. That then they return'd into the Fray, and that was near John Darby's Door, who, upon an Outcry (as he supposes) that they had made of Murder, was come out in his Shirt, and was looking over his Gate with a Stick in his Hand. That then he came to the Fray, and stood by, while one of the Pritchards and Risdel had Thomas Batten down on the Ground. That he desir'd him, Darby, not to make any Party, but to make Peace, that they might go Home about their Business. That the Deceased was standing by him, giving no Provocation, not fighting, and that John Darby with his Stick knock'd the Deceased down, and he died in about Half an Hour: That having apprehended him, he said he hoped he had not kill'd him; but being carried to the Deceased, and seeing him dead, he kneel'd down, and Kill'd him, saying, Carry me where you please, I am willing to die for him. Thomas Batten depos'd the same, as to the Circumstances before the Beginning of the Fray, and Occasion of it; but as to the killing of Orchard, he being upon the Ground, and Risdel and one of the Pritchards fighting with him, he could give no Account of that. Henry Griffin depos'd much to the same Effect, saving that he having been to get his Wife away to his Lodgings, return'd back, and coming in Sight of the Prisoners, he saw John Darby give the Deceased the Fatal Blow, who was at that Time standing still, and not fighting. The Prisoners Risdel and Pritchard in their Defence pleaded, as to the Beginning of the Fray, That meeting the Prosecutor, Witnesses, and Deceased, about twelve a-Clock at Night with a Woman, suspected her to be an ill Woman, and having been drinking, there happen'd to be some Words pass, which proceeded to Blows, the Prosecutors being the Aggressors, and as for Mrs. Griffin's being knock'd down, Risdel deny'd his striking her, but said she might possibly be push'd down in the Fray. John Darby pleaded, That he knew not the Deceased, and therefore had no Malice against him. They all called Persons to their Reputation, who gave them the Character of honest, laborious Person in their Calling of <rs id="t17241014-17-deflabel87" type="occupation">Brickmaking</rs>

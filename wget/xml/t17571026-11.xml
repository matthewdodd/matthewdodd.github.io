            . I saw the prisoner come out of our warehouses on the key. I observ'd his cloaths, and thought he look'd stiff and round. I call'd him, and he came to me. I search'd him, and found both ginger and sugar upon him. I ask'd him how he came by it He said it was the first time, and that he would do so no more if we would let him go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he employ'd there by you?</p>
               <p>Pyke. No, he was not's the porters employ people, he might be employ'd by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you belong to the key?</p>
               <p>Pyke. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part about him did you find the sugar?</p>
               <p>Pyke. He had seven or eight pockets about him, properly fix'd for that purpose, and there was sugar or ginger in them all.</p>

            . I am trusted with merchants goods at Summer's Key, in the warehouses; the prisoner was detected by Mr. Pyke, and had seven or eight pockets in which there was sugar and ginger.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose goods were in the place the prisoner came out of?</p>
               <p>Oxley. There were goods belonging to several merchants.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any goods from thence ?</p>
               <p>Oxley. We have lost goods several times, but could not charge the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How much sugar and ginger was found upon him?</p>
               <p>Oxley. I can't say that, it was not weigh'd; there was the quantity laid in the indictment, or more. I saw the prisoner down on his knees to Mr. Pyke, saying it was the first time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>These parcels of sugar and ginger I pick'd up from off the ground, before I went up into the warehouses to work. I went up with the other men and came down with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who employ'd you?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know, nor whom I was at work for; I never work'd along with them before.</p>

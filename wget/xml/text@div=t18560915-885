                  </hi>. I keep a chandler's shop, in Lambeth-street, White-chapel. On Friday morning, 5th Sept., at 1 o'clock, my shop was safe—there were two raw hams and one cooked one there, also some tea, tobacco,</p>

               <p>and the contents of the till—two of the hams have since been shown to me—about 6 o'clock in the morning I found the passage from my shop door to the house blocked up with butter tubs—the shop is part of the house—the door was locked, and the tubs placed against it—it is the side door, which comes from the shop into the house—the street door was open—it was fastened securely at 1 o'clock—the bar of the front shop win<lb></lb>dow was strained, the shutter taken down, and a large square of glass removed, so that any man could get in—my house is in the pariah of St. Mary, Whitechapel—I have not found the other things; those I have lost are worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the prisoner at all.</p>

On Friday morning, 5th Sept., at a quarter past 3 o'clock, I saw the prisoner, in Fashion-street, Spitalfields, carrying these two hams on his shoulder—I stopped him, and asked him where he had got them from—he said that he had brought them from his father, Mr. Nutter, of No. 7, Bell-lane, and when he got to the station he said that he gave three half crowns each for them; he afterwards said that he had been in the country to see his friends, and they had made him a pre<lb></lb>sent of them—I went to No. 7, Bell-lane, but could not find his father.</p>

               <p>resist me when I went up to him—I at once took him—he was confused when he told me about his father—I only found these two hams upon him—he was searched after he was charged—Bell-lane is 300 or 400 yards from where I saw him—it was not light, hut there were gas lights—the prisoner did not tell me the name and address of the friend in the country whom he had got the hams from, therefore I could not inquire into that—he was going a cross road from Brick-lane, which leads right from Whitechapel.</p>

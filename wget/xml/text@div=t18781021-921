                  </hi>. On 8th April last a post letter was sent to my house, 22, Haslemere Road, and on that night I heard a violent knocking at my door, I was undressed—I looked out of my window and saw the defendant—on the following morning I found a bill like this one underneath my knocker, and also under every knocker—on 16th May my attention was called to a similar bill posted at Fenning's Wharf, where I am employed—I applied for a warrant at the Lambeth police-court, or 11th April, and since the 16th May I have been frequently annoyed by the prisoner—the insinuations of this bill are false.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I did not know you lived at 16, Cornwall Road—my wife saw you—I brought an officer six months ago—your brother was charged at Guildhall by me, and convicted for assaulting me and my wife—I have not accused another man—your brother at Waltham stow in February, 1877, tried to get your foreman to leave—a van of furniture was stopped at 12 at night by the police—I have not left my</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine driver—on 16th May last I saw the prisoner post this bill on the wall at Fenning's Wharf, where I work, between 8.30 and 9.30 a.m.—this is the bill marked B—I tore it down, this piece first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Pisoner</hi>. I can read the bill—some thick liquid like gum was on it, not paste.</p>

I received two bi Is in an envelope by post—I don't known where they came from—I know a butcher named Mumford who offered a reward verbaily and in writing for the prosecutor's address—this is the bill—he is one of the creditors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner</hi>. These bills came from Walthamstow from the creditors, and not from me at all. The prosecutor runs away from his creditors, and he wants me out of the way while he shifts again. I work from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., an could not have posted the bill, and there is no gum nor paste on it. I have had witnesses here, but they are business men and could not wait.</p>

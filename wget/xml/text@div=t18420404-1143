On the evening of the 31st of March, about half-past seven o'clock, I was going along Fenchurch-street, and felt something at my coat-pocket—I immediately turned round and found the prisoner behind me—I caught hold of him, and charged him with having my handkerchief—he said he had not—Jones was just behind me, and said the prisoner had just dropped the handkerchief—I saw it on the ground, about a yard and a half from me—I gave the prisoner into custody with it—he begged to be let off several times.</p>

I am a porter, and live in Colchester-street, White-chapel.

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">smith and engineer, No. 90 1/2, St. Giles's.</hi> In Oct., 1842, I advertised a cabriolet for sale, and I believe on the 8th of Oct, the prisoner called on me—I told him the price of the cabriolet was fifty guineas—after some conversation he agreed to give 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—he said it was not convenient to pay the money then, but he would give me a good reference—I said, if he would give me a good reference I would take a bill—he referred me to Hodges and Parker, bankers, No. 10, Austin-friars—he pulled out his card, which I produce, and at the same time he dropped a loose check out of his pocket-book, similar to one which I produce—I told him I never heard of the name of Hodges and Parker—he said they were merchants and private bankers, and that it was not an uncommon thing for merchants to be private bankers—he said he would call again in the course of the day—after he left I went to No. 10, Austin-friars, and saw the names of Hodges and Parker on the door outside—I saw a person, who appeared to be a clerk, in the outer office—I asked to see one of the partners, and I saw a person who said he was a partner—I do not know who that was—I do not know Parker's person—I do not think it was Hodges—I showed him Mr. Green's card, and told him he had given reference to them—he said that Mr. Green kept an account with them, and it was all regular—I asked, if they had a cabriolet to sell worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, whether they would trust him? and he said most certainly they would—I then returned home—soon after the prisoner called again—I told him they gave him a most excellent character, but that the person I saw was a very young man, and asked him for a reference to some tradesman whom he dealt with—he laughed, and said, "Well, I will give you my coach-builder, Mr. Charles Thompson, of Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square"—I went there, and Mr. Thompson said Mr. Green's family had dealt with him for a long time, and were highly respectable; that his father had been a banker at York, or in Yorkshire, and he was then about selling Mr. Green a second-hand cabriolet himself—I then let him have the cabriolet, and he gave me this 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; bill, drawn by myself, payable two months after date at Messrs. Hodges, Parker, and Co., No. 10, Austin-friars, and accepted by himself—I paid the bill away, and it was re<lb></lb>turned to me, dishonoured, by Mr. Corbyn—I sent my clerk to Hodges and</p>

               <p>Parker's, I did not go myself—two or three days before the bill became due I accidentally met the prisoner in Holborn—he did not know me, but I made myself known to him—he then asked whether I had heard of the failure of the house of Hodges, Parker, and Co.—I do not know what I said, for I had been then informed that they were a gang of swindlers—I did not tell him so—two or three days after the bill had become due the prisoner called on me, and offered me a bill on Captain Farquharson or Ferguson—I asked him for payment of my bill, and he offered me this other bill instead—I asked him to leave it with me, that I might inquire into the character of it, but he said, "No"—I did not take it—I have never got my cabriolet again, or a farthing for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> When the cabriolet was advertised, whose property was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My own, entirely—I do not know the meaning of a <hi rend="italic">chaunt</hi>—it was not got up between Mr. Corbyn and myself, and advertised for our mutual benefit—I bought it of Mr. Large, of Queen-street—I do not think the check pro<lb></lb>duced is the one you dropped—you put it into your pocket-book again—I have a whole check-book here, which I got from the witness, Mrs. Jones, with various other papers—you left me your card, with "10, Essex-street, Strand," on it, I believe—the person I saw, who represented himself to be one of the firm of Hodges and Parker, was a tall young man, about twenty-five or twenty-six—he gave you a very good character, said you were very regular, kept a very good account there, and so on—I think he said you were the son of some great man at York, a banker, or something of that sort; and as for Mr. Parker, that he was the son of some great man at Bristol, or the West of England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Mr. Parker told you that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know Mr. Parker, or any of them—you did not refer to Mr. Thompson at the same time you referred to Hodges and Parker, but when I asked for a reference to some tradesman—Thompson gave you a very excellent character—he said you were about pur<lb></lb>chasing a cabriolet of him at a price considerably higher than mine, and you yourself told me that you were about purchasing a cabriolet of him, but that mine was better at 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; than his at 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I did not call on you in Essex-street—I told Mr. Corbyn to do so—you told me you wanted a Cla<lb></lb>rence for a friend, and I told Mr. Corbyn, thinking to do him a service, as I heard so good a character of you—Mr. Corbyn waited on you for an order for the Clarence—when you told me that Hodges and Parker had failed, you said it would seriously derange your affairs, but you would look in upon me, which you did, and offered me the bill on Captain Farquharson, payable at joint-stock bank, if I would give up my bill—it was a larger amount than my bill—I was to return the balance when the bill became due—you would not leave it for me to make inquiry respecting it—you spoke of leaving some wine warrants with me as security for the payment of the bill, but I thought they were like the bills, good for nothing, and I directly told you you were a swindler, and a gang of swindlers—I never saw Mr. Hodges or Mr. Parker driving about in the cabriolet, nor ever saw or heard it was in their pos<lb></lb>session.</p>

                  </hi>. I am agent and factor of Messrs. Rogers, cutlers, at Sheffield, and live in Hatton-garden—the prisoner called on me there with Parker, I think, in April, 1842—I have seen Parker repeatedly since—the pri<lb></lb>soner introduced him as Mr. Parker, of the firm of Hodges and Parker, No. 10, Austin-friars, and gave me a card, which I have not with me—he said they were young men, merchants, who had just commenced business, that they were persons of property and respectability, that they were large importers of brandies, and he thought they could sell a great many of our goods—I had</p>

               <p>known the prisoner about three years previously, by his having married into a very respectable family in Sheffield, and, consequently, I did not make the usual inquiries, which I otherwise should have done—I parted with the goods on the faith of his general character and respectability previously—we had executed an order for him three years previous, and it was regularly paid; in fact, I believe the goods he had on his marriage were all obtained in Shef<lb></lb>field, and paid for regularly—he was then living in Great Winchester-street, and paid me with a check, honourably and fairly—one part of these goods consisted of a case of seventeen or eighteen pairs of plated desserts—that order was given me by Green and Parker together, and they were to be sent to Austin-friars—he then gave an order for a quantity of ivory knives and forks, and razors, which I wrote for and executed—I took a porter with me, and delivered them in Austin-friars, on account of Hodges, Parker, and Co., not to the prisoner—he did not order anything on his own account—his name was not mentioned—this is the invoice—when I took the goods to Austin-friars, the prisoner was there, acting as one of the firm, indeed I sup<lb></lb>posed him to be the Co.—they were taking lunch together, which I did not like the look of—I stated to them at the time, that I expected cash on delivery—the clerk I saw said they always paid on the first Monday in the month—but when I called on the first Monday of the month, they said I was rather hard, in pressing for the whole amount of this invoice and the other, and they settled the small account, which I believe was about 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;, begging I would let this stand over till the first Monday of the next month—I think it was the first Monday in May that they paid me the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—the amount of the other account was between 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—the goods were sold at trade price, to sell again—they were supposed to be going to France—they had them at the regular merchant's price—if it had been, a regular mercantile transaction, I should have allowed them two months' interest, or taken a bill at two months, upon satisfactory reference—I received one letter from Parker, while at Austin-friars—I have it not here—I think I should know his hand<lb></lb>writing—I never saw Hodges—I believe he was here the Sessions before last, and was let out on his own recognizance, and is gone—the trial was put off then because we could not find Green, and now we cannot find Hodges—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I cannot swear to this handwriting—I do not know Parker's handwriting—I only had one letter from the firm—I never saw Parker write, or acted with him upon any letter I received—all the transaction I had with him in writing was the account, when they paid me the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—I have never received any money for the other goods—their clerk afterwards called, and told me they had absconded—I think they were broken up in the middle of May, 1842—the goods were ordered in the name of Hodges, Parker, and Co.</p>

Q.</hi> Does this bill of parcels contain an account of all the goods that were sold by you to Hodges and Parker? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe not—it is for the goods they have not paid for—the other one that you paid for was a sepa<lb></lb>rate bill of parcels, and they had a receipt—it was on the former bill that you called, and introduced Mr. Parker—you have got that—the one I have was found on the premises with other papers—it was positively stipulated that the goods should be sold for cash—you were present when I called, the first Monday in the month, and you said you thought I was very hard to wish it settled then, you knew our house was too respectable to mind a month's credit, and so on, and I let it be—the first parcel was delivered on the day you called, and the second parcel a few days after, and you thought it very hard I should include them—goods delivered after the first day of a month.</p>

Thompson—he said he should have either a dividend or money on his own or his wife's account on the 10th of Oct.—I said then he had better wait for the horse till the dividend became due—he said it was very necessary he should have it, as the Parliamentary Session was about to begin—I declined selling the horse without the money—he then gave me a reference to Hodges, Parker, and Co., his bankers, and gave me this check—I did not go there—a friend of mine, Mr. Benton, went to make inquiries, and, in consequence of what he told me, when the prisoner called again I told him I would take a bill upon Hodges and Parker backing it—he brought a bill to me, reporting that it was backed by them—I afterwards passed the bill to Mr. Benton—he returned it to me—I have not got it here—I have never been paid for the horse, and I have likewise refunded the money to Mr. Benton, 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., besides expenses—I never went myself to Hodges and Parker.</p>

About Dec, I called at Mr. Hodges', at No. 104, Guildford-street, about my father's bill—it is Dr. Hodges' dwelling, and has been for some years—I asked for Arthur Hodges, and saw him—I told him I had called in reference to the payment of my father's account—he said Mr. Parker was not in town, but would be shortly in the receipt of his dividend, when he would be at his hotel, and would no doubt pay me—I asked him for Parker's address, and he could not give it me, which I said I thought was rather odd—he said he did not know where he was—I then went away—he did not tell me where his hotel was—I did not ask him—indeed I was pretty sure he was deceiving me, and did not go further with my questions—I saw it was a bad business.</p>

               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>
               <p>Chesterman. I am twenty-five years of age: I was coming up the Old Bailey, about half an hour after eleven at night, on the 18th of this instant:

               <p>Q. When had you seen the half crowns last?</p>
               <p>Chesterman. I had them just before I met with her: I said to her, she had robbed me; she denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the room, before you miss'd your money?</p>
               <p>Chesterman. About three or four minutes: I never was any where else but on the chair?</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched?</p>
               <p>Chesterman. No, I was afraid to search her; the other two prisoners were in the room with her; but I never left her till the time I took her to the watch-house: I would not let her go out of the room: I stood at the door: one of the women took me by the collar, and tore my shirt; and took up a pint pot, and swore she would knock me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the other women meddle with your pocket?</p>
               <p>Chesterman. No: they were not near it; they all three came at me at once; when I would not let them go out of the room, they knock'd my hat into a tub of water.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your half crowns again?</p>
               <p>Chesterman. No, I never did: when I went to call the watch, while one of the women had me by the collar, the other went to pull me from the window.</p>

               <p>We all three buy old cloaths together: I was coming along; the man asked me what I had got in my apron, and wanted me to go along with him and drink: I said no, I would not drink any thing: he said it was a very cold night, and he would give me a draught of purl; he gave this young woman three shillings, (meaning one of her fellow-prisoners) and they were on the bed together, and he was to stay all night with her for that money; but she said he should not stay, without he made her a present of some thing else: he wanted to sell me a pair of breeches: I had not a farthing of his money.</p>
               <p>Smith. I heard Edwards say she would give the man his money again; but one Foliot had got the money, and said she might go and be d - d, he would not part with it.</p>

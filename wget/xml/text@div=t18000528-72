             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a constable of the city of London: On Thursday, the 1st of May, I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of the Old Change in Cheapside, with a box; I observed the box and I observed him; I saw it very loosely corded, and the prisoner rather in a hurry; I looked and observed no direction upon the box at all; he was looking about him, and during that time a coach get off the box the kirb; before the coachman could get off the box the prisoner opened the door; he put the box in, and the coachman shut the door; he ordered the coachman to drive to Chesterfield-street, Marybone; I then went up to the door, and looked steadfastly at the prisoner; he seemed to be very much confused; the coach drove off into Newgate-street, opposite Bagnio-court; I saw him get off the seat; he told the coachman to draw up; upon that the coachman drew up on the off side; I then ran round the horses' heads, and before I had got to the coach-door he had opened it, and was going to get out; I immediately stopped him, and shoved him back into the coach; I then got into the coach; he asked me what I meant by that; I then told him I had a suspicion that that box was not honestly come by; I asked him if it was his own property; he said, no; I asked him whose it was, he said it belonged to a gentleman's servant at the other end of the town; that he had left it with him, and desired that he would take it to him; and not being satisfied in my own mind, I ordered the coachman to turn round and go to the Compter; the box was in the coach; I took him to the Compter; I there asked him for the key; he said there was no key, it was not locked; I asked him if he had any objection to my opening it; he said he had not; I opened the box, and found a bag containing a quantity of raw coffee; I took him before Alderman Newnham the next morning, and he remanded him till the Wednesday following; the bag was kept in the Alderman's room during that time, in the box; and it was advertised on the Wednesday; I saw the same box again, I sealed it up on the 1st of May; Mr. Cornish attended, and Mr. Brown, his clerk; they saw the bag, and he was fully committed; the bag and box were delivered to me, and I sealed it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. The first time you saw the prisoner was in the Old Change? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And because the man was in a hurry, going about his business, you took him to be a rogue, and stopped him? - A. So it turned out; I had some suspicions about it; I am a little judge of these things.</p>
               <p>Q. The box you spoke of had no directions upon it? - A. No. (Produces the property.)</p>
               <p>- BROWN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I have been clerk to Mr. Cornish between nine and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280074"></xptr>ten years; the prisoner was labourer to Mr. Cornish, and had access to all parts of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on the 1st of May, miss any coffee? - A. The 1st of May was a holiday.</p>
               <p>Q. The day before? - A. I cannot say; there had frequently been coffee missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bag? - A. The bag is inside out.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had better empty the coffee out.(The coffee was emptied out.) Do you see any mark there by which you can swear to it? - A. It is one of the bags that has been in the warehouse, and has been lodged there with coffee.</p>
               <p>Q. That is one of the bags that has been intrusted to Mr. Cornish's care? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. By what mark do you swear to this bag? - A. By the shipmark, E B, 250.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other mark? - A. Yes; an original mark of S H.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by the original mark? - A. It is a plantation-mark; the other is the ship's name, and the captain's name.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it every bag that comes from the plantation has the same mark? - A. I look upon it not; it may.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it is the custom of this plantation to mark with S H, or not? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Now the ship's mark - is not every bag brought by that ship marked with the same mark? - A. It ought.</p>
               <p>Q. How many does a ship bring? - A. Sometimes a ship does not bring more than ten, and sometimes five thousand.</p>
               <p>Q. If the ship comes over in 1798 or 1799, all the bags will be marked with the same mark? - A. Yes, if the ship's name and the captain's name is the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell whether this bag came over in 1798 or 1799? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to this bag being in the warehouses any time in April last? - A. Not without looking at the book; that bag might have been out of our warehouse six months ago; but still it has been the property of Mr. Cornish.</p>
               <p>Q. The business of Mr. Cornish, as a warehouseman, is this, that when coffee is landed, it is deposited in that warehouse for a certain time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At what period does it leave the warehouse, when it is sold to the grocer? - A. Yes; or being delivered for exportation.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that that bag was in Mr. Cornish's warehouse at any period of the year 1800? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was in Mr. Cornish's warehouse in any part of 1799? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath at what time? - A. I cannot exactly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see it in the warehouse? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did it first come in? - A. About a year and a half ago.</p>


               <p>Q. Will you swear that it was not delivered? - A. If it was delivered property it must have been delivered for exportation, for it was prize coffee that was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that that bag was not delivered out of Mr. Cornish's warehouse last year? - A. I look upon that bag to be a bag that has been started, and put into casks; I can tell if I refer to my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Refer to your book then. (Produces his book.) Is that your day-book or your ledger? - A. It is my weighing-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these entries made from the weighings themselves? - A. After I weigh them I put them upon pieces of paper, and then copy them into the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are those pieces of paper? - A. Delivered to the broker.</p>
               <p>Q. Those pieces of paper then are the originals? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. This book is only a copy from those pieces of paper? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Then it is not evidence.</p>
               <p>Court. You can make it evidence if you chuse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. To shew your Lordship I am not afraid of the contents, I will examine to the book:</p>
               <p>Q. Now tell me what is that book? - A. The weighing-book.</p>
               <p>Q. According to this book, at what time was that bag emptied? - A. I cannot tell from that book.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time does it appear by that book that it was weighed off? - A. The 14th or 15th of March, 1799.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at the time it was weighed off, emptied? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that book afford you any further information upon the subject? - A. It does not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then can you now tell me if that bag was in Mr. Cornish's possession in December last? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. In November? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In October? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. How long it has been out of Mr. Cornish's possession you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Give me leave to ask whether bags that have been in Mr. Cornish's possession do not find their way on board ships and on board lighters? - A. Yes, for the purpose of mending other bags; the prisoner himself has taken bags from the warehouse for that purpose, by my order.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the bags at any time become your perqui<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180005280075"></xptr>site? - A. No, unless I purchased any for my own use.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear positively that you never purchased that identical bag? - A. I am certain I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are bags never left at the public-house, the Friars, near the warehouse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are bags of this sort ever sent out of the warehouse after they become Mr. Cornish's property in overtakers? - A. Yes, but they have a private mark put upon them; the mark of those packages which have been started.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Has this bag that mark? - A. No, it has no mark but the original mark.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no mark upon that bag which denotes it ever to have been the property of Mr. Cornish? - A. There is not.</p>

               <p>Q. What ship did that come by? - A. The Eagle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the coffee which came by that ship come into the possession of Mr. Cornish? - A. Some of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the ship contain? - A. To the best of my recollection sixty hogsheads, and about five hundred bags came to our warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear there were no other bags that came in that ship that went to some other warehouse with that mark upon it? - A. I am almost sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible that you can know? - A. It is very seldom that it goes to two different persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know how many of those five hundred bags you had delivered out of your warehouse before the end of the last year? - A. I do not think there were any remaining at that time; this identical bag I can remember being started by the number; I only know that from my book.</p>
               <p>Q. Shew me where it appears in the book? - A. I can shew it by a memorandum from the day-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the day-book here? - A. No; it was started on the 15th of March, 1799.</p>
               <p>Q. And when that bag went out of the warehouse after, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never know an instance of a bag going out of your warehouse fairly, without a mark upon it? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they never given to the Custom-house officers to make aprons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor to the Excise officers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never given them yourself for that purpose? - A. I cannot recollect any such thing having been at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. I understand you, that this bag you know from the circumstance of its being a part of a parcel of eighty that were started? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had gone out of your warehouse then, would it have gone fairly? - A. It could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it any such private mark as it would have, if it was to get to an overtaker? - A. It has no private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. If bags were given, would they be given with raw coffee in it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that coffee the same sort that you had in your warehouses in April and May last? - A. I cannot swear to the coffee.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The first was a holiday, on every holiday we leave the doors open; on the 1st of May I went out, and took a pint of porter; I met with a person that had this load; when I have nothing to do, I do any thing for any body that will employ me; I met with a person who asked me to take this box in a coach to Chesterfield-street, Marybone, and having nothing to do, I took it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a Custom-house Officer; I had the care of Mr. Cornish's warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Under what locks are the warehouses kept? - A. The Custom-house, the Excise, and Mr. Cornish's locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it easy to pick those locks? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was taken on the 1st of May, were you there the day before he was taken up? - A. If the warehouse was open I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known any bag which had contained coffee to be sold? - A. Mr. Cornish's clerk frequently buys them for his use, or for overtakers.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known an instance of a bag being given? - A. As he buys many bags, I have myself asked him for a bag, and he has let me have it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of a bag of that sort? - A. I do not know, I suppose about three-pence or four-pence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It is not an easy thing to pick Custom-house locks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But it might be easy, perhaps, for any body to take coffee before they were locked up? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bag - is that a bag that was ever given to you, by Brown? - A. That I am sure I could not swear.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am a Custom-house Officer; I surveyed these warehouses during the holidays, the warehouses are locked up, and when they are open we are always there.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for any thing to be stolen out of the warehouses while you are upon your duty? - A. It may be.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for a man to take a large sack of coffee out without your observing it? - A. I should think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you or not, know whether bags are frequently given away by persons belonging to the warehouse? - A. Certainly they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a public-house called the Friars? - A. Yes, very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if Brown has ever left bags at that public-house? - A. I cannot say; I have had bags given me myself to make aprons of.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Though a diligent officer, you did not observe a man go out with a bag of coffee? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. But a servant in the house might have done so, without your knowing it? - A. We always rub the men down.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a Custom-house officer; I survey the warehouses of Mr. Cornish; there is always one officer in the warehouse continually; when we go, we lock it up with three locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you at all be surprised to hear that a man had escaped with sixty pounds weight of coffee in his breeches-pocket? - A. He could not carry one pound without being discovered.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it possible for the prisoner then to have carried out that quantity of coffee without being derected? - A. Impossible.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were you at the warehouse the day before the 1st of May? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that, recollect yourself? - A. Every day the warehouse has been open I have been there.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, were you there upon the 30th of April? - A. I cannot rightly tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the 30th of April, if you were not there, any body might have taken out a bag of coffee? - A. But the locks are always locked when we go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear, that on that day the warehouses were locked with locks upon them, and that you saw it? - A. We always six the locks when we go away.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I am an Excise-Officer; for the last fourteen months, I have not been absent a day from these warehouses; the prisoner at the bar worked in the warehouses; we always rub down the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible for any man to carry out sixty pounds of coffee without being discovered? - A. I should think not five.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner generally dressed? - A. In a short jacket, with an apron before him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever known bags given away? - A. Yes; the clerk was kind enough to make me a present of one, about a twelvemonth ago to make an apron, and since that, I made a request of another, and he let me have it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did he give you any coffee at the same time? - A. No, I did not ask him that question.</p>
               <p>Q. You rub down the men, you tell us? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 30th of April, 29th, or 28th, did you rub down, or make any enquiry of the prisoner, with respect to any thing he took out of the warehouse? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called nine witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Tipper.) Q. Was the bag inside out when you took it from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the mark could not be seen? - A. Yes; it was exactly in the same state in which I produced it here in the box.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). Sergeant Morgan and I received certain instructions with regard to the premises of Messrs. Hill, army tailors, and watched them in consequence—on three occasions I saw Chelraick leave and go to Laventhall's house, 8, West Street, Golden Square—on Thursday, 28th October, I followed Chelmick to her shop, where he handed her some silk—I ran in and said "I shall take you into custody for stealing this from your employer"—he said "I know I have done wrong; I can't think how I could have been so foolish"—I raised my umbrella to Morgan, who was outside, and he came in—I saw a quantity of silk in the back parlour on the floor, and some on a chair—I heard Laventhall say "That is all the silk I have had from Mr. Hill's; don't lock me up for the sake of my <hi rend="italic">two</hi> children"—she became very excited, kissed our hands, and begged not to be taken in custody—some more silk was found in a hamper under the bed—I found inside Chelmick's coat a large pocket—I afterwards searched his house.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). On the 28th October I was with Andrews watching the premises—on his giving me the signal I went into Laventhall's shop—I found a lot of silk on the floor in the back parlour, and when I told her I should charge her with receiving it she said "I have never seen the man before; this is the first time I have ever seen him, and 1 have not purchased what the officer has"—she fell on her knees, and begged me for the sake of her two children not to charge her—she brought me some more pieces of silk, and I found more in a basket under the bed—</p>

               <p>a female relative of hers was present during the whole of the search and conversation—Laventhall stated that the business was hers, but that her husband was at the Cape of Good Hope—she also said where the silk came from, and in Chelmick's presence—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the invoices I took away.</p>
               <p>

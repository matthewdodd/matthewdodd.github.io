                  </hi>. I live in Sutton-street, Soho, and am a draper's assist<lb></lb>ant—I first saw the prisoner on 10th April, about half-past eleven o'clock in the morning, in St. George's-road, opposite the Catholic Church—a person, who is not in custody, came and spoke to me—the prisoner was about twenty yards in advance; he pulled out his handkerchief and dropped his purse—I picked it up and called to him, "You have dropped your purse"—he said, "I am very much obliged to you; I would not have lost it for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., will you have a glass of wine, or anything?"—the prisoner, the man who was speak<lb></lb>ing to me, and I went to a public-house—I had a glass of porter, the other man had a glass of ale, and the prisoner a glass of gin—another man came in and he had a glass of ale or porter—the third man talked about throwing weights—the prisoner said, "I will throw a weight for a glass of rum," and the prisoner asked me to go and see the weights thrown, and the person who first came to me asked me, and I went into the skittle-ground with them— when we got in the skittle-ground the prisoner and the man who came up to me first, began playing at skittles—they commenced betting—I betted, and lost 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to the prisoner—we went from there to the Canterbury Arms, and there the prisoner said he would make me a bet of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I could</p>

               <p>not knock down the skittles in nine times; if I got them down in eight I should win the game—I took the bet, and went to my landlord and got the money—I took it to the Canterbury Arms (I had been at two public-houses with the prisoner before that; I do not know the name of the second house, I believe I had some ale there)—I took back with me thirty sovereigns, twenty half-sovereigns, and a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—when I got back the prisoner, the man who accosted me first, the one that came in the third instance, and another named Anderson, who has been found guilty (<hi rend="italic">see page</hi> 317) were in the parlour, and they would have me have some wine with them—there were two bottles of wine had in the parlour—they then went in the skittle-ground—I then put down 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns and half-sovereigns—I cannot tell whether I put down the note—the prisoner deposited his money with Chick, and Chick took up my money—the prisoner appointed him stakeholder—I put that money down for the bet that I have mentioned; the prisoner then said, "Let us play for a bottle of wine first"—I said, "I do not mind"—we played, and Chick said the whole money was deposited on the other side, and he told me to put down the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I did, to make up the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lost the game for the bottle of wine—I was then at the bottom of the ground—the prisoner walked up and Chick handed him the money, and the prisoner <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> away—that was after I had finished the game for the bottle of wine—when I wanted to go after the prisoner, Chick and Anderson and another of the name of Strong prevented my going out— they said he would be back again presently—I got out of the place and gave information—I returned in half an hour, and the others were then gone—I saw the prisoner again last Sunday fortnight, in the station-house—I had not seen him till then—I saw one of the other men afterwards, who made his escape out of the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Leamington Road Villas, Westbourne Park—on Thursday, 7th November, I was walking in Talbot Road at about 6.30—Stuchfield passed me, and then pounced back on me and wrenched my muff-bag from me and caught me a blow on my breast—a pocket hand<lb></lb>kerchief, a purse, and a bunch of keys were in my muff-bag—he ran away—Henley immediately came up and asked me what was the matter, and what the man had done—I told him the man had robbed me, and he pretended to run after him, but did not call "Stop thief!"—I ran too—both men got away—I gave information to the police—several weeks after I was taken to Marylebone police-court, and picked Stuchfield out—I afterwards saw another man brought into court, and immediately identified him as the man who accosted me after the robbery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The robbery was completed by the time Henley came up to me—he actually ran after the other man—I had given a description of Stuchfield to the police, and I picked him out of six or seven—I do not remember that they were much older than he is—there was no constable standing by him—I should think not more than a month or five weeks had elapsed since the robbery—I was not confused at the time of, the robbery, but shocked.</p>

I took Henley on 21st December from a description given me—I placed the prisoners amongst six or eight strange persons brought in from the" street—the last witness picked out Stuchfield—she was previously in the witnesses' room while we put the men in order, and then she came out alone—she afterwards identified Henley in court—he was apprehended by another officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She did not identify Henley until she heard him speak—I was standing three or four yards from Stuchfield—I brought him out and said, "You can stand where you like"—the lady was not present then.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had arrested Henley previous to the lady knowing any<lb></lb>thing about the matter—they were both apprehended the same day—Stuch-field was placed alone with the others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a spring maker, of 2, Denmark-place, Soho—on the night of 16th October, about twenty-five minutes past 12, I was going home, up the east side of Aldgate—a female accosted me—shortly afterwards the prisoner came across the road, and said, "I think I know you"—I said, "I don't think you do"—she asked where I lived—I said, "At the West, where do you live?"—"Close to Victoria Park"—" Where<lb></lb>abouts?"—"Do you know the Consumption Hospital?"—"Quite well"—"I live at the back of it"—I asked what number—she asked me to meet her on Sunday—I said I was engaged—she then said, "Let us walk on, don't stand here, this will be your nearest way"—we turned down Jewry-street into Montefiore-court—she said, "There is a passage through here, this is your nearest way,"—I did not like the look of her, and I took my purse out of my trousers pocket and put it into my breast coat-pocket—I am positive it got into my breast pocket—it contained thirteen sovereigns, an acceptance for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. several I O U's, six receipt stamps, and eleven postage stamps—the prisoner wanted me to take liberties with her, and I would not—she was close to me—in an instant she ran away—I immediately felt my pocket, and my purse was gone—I went out of the court as quickly as I could and saw a policeman, and complained to him—there was a man in the court while I was talking to the prisoner, and when she ran away she passed that man—the policeman and I went into Aldgate, at the corner of George-street—the policeman pointed out two females walking—the prisoner was one of them, and I said, "That is the person"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my purse—it is torn all to pieces—it was whole when I lost it—I saw it next day in the hands of the police—part of the papers are in it now.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 18th of August, at a quarter to three o'clock in the morning, I met the prisoner in Pollard-street, Bethnal-green - I observed something large before him, and asked what it was; he said, "Only a little flour;" I asked where he got it - he made no answer; I took him to Mr. Squirrel's, Pollard's-row - he had this bag in his apron, with 52 lbs. of flour.</p>

The prisoner had been nearly five years in my service - I had seen him on my premises not more than twenty minutes before he was stopped; this bag is not mine - I cannot speak to the flour; I had let him in that morning, and locked the two gates - when I came down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080063"></xptr>in the morning I found these false keys in the gates, which led out the back-way, and was the way the prisoner was going; I saw nothing in his apron when he came in - my flour is kept in a loft, about two yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Had you ever seen those keys before? A. No; a widow and her daughter lodge in my house - the daughter has at times come home late; she would be let in at the street door, not at the back gates; I never found the prisoner in flour - he has bought flour of me.</p>

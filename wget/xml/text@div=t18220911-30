            . I am landing clerk at Miller's Wharf. I have the box; I saw it safe twelve months before the robbery. On the 31st of August, about eight o'clock at night, I found it broken open, and the warehouse in which it was broken open also; I did not know the contents; something had been taken out of it; I had seen the prisoner on the wharf that day.</p>

            . I know the contents of the box, as we had a dispute about it; I know these to be part of the things; it lay in our lumber-room, and could be easily got at. The prisoner was searched the same night; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110017"></xptr>denied ever having seen the parcel, and also the twine, by which it was tied. I gave him in charge, and next morning I went on board the Comet; his bag was produced, and under some dirty clothes in it were four parcels of trimmings, which were taken from the box. The trimmings in the box were similar to this.</p>

            . On the 31st, about eight o'clock at night, I took him in charge - he denied all knowledge of the parcel. Next morning Mr. Hosier gave me the bag from the Comet. The prisoner said it was his, and that he found the trimmings in a privy on the wharf, and took them on board. I asked why he did not tell Mr. Hosier he had them - he said he was only asked about feathers and flowers.</p>
               <p>MR. HOSIER. There was a considerable quantity of trimming in the box, like this, of the same pattern and fabric. Much more has been stolen than what is found.</p>

            . I am a sail-maker, and have a loft at Miller's-wharf. On the 31st of August, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came up to my loft, and asked if I would give him a piece of tar twine to mend his waistcoat, which I did; it was twine like that the parcel is tied with. My loft is on the same floor as the warehouse. I saw him again about one o'clock on the floor under the warehouse asleep, in the very warehouse the parcel was found - he had no business there; but the boys are frequently there.</p>

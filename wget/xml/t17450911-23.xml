             . On the 18th of June last, about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was robbed of 14 guineas and an half, which was in a purse in my pocket .</p>
               <p>Q. When was it done?</p>
               <p>Thornton. I went into a house called the Hayfield , in the back lane by Rag Fair, and called for a pint of beer and a pipe, and smoaked my pipe of tobacco. This

             was standing at the bar, and I took her to be the landlady of the house, I drank to her, and she pledged me. After that she sat down opposite against me in a little box; then Jane Johnson came in and sat by her, and they persuaded me to have a quartern of - I can't think of the name, rosa solis, no; it is not rosa solis, it is some Irish name I think; - usqucbaugh, ay, that is the name of it. Afterwards they persuaded me to go to a little room where this Winifred Ward lay. We all three went and sat down upon the bed side together, and then we had another quartern of the same liquor . I found it worked in my head a little , then this

             sat by me a quarter of an hour, and she persuaded me to go to her chamber 3 or 4 doors higher up in the lane: a chamber where I suppose she has carried many an one.

             led me the way, and carried me there, into the chamber; so I called for a bottle of beer, and a woman brought it up and sat it down, but I never tasted it; then Winifred Ward hugged me and kissed me; and I lay down upon the bed with her, and had a roll there, Then she pretended to go for a pair of sheets, and as soon as she got off the bed, I felt for my money, and it was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after she was gone, was it before you missed it?</p>
               <p>Thornton. It was immediately after. So I run after her, but I could not find her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss your money in the other house?</p>
               <p>Thornton . No, I did not miss it till I came there. I went to the house I was in first, and made my complaint there, and they said they knew nothing of it, but they were sorry for it .

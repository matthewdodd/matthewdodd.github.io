                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and live at Ryde Cottage, Kilburn. The prisoner was my coachman for about twelve months—he lived with my brother before he lived with me, for about fifteen months, and on his going to India, I took him—on Saturday, the 11th of February, I desired him to pay a bill of 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to Mr. Hale, a corn-chandler—I gave him a £50 bank-note for that purpose, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I directed him to pay the bill and return me 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the receipt—Hale lives about a quarter of a mile from me—I believe the prisoner came back that night, but I did not see him—the next day, about one o'clock, I sent for him, but he was not there—I made inquiries, and then gave information.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 38.) On Sunday evening, the 12th of February, I received information against the prisoner, about half-past six o'clock—at ten o'clock I saw him get out of a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, in Great James-street, St. Mrylebone, about three miles from Kilburn—he did not go to any house—he stopped opposite No. 57—I observed him speak to a female—I went and asked whose crest was on his buttons—he said, "Here it is, You may see"—(he was the worse for liquor, but he could understand what I said)—I asked if he had not been entrusted with a £50 note to get change—he said no, he was not the man—I took him into custody—we went down Harcourt-street, and he attempted to rescue himself, by putting my cape over my head, but I held him fast, and he said, "I am done, my character is gone"—I took him to the station, and found on him two sovereigns, eight half-crowns, nine shillings, three sixpences, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 0 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper, eight duplicates, and a bill for corn for 37<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at Mr. Hale's—I went back to No. 57, Great James-street, and found the young woman I had seen him speak to, standing at the door, and from what she said we</p>

               <p>went into a back room—she unlocked a box, and gave me two £10 notes and five £5 notes—after I had searched the prisoner at the station, the inspector asked him what he had done with the money—he said he had lost it, and that was the reason he had not returned to his master.</p>

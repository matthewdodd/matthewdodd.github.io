I went about the 7th or 8th of June with my family to Hampstead: I secured my house in the strongest manner I could; the doors were barred and bolted, and all the windows were fast; I examined the windows of the kitchen myself; I saw the screws safe; one of which was afterwards broke. I came to town occasionally, and then I looked at my house and saw that all was well. A message was sent to me on the 20th of June that my house was broke open; I came immediately to town, and found one of the bars wrenched, and found the screw of the window taken; it was screwed in the inside and could not have been taken out without some person having put their hand into the window; the sash of the window was up and a pane of glass was broken; I myself picked up a chissel in the area next morning, and there were marks of violence on the door; and on the other windows, the area is twenty feet deep.</p>

               <p>On the 20th of June, at eleven at night, I went into a fore garret in a house in the neighbourhood, near the house of Mr. Morrill; the window was open; I saw a man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150005"></xptr> walk by Mr. Morrill's house; I observed that when, any body was there, he walked on; when nobody was there, he clapped his hands; I heard Mr. Morrill's window shutter wrenched and the glass fall into the area; the noise continued till half after twelve; then a servant of Mr. Baldero's came home and I alarmed him.</p>

               <p>A WITNESS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman; I found the pistols and tinder-box in the area; when I went down, the prisoners were sitting under the arch in the area, about a yard from the window; there were remains of violence on the kitchen door, on the street door, and likewise the other window. I took the screw up in the window; it lay by the pistol and tinder-box.</p>

               <p>I heard the cry of watch; I went down; there were five or six watchmen there together; they said there were thieves in the house; they did not choose to go in; at last, I jumped into the area; I saw both the prisoners under the arch against the wall; I called for my bludgeon; the prisoners said, don't insult or ill use us, and we will surrender ourselves; upon which we handed them up and got them into the street, and they never spoke a word more.</p>
               <p>RICHMON BRIDGE sworn.</p>
               <p>About half after twelve at night, I saw Mr. Baldero's coachman watching the house; I asked if there was any fire, he said no, but thieves; I saw the window-shutter loose; I put down my stick; the sash was up and a pane of glass broke: the prisoners were taken out and carried to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COX's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>All I have to urge in my defence is this, at the time the burglary was committed, I was clerk to an attorney in the city, who, I believe, is in court now to give me a character. I left the office at eight in the evening; I spent the remainder of the night with a friend, with whom I drank rather too free; I left him; I believe, it was past twelve o'clock, in order to go home; coming along Hatton-street in my way home, I heard an alarm, and understood by a woman who was at a window, that there were thieves in the area; I looked round in order to see if I could get any assistance; I saw my fellow-prisoner coming towards the place on the other side of the way; I called to him, and told him what I had heard, and asked him, if he would go over the area with me, to see if there was any body there; he readily complied, and we got over, which, I believe, we should not have done if we had been in our proper senses; for he was also in liquor; we were hardly down but we were surrounded by the watchmen; we called to them, and told them we could not see any body there, or any thing like thieves, and desired to be helped over; that man came over and used me ill. I desired to be helped out, and said, I would readily go wherever they should take me; they helped us out and took us to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>WATSON's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The evening the robbery was committed, I had been at Sadler's Wells, after the entertainment was over I drank pretty freely; I met some acquaintance that kept me rather<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177807150006"></xptr> late; coming along Hatton street, Mr. Cox called to me over the way, and said here is an alarm of thieves; I can find no watchman to come to detect them; he said, if you will get over the area I will go and see if there i s any body there; I complied with it; I saw no body there; the windows were shut when I went down.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner:</p>
               <p>Mr. SPOTTESWOOD sworn.</p>
               <p>Cox has been clerk to me since November 1775.</p>
               <p>What has been his behaviour? - Exceeding regular; he married a year or near two years ago; he was then absent about a month from me.</p>
               <p>Did you ever know him guilty of any such crime before? - Never, he was always exceeding regular and honest; I have often trusted him with two or three hundred pounds at a time to carry to my banker; and he never wronged me in his life.</p>
               <p>Mr.TODD sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known Cox and his parents and their connexions twenty six years; they live in a reputable way, and give him a good example; and in my own knowledge of him and his family I never heard any ill thing of him till the present affair.</p>
               <p>(All the witnesses for the prosecution were asked whether the prisoners were intoxicated with liquor when they were taken out of the area.)</p>
               <p>They all said they both appeared to be very sober.</p>

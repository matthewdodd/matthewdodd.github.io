            . I am a tobacconist, and live in Newington-causeway; I have been a parish-constable. I had information from Goff, and on Thursday, the 11th of February; I was going to meet Goff at Brentford, and in Hammersmith, between five and six o'clock in the morning (it was very frosty,) I saw three men coming along the footpath; I stood up by the side of a wall, and concealed myself immediately under a gas-light; the three men came by - Juxx was the first, Plummer the next, and the third, who is not yet taken, the last; each had a great basket on his head - I am quite sure they are the men; I did not know them before - Plummer, seeing me look so hard at him, said, "Good morning, master;" I said, "Good morning" - they passed me, and I went on towards Brentford; I had not gone far before something struck me that all was not right - I turned back, and ran towards them again; there is a night-house at Hammersmith, called the Chaise and Horses, and joining that a pent-house, and the there I saw three baskets under the pent-house, and the three men had got a pot of beer; I immediately crossed the road, walked by them on the opposite side of the way, and seeing nobody to assist me I crossed over and came upon the same side as they were standing - when I came up to them Plummer, and the one not in custody, stood with their faces towards me; Juxx's face was towards them - I laid hold of Juxx by the shoulder, faced the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150016"></xptr>others, and said, "What have you here, old chops?" Plummer said, "Water-cresses, master" - I then laid hold of Juxx by the shoulder, and said, "Let us look at them then," and at that moment Plummer, or the other, threw the pot down and ran away - Juxx tried to get away, but I told him it was of no use; I looked into his basket, and found a quantity of pairs of breeches - I called the landlord to take the baskets, and took Juxx into the public-house; he said, "What are you going to do with me?" I said to take him to Bow-street - I said, "What are you going to do with these?" he said, "I don't know, some man gave them to me, and asked me to give him some bread and cheese;" I locked him up - he behaved very ill, and we had a great deal of trouble with him; I described Plummer; I am quite certain he is one of the men; I saw him pass by the gas-light and noticed him; I afterwards spoke to him and he said they were water-cresses - on my oath he is the man - I produce the property and baskets; the shop tickets are on the things.</p>

            . I am the last witness' husband. On the morning of the robbery I saw three men carrying three bundles from the house across the street; it was very dark, and rained very fast - I could not see their faces; one had a large bundle under his arm, another a pack on his shoulder, and the other a good sack full.</p>

               <p>MRS. CARPENTER. I have examined all the property; my shop mark is on them - here is not all that I lost - it is part of it; I am single.</p>
               <p>Juxx's Defence. On the 11th of February, I got up about five o'clock in the morning, to go to Limehouse to get a job, and in Gunnersbury-lane I overtook two men - Plummer was not either of them; they were each carrying a basket on their heads, and had the other between them - I bade them good morning; they asked how far I was going - I said to London; they said if I would carry the basket to Covent-garden they would give me somebeer, bread and cheese, and told me they were water-cresses I proceeded on, and met Myers; he said to me, "Good morning;" at the Chaise and Horses public-house they asked if I would have something to drink - I set the basket down; they fetched a pot of beer - I was drinking - Myers came up, and asked what I had got; I said water-cresses - the two men said, "We are going in to get a pipe;" Myers immediately collared me, and the other two ran away.</p>
               <p>Plummers' Defence (written.) Between the hours of eight and nine o'clock, in the evening of the 13th of March, I was at the sign of the Crown public-house (Mr. Jeffry's) drinking a pint of porter, when Myers, the officer, entered, and told me I was wanted; I asked him what for - he took me into a parlour, and searched me, and found only 2 1/2d. and a handkerchief, which was returned to me; Myers then said, "You know what I want you for - you are acquainted with a chap called Long Tom; I said No - he makes answer, "Yes, you know

            ;" he then says, "I want you on suspicion of having been concerned in the robbery at Mrs. Carpenter's;" I declared I knew nothing of the transaction - I positively declare I am innocent of the charge altogether; I never was in company with the prisoner Juxx, or any other man on the morning named in the indictment: I was at home in bed at the time the robbery is said to have been committed, which I could prove, but the distance from town prevents my witnesses from attending, they being people in business, and I am unable to pay their expences; I have always borne an undeniable character throughout my whole life, and got my bread by honest and industrious means.</p>

                  </hi>. My father is an auctioneer and land-agent, carrying on business in Gresham-street, City; he has a country-house near Chelmsford, called Broomfield-lodge. On Monday, 6th Nov. last, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper:—"A pair of brown geldings, and a very superior Brougham-horse to be sold, at half their value, to procure immediate sale; the pair are well-bred, clever in saddle, and step well together in harness; six years old. The Brougham-horse is bay, black legs, sixteen hands; very noble horse in harness; five years old; warranted sound. The coachman is fully empowered to disposed of them. 28 stable, Turk's Head Mews, Harley-street, Cavendish-square. Also, a very stanch pair of liver and white pointers."—In consequence of seeing that I went to" Turk's Head Mews, or Harley Mews North, in Harley-street—I went down the yard, and when I got to No. 28 stable I saw Mowatt; he was dressed similar to what he is now, with a shawl-handkerchief on, a black coat, and kerseymere trowsers—I asked him for the coachman of 28 stable—he said that he was the coachman—I went into the stable, and asked him whether those were the horses which were advertised for sale in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>—he said they were—I said, "You will have no objection to give me a reference to whom these horses belong?"—he said, "No, certainly not;" they belong to Mrs. King, of Eastbourne, Sussex"—I asked him to have the horse stripped and taken out of the stable, that I might see him—he called a person named George, who turned out to be a person named Bubb; who came from the loft, went up to the horse's head, took the clothes off, put a bridle on him, and turned him round in rather a clumsy way—Mowatt said, "D----n these Lon<lb></lb>don fellows, I thought they were more up to their business"—I looked at the horse, and found he was older than he was represented to be—I believe that was the smaller horse—I asked him how long Mrs. King had had them—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184812180006"></xptr>
               <p>said, pointing to the smaller horse, "That one she bred, and the other (all<lb></lb>uding to the larger one), she bought two or three years ago"—the little horse was then taken into the stable, and—the other one was brought out—he said they had been constantly driven together, and I asked to see them stand together side by side—I asked how long they had been driven together, and he said constantly for about two years by himself; that the ladies had ridden them, and they were perfectly quiet in double and single harness—I believe I made a remark upon the other horse's age as well—I said that either he or I must be a fool to say that horses with their mouths were only six years old—he said that they were only that, for the one his mistress had bred, and the other she had only had about two years—the horses were then taken into the stable, and I asked him, I believe, what the price was—he said his mistress, Mrs. King, expected a hundred guineas for them; but that I had better see the job-master as to price—he called to George, and told him to fetch his master; he did not mention the job-master's name, but it turned out to be Ward—Ward came down the yard, and I told him, in Mowatt's presence, that I had seen the horses; that I liked the look of them very well, and that the coachman told me they were perfectly quiet in double and single harness—Ward said, "I can assure you that they are both perfectly quiet in double and single harness"—I said it was not for myself that I wanted them, they were for my father; and unless they were quiet 1 would not look at them, nor get him to look at them at any price whatever—he said Mrs. King was an old customer of his; that she had been dealing with him for fourteen or fifteen years, and that was the reason she had sent the horses up to him to be sold—I repeatedly spoke about their being quiet, and he said they were quiet; I might have no doubt about it; that he knew Mrs. King a long time; that she would not ride behind them unless they were perfectly quiet; and she would not permit him to tell a lie about it—I then asked the price—he said that Mrs. King expected a hundred guineas for them; but that he had no doubt she would take eighty, for what with the expense of the horses standing at livery, and the coachman, who must have his "<hi rend="italic">baccy</hi>" the same as the rest of them, it cost her very nearly 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I said it was useless for me to look at them at that price—" Well, sir, "he said, "I don't think she would take any less; but ladies don't know much about these sort of things"—I again asked him as to their being quiet; "for, "I said, "my father is uncommonly fidgetty, and unless they are perfectly quiet I really would not have them"—he said, "You need be under no apprehension of anything of that sort, sir, for I have known Mrs. King so long; and I can give you a warranty that they are perfectly quiet"—I then asked him to tell me the price he intended to take for them as I would get my father to look at the horses, and if he liked them, I would recommend him to buy them; but as for eighty guineas, that would not do—he said it would be a bad job for him; that Mrs. King had been his customer so long that he should get nothing by having the horses there at that price—he then said, "If you like to have the horses at seventy guineas, and pay me my commission, I think I can get Mrs. King to accept it"—I said, "If I bought the horses, I should buy them outright, without having anything to do with his commission"—he said, "Well, it is a very bad job for me; I shall get nothing out of it"—I said, "I can't help that; if you will tell me the lowest price you will take for them I will get my father to look at them, and see if he will buy them"—he said he thought Mrs. King would not take any less—I said then I could not buy them at that price—he asked what I would give for them—I said, "I believe it is not a usual custom to be buyer and seller too;" I know you men</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184812180007"></xptr>
               <p>have generally two prices, an asking price and a selling price; and if you will at once tell me, as I am going to Tattersall's to-day, I shall probably, unless I buy these, meet with a pair there"—he then said if I liked to take them at sixty-five guineas, and pay his commission, I should have them—he said he had been to an omnibus-proprietor, a namesake of his, named Chaplin, who would give him seventy guineas for them immediately; but Mrs. King had left particular orders with the coachman that they were not to be sold unless for private use; that she would not entertain any dealers having them—I then told him that if he would give me the refusal of them at 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. till three o'clock in the afternoon I would get my father to look at them, as they were for him, and not for myself; and then I would give him an answer whether we would have them or not—this was about half-past eleven, or twelve—I then went away, and returned in about an hour with my father—I found Mowatt and Ward standing against the stable-door—Mowatt opened the door; we went in, and 1 said, "These are the horses"—Bubb was in a box close by, with a Brougham-horse—the horses were brought out—my father entered into con<lb></lb>versation with the men—I did not pay attention to what was said; I walked away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a land-agent and valuer, of Gresham-street, and have a country place, Broomfield Lodge, near Chelmsford. On 6th Nov., in consequence of seeing this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, I went to Turk's Head Mews, or Harley-street Mews, and saw Mowatt, Ward, and Bubb—the horses were brought out, and stood side by side—I looked at them, and said I under<lb></lb>stood they were more than six years old, but I did not care about that so long as they were quiet—Mowatt then stated that he was coachman to Mrs. King, of Eastbourne, Sussex, that she bred one of the horses, that he had driven them together two or three years, and I might depend upon them being perfectly quiet—I had them walked down the yard—Mowatt said he had driven them with a snaffle on the top—I said, "I suppose you mean you drove them with a curb bit on the cheek—he said, "Yes," and that he had constantly driven them, and that the last journey was with his mistress from Eastbourne to Bromley, and they came up extremely well; and that when his master was alive he used to drive the larger horse in single harness, he was a capital horse in single harness, and he always drove him with a snaffle bit—I said that what I was particularly anxious about was, the horses being quiet, and he repeated several times his having driven them together, as Mrs. King's coach<lb></lb>man, and he always rode the larger horse when he rode post—some conver<lb></lb>station occurred about the price, and he referred me to Ward, and said, "The job-master will talk to you about the price," pointing to Ward, who was standing by—Mowatt said that he was very anxious indeed to get rid of the horses, because he was there at considerable expense, and his mistress was very anxious for him to get back, as she was going to Jersey, and wanted the horses sold, and if sold he should go back that night—I then had some con<lb></lb>versation</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184812180009"></xptr>
               <p>with Ward about the price, and he asked me seventy guineas—I said I could not give that price—Mowatt, who was standing by, then came up to me, and said, "What has he asked you?"—I said, "Seventy guineas"—he said, "I don't think my mistress will accept that price"—I was then walking up the yard towards the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which was waiting for me in Harley-street—Ward and Mowatt were walking with me, talking about the price, and Ward said, in Mowatt's hearing, he would take sixty-five guineas for them if I would pay his expenses, for that Mrs. King was a very old customer of his, and he could not charge her anything for the standing of the horses, and he should get nothing unless I gave him something—I told him I could have nothing at all to do with his commission, and as I was getting into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I said I would give him 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the horses—he and Mowatt were standing together—Ward said he could not take that price, and after some more con<lb></lb>versation, he still recommending the horses as a pair most likely to suit me, the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drove on—in going along Harley-street, in consequence of some conversation with my son, we turned round, and came to the end of the yard in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Ward and Mowatt were standing together at the corner—Ward came to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-door, and I said, "I think the horses will suit me in consequence of what you say, and I am induced to offer you 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to include everything, if you will deliver them at the Eastern Counties station this afternoon"—he said I must give him something for himself, for he had no other chance of getting anything—I said, "No, I shall not do that," and I called out to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to go on—he then said, "Stop a minute"—Ward then went to Mowatt, who was standing two or three steps from him, and be came back and said I should have the horses—I then said to Mowatt," Of course you will lend me the cloths and bridles to take the horses down to the railway, and I will return them to-morrow"—he nodded assent—Ward came from Mowatt to the <hi rend="italic">cab-door</hi>, and said, "You must give me something to bind the bargain—I gave him a sovereign, and drove away, having previously arranged that he was to be at my office, in Gresham-street, a little before four o'clock, and that the horses were to be sent at five o'clock to the Eastern Counties Railway station—I then went away, and got back to the office about a quarter to four—I found Ward there—I took out my check-book to draw a check—Ward said a check was of no use to him, because the bank would be closed, and he could not get the money—I said I had not the money by me, and after talking for two or three minutes I said, "Well, if you will be at the railway station at five o'clock, I will endeavour to get the check changed, so as to give you the money"—at five o'clock I went to the rail<lb></lb>way station, where I saw Ward—he wished me to pay him—I said, "Where are the horses?"—he said they would be there in a minute or two—I replied I should like to see them first, and in the course of a few minutes they came into the yard—a horse-box was got ready—I then went into the waiting-room, and paid Ward four sovereigns, having given him one before, and six 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—he again pressed me very much to give him something for himself, saying I must give him something to get a new hat, that he should get nothing for the keep of the horses, repeating what he had said before—I gave him no answer, but walked out where the horse-box was—he followed me—I found them taking the cloths off the horses—I remonstrated, and Bubb then stated that he was ordered not to leave the cloths or bridles—in a minute or two afterwards Bubb came to me, and wanted something for bringing the horses—I said, "No; as I have been deceived about the clothing, I will not give any of you a <hi rend="italic">screw, "</hi> I think was the observation—I then went down by the train—the horses were taken out</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184812180012"></xptr>
               <p>at Chelmsford that evening—Ward gave me this receipt at the time I paid him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"London, Nov. 6, 1848. Received of J. Bedel, Esq., the sum of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for a pair of brown geldings, warranted sound, quiet to ride, and quiet in double and single harness; the horses to be returned within one week from this date, if not approved of. <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE WARD</hi>." The horses got into my stable at Broomfield that night—I went to see them taken out next morning, and directed my coachman to put the harness on—they were put to a spring van which I keep, and in which I always drive horses before I put them to my carriage—one of the horses came out of the stable very well—the large one we could not get out; we had considerable trouble with it, and we were at last obliged to back him out—after considerable difficulty we put the horses to the van—they appeared to be unaccustomed to be put to harness—my coachman and my son got on the box, and we tried to make them go forward, but they were very unwilling to do so, but after pushing at the wheel, and pushing behind, they sometimes rearing, and sometimes backing, and sometimes going a step or two forward, we got them out of the gates into the road—they still kept on doing the same, and after they had got about fifteen or twenty yards, one of them kicked very viciously—I had not given them too much beans; I had none in my stable—they bit one another very much in going through the yard—they were evidently unaccustomed to each other, and, I think, to harness—I did not take any care as to which side I put them in, or change them—as soon as I found they would not go forward, but kicked and reared, I had them taken out—I never tried them in the carriage—that was the only experiment I personally made with them—they were tried subse<lb></lb>quently—I came up to London, and communicated with the police—I did not go to the stable—I attended before the Magistrate on the Saturday—at the time I parted with my money I believed the horses were the property of Mrs. King, that she had bred one and bought the other, and that Mowatt was her coachman, and that the horses were sent up to Ward, the job-master, for the purpose of selling them.</p>

Your <hi rend="italic">clerk</hi> informs me that you will not be in town till to-morrow, therefore any time between eleven and four o'clock to-morrow, Tuesday, you can have your money returned by sending the horses to the stable in Harley-street"—I believe my clerk did see the person—I did not send the horses to the stable on the Monday—I did on the Saturday, but not after receiving the letter—I believe it was a fact that I was not likely to be in town on Monday—I am an auctioneer—we do not always give a literal account of the matters we have to sell, but we do not deceive—some persons give a much more pic<lb></lb>turesque description of the property they have to sell than others—I am not poetical, and do not keep a poet.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 26). In consequence of Mr. Bedel's direction I went down to Eastbourne on Wednesday, 8th Nov.—I made inquiry at the post-office, and all other places I could think of, for a Mrs. King—I found no widow lady of that name who kept horses or a carriage, only a poor woman, the widow of a carpenter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a veterinary surgeon, living at Walthamstow. I have seen these two horses—the large one was unsound—it is a roarer—roaring is a disease in the upper part of the trachea, consisting of a deposi<lb></lb>tion of coagulal lymph, which is as an impediment in the act of respiration, causing a noise that we hear on these occasion—it is an imperfect breathing.</p>

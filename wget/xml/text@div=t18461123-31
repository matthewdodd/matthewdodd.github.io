                  </hi>. I reside at No. 16, Fitzroy-square. In the beginning of June the prisoner came to me as a servant, in cones<lb></lb>quence of an advertisement—he stated he had lived at Bath—I said I never took a person who lived in the country, as I could only have a written cha<lb></lb>racter, and I should like to see the principal—he said he thought Mr. or Mrs. Campbell, with whom he had lived, would be in town, and I could see them—he came a second time, and said Mrs. Campbell would be in London—that Mr. Campbell lived in Pulteny-street, Bath, and owing to some railway specu<lb></lb>lations he had failed, and was about to break up his establishment, but Mrs. Campbell would come to take lodgings he thought, and he said she resided at No. 26, Nottingham-place—on the Wednesday following my daughter went—she said she had seen Mrs. Campbell, who was very much the lady, and she gave this man a very excellent character—the prisoner told me he had been hired as a footman to Mr. Campbell, and-having lived there eighteen months, and the butler going away, he was elevated to the place of butler, that the whole of the plate and the cellar was placed under his care; Mrs. Camp<lb></lb>bell corroborated what he had said, and wished me to take him—he came on the 11th of June—on the 12th we had some friends to dinner—that was the first time of his waiting on us, but it was so bad that I could not but complain to my daughter—I said, "This man is not in the habit of attending on com<lb></lb>pany, or waiting at table"—it being my habit to have the plate brought up to my bed-room at night, he brought it up, and said, "My manner of waiting has been rather indifferent, Sir, but your place was strange to me"—I said he had just anticipated what I was going to say—the next morning he came up for the basket of plate—I let him have it, and I thought he was going to clean it—I have missed it, and it has never been found—the last I saw of the plate was on the Friday—on the Friday night he professed to bring it up—he brought the basket, and there was plate in it I know—the prisoner is the man who hired himself to me—I have not the slightest doubt of it</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the prosecutor's service. On the 11th of June the prisoner came into his service—I have not the least doubt be is the person—he went by the name of John Brown—I saw him bring the plate-basket down on the Saturday morning—I could not see what was in it—he went out, and staid about twenty minutes or half an hour—between eleven and twelve o'clock I saw him in the pantry, cleaning the plate—about one he went out with a note for Miss Mayhew, and never came back—the plate was missed about a quarter before two—he told me he was going to take the note, and he asked me what time luncheon would be ready—I have not the least doubt he is the person—no one else could have come in without my letting them in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Mayhew's service. I remember his having the prisoner as footman in June—I saw Miss Mayhew count the plate to him—there were the articles mentioned—the fish-slice, the large forks, the small forks, the jug, and other things—the prisoner had the charge of it—I washed it on the Friday after dinner, and gave it to the prisoner—he left the next day between one and two o'clock.</p>

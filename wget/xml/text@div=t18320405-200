The prisoner has been in my employ about twenty-three months; I had reason to suspect him on the 15th of March - I let him go out, and then sent one of my men to tell him I wanted to speak with him - I took hold of the flap of his coat, and he took out of his other pocket, on the left side, a piece of satin and some jean, which had my mark on it; I said, "This is not yours" - he said, "No, it is yours, and I do not know how it came here;" we took him to the office, and then went to his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050090"></xptr>lodgings, where we found a number of other articles, in papers, and some husks, with my initials on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Do you know whether the prisoner had been in this way of business? A. I know his father was a stay-maker, and I understand he himself has been a publican, and has failed; he first said the articles he had about him were his own, and he had bought them of a person in Crown-court, but did not know his name; I never knew of his cutting out work for himself in my shop - I would not keep a man in my employ who did so; I have had a person in my employ who has had orders for himself, and he has told me of it, and I have let him have goods - this is the jean - it has the prisoners own mark on it. and he acknowledged it was mine, before he went out of the house; a day or two before he had some stays to cut out, and this was the lining of them - it happened to be seven yards long, and the night before, he wanted a little bit - I gave him this to cut the little bit off, and he did not return it - when I found it, he said it must have come into his pocket by mistake; he said at the station, that he lodged at No. 33, Maiden-lane.</p>

            . My husband is a corn-porter: we live in Charles-street, Drury-lane. I am a stay-maker: I stitched and cottoned two pairs of stays for the prisoner - I did all but boneing, and pressing them; these two pairs are my making, to the best of my belief - the pattern is the same, and as far as I can tell, these are the pairs I did for him; I do not know this other pair.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Will you swear positively that the work of these two pairs of stays is yours? A. They appear like it as near as I can tell; I put no private mark on them - the last I made was of this pattern; I have been a stay-maker ten years, and have been accustomed to needle-work all my life.</p>
               <p>MR. HOBSON. This woman worked for me, and when I found she worked for the prisoner, I discharged her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband, Thomas Taylor, at 11, Fleet-street, Bethnal-green; we rent the front parlour of Mr. M'Mitchell, a policeman. On Monday night, 22nd Sept., we went to bed about 11 o'clock, the parlour-window was down, and I think fastened, but I could not swear to that—I was disturbed by hearing a heavy noise and breath in the room—I told my husband there was a thief—he got up—the window was wide open, and the shutters also—they had been shut when I went to bed, but Dot fastened—my husband's coat, trowsers, and shirt-front were gone from a chair by the window, where he had placed them when he went to bed, and his stock was hanging out of the window—I saw the shadow of a person at the window, but could not swear to him, or see whether he did anything—my husband went for a policeman—these are the things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On the morning of 22nd Sept. I was on duty in Brick-lane, Spitalfields, about twenty minutes past 2 o'clock, and saw the prisoner standing at the door of No. 3, New Montague-street—that is more than a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's—he had a bundle with him—he saw me, and walked away fast—I followed, and asked him what he had got in the bundle—he said, "They are my own things"—I asked where he came from—he said from his lodging—I asked where he was going to—he said home—he assured me the things were all right; and if I would go with him to the bottom of the street to Mr. Bailey's, the Halifax Arms, I should have satisfaction that it was right—I went to the door, and Mr. Bailey said he merely knew him by sight—I then proceeded to take him into custody—he resisted very much, and threw the bundle down in a dark place—my brother picked it up and gave it to me—I examined it, and it contained these things.</p>

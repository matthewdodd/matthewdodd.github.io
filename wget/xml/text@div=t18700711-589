                  </hi>. I live at 28, Lime Street, City—I am out of employ-ment at present—in 1866, I was in the employ of Messrs. Bull &amp; Wilson, woollen drapers, in St. Martin's Lane—they employed a gentleman of the name of Sparrow, and Musgrove was a carman in his employment—I knew Musgrove in 1851, but I lost sight of him till I went to Bull &amp; Wilson's—I was there three years and a half, and he came there frequently during that time—I only knew Isaacs by sight—I only saw him twice before I saw him at the Court, about six months before I left Bull &amp; Wilson's—some time in 1866 we had a meeting at the Pavilion Music Hall—Musgrove asked me on several occasions to meet a friend of his who had plenty of money—I should think he asked me two or three times—I went to the Pavilion Music Hall, where I met Musgrove, and he introduced me to Samson Isaacs as a friend of his who had got plenty of money—we sat down together at a table—Musgrove did not join in the conversation—he could hear what was said—we were drinking and smoking—Samson began speaking about trade and business—he then asked me whether we were sufficiently paid, and whether we could do with some more money—I said "Of course we could do with more"—he was speaking about the young men in the trade—the conversa-tion after led to this, that I should give some goods to Musgrove—he said "If you give goods to Musgrove they will be given to me, and we will dispose of them and divide the profits"—that is what was said as near as I can recollect—I said I would see about it—he said it would be better that Musgrove should come about dinner time, because half the young men would be out of the way at dinner—I left him shortly after that—I was assistant at Messrs. Bull &amp; Wilson's—I should have had access to the goods in their establishment—Musgrove had seen me in the warehouse nearly every day—I mentioned this conversation next morning to Mr. Grubb, a young man in the employ—I saw Musgrove that day, and I asked him what he meant by introducing me to such a vagabond as that—I mentioned what Samson had said to me, and Musgrove said he did not hear what was said—I said if I heard anything more of it I should speak to my employers—I spoke to two or three others about it—I did not make it a secret—we all left the Pavilion together, and parted a little distance off—I forget where—I bade Musgrove "Good night"—I left Messrs. Bull &amp; Wilson's on 1st January, 1867—I had a conversation with Musgrove in October, 1867, in the presence of Mr. Sparrow, his master—I was then a Mr. Garnier's, in Golden Square—Mr. Sparrow came with Musgrove to inquire about the conversation—he said "What have you got to say about my man Tom?"—I said I knew nothing against him more than he intro-duced me to a bad man at the London Pavilion—Musgrove said that it was not Samson he meant to introduce me to, and afterwards he said it was—I complained of losing my situation for it, and we parted—I was dismissed from Messrs. Bull &amp; Wilson's—I forget who paid for the beer at the London Pavilion—Isaacs paid for some, that is all I know.</p>

               <p>Magistrate "I could give no reason for suspecting him"—my reason is not strong, and I should say there was no suspicion—I said I did expect it was for no good purpose—I had no particular reason—the Pavilion is a music hall—there were a lot of people sitting round—we were the only three at that table—there were tables close by—we were at the side of the hall—the tables are close together—the conversation was loud enough for me to hear, and Musgrove too, I should imagine—I have said that he might not have heard it—I could not swear that he did—it was a startling proposition for Samson to make—Musgrove did not join in the conversation—he said nothing, to my recollection—I expressed my indignation to him next morning, not then—I understood it as a proposition to rob my master—I did not think it right to sit three-quarters of an hour drinking after the proposition—I did do it—I have not forgotten any of this since 1866—I shall never forget it—I did not make any memoranda of what took place—I said I would see about it, and did mean to see about it—not about getting the goods, but about the proposition.</p>

Bull &amp; Wilson six months after this affair—I had three months' notice—there was no reason for my being sent away—merely that there was to be a change in the establishment—I got a character from there to my next situation—I went to the Pavilion to see what Musgrove meant, and to see what kind of person he was going to introduce me to—I stayed there because I did not know what to do.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, White Hart Street, Drury Lane, and am a cloth worker and presser—Messrs. Bull &amp; Wilson were customers of mint—Musgrove was in my service for nearly eighteen years, as carman—he always conducted himself as an honest and respectable man—I placed very great confidence in him—he would have to collect goods from Messrs. Bull &amp; Wil<lb></lb>son, and bring them to my premises—I did not know Isaacs at all—I did not know that he knew Musgrove—in the month of September, 1867, a Mr. Coleman sent for me, and I went with Musgrove to have a conversation with Sherborn—I got them to confront one another, and I could not make head or tail of it—but I can see it better now—I said "Musgrove, you have been seriously accused, what have you to say"—he said he did not know what I meant—I said that Mr. Coleman had made a serious accusation, for assisting a man, named Samson, to incite a young man, named Sherborn, in his employ, to rob Messrs. Garnier—Sherborn said that Musgrove bad got an order for the Pavilion, and he went there and sat at a table with a d—vagabond named Samson, Musgrove introduced him to Samson, and said he had got lots of <hi rend="italic">sugar,</hi> that he could take any amount of <hi rend="italic">stuff,</hi> and had lots of <hi rend="italic">sugar</hi>—Musgrove said he did not know the man, but he might have seen him—I pressed Sherborn very much to give me some more information on so serious a charge—he did not tell me any more—it was not corroborated by further inquiry at Messrs. Bull &amp; Wilson's, and I kept Musgrove in my employment.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant surgeon to Dr. Warsop—on Sunday, 31st July, I was called to see the prosecutrix, and found her suffering from two incised wounds, one over the back of the head an inch and a half long; it could not be very deep there; and the other over the left eyebrow about three<lb></lb>quarters of an inch long; it could not be very deep there—this was twenty minutes or half an hour after the stabbing; she had lost only about three ounces of blood—they were such wounds as might be produced by this knife, or some sharp instrument—she was ten days under my treatment, but is quite well now—they were dangerous wounds, from their situation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> After she took my cap and tore it, I got in a passion and gave her a blow. I had a glass in my hand, and gave her a knock with it, but did not do anything more.</p>

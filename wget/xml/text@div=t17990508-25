             sworn. - I am a supernumerary watchman: While I was going down Cannon-row, I saw a man and the prisoner together; I went a little forward to my box, in Cannon-row, and hung up my lanthorn, and a man came up to me, and asked me if I knew where that woman lived; I told him I did not, but I would enquire; I then took him down to the watch-house, and the constable of the night desired the two patrols to go with me to bring the prisoner forward; when we got to her lodgings, No. 26, Dartmouth-row, Westminster, we were answered from within that they could not open the door, for that they had no light; the patrols said, we have got a light if you want one, they then opened the door; the patrols went to the window immediately, the prisoner and a man were in bed in the room, they opened the window, and found the watch on the outside of the window; the patrol has it in his possession.</p>

On Monday morning, the 6th of August, I was telling my half-pence out of my till: I told ten shillings: I put five of them up in a brown paper, and the other lay loose. I was called to carry a pennyworth of two-penny over the way, and left my girl in the tap-room: I returned in about four or five minutes, and missed three shillings in halfpence, out of the loose parcel: the girl told me, a man and a boy had been in, and if any money was taken, it must be while she went down for their beer. A neighbour told me he saw them go out of the house; I pursued and overtook the prisoner in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields, and brought him back: he was taken before Justice Welch, and 2 s. and three-halfpence were found upon him. The boy ran away, as soon as he saw me coming.</p>

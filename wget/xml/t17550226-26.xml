            . About a month ago Mr. Lowther's wife told me she had lost a gown, I went and inquired about it, and we found it at Mr. Butler's in Gray's-inn-lane on the Monday after the prisoner was gone away, there was the prisoner, she owned she had taken the gown, and hoped Mr. Lowther would forgive her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I lived with his cousin, he lived there; I once asked his wife for an old gown, she gave me the piece, and I had it made up in a gown; she gave me a sheet also to make me some aprons; she is since dead.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sensible my wife never gave her the gown, she took it away in pieces, and had it made up.</p>

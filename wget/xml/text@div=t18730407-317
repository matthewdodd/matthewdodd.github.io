                  </hi> I am a linendraper of the Old Kent Road—the prosecu<lb></lb>trix' brother is in my employment—about 18th December, I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I do not know the prisoner's writing.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The letter stated:</hi>—"20, New North Road, Hoxton. Tuesday, 12 a.m., 17th December, 1872. Dear Sir,—I find I have done you much injustice in writing to you upon the treatment of your assistants; it appears they were wanton falsehoods, therefore, I feel sorry, and apologise for paying attention to such false statements emanating from Mr. B. Roper. With regard to the other unpleasants, they are unfortunately too true. Miss Roper, sister of your assistant, is, I fear, leading an abandoned life of im<lb></lb>morality somewhere in your neighbourhood. I often see her about town, but can't find her address, with a view of reclaiming her from such a course, which I am anxious to do, as she is my own sister's daughter. Her family are anxious about her and have written from Bury to me to find her out. Now, Mr. B. Roper knows where his sister is, but will not inform me you would indeed be doing a good act if you could procure by some means the address of that young creature, in order that I may take measures to send her home to her parents immediately and thus relieve their distress and anxiety. The poor father, who is an excellent and good man, would, like myself, esteem it a lasting favour if you can aid us in this matter and at once furnish me with her whereabouts.—I am, yours faithfully, Henry Pearson."</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and life with some Mends at Tennison Street, York Road, Lambeth—my parents live at Bury St. Edmunds; I came to town about two and a half years ago—I have been in toll employment since I have been in London—there is no pretence for saying that I have been leading a life of abandoned immorality—the letters produced art in the prisoners writing—he is my mother's brother—since I was at Bury St. Edmunds he has been bound over to keep the peace—he got me discharged from Spiers &amp; Pond's—it is not the fact that my parents have been seeking me and do not know where to find me—I have been in constant communi<lb></lb>cation with them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I have resided with Mr. Walter Palmer, a farmer, at Kelford, as governess—no intimacy sprang up between us while I was there—I have never admitted that I was seduced by Mr. Palmer—I never had occasion to lock myself up in a room from Mrs. Palmer's vengeance—I never stated that Mrs. Palmer had attempted suicide by throwing herself into a pond—I will swear that I never received any visits from Mr. Palmer during the time I was at Bury—I never accompanied him to Cambridge—I never went to a flower-show to meet Alfred Burt—Mr. Palmer did not pay a draper's bill of 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me at Bury St. Edmunds—I owed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I left there; that was all—I know Mr. Beckett, a surgeon; he took your practice—I do not know Mr. Layton, or Mr. Tinker, a chemist and druggist—I have heard their names, but I am not personally acquainted with them—I knew a Mr. William Lawrence; I was introduced to him by your wife—I was engaged to him—he is a widower, and has three children, I think—I have gone to his house with my aunt and cousins, your children—I saw Mr. Palmer once at Hull—I will swear I did not walk out with him one evening—my grandmother left me a small legacy—I came to London to seek a situation, and my father furnished me with means—my father is clerk to a wine merchant, and he has eleven children—when I came to London I was anxious to get anything to do I could that was respectable—I saw Mr. Palmer once at the Agricultural. Hall, when I was behind the bar for Spiers &amp; Pond—he came up to the Horse Show—I have never received apples, eggs, game, fowls, and pigeons from Mr. Palmer—I never received a hamper; only from my father—Spiers &amp; Pond appointed me to the Blackfriars Station, and I went there on 14th June—they afterwards sent me to Swanley, as lady, manageress—I was there from the latter part of June until November, and the reason for my leaving was that you had written letters to them against my character—I was never at the Half Moon, in the Borough, with Mr. Palmer, nor at a theatre with him in the evening—I never went to your lodgings for the purpose of creating a disturbance; I wanted to ask you what object you had in getting me discharged.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you occasion for the things you carried with you? - A. Yes; I packed up the things mentioned in the indictment, they were all my property, except the towel, and that was my father's, I tied them up in one of the handkerchiefs; I know nothing of the prisoner, except that I met him the night before by Temple-bar, and he, out of friendship, said he would shew me the way to the ship, he was an acquaintance of my friend that I was going to see; the first time I had ever seen the prisoner was with my friend, about a month ago; I never was on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he ever been at your house before? - A. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it when you met him at Temple-bar? - A.About seven o'clock, as near as I can guess, he asked me if I was going on board a ship next day; I told him I was; he asked me if he should come and shew me the way, that he was sure I should never find the way by myself; I told him he might come up to shew me the way; he came, and waited till I had tied up the things, I put them down upon the table in the room where he was, till I had prepared myself to go; when I was ready to go, I was going to take the bundle up to carry, he said, no, it would be too heavy for me to carry it, he would carry it; I said, no, I would carry it, I did not wish to give him the trouble of carrying it; he told me not to mention the trouble, for it was none; accordingly he took the bundle off the table, and walked down stairs immediately; I walked down immediately after him, and when I got to the bottom of the stairs, he was absent, I did not see him go; I made endeavours to find him along the Strand, through Exeter-street, and up and down every street where I thought I might be liable to see him; I did not see any more of him till he was taken prisoner on the Monday evening following; I was told, by an acquaintance of his, where he slept, I went down with the watchman, and took him up; it was in a house in Ship-yard, Temple-bar, I told the watchman that was the prisoner; he said, if I gave charge of him, he would give charge of me; I told him he was very welcome to do that; when he got to the watch-house, he said, he was knocked down, with the bundle, as he was going across Stepney-fields.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not to go to this ship without you? - A. No; he was to go to shew me the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of these articles again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Have you got any more witnesses here? - A. No; my father is out of town.</p>
               <p>Q. The watchman is not here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to take this bundle to the ship? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Stepney-fields is in the way to Blackwall? - A. Yes, I believe it is; I am a stranger to that part.</p>
               <p>Q. You told us what business your father was - what business are you? - A. I work in the muff business, in a shop in the Strand, near Templebar.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100034"></xptr>Q. You know Temple-bar very well? - A. Yes, I am often that way.</p>
               <p>A. Sometimes of an evening too? - A. Never unless my business calls me.</p>
               <p>Q. But does your business call you there frequently? - A. No, unless my father should want me to go that way.</p>
               <p>Q.You knew the prisoner lived in Ship-yard before? - A. I knew he lived in Shire-lane, but did not know the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know the prisoner lived in Shire-lane? - A. Because this friend that I was going to see told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name? - A.Noble.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he? - A. He has got a place on board a ship.</p>
               <p>Q. A single man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner? - A. A twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. You have frequently seen him? - A. Yes, in that neighbourhood; because his mother keeps a house in Ship-yard; I know his mother.</p>
               <p>Q. You frequently went to see him? - A. Not to see him; his mother did keep a shop in the fruitery line, and I have been there to buy things.</p>
               <p>Q. How often had you seen the prisoner before this happened? - A. Three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you seen him? - A.Frequently, in that neighbourhood, in the street passing by.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose were you going there? - A. My father was coming to me on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. You were to stay on board the ship? - A. Yes; there was a young woman there I was going to see.</p>
               <p>Q. You had packed up these little articles to stay on board the ship with Mr. Noble for three days? - A. I was going to stay till Sunday.</p>
               <p>Court. Her connection with Mr. Noble has nothing at all to do with this case; let it be what it would, she is not to he robbed; and the robbery is distinctly proved.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have known this girl upwards of a twelvemonth; I was on the Wednesday night in Shire-lane, in company with this sailor, this girl came there, and the sailor told her, he was going on board a ship; this girl asked him whether he would let her go with him, and he said, yes; he told her, he should come to her house the next morning, with me, at seven o'clock, to go on board; she told him, there was a string to pull the door, if the door should be locked; we parted that night, and came again the next morning, and he said, it was of no use for her to go with him, and he asked me if I would go on board ship with him that day, and I went with him on board, and then I came home from the ship, and he asked me if I would go for her the next day; and I accordingly did call for her, about one o'clock, and she asked me if I wanted any thing to eat; I told her, yes; and she gave me a bit of bread and cheese; and then she asked me, whether she should take any thing on board; I said, if she was going to stop, she might; then she said, she would stop on board; she accordingly packed up some things, and she asked me, if I would take them for her a little way; she said, she would carry them some part of the way; I told her, yes, I had no objection to it; she then asked her father, how long she might stop; her father said, he did not care how long; her father gave me a towel, and asked me, if I came up the next day, if I would bring him some biscuits; I told him, if I did come up, I would bring him some; then we both came down stairs, and she stopped to put her pattens on, and told me to go on; accordingly I went on; going on, I missed her on the way; I thought she had got on before me; I went down towards Limehouse, and coming along Stepney fields, I met with two sailors, they asked me, what I had there; I told them, I had a few things to take on board a ship; they asked me, what ship I was going on board of; I told them the name of the ship; and while I was telling them, one took the bundle away, and the other struck me, and made my nose bleed; I did not know what to do, I thought it would be the best way to make my way towards home; and making my way towards home, I came along Wapping, and I met a young woman that I knew; she asked me, what I had been about, and I told her what had happened; she told me, it would be best for me to go home; I told her, I was afraid to go home; and in a night or two after, I met with this girl in Shire-lane, and she did not say any thing to me then; and soon after, she charged the watchman with me, the same night.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Prosecutrix). Q. Had you met the prisoner in Shire-lane that night, before he was apprehended? - A. No, I had not; I did not see him.</p>

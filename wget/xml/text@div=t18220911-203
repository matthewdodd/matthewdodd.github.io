There were two hammers, five chisels, a pair of compasses, two planes, a plow, three saws, two squares, five gouges, a rule, pair of pincers, two gimblets, four awls, and two files. She said she bought them of two young men between nine and ten o'clock the night before, for 9 s., and thought she should know them if saw them. I took the tools, and told her to attend next morning at Bow-street; she did, and said the persons were about the size of the prisoners, but certainly were not them. Her husband was sent for, and they were admitted to bail.</p>

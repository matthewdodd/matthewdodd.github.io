               <p>ELIZABETH DRUMMOND sworn. - I live with Mrs. Golder: The prisoner came in from London with the coach, the landlady was not at home, he said, he was very cold, he sat down by the fire; he had a parcel in his hand, he said, it was a parcel belonging to a man up the town, a little way; he did not mention the man's name, and said, he would go and deliver it; it had nothing round it, it was only pinned; Charles Tovey lives beyond our house a good way.</p>
               <p>Golder. Upon the constable and the prosecutor coming in, they asked for the parcel, upon which the prisoner, instead of saying, there is your parcel, take it, and go away, he asked what parcel? and when they took him into custody, the prosecutor said, are not you a good-for-nothing fellow? he said, for what? why did not you promise to take care of my parcel? he said, no, I am not the man and persisted in it that he was not the man that pretended to take care of the parcel.</p>

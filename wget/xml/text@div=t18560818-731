                  </hi>. I am the manager of Mr. Frederick Dent's business, a chronometer maker, at the Royal Exchange. On the morning of 15th Aug., about 10 minutes past 11 o'clock, the prisoner came in—he took a watch from his pocket, and said, "I have a gold watch, but I have no chain, I wish to purchase one"—I showed him a variety of chains, and he then asked for a gold seal to attach to the chain—I had merely to turn my eye from the counter to a drawer, and in the act of so doing, observed the prisoner abstract a gold chain, and place it in his left trowsers pocket—I discontinued my search, and told him I missed a chain from the tray, on which he made a sudden motion, and replaced the chain on another tray—I immediately told him that that was the chain which he had taken out of his pocket, and which he had stolen, and I should give him into custody—I detained him some time, till the porter came in, and I sent him for an officer—shortly after, the prisoner bolted out of the shop into the Royal Exchange—I followed him, and called "Stop thief!"—he was stopped after</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185608180011"></xptr>
               <p>a time, and I gave him into custody—I gave the chain to the officer—the prisoner was taken to Bow-lane station—he had not asked the price of the chain—it was taken from the tray he was looking at—I had shown him some others, and told him the price of one—he said it was not good enough, I then showed him the others—this chain was double the price of the Albert chain I had shown him.</p>

            , has lodged with me upwards of a year and a half; the other came in the middle of the week, the Wednesday before Easter, and he asked me on Saturday night what I charged for my lodging? I told him fifteen-pence a week; and he said he supposed if he gave six-pence that would do, and then he would begin the next week with me; the Tuesday after he went away, I was in my bed at the time when he went away; I generally makes a rule to go up into the bed rooms as soon as I can to open the windows, and do my business, and then I went to the box to take out the dirty linen to wash it, and get it up, there was nothing but the coarse apron, and that was not in the box; on that I enquired of this young man when he came home on Thursday, what he had done with the clothes? thinking he had locked them up in the chest; Penny left the lodgings the same morning as the young man went out, and he never returned, nor we never see any thing of him till Mr. Robinson met him and took him up with his clothes on his back.</p>
               <p>Court to Robinson. When was it you apprehended this man? - Whitsun Tuesday in the morning, between eight and nine o'clock; I was robbed on Easter Tuesday morning, and Whitsun Tuesday I met him in the Strand; when I met him I saw that he had the property belonging to me on him, he had one of the cravats about his neck, and a pair of stockings; I took him into custody, and took him before a justice, and he was examined; as to the stockings I could not safely swear to them, but as to the cravat I could.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When you met me in the Strand, and you told me I was your prisoner, did not I go with you very willingly? - Yes, you did, very peaceably.</p>

               <p>I am a constable; I attend the public office, Whitechapel; I took the cravat off the prisoner's neck. (Deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought that property at the pawnbroker's in Rosemary-lane; I had no money to subpoena him here; he came before this gentleman and said I had bought one, but he could not remember whether it was this one or not.</p>

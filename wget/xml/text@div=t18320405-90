On the 22nd of March I missed two spoons from the dresser-drawer in the kitchen, and two from the pantry; the prisoner lodged in the house, with his father and mother, but the rooms the spoons were in did not belong to them; I have seen some broken pieces of spoons, which I know were part of what I had lost - the prisoner had stolen one spoon on the 19th: he then went away, and on the Thursday he came back and stole the others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did they not belong to your father? Witness. No, four of them are mine, and one is my father's.</p>

            . I am a Policeman (I T.) On Friday, the 23rd of March, I went in search of the prisoner - I took him; he said he knew nothing about the robbery on the 22nd - the spoon he took on the 19th had been found; I took him from London to Hammersmith, and when we got there he said he had sold the spoons to Mr. Buchanan, a refiner, in Raquet-court, Fleet-street - I went there, and found these pieces of spoons, which Miss Denman can swear to.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Drury-lane. I went to No. 12, Short's-gardens, and found the prisoner in a room there, and a great many goods of mine—I first pointed to a large blue jug, which I knew by a flaw in the handle—I said, "That is mine"—I pointed to a cruet-frame with some cruets in it—I should not like to swear to that, but I believe it to be mine; but I swear to the jug—it had been lost for several months—I think it has never been washed—I saw a sugar-basin which I lost not a fortnight before the pan was taken—I know the sugar-basin, and can swear to it, and to a small milk-jug—how they got out of my possession I do not know, but I told the policeman if they were mine I should know them—I never gave these things away, nor sold them—there are persons who sell earthen-ware and glass at my place, but there was no one at home when these things were taken.</p>

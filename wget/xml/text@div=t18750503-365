                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker at 179, Newington Butts—on 25th April, about 12.15, I was closing the back door leading to the yard—I heard a i' noise, in consequence of which I called the servant, and went downstairs</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187505030117"></xptr>
               <p>with a light to the wash-house in the basement—there was a chimney facing the door, and I saw the feet of a man half way up it; I could not see his head—I went to the front of the house for a policeman, who came and waited till I went to the station to get some more help—we then found the man had moved from the chimney, and subsequently I found him in a cup-board underneath the dresser in the front part of the house—the sergeant pulled him out and asked him what he was doing there—the prisoner was the man—he had worked at my house about sis weeks before—he could not have come in at the front door or I should have seen him—there are two doors, an outer one and the door of the house—I don't know whether the outer door was open or shut, but the. inner door was fastened about 11.30 with a chain—I found the chain down about 11.45, but I did not think much of it then, it came into my mind when I heard the noise downstairs.</p>

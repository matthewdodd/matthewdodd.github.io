I asked him to shew me a place to sleep in - He shewed me a room, looked the door, and went away. I went to bed, and when I awoke I found all my clothes gone, and a jacket in the room which did not belong to me. I found the door open when I awoke, I am sure he locked it and went away as soon as I got into bed. I was not senseless.</p>
               <p>SOLOMON SOLOMAN. I am a headborough. I went to look after the prisoner - He lived in the workhouse; I gave information there, and they stopped him. The next day I charged him with the robbery, which he denied. I found nothing on him. Owen described the handkerchiefs to me - He saw them afterwards and claimed them; he gave me a jacket, which I knew to be the prisoner's. I have seen him wear it. I knew that the room where Owen slept belonged to the prisoner. He cohabited with a woman there, but she was in custody at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH BORDER. I am gate-keeper to the workhouse of Whitechapel; the prisoner was a watchman, the officer desired me to stop him, which I did as he came in; I sent him up into the lobby, and told him he was suspected of robbing the sailor. I called an officer, who searched him, and brought him out; after he was gone I went into lobby, and found the two handkerchiefs under the sacking of a bed in the lobby. No person had been there but the prisoner.</p>

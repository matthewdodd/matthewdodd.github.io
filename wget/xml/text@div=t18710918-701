                  </hi>. I live at 4, Upper Marsh, Westminster Bridge Road—my husband is a smith—I let unfurnished loggings—on 7th August the prisoner came to my house, and asked what apartments I had to let—she looked at them, and said they would do—she said she had been walking all the morning, and was very tired—I asked her into my own apartment, and made her some tea, as she seemed very weary—she said she had come from Working; that she had travelled with Mine Nightingale, as one of her sisters, in the Crimean war, and that she had an engagement at the New St. Thomas's Hospital, as one of the sisters there; that when she came up from Working on the Sunday, as she came to me on the Monday, she brought 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. with her, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she spent for a bed on the Sunday night, and the other 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she had spent in charities, which was a sister's duty to do—slie took out a pair of earrings, and a brooch, and asked me if I could make money of them for her—I said I was not in the habit of frequenting pawnbroker's shops, neither did I know anyone that was—she then said would I let her have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. until the morning—the said she was going to receive 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Post Office Savings' Bank in Westminster Bridge Road, and she would pay me hack again then—upon that representation I let her Have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she told me that Miss Nightingale had made her a present of the earrings, and she valued them very much, indeed—she took the apartments, and said that of course she had hitherto lived in the hospital; that she had so much money allowed her to furnish her place, and directly she got her post-office order would I go with her to Atkinson's and order her furniture—I said "Yes," which was done, but before that she had 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of me, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 7th, and 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 9th, and another 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 10th, making some excuse about not being able to get her money because she ought to have given longer notice—I saw the outside of a letter that she had—this it—it has on it "On H.

I am a coductor to an omnibus. on sunday, the 9th of August, about ten o'clock at night, I was near the Royal Exchange with my omnibus, against the Sun Fire Office in Cornhill, I was standing behind the omnibus—the prisoner came up—he said nothing—a man came up with him, and asked if I was going to Blackwall—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Stop half&amp; minute, there will be four or five of us going down"—while he was speaking, up came the prisoner, and another man, and two woman; the man who frist came up, said to the prisoner, and the others, "Have you got any money to pay your way dawn?"—they re<lb></lb>plied, "No"—the man who frist came up said, "I have only got sixpence; I shall ride down, for I shan't walk all that way"—he gave me the six<lb></lb>pence, and got up the steps; went in the omnibus, and sat down—one of the woman walked up the top step—I said, "My good woman, you can't sit there"—she said, where her husband was she would ride—I said, "If your husband is inside, you must get in to him, or he must come out; for I cannot have this <hi rend="italic">row</hi> round my <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>"—during that time, a gentleman came up, and wanted to get in—I asked the good woman to move—she would not—I said, if she did not move, I must put her down—the gentleman said, "Conductor, take and put that woman down"—the prisoner was standing alongside on the pavement—I got down"—the to take the woman down, and she fell down—I took hold of her, to put her down, and she fell down in my arms—I then went to get onthe steps; when the prisoner, and the two woman, and the man that was there, all fell into me, and tried to scartch me, and to tear the things off my back—the woman had hold of the iron underneath the steaps—she loosened her hands, and came backwards into my arms—I immediately jumped up on the steaps and hallooed out "All right," to the coachman—he drove off, and the woman ran after the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> again, and caught hold of the iron, and began to halloo "Murder"—I halloed out to the conchman to stop the <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> and the prisoner came up to me, he caught hold of the my coat, and tried to pull me down—I caught hold of my coat, that he should not tear the skirt off, and pulled it out of his hand—I then told the coachman</p>

               <p>to go on again—the woman ran after the bus again; caught hold of the iron, threw herself down, and began to hllno "Murder" again—I called to the coachman to stop again; which he did; and the prisoner came up to me again—I stooped down, and pulled up my coat, that he should not take it, and shoved him away—I told the man who was in the bus, to get out to his wife, as she called herself, and he got out—I gave him his sixpence again on the sten; and while he was getting his wife away form the iron, I kept my eye on the prisoner—I was afraid he would pull me down—I saw him go round form the back of the bus to the off-side, round the horses; come round on the near side, and as I was standing with my back—I turned round; watching him, and I had my back fixed aganist the bus—as he came round on the near side, he brought a knife or something in his hand—I could not see what it was—he took and cut me right across the leg—I no sooner felt the knife at my flesh, but I jumped down, and seizcd him by the collar, and called for assistance—the officer was close at hand, and came to my assistance directly, and took hold of him—I saw he was going to make away with what he had in his hand, or to put it into his jacket-pocket—I tried to catch hold of his hand, but only caught hold of his thumb, and held it till the officers got him form the mob—a pocket-knife was found on the spot where I gave him in charge—the cut was about an inch and a half, or two inches long, not so deep as the surgeon expected it to be—I had a boot on; if it had not been for that, it must have been deeper—it cut throught my trowsers, boot, and stocking—a sur<lb></lb>geon attended me; he only dressed it myself after<lb></lb>wards—he found it was of no great consequence.</p>

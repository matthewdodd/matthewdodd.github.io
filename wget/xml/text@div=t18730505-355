Waterlow and Sons, of Parliament-street—the prisoner had transactions with our firm—we had refused to supply him with any goods without he made some deposit in advance, because we had had some difficulty in recovering from him payment of back debts—I said that I could no longer give him credit, and I suggested to him that he should deposit with us a given sum of money, say 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and work it out in that way—on one or two occasions he gave me some money for that purpose—in August, 1870, he was indebted to our firm, having overdrawn his account—on 10th August, 1870, he called upon us—he purchased goods on that day to the amount of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me this cheque on Glyn's, dated 6th August, signed by him—I paid it into our bankers—it has been returned to me, marked "N.S."—I have seen the prisoner since then, and have asked him for the money.</p>

I am assistant to my father, who carries on business as a bookseller at 52, Parliament-street—on 4th January, 1872, the prisoner came and ordered some books, "The Idle of the Duke of Wellington, "and six others—he gave me a card with an address on it, and "Mr. Edward Mansell, auctioneer and valuer"—I sent the books and the account to the address, and they were never returned to us—he called at our place again on 20th March, 1872, and said he wished to pay his account—I did not recognise him at the time, and I asked him is name—he said "Edward Mansell"—I brought the ledger forward and told him the amount—he said he thought it was more than that—he gave me a cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn on the Union Bank of London—it says, "Pay to Mrs. Mansell, "and is signed, "Edward Mansell"—there is a mark across it, "Not provided for."</p>

I went to 27, Great George-street, upon the cheque being returned from my bankers, to find the prisoner, but I did not find him there—there was no name upon the door, and I could get no information about him—the hallkeeper there told me he had left, but I got such information as led to his being apprehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He had had an office there—I saw one of the managers at the Union Bank, and he told me the only address they had got was the same as that upon the card he had given to my son (27, Croat George Street), and they could not assist me to any other—I never knew, as a matter of fact, that he was up and down in London every day of his life, and going backwards and forwards to Chiswick—I had heard of it.</p>

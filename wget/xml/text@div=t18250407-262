            . I am headborough of St. Lukes. About seven o'clock, in the morning of the 18th of February, I was in Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner Turley going up Playhouse-yard with a bundle of bridles under his arm, and eight girths rolled up in his hat - he came out of Chequer-alley, not in a direction from Mr. M'Donald's. He said a man met him at the Star, public-house, in Old-street, and gave him a shilling to take them to Mr. Dixon's - I took him into custody.</p>

             re-examined. Q. When you were bringing Turley back, did you see Merritt? A. Yes, I met him with four saddles on his shoulder - I showed them to Mr. M'Donald, who owned them as his: Merritt made some resistance, but Turley did not - they both said they had been employed by another man to carry them.</p>
               <p>MERRITT'S Defence. I was going to a Mr. Martin's, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070094"></xptr>the City-road, and the person with whom I was going to live was not there: as I returned I met a man who asked me to carry these things to Mr. Dixon's, and said he would give me a shilling; Turley was going by my side, and I told him, if he would carry part of them, I would give him part of what I was to have. As I was going down Whitecross-street I met the officer - I told him what I was to do with them, and said I was going to my father who worked at Mr. Dixon's.</p>

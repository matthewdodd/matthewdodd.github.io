I had not seen him before; Boyle knocked me down against the wall with his fist; I then saw another man come over the way; I rose, and this man followed me round to the workhouse where there is a dead wall, and there knocked me down a second time; then there were three of them: I laid myself upon my belly to prevent their getting at my pockets; one took me by my throat and turned me upon my back, and took my watch and three guineas, and six-pence worth of halfpence out of my pocket; and they likewise took a coat, a waistcoat, a pair of breeches, and a black silk neckcloth out of my bag; for I buy and sell old clothes. I cannot be positive as to M'Carty; the other man that struck me with the stick is not taken. On the Friday following, when I was in New Gravel-lane, I saw Boyle with two women; they were dragging him along by his hands; I passed him, and then I turned back and looked in his face; Boyle said, d - n you! why do you look so hard in my face? I said how did you come by that neckcloth; he said, he bought it on board a ship half a year ago for nine-pence. I claimed this neckloth, and charged him with knocking me down; he then took off the neckcloth and held it in his right hand; I said he should go to the Barley-Mow. I was assisted by one Evans and another man to take him there; then we took him to the Black Horse; there the prisoner refusing to let go the neckcloth, we handcuffed him, and then it was taken from him; at the same time, I found my watch at the house the two prisoners lodged at.</p>

               <p>I attend at Justice Campher's office. On the 10th of August I was sent for to the Barley-Mow; there I saw Boyle, Johnson, and one Evans; the prosecutor charged Boyle with having knocked him down, and that he and two others had robbed him; Boyle had at this time a black silk neckcloth in both his hands; the prosecutor said it was his. I seized Boyle, and desired he would let go the neckcloth; he was very unwilling to do it; at length I got it from him by force; I took him to the Black Horse, and then went to his lodgings. I found a watch in a chest there; the prosecutor said before he saw it, that if it was his watch, it had a single case, and the glass was broke; I found it to answer that description; I sealed up the watch together with the neckcloth under my own seal, and left it at the Black Horse; I had it from thence last Tuesday, sealed up in the same manner I left it.</p>

               <p>How do you know it was that time? - Because the dial was just by me where I sat at the public-house; it was about ten minutes after nine o'clock. I heard of the robbery next day when they were taken up.</p>

I had been three or four weeks at the prisoner's before I went the last voyage: after I received my wages from the East India-house I went to St. Mary-axe, to a man named Kings; the prisoner, his wife, and another person were sitting there - I left three sovereigns there, and then went into a coach; the prisoner, his brother, and a female entered the coach on the starboard side - she fainted on the prisoner's brother's knee; I said, "Why don't you give her air;" I reached to open the window, and the prisoner's wife put her hand into my pocket - her hand was behind her husband, but she dropped the note, and I took it; the prisoner seized my arm, tore my jacket, and gave me a scratched eye, but I put the note into my mouth, and gave it to the Policeman.</p>

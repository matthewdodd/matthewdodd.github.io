               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time was this? A. To the best of my knowledge, about half-past one o'clock - I went into no court with her; she might have followed me through some courts in my way home: I had spent the day with a friend, and had been to church - I then went for a ride in the Regent's-park, and afterwards to a friend's on Laurence Pountney-hill; I then went home with a friend to Bedford-row, and was then going home down Chancery-lane - I had been drinking wine till ten or half-past ten o'clock; I drank perhaps seven or eight glasses of port, and some sherry, but no porter nor spirits - I was sitting two or three hours over my wine: I did say I thought I had lost my watch-chain; I did not go into any dark court with her - I do not know Bishop's-court; there are several courts, but I do not know the names of them: there was no talk on my part about going to any house, and I do not know that she did - I did not countenance any thing of that kind; I am sure that I did not give her what I thought were two shillings, for some little benefit conferred in Bishop's-court - I was not near falling down; no one advised me to go home, as I was in such a state - some one might have said so; my spirits might be elevated from its being the first time I was robbed: wine will raise the spirits without taking the senses - I did not hear any one advise me to go home; I did not let the prisoner go - I gave her in charge.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in Chancery-lane about one o'clock; I went to the place - the prosecutor called Watch! and he gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him of two sovereigns - in taking her along she dropped the sovereigns out of her hand; I took up one, and my brother watchman took up the other - the prosecutor appeared to be rather the worse for liquor; the prisoner owned to robbing him and taking the sovereigns out of his pocket - in going to the watch-house she tried to slip a piece of money into the right-hand cuff of my coat; that was before she dropped them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she drunk? A. I did not perceive it; but the prosecutor was; it was at the end of Bishop's-court I took them - the prosecutor said if she would give him back the money he would not give charge of her; he said in the watch-house that he thought he had lost his watch-chain, but he had not: the prisoner said he wished to have connexion with her - I did not give her an opportunity of escaping; when I heard the call Watch! I went up to the place, and as soon as he said she had robbed him, I took her - I did not hear the watch-house-keeper advise him to go home, because he was in such a state.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you think it at all possible that he might have been with her within a few minutes, and have forgotten it? A. Yes, I do - he was too far gone to have any senses at all.</p>

            . I was officer of the night. I came to the watch-house in about five minutes; I found the prisoner and the prosecutor there - the watchman gave me the two sovereigns; the prisoner admitted that she stole them, and begged for mercy - the prosecutor said if I would give up the two sovereigns she might go, but I would not let her; she did not say he had been with her till she was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you serving in your own right? A. Yes; I am a bricklayer. The prosecutor was not kicking up a little row - he was the worse for liquor, but he could go along the street very well; I should think he could not have forgotten what had taken place -I did not hear him say he had lost his watch-chain; I did not hear that till this evening - I was not there for about five minutes; I was going round to see that all was right- I never said I thought he was so drunk he would not venture to come forward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He gave me two pieces of money- I wished him to go to a house, but he said he had rather stop in the court, which was Bishop's-court; I was with him some time, and did satisfy him.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. USTONSON. Q. Did you make any proposition to give her any money? A. No, none whatever; she did not ask me for money - my way home is down Bishop's-court.</p>

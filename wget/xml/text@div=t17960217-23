            : On Tuesday, the 9th of February, at seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner; I was going from my father's house, in Little Prescot street, to my own house in Gower's-walk, near Whitechapel; I was going along Red Lion-street, into White<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170038"></xptr>chapel; the prisoner walked along with me; I went into a cheesemonger's shop; I took out my box to pay for what I bought; I had a bundle under my arm, containing a counterpane and two curtains; when I came out he was standing at the window; he said, you are heavy loaded, shall I carry it for you; I said, no, I could carry it myself; I went into <placeName id="t17960217-23-crimeloc139">Gower's-walk</placeName>

               <p>Jury. Q. Did you miss your box? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. He did not take your bundle? - A. No; he was stopped at the corner of Union-street; the box was not found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a box was it? - A. A small box; there was half-a-guinea and a shilling in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it? - A. I took the box out of my pocket at the cheesemonger's.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you feel him put his hand into your pocket? - A: No; I heard the box rattle, and then I was alarmed; I put my hand in my pocket and missed it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are sure it was the box that rattled in his hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he say he would see you safe home? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You are sure you put your box in your pocket, at the cheesemonger's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any hole in your pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pull your handkerchief out of your pocket? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He never attempted to take your bundle? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. Not before that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your husband? - A. A farrier.</p>
               <p>Q. A journeyman? - A. Yes; he works with my father, in Little Prescot-street; he is a German.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You went to the Grand Jury some time ago, you know; this man was called up, and there was a mistake in the indictment, and you were desired to indict him again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You told the same story, before the Grand Jury then that you did before? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. He was before indicted for privately stealing from the person, and now for a highway robbery; the name of the husband was stated wrong.</p>
               <p>Court. There is no more pretence for a highway robbery than for-high treason.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Your Lordship knows there is a reward for highway robbery, and none for privately stealing.(The former indictment read).</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Where did you first meet the prisoner? - A. In Red Lion-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Either you touched him, or he touched you, and some conversation took place between you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure no conversation at all took place between you, before you got to the cheesemonger's shop? - A. He said that I was heavily loaded; and I said I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you talk of afterwards, did not he say, it was a fine night, and you said, it was? - A. No; he walked on.</p>
               <p>Q. Some conversation, of course, passed about the weather, or something? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you talk about before you got to the cheesemonger's? - A. Only he asked me if he should carry my bundle for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went on very familiarly together; he talking to you, and you to him; how was that? - A. We did not talk much.</p>
               <p>Q. But you went on talking a little together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what passed between you before you came to Red Lion-street, in Leman-street now? - A. It was in Red Lion-street that I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him, when you went into the shop, that you should not stay long? - A. No; I did not know but he was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say, I shall not be long? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say, he would wait for you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him where you lived, did not you, No. 1l, Gower's-walk? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was it you told him that? - A. In Gower's-walk.</p>
               <p>Q. It is some way from Red Lion-street to Gower's-walk; a quarter of a mile or more? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You conversed together from the cheesemonger's shop; what did you say to him when you came out of the cheesemonger's shop; did not you ask him why he staid so long for you, or something of that sort? - A. I did not say any thing to him; I did not know but what he lived somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you were not at all surprised at his staying for you? - A. I thought it was as free for him as me; I did not think of seeing him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell him to go about his business;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170039"></xptr>that would have been rude, you know; you were not angry with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Therefore you went along sociably together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not quarrel with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you talk about all that time; I don't know whether he said, my dear, or no; but did he not say, it was a dull place, and he would walk down with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were agreeable to his going with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a motto upon the box, was not there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words upon it, can you tell? - A. I can tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. What were tyey? - A."I love too well to kiss and tell."</p>
               <p>Q. You say, he put his arms round your neck? - A. No; he took hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to your own house when this happened; just at the door? - A. No; three or four doors off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect saying, "here is my husband;" and then the man run away? - A. When he had got the box, he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not see him take it? - A. No; I heard it rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect using the word husband? - A. No; I did not mention his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Your husband's name, you know, is Dummert; I know You did not mention his name; but did not you say, here is my husband, accidentally, I suppose; what did you say about your husband; did you think he was opening the door? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Who advised you to after the indictment? - A. One of the gentlemen that was here.</p>
               <p>RICHARD SWINNERTON sworn.</p>
               <p>I live with Elwin and Flower, wholesale silk merchants, in St. Paul's Church-yard: On Tuesday, the 9th of February, a little after seven, I was going to Gower's-walk; turning out of Church-lane into Gower's-walk, the prisoner passed by me, walking; the prosecutrix desired me to stop that man, for he had robbed her; the prisoner ran about an hundred yards; he was not out of my sight; I pursued him to the Prince of Wales, the corner of Union-street; and he was taken round the corner, by a person, before I came up to him; his name, I believe, is Robertson; I never saw the prisoner before; I did not see him talking to her, not she to him; when I first saw him, he was walking, and she was walking after the prisoner; and she said, first of all, "stop that man, stop him, for he has robbed me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did you go with this woman to Clerkenwell, upon the former occasion, as well as the last? - A. Yes; I was twice to find the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the second indictment came to be for robbery? - A. As far as I can find, the officer belonging to the office came out, and said, the indictment was wrong found, because the prosecutrix had not given her husband's two Christian names.</p>

My Lord, on Tuesday afternoon, I left the India warehouses, in Billiter-lane; I went upon duty in Seething-lane; I am a warder, I left my duty about seven o'clock; I stepped down to Butcher-row, to buy a steak, to carry home to my wife and three children; this woman came by and touched me, I said, my dear, I would have made room for you, if you had spoke; she said, there is room for me, we sell into discourse; she said, she was going into the cheesemonger's shop; I said, I would stop for her; when she got her cheese, she came out, and we walked along, and she said hold of my arm; we went as far as Church-lane, Whitechapel; I told her I was going up Brick-lane; she asked me which was the best way for her to go, up that lane, or up Union-street; I told her Church-lane was the best, because it was paved; she told me she lived in Gower's-walk, and I would, if she liked, walk with her; I was just going to leave her, and she took hold of my arm again; she said, she would not like to see her husband, her husband was a jealous man; she gave me liberties not proper to speak before women, and I took liberties with her; I kissed her afterwards; I found she was a woman with child; I kissed her, and shook hands with her; she said, there was her husband at the corner, and I went away in a hurry, and she called out, stop thief; this young fellow was at the corner all the while, he did not come after me till I got over the way; the man, at the public-house, said, oh, we want you; I pulled out my money, I had 1s. 4d1/4 I had had a pint of beer at a house in Seething-lane; the woman said it was not her shilling; he took my knife from me, and I was locked up; after it was put down what the good woman said, there were two Jews said, "damn him, we will do for him;" they went out, and in about ten minutes the two Jews and this man came back, and pretended they had picked up this box in the middle of the road; I have watched thirteen years in Crosby-square, besides doing business; my character is well known, I have done duty at the India-house.</p>

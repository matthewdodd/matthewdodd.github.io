I live at the Queen's Head public-house—on Sunday, 20th March, the prisoner came there—I served him with a glass of ale—he gave me a half-crown in payment—I put it in the till—I noticed that there was no other half-crown in the till—I gave the prisoner change, and he left—in a short time after the prisoner had gone (in ten minutes perhaps) I saw my niece go to the till—I had been at the bar during that time, and no other half-crown had been taken—I saw my niece take out half a crown and bend it—I afterwards gave it up to the constable—I should know it again—on Monday, 21st March, the prisoner came again—I recognized him—he asked me for twopenny-worth of rum—he gave me a half-crown in payment—I looked at it and found it was bad—Mr. Willsher was there at that time, he took it out of my hand and said it was a bad one—the prisoner did not say anything to that—he was given into custody on that occasion—I am the aunt of the last witness—this is the half-crown that my niece bent that I took on the Sunday.</p>

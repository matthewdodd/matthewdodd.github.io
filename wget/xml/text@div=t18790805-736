                  </hi>. I am a grocer—in September last the prisoner brought me this prospectus of J. C. Morrisson and Co.'s Debt Recovery and Mer<lb></lb>cantile Office, for which he said he was agent, and asked if he could collect any debts for me—I said that I had none then—he made five or six weekly calls afterwards, and believing him to be an agent of the Globe Society, I gave him this written authority to collect debts from Mr. Biggs and Mrs. White, and said, "I have your prospectus;" he said, "Yes, you have"—I have not received any money which he has collected from Mr. Biggs or Mrs. White—after some time I made inquiries and could not find the prisoner—he then called and said that Mr. Biggs would pay in two instalments, and Mrs. White 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. monthly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> You called weekly as the agent of the Globe Debt Recovery Office—I have known J. C. Morrisson and Co., 15 or 20 years, through friends and advertisements, and my reason for giving you the account was that I knew that their office was in existence—I do not dispute giving you authority in both cases—I received a notice that Mr. Biggs had paid, it was not from 110, Old Street, there was no address on it—I tried all I could to find you, but you had gone away and left no address—when I found you you were going by the name of Etherington—I went to the address on the prospectus, and from there to Gloucester Terrace, and then to the County Court, Edmonton, but could not get any information—</p>

               <p>I went to Ilford Police-court on 28th May, through seeing 'i report in a newspaper—I went up to you outside the Court and asked you when you were going to settle with me; you said that anything due to me would be paid as soon as the books then held by the police were returned—I said that I would engage Counsel and see what I could do for you, or I would get two or three to club together—I afterwards wrote this letter to you: "Sir, I beg to say that unless the money collected for me is forwarded at once I shall communicate with the Treasury and ask them to take the matter in hand"—if I had got the money I do not know that I should not have prosecuted you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I received this letter in reply, containing this receipt in the defendant's writing on one of the Albion forms, for the money received from Mrs. White, and this other receipt came to me in February—I cannot swear to it being the defendant's writing, but it is on one of the Albion forms, Albert B. Bond, General Manager—I then went to his local office and found that he had gone away—I went to the police when I saw it in the papers, but they did not give me much assistance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">By the Prisoner.</hi> The amount here stated is correct all but 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was to be made up next time you called—I sent you a letter dated 16th June; I have not a copy of it—I was anxious not to punish you or put you to any inconvenience if I could help it—I do not think I wrote a letter saying that I was going to apply to a Magistrate—I went to your wife, but said very few words to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, St-George's Square, Upton—I was indebted to the prosecutor last year, and Mrs. Bond called on me—in consequence of what she said I paid her 31. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she afterwards gave me this receipt, signed by the defendant, but I never saw him—I paid money twice.</p>

                  </hi>. I am proprietor of the Globe Debt Recovery Office—I do not know the prisoner, but on 8th July last year we appointed an agent, H. C. Bard, and I understand the prisoner is the person—this receipt is not in my writing, and I never saw the money—I never autho<lb></lb>rised the prisoner personally to collect money—I have never done business with Mr. Pearson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I sent prospectuses to H. C. Bard, and appointed him agent to my office, but I never saw him—we do it by letter, and had some references also by letter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The charge has been altered. The first charge was for embezzling the amount, and he wished to prove that I was a servant in his employ. The Clerk of the Court stated that the prisoner was com<lb></lb>mitted by the Magistrate for embezzlement, and thai leave of the Court was afterwards obtained to indict him for obtaining the money by false pretences.</p>

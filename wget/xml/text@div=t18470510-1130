                  </hi>. I live in Size-lane. On the 10th of May, about ten o'clock, I was at the top of Cheapside—I saw the prisoner and another person following a gentleman—I saw the prisoner put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, and take this handkerchief out—I had not time to stop the gentleman—he went on—I took the prisoner with this handkerchief in his hand—I think he took it out of the gentleman's right-hand pocket—I do not know who the gentleman was.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you see me put my hand into the gentleman's pocket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw you touch the pocket—I did not see you distinctly take the hand<lb></lb>kerchief out—there were three or four persons close by—I saw you running away with the handkerchief, and caught you with it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was with a young man in a public-house; he had spend all his money, and asked me to sell or pawn this handkerchief for him; I was going down the street, and this witness accused me of stealing it—he made a strike at me, and I warded the blow off with my hand.</p>

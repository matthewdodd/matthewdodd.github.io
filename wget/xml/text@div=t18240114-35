I'll give her the halfpenny," and thrust his hand into my breeches pocket; I gave him a knock on the head, and thrust him away, and after that he put his hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took out a halfpenny - he was a stranger to me. He followed me down to the end of the passage, and I caught his hand in my breeches pocket again; he took my silver out - I called for the watchman, and gave him in charge. I saw him give the watchman something, and he then set him at liberty - he ran off, and was taken next day. I lost 18 s. from my breeches pocket. I live at Chelsea-common, on a small income, and had been to receive some money in Cross-street.</p>

            . The prosecutor called at my master's for me to assist him home; he seemed very drunk - he could walk a little. We met the prisoner on the steps of Lansdown-passage with two more; one of whom I knew, and spoke to. Wright was going to give the woman a halfpenny - the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, and said,</p>
               <p>"Let me give it her." Mr. Wright pushed him down, and he pushed my master's son down, and said he could see him home better than us. I did not see his hand in Wright's pocket, but Wright called out,</p>
               <p>"Stop thief, I have caught your hand in my pocket." I shewed him to the watchman, and he said he should not follow him. He ran off, and was taken two days afterwards. Wright said next day that he had lost 18 s. He had heard me call Wright by his name.</p>

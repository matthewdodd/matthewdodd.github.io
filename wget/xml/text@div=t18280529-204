On the 16th of May I was at a public-house in Gray's Inn-lane - I threw off my shawl when I went in; I missed it, and said to the prisoner, who sat there, "Have you seen my shawl?" she said No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where had you come from? A. From Deptford; I was fatigued, and went there for refreshment; I had been to no other public-house - I had a glass of ale and a biscuit; I was perfectly collected: I was low, as I had just heard of a gentleman's death. I had not met the prisoner in the street; I had no victuals with me; I went to the Bell and Crown, and slept there that night, as the officers took me there; I was not drunk. I am an officer's widow, and have a pension. I had been to look for a situation; I complained of being tired; the prisoner said, "I am a colonel's widow - you can go an sleep with me at Clerkenwell, and go to Deptford to-morrow;" I said I would think of it; I cannot swear whether I had any gin and peppermint - I never drink gin and cloves.</p>

On the 16th of May, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prosecutrix came in, alone; I saw her talking to the prisoner in the house - she called for a glass of ale, and then said she had lost a shawl; the prisoner had then gone to the back part of the house - I told her I had seen no shawl on her; but the prisoner was charged with it, and it was found secreted under her clothes - I took it from her, and gave it to the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were they not both very gay? - A. They were both drunk; the prisoner behaved very ill, and would not leave the place; the prosecutrix drank a glass of gin and cloves.</p>

             sworn.(The witnesses examined apart, by the prisoner's desire.)</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - I am a patrol in Castlebaynard ward.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing particular taking place on the 3d of February? - Yes. There is another patrol besides me, and we were on our round between twelve and one. I was coming along Great Knight-rider-street. There was a coachman and coach there; it being frosty weather, the coach had got into a sort of bog. When I got to the end of Sermon-lane, I heard the cry of, Watch, and Murder! and I ran up to the upper end, where I heard the noise, and there was another watchman that was on that beat, that got into this house before me, (into this house where Mr. Dunn was) the corner of <placeName id="t17950416-52-crimeloc298">Sermon-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Does the prisoner live in that house? - That is more than I can tell you. He was in the house, but it was the wife that I saw below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner there? - Not at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get into the house? - I did. The woman, Mrs. Harvey, stood in the passage, wringing her hands, begging of the watchman for God's sake to give her a light. I desired the watchman to open his lanthorn, and if he had a bit of candle to give her. He had none. She said she had plenty up stairs, but she was afraid to go up for it. I asked her what for? She said that her husband was crazy, and in liquor, and she was afraid he would murder her. I then called to another watchman to give her a light. Just as soon as we got out of the door, the prisoner followed us out with a pair of pistols, one in each hand, and he followed us out, it may be forty or fifty yards down the street, swearing that he would blow our brains out; so I turned to him, and asked him, what would you blow out my brains for? I am a servant of the ward.</p>

               <p>Q. The woman said, my husband, who did you suppose she meant by that? - I don't know that. He wanted to know what brought us nigh his home; so after telling him I was the servant of the ward, he said, go along about your business, and the first watchman that I meet again coming nigh my house, I will blow his brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this in or out of the house that he said this? - Out of the house. As soon as I got down to the lane's end, I met two more watchmen, and consulted with them to see what was best to be done; and out of the Black Swan passage, just facing the corner of Mrs. Harvey's house, Price, the deceased, came out there, and he sprung a rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner then returned to Mrs. Harvey's house? - Yes, he was in the house then. He was at this time inside of the house, and the door shut on him. I went up to the man that sprung the rattle, and I clapped my left hand to his breast; says I, no more of that. Another of the watchmen followed me, coming up as far as the middle of Sermon-lane, springing his rattle after me. I checked him for that, and desired him to go along directly to his beat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - I told Price, and a man of the name of Butler,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160105"></xptr>that is here (I met them going into the Black Swan passage before me,) and I says to them, now, mind what I tell you, if you do not, I will report you, each man keep to his beat, and make no more object of that house than any other house, and by the time we may be got round again, it may be about a quarter of an hour, and this man may be got to sleep. I sent Butler Sermon-lane way, and I went round the church-yard, with Price, the deceased. I turned down Paul's Chain with him, and we came along little Carter-lane. Now, says I, let me go before you, for he can see you when he cannot me; I did get a few yards before him, and the prisoner was at the first pair of stairs window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that when you were going to pass by Mrs. Harvey's house? - Yes; I was coming up towards it; when I came to Mrs. Harvey's, I see the prisoner at the one pair of stairs window, with the piece projected out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the fire-arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time was the deceased with you? - Yes. I turned back to the deceased again, and I told him, you must go the reverse round your beat again; for, says I, this man is like a fowler, with his piece levelled out at the window; and says I, leave me to watch his motion. In a few minutes after this, he came down stairs, the prisoner did, and he went along Carter-lane, for about the value of thirty or forty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he at this time any thing in his hands? - He had a pistol, if not two, but I will not take on me to say whether he had two or no, but he had one pistol, which I can clearly swear to, and he called out Watch, Watch, twice, where are you now, you thieves?</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you at the time? - I kept as close to him as possible with propriety, perhaps about fifty yards. He came down along then, and faced Great Carter-lane, as if returning home, and passed his house, and faced off Carter-lane, and he called out, Watch, there in Great Carter-lane. There was a spare man that belonged to us there, and it was his second night of doing duty, and he came up to him, and said, he would blow his brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say so? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear that watchman say any thing to him? - There were a good many words passed; he begged his life, and said he did not know him, and begged, for God's sake, he would not blow his brains out. The prisoner said he knew him, he was one of the thieves that was about his house. The prisoner left the watchman then, and faced towards home; and getting up Little Carter-lane, he fired a pistol wantonly, out of bravado, and then he got into his own house, if it be his house, or Mrs. Harvey's house. Then I gave the charge to all the watchmen, for every man to keep regularly round his beat, and not to crowd about the house; and then I came to the officer of the night, and told him what had happened, in the watch-house; and the other patrol, I desired him to make his off-set, and desired him to keep the watchmen separate, or else there would be mischief done; and then I went out no more that night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This watchman, the deceased, I believe his beat did not extend to the prisoner's house? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first came to the prisoner's house, I believe you heard a considerable noise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first came up to the house, and see Mrs. Harvey, did she not tell you (recollect as well as you can) that she was afraid to go up stairs, for she thought the man was crazy? - She said, he was crazy, and in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that she added, and in liquor? - I am sure she said he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the woman, besides saying that he was crazy, said that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160106"></xptr>he was in liquor? - Yes, I am; and she said, he has got a pistol above stairs, well prepared. Indeed, mammy, said the little girl, he has got two and a gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the house? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing thrown about? - Yes, some tea-tackle.</p>
               <p>Q. A considerable quantity laying on the floor, perhaps? - There may be between three and four cups and saucers, and a tea-pot broke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any child's victuals scattered about? - I cannot say that I noticed that.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you the curiosity to go into the bed-room at that time, either before or after this melancholy accident took place? - The next day I was up in the bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the state in which the curtains of the bed were? - Upon my word, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see, among other things, a jug of water broke? - I cannot say, indeed; if I did, I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this man, in Carter-lane, fired a pistol off wantonly, I want to know what you mean by wantonly; there was no person there to be fired at? - No, there was not.</p>

               <p>Q. You more than once repeated your desire to the watchmen, that they might not go to disturb him? - Not to notice the house more than any other.</p>
               <p>Q. That you thought necessary to repeat twice? - I did, if not more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you add at the time, that you thought the man was crazy, and might do mischief? you yourself thought he was mad at that time? - As for madness I will not take on myself to say, but I know he was in a mad humour.</p>
               <p>Q. You not only mentioned it to them and the constable of the night, but to several strangers; you mentioned it to the man that went out after you to give them the same charge? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The man was calling the watchmen thieves? - His language was, you bloody thieves, the first I catch coming nigh my house, I will blow your brains out.</p>
               <p>Q. He seemed to have no resentment against any person, but persons under the description of watchmen? - No, not that I conceived.</p>
               <p>Q. You found that with good words, so far as yourself was concerned, you pacified him very easily? - Yes; when he had parted with me he went into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that fair words had effect on him? - Yes, that was what took effect on him, I could see nothing else take effect on him but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear a gun fired out of the window at the time you was a good way from the house? - No; but after I got into the watch-house I heard the report of two, whether they were pistols or guns I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not observe that the springing the rattles seemed to make the man wilder? - He was in the house when Price, the deceased sprung his rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you said that Price sprung his rattle twice? - No, it was another man up Sermen-lane that sprung the rattle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing what effect the noise of the rattle had upon his mind? - No, I did not see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come out of the house a second time before the noise of the rattle? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. If I understand you right, you heard three guns fired off, you saw one and heard two afterwards? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

Do you remember going with Fitzgerald on the night of the 3d of February, on hearing some noise? - Yes, I went to Sermon-lane, to Dunn's house, where the prisoner lived; I heard a noise of murder, before I got to the door; after that I heard a voce say, watch! when Fitzgerald came up, he asked me what was the matter? the woman, Mrs. Harvey, opened the door; she told me afterwards she was Dunn's wife; she said to me and the patrol, come in; I walked in first, the patrol followed me; when I came into the room the woman had no light; the woman says to me, watchman, give me a bit of candle; I answered I have none but what is burnt; the patrol made answer, if you have a bit give it her; I immediately opened my lanthorn, in my lanthorn was a save-all, on that save-all was a small bit of candle, I light the candle, and gave the candle and save-all into the woman's hand; the woman made answer, I have light enough up stairs, but I durst not go after it, for I am afraid I shall be murdered; she said he kept a pistol up stairs loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you understand by that? - She said no further than that; a little girl made answer, yes, mammy, he has two and a gun; immediately I heard the footsteps of somebody coming up stairs in a hurry, I took myself out of the house into Sermon-lane, the patrol with me; and Dunn came after us down the lane, saying, you bloody watchmen, I will blow your brains out; we both went to the bottom of the lane, then we both turned round and faced Dunn, and Fitzgerald said to Dunn, what makes you to follow us, we have not affronted you, nor do we intend to affront you; he made answer again, you bloody watchmen, I will blow your brains out, he then at that time went back to his own house, and Fitzgerald and I we went round our</p>
               <p>Q. After that how soon did you see or heard any thing of him? - I see him at a distance about a quarter of an hour after, in Sermon-lane, with a brace of pistols in his hand, when I saw the pistols in his hand, I thought I would keep out of his sight till my two hours were out, and I came to be relieved; I went round between the hours of one and two; I was coming down Carter-lane, three quarters of an hour afterwards, Price, who was then on the other side of Carter-lane, on the Old Change beat, says to me, partner, what had we best do in this matter? he said, I think it will be proper to acquaint Mr. Strutton with it; within a few minutes after this he came up after me, saying, you bloody watchman, I will blow your brains out; I ran across Carter-lane, into King's Head passage, Dunn followed me into the passage; I thought it would be proper to put my light out, I had no time to stop to put it out.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you put your light out? - To shun Dunn, thinking if he lost my light he might lose me; I shook my light out, and when the light was out Dunn did not come through the passage, but he stopped there; I went through the passage into St. Paul's Church-yard, to the opening of the Black Swan-passage, there a man came to me, one Mr. Simpson by name, saying to me, watchman-</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do? - I then heard some voice coming up St. Paul's Churchyard, supposing it was some just come from the watch-house, that Price was gone for; they came no further than Paul's Chain, went down Paul's Chain, came up Carter-lane, I went down Carter-lane, expecting to meet them in Carter-lane, which was facing Dunn's house. When I came to the end of the passage they were not come up, I went a little way up the passage again, I then see<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160108"></xptr>Dunn standing in Sermon-lane, a little way off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he at that time any thing in his hand? - He had a gun. When the man came up Carter-lane to Sermon-lane, they entered the opening of the lane, and just at the entrance of the lane Dunn presented his piece immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he present his piece to? - I don't know exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the company? - I see Mr. Crickett for one, and Mr. Shutt for another, and Price, and one Green, as they drew nigh towards Dunn, Dunn fired the piece.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing at that time? - Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the effect of that piece being fired? - Price immediately dropped to the ground after the report of the piece, I instantly stooped to Price, saying Price, are you shot? Price answered me slowly, I am; I immediately saw Price's coat on fire, on the right breast, I clapped my hand on it, to put the fire out; I put the fire out of his coat, and the blood of his body gushed out. He was a dead man within five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Dunn secured on the spot? - He was, Mr. Crickett first took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Putner, at the time that you first went to this house, you immediately saw Mrs. Harvey, the woman? - Within a minute or two.</p>

               <p>Q. I believe she seemed to be in a considerable slurry and alarmed? - She did, she wanted a light, but she was afraid to go up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you why she was afraid to go up stairs? - She told me she was afraid to go up, for fear she should be murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing of this sort, that he was out of his senses, or that he was mad? - Not a word of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing of this sort, that he was crazy? - Not a word of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with Fitzgerald at this time? - I was with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not hear him say that he was crazy, and in liquor? - I heard her say that he had drank liquor, more than he ought to do.</p>
               <p>Q. When you see Dunn, from the whole appearance of him, did you believe him to be a person in his senses, through his whole conduct? - He seemed a man very resolute; I cannot think the man any way crazy.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you said you would go to Strutton; what is he? - He is a hair dresser.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any other occupation besides that? - I don't know whether he has or no.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that he is the keeper of a mad-house? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the room after Dunn was apprehended? - I was fully employed with the man that was shot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into Dunn's room, after the prisoner was apprehended? - Yes, I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing there with respect to the appearance of the room? - Yes, there was a deal of furniture broken up, earthen ware chiefly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into his bed room? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any boxes in the room? - I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You was asked about Strutton. Perhaps you know Strutton? - Yes, I do know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he any thing to do with the watch? - He has.</p>
               <p>Q. It was for that purpose you meant to go to him? - It was.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160109"></xptr>Q. Do you remember any thing that happened on the night of the 3d of February last? - I do; about one o'clock I heard a great noise, and hear the cry of murder, from Mrs. Harvey's daughter; I opened the door, and looked out, and did not see the door opened, and I shut my own again, and a little after that I heard a very great noise, and the watch was called, and there was a noise in the house, with the watchmen and the prisoner at the bar as it appeared to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come from the house? - I see the watchmen come and the prisoner, he drove the watchman down Sermon-lane. I see him return and go in doors, after that the window was thrown up of the bed room and a pistol fired; I see the window thrown up, but I did not see the pistol put out of the window, I heard the report of it; I see the prisoner after that in my one pair of stairs room, and through one of the holes of the window shutters I see him load two pistols, when he had loaded them, I see him take hold of some other piece which I thought was a blunderbuss or a gun; while he was loading these pieces, he swore that he would shoot some bloody sons of bitches of watchmen or some damn'd fellow of a watchman. I cannot exactly repeat word for word; the girl cried murder, and begged her mother to stop him from going out.</p>
               <p>Q. What girl? - Mrs. Harvey's daughter. I see him come out of the house with two pistols in his hand, and he held the pistols out in his hands with his arm stretched out and said, who set the watch, bl-st the watch, bloody watch, d-n the watch; b-gg-r the watch; the first bloody b-gg-r of a watchman that comes to me I will shoot him; this was in Sermon-lane that these expressions were made use of. He turned to the right hand and went down Little Carter-lane, towards the Old Change, repeating the same expressions as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him do any thing there? - Nothing there, but going backward and forward, he returned back towards Great Carter-lane, still using the language about the watchmen as he did before; he got into Carter-lane, and there I heard some words with somebody, I supposed it was with some of the watchmen, he returned back again; he was about Mr. Simpson's door in Little Carter-lane when he fired one of the pistols off. He went down Sermon-lane, returned back again about the middle of Sermon-lane; he fired another pistol, the balls of which lodged in my doorpost; immediately after the second pistol was fired off the watchmen sprang their rattles; immediately after the watchmen had sprung their rattles, he came to the top of Sermon-lane and looked down Carter-lane, towards Paul's Chain he saw the watchmen and several people coming towards him, he looked at them, he went to the door of the house that he came out of where he lived, kicked with his foot and knocked with his elbow three or four times, he could gain no admittance. I see him put the two pistols down at the side of the house; I see him take the carbine from his side and put the piece to his shoulder, and called the people about him and swore he would shoot the first bloody b-gg-r that came nigh him; the people ran back towards Paul's Chain. I see a man come round the corner in a blue great coat, by the name of Bailey, a Plaisterer; the prisoner was standing just by his own door at the time that this person, by the name of Bailey, the Plaisterer, crossed over to him, the prisoner at the bar asked him what he wanted? he told him nothing; he asked him where he was going? he told him he was going home; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160110"></xptr>bl-st you, go home immediately. After this I see Price, the <rs id="t17950416-52-viclabel299" type="occupation">watchman</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17950416-52-victim523 t17950416-52-viclabel299"></join>, cross over the way to him, he was then about two feet from the muzzle of the piece as nigh as I could guess; and he said to him, you bloody b-gg-r of a watchman I will send you to d-nation or hell, I cannot tell expressly which words he used. I see him fire the piece, the contents of which went close to the watchman's right breast, the watchman immediately fell, the wadding was a light on the outside of his coat; the watchman when he fell said, O Lord, three times, I am shot; I heard the prisoner say no more till I got into the street. I immediately went down stairs and went into the street, the watchman was laying on his back; I went up to the prisoner and said you d-mn'd rascal, how could you shoot this innocent man? he told me the man could not be killed, for there was nothing but powder and wadding in the piece. They wanted to remove the dead body to my house, and I said it should not go there, where the tree fell there it should lay; I see the murderer come out of that house, and there the dead body should go in; I called some time and they would not open the door, and I said, if they would not open the door I would go home for an axe and break every pannel of the door in; when Mrs. Harvey opened the door I told her it was her fault, because she would not open the door when Dunn knocked, she said she was afraid to open the door because he would have killed her. I told her it was better to kill her then to kill an innocent man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You see him fire off a pistol before this accident? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person at hand then? - No; I looked upon it he fired them off wantonly without any object at all, I looked down Sermon-lane both ways, and could see nobody coming.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - About a quarter before two, on the 4th of February as nigh as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the girl that cried murder not Mrs. Harvey? - I never heard Mrs. Harvey cry murder.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person within the reach of the man when the gun was fired off? - I see no person but Bailey, the plaisterer, and Price, the watchman, these were the only three persons in Sermon-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in this way wandering about the street? - Better than three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that the window was thrown up and the pistol fired out was the Lane empty then? - I presume there was no aim at any body then.</p>
               <p>Q. So that was the third pistol fired without any aim at all. Did you hear Fitzgerald give any directions about Dunn? - Yes; I heard Mr. Birkwood desire him to go to bed. This was not in the street, it was when he was up stairs in the room at the window.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in the night that this melancholy affair took place? - It was in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this melancholy thing happened? - As nigh as I can recollect three quarters of an hour. I see him come out of his own house, and he did not come into the Lane directly after, he went far away; but when he came into the Lane where I was, he fired one pistol before he came to my door, and then I lost sight of him till he met the watchman, and then he fired another pistol which I believe shot the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before, as you live in the neighbourhood? - I see Mr. Dunn the day before and conversed with him.</p>
               <p>Q.

You have had frequent opportunities of course of making your observations on the state of mind of the prisoner at the bar? - Yes; I have worked with him better than a twelvemonth at Mr. Harris, the soap maker's. It is near now two years ago, sometimes he would take a fit and sit down, and would not work nor speak to me nor any body else; and sometimes he would work twice as much as at other times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be a man in his senses at all times or deranged? - Sometimes he would take fits and speak foolish, and sometimes not speak at all; perhaps, some mornings I could hardly get him up to go to work, and then perhaps he would take that sit no more. I know that part of his behaviour did not shew that he was a man in his senses at all times.</p>

Tell us the deportment of the man, and what seemed to be his conduct during that particular period? - In general I have seen him in a state of lunacy which was the occasion of my leaving him, I could not stay any longer with him; I left him on that account about a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us in what way that lunacy shewed itself? - I slept with him in the same bed. I have gone to work with him to Mr. Harris's, and he has been there in the morning, and I have advised him several things and he would not take my advice; and he has taken and tore his clothes in pieces, and I could not see any reason he had for doing it, and I see him have a kind of froth come out of his mouth when he was in a mad state of lunacy.</p>

               <p>Mr. Trebeck. The time you speak of is the time that your cousin speaks of? - No, it was not, but it was in the same house, and the same employment below stairs in the cellar.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Harris see him occasionally? - Not very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid him his wages? - Mr. Harris paid him Saturday night, in the ounting house.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not think it necessary to take any particular care of him, confine him, or any thing of that sort? - He was under the care of a doctor that lived at Dalmahoy's, at Ludgate-hill; he has gone to Dublin now, and in business for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. After he left Mr. Harris's service, where did he go? - He went to live with one Mr. Yeate, who lives at No. 157, in the Borough, Chymist and Druggist, to carry out loads occasionally.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he employed by him? - I cannot justly say, as near as I can guess, half a year.</p>

What quantity of victuals were these? - There was a little better than half a pint; he came down and he reached to the cupboard, where a quantity of moist sugar was in a bason between half a pound and a pound, and he emptied it all into the child's victuals that stood on the table, then he threw it instantly against the grate, which surprized me, and I asked him if he was mad? he then reached to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160113"></xptr>the mantle piece, and broke all the china, and all the things that stood on it as fast as he could throw them down; he then went round to the shelves, and as he went round the room he broke all the things in the same manner; he then went to the window and took down a wash hand bason and pitcher of water, and emptied the pitcher of water about the room. The whole space of time he walked in such a manner that his legs were higher than his head, and as he walked round the room, he lifted himself, and put himself in such a posture, and when he threw down the pitcher, it so alarmed me that I got up to try to pacify him; he made no answer, but the blood and slabber ran out of each side of his mouth; this alarmed me so much that I ran into the passage, and he took the candle and ran up stairs. The street door was not quite fastened, I pulled it further open, for I see a light through the crevice of the door; I then see a watchman and patrol close against the door, I asked them to give me a candle, as I had no light, they asked me if I had no candle in the house? I told them I had plenty up stairs, but I was afraid to go for it for fear of Dunn; they were then lighting the bit of candle and the report of a gun went off up stairs: I ran up stairs, and met him coming down, and I heard him say how came his street door open, what business have you to disturb me in my own house, are you come to rob me? he then returned up stairs, looked out of the window, and opened the window, and put some powder in the gun, and put it out of the window, I was in the room with him then; he in a short space of time fired it off after he had looked out, he then threw it on the floor. The rattles sprung at different times, during this he looked out of the window and he said, the thieves are about the house, I see I must make them go; he then ran down stairs with the fire arms in his hands and returned again in a saw minutes; he then reached an old sword and began to cut the curtains of the bed to pieces, he then cut great gashes in the chest of drawers, and broke the sword in the wainscotting of the room, and broke the door to pieces; I then strove to pacify him; he seemed to recollect himself a little, I begged him to go to bed, and I unbuttoned three buttons in his waistcoat, I asked him if he meant to kill me? I meant by the fright; he said no, I was dearer to him than his own soul, and he killed me; during this the noise, and the rattles in the street continued, and he catched up the fire arms and ran down stairs with them; I heard a great noise in the street, and I heard the report of two pistols, somebody knocked at the street door with great violence, our lock is a spring lock, and it was double locked; I went and strove to open it, but I could not because I could not directly find the key, I then heard the report of a gun, and people crying in the street, the man is dead! I thought it was Dunn that was dead, and I strove to find the key to get the door open, at lad I got the door open, and then they brought in the deceased. When the corps was brought in, there were two men, Putner and another, set up all the night with the dead man in my room below, I had some occasion to go down for my ring, I said, Putner, had you hold of this man before the piece went off? he said he had.</p>
               <p>Q. To Putner. Did you say to this woman that you had hold of the prisoner at the bar before the man was killed? -  I never said so, nor no person had hold of him before the piece was tired.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. The prisoner lived with you as you have described for some time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do I conclude fairly that you mean that I should collect from your evidence that he was out of his senses at times? - I thought him so.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160114"></xptr>Q. At different times? - Once before. I cannot say to the time, it may be six months before.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet having seen him in that situation you who were not married to him chose to live with him as his wife? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us of the manner in which he broke the sword; I believe the watchmen were up the next day in the room? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew them the curtains and bureau? - I did not. I believe there were a great many saw that the sword was broke left in the wainscot.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you recollect to have asked Putner a question which was very natural, the next day you must be more collected; did you shew any body the curtains or any thing that you have mentioned now? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he spent his evening? - I do not, he told me different places; he never would satisfy me.</p>
               <p>BLADEN sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. This man lived with you, I understand, for how long? - I was at home at the time above a fortnight or three weeks.</p>

               <p>I was spending the evening, Tuesday evening, the 3d of February in Trinity-lane, on my return home about one o'clock, I see the prisoner. I heard a noise first of all, and I saw the prisoner walking about the street with fire arms. I then after that see him go to his own door and desired to get in; by some means or other he could not get in, and some watchman or other got hold of him. There was a kind of scuffle ensued. There were two or three watchmen, I did not pay any particular attention, and in the scuffle the piece went off.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. What are you? - I am a grocer in Dean-street, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr Cricket at that instant you describe? - I did not pay any attention to any person scarcely; I only see a kind of scuffle, and the piece went off, and then I went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a man killed by this accident? - I was not very near. I see two or three men together and very odd kind of language was being made use of, and a kind of scuffle appeared to me as I stood at a distance, I did not choose to go near for fear something might happen to myself.</p>
               <p>Q. After the scuffle and the piece went off, did you observe a man fall? - I observed a man fall, and a man knocked at the door and the deceased was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember how many persons were present? - There appeared to me to be four or five, or five or six. There were other persons walking about the streets; there were four or five different people at the time that accident happened with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they of course saw all that you have now stated? - They appeared to be a watchmen.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you went away seeing the man drop down? - A lusty gentleman knocked at the doors and desired the deceased might be taken in there, and I instantly went away. I asked no question whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. How happened you to give an account of this? - They found me; I was a few days after at a public house, the house I use in Charles-court, in the Strand, and I saw in the paper that he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who? - The prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his name at that time? - I did not, but the circumstance struck me. I was saying what a shocking circumstance it was, and the master of the house or some person there asked me who I was, and where I lived, and whether I would choose to come here to relate that circumstance?</p>
               <p>Q. What house was this? - At the Bell.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person that asked you this? - It is a person I had some trifling knowledge of, but I don't know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Who applied to you? - The brother to Dunn; he said his name was Dunn.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not inquire, perhaps, particularly? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did he apply to you? - I suppose it might be in the course of two or three days after I see it in the paper.</p>

               <p>Q. Then it was in the course of a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160116"></xptr>week after? - It was. He came to me, and asked me if I knew any thing of the circumstance that happened on the 4th of February, in the morning? I said, I was coming past at the time and I saw some little of the transaction; and he said, my brother's life is in danger; it is a very disagreeable situation, will you come forward, if you are subpoenaed, to say what you know about it? - I said in such consideration as that, I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you how he found you out? - By being at this man's in Charles-court; in the Strand; I understood, that the man that keeps the public house knows Dunn's brother, Dunn's brother told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the master of the public house knew you? - Certainly he had some knowledge of me because he used to serve me with beer; he knew where I lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the Coroner's Inquest? - No; I did not take any further notice of it; I told him, when his trial came on, if I was subpoenaed, I would come forward.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you did not speak to any body at the time that this affair happened? - There was nobody there that I knew. I might say, what an affair this is, as any other person might say when any thing happens in the street.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know the prisoner at the bar before that time? - Never see him in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known his brother? - I don't know his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no piece levelled at the man at all? - I was not near enough to see that. There was a scuffle and I cannot say whether he shot the man accidentally or whether it was levelled or no.</p>

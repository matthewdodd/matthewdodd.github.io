            . I was at the corner of Brook-street, when I heard the cry of Thieves, I saw some chair-men run, so I run. As I was going by the prisoner he asked me what was the matter, saying, had any body lost any thing; said I, a gentlewoman has lost a cloak: He said there were two men gone up Bond-street, adding, they ought to be hanged that did it. I saw something under his coat like a cloak, being about two yards from him. When the chair-men came back, I said, I had a strong suspicion of this Man; by this time he had dropped the cloak, and it was taken up at his foot. The gentlewoman described it. We desired he'd let us see his hand, which was very dirty between the fingers with soft mud.</p>

            . I was standing at Mr. Murray's door, and saw the prisoner cross the road and pick up a waistcoat which he put under his coat - he ran up Farthing-alley; he turned round and saw me watching him - he then went into a house and came out without the waistcoat, he came down the alley, and went up Butler's-buildings, and in a short time he came down without his coat; I informed an officer who took him - we went and got the waistcoat; I am certain he is the man - I should have stopped him, but did not know but that he was going to take it to some person at the Docks.</p>

On the 30th of October, about a quarter or half-past three o'clock, I saw the prisoner come up the alley, with something under his jacket, and go by my door; I noticed him particularly, by seeing Mr. Parker watch him - this gave me a suspicion; he made a stop several times in going up the court, and at last went into Mrs. Price's, which is the end house, and when he came out he had nothing; I went and told Mrs. Price.</p>

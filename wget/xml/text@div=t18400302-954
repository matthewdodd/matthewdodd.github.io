                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live in Tabernacle-walk, Finsbury, in the parish of St. Luke—it is my dwelling-house. On the 15th of February, a little after four o'clock in the afternoon, I heard my shop window cracked two or three distinct times, and on going there I observed it had been cracked—I remained there, and saw the prisoner return and break the window in with his hand, or some instrument in his hand—I went to the door, took hold of him, and brought him back to the shop, and while I was waiting for a policeman he assaulted me and a man who I called in to my assistance, and also my wife, by striking us—he kicked me in a certain place, and he struck the person I called in in the face, and gave him a black eye, and he did a good deal of damage in the shop—I had satin waist coating and different articles in the window—we detained him till a policeman arrived.</p>

Wall called me—I went, and found the prisoner, and assisted in detaining him—Wall accused him of breaking the window—he tried to get away, and told me to let go of him, which I did, he then rushed to the door, but was detained—he pulled himself away from me, and struck me in the face.</p>

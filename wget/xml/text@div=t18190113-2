               <p>Q. Were you not an unfortunate girl - A. No. I did not know the prisoners before, I had not been drinking with them that night, and was never in the public-house in my life. I cannot say how they knew that I had money, I had told nobody of it. I received it in Tothill-street, of a gentleman who is butler to Lord Grenville. I met him there about eight o'clock, he asked me what I did in town, and gave me the money to go home again. I was in a public-house with him till near this time, and received the money of him as I left the house - I was never in any other public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. They said that if you did not deliver the money they would take your life - A. They said if I did not deliver what money I had they would. I saw them next morning at Queen-square Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not then say that thirty persons were round<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130005"></xptr>the door - A. I said about twenty. I should know the man who took the money if I saw him - it was neither of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoners do before the money was taken - A. Two men struck me, it was neither of the prisoners. After they took my money I called out that they were thieves.

            . I am a watchman. I heard a noise in the passage a little before twelve o'clock; there are two passages which go into the court. I heard the prosecutrix call out, and heard both blows, but only saw the last struck - there were a great many men in the passage. The prosecutrix fell on the ground, and the blood was running from her head. I went to spring my rattle, as there were so many, when two of them fell on beating me with a stick, another gave me three blows with a poker - they broke my lanthorn in the passage. I do not know who struck me, I cut the man with my cutlass, but have not seen him since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoners - A. I saw all of them except Mackintosh, outside the door of the house. I am sure they were there. I knew them before, two of them struck me several times. I could not lift my arm up, they all kept beating me until some more watchmen came, they then ran away - there was about twenty of them. Next day I went with the officers, and took the five prisoners, they all live in the neighbourhood. I went to the prosecutrix, she laid in the passage, and while the men were standing round, she said she had been robbed of 20 s. 6 d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was moonlight, I could see half through the passage. I could not see who struck the prosecutrix there were so many round.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the four men you saw - A. They stood outside, and the prosecutrix laid outside the door. When I was struck they all told the man to give it to me well.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are sure it was neither of the four prisoners who struck the prosecutrix - A. I do not know who struck her - she lives in a lodging-house - there are married women, and girls of the town live there. I saw the prisoners distinctly, and know several of the others by sight.</p>

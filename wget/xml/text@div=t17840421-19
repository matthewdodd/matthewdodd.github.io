               <p>On Wednesday evening, I believe it was the 14th of this Month, I was coming out of Silver-street, going into Wood-street, I knocked at Falcon-square for a person, one Mr. Davis, I heard the cry of stop thief! and I heard the sound of feet coming down from Noble-street, and we crossed the way, and against the dead wall I met the prisoner Barton; I immediately collared him, he asked me what I stopped him for; I said I apprehended he was a thief; he said he was in pursuit of a man; he strove to get away, and I held up my stick, and told him I would knock him down; I observed another man come down after him, and he turned to the right where we were standing, and several people after him, and I heard somebody cry out, damn him, the other is taken; I then proceeded with him after the other people to Staining-lane, where they said there had been a robbery committed; when I came there, I was behind the other prisoner whom two people had in custody, and I heard that gentleman who was wounded say, that is the man who struck me, and he then looked into the other man's face, but I do not believe he said any thing of him; I proceeded with him to the compter, nobody else went with him there; I saw him searched by a man that is a Jew I believe, he first searched the other prisoner, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270058"></xptr> saw the ends of some keys, which appeared to be picklock keys, taken out of his pocket; they then searched the prisoner Barton, and he pulled out something, the man that searched him did, and put into his coat pocket, then he pulled out a japanned tobacco box, and the prisoner Barton said, that is only my tobacco box; I said you had better open it, and see what is in it, which he did, and it contained tinder and two or three matches; I then heard somebody cry, go for a constable, which I believe was the man who examined them; then I saw an iron crow.</p>
               <p>Did you ask the man what it was that he put into his pocket? - No.</p>

            ? - I believe at the compter, not before.</p>
               <p>Where did you first see the boy lay hold of the flap of the man's coat? - I believe it was the corner of Staining-lane.</p>
               <p>Court. Because this boy has been telling us he had hold of his coat before you laid hold of him? - The prisoner was upon the full run, and from his running so fast, I rather conceived him to be the thief.</p>
               <p>Was there at that time any boy near him? - I did not see any boy, I have had some talk with the boy after he told me he was near him and put up his stick, or something, and he he was frightened and let go his coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barton. Did you see any stick in my hand? - I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Did you make use of any imprecation? - I made use of no imprecation, I told you, I apprehended you was the person.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you use any such expression as this, I will be damned if I let you go? - No, my Lord, that I am conscious I never did; when I first met the prisoner, I am confident there was no boy laid hold of him, the boy mentioned the circumstance to me, and I was rather uneasy in my mind, I went to the boy's master and had some conversation with him, and the boy then said he believed he was at some yards distance when I stopped him, but prior to my stopping him when he was coming down the lane, he caught hold of his coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You did not see any boy till some time afterwards? - I saw a boy have hold of the prisoner Barton's coat, when I came to the corner of Staining-lane.</p>

               <p>What did you do with these spoons as soon as you found them? - I put all the things in my pocket together, there was no constable came in with the prisoners.</p>

               <p>Were not the matches in the tobacco box? - No, nothing but tinder, I gave the things to the constable, Mr. Fletcher; there was a crow when I searched them, I delivered the crow and the rest of the things to Mr. Fletcher.</p>
               <p>Mr. Freers. I beg leave to know if he delivered up all the things, it is a satisfaction to my mind?</p>
               <p>Harvey.

               <p>Court. Did you deliver up every thing to the constable that you took from the prisoner? - I delivered up every thing.</p>
               <p>I ask you whether now you have delivered up every thing that you received from the prisoners? - I have most certainly.</p>
               <p>Because it looks very much like a manoeuvre, when they were discovered to deliver them up? - It was no discovery at all, there were ten or twelve people that were present at my searching them, that saw me take the spoons and every thing else from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Freer. Have you any more reason for suspecting that man's conduct? - I was conscious I saw him take something else out of his pocket, but I could not ascertain what.</p>
               <p>Court. He says the other people saw what it was? - I saw him take something out of the pocket, but I could not ascertain what it was, I did not ask him, it seemed to be close clasped in his hands, I saw every thing but the spoons.</p>

               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, for the boy I am afraid he has been instructed that it would be of service to him to go so far as he has done, with respect to some future explanation.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, that there was a burglary by two men is proved to a demonstration, I think, because the door was safe at half past eight, or a quarter before nine, and very soon afterwards the street door and parlour door were open, and the parlour door forced, and things taken out of the drawers of the bureau in that parlour, and when three spoons were actually missing, there can be no doubt but somebody had found means to enter that house by some false key, for the purpose of plundering the house, and had gone some length towards doing it, for the spoons were actually taken away, and the moving the things but an inch is a feloniously taking; the taking the things out of the drawer, and laying them down with intention to convey them away, is a felonious taking, and there is no doubt but the two men who run down stairs, one of whom struck Delport, were the thieves; the only question is, whether the prisoners are the men, Burne is sworn to by the prosecutor as the man that struck the blow; and in confirmation of his evidence, this blow being struck with iron, you find when B urne was apprehended in Falcon-square, he threw something from him which appeared to be an iron crow, he had pick-lock keys in his pocket, one of which actually opened Mr. Delport's door, but the circumstance of the crow sticks to him: I think there is no doubt with respect to Burne; the evidence is different with respect to Barton, Mr. and Mrs. Delport, and Whittingham, do not take upon themselves to swear to Barton, but each say he was in a light coloured great coat, and the evidence is, that Barton had on a light coloured great coat, and he was taken running in the same track, and when taken to the compter and searched, there was found upon him, if you believe the Jew, three silver tea-spoons, which tea-spoons are positively sworn to by the prosecutor; and the prisoner judges well for himself in saying that he knew nothing of the spoons, as he did not get rid of them, and he tells you that the Jew swore falsely; the real complexion of the Jew's conduct is, that he had a wish to finger these spoons, that I am very much inclined to believe, but though he did not deliver them before, he did deliver them, and how should he come by them, he was a prisoner himself before, and Mr. Freer saw him take something from the prisoner Barton, which he did not shew to them, but put in his pocket, he produced the spoons the next day; I think now it would be too much to entertain any serious doubt whether these spoons were found on the prisoner Barton, and if they were found upon him, it is better evidence than fifty people swearing to the identity of his person.</p>

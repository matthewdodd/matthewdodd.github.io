In consequence of Mr. Layton calling upon me I searched for the ladle, and missed it; I then went to the prisoner in the watch-house where she was, she began crying, and said, how cruel it was to rob me after I had behaved so well to her; I told her I missed other articles, and I begged that she would confess for the sake of the other servants; I went the next morning to Marlborough-street, where Mr. Layton was with the ladle; he has kept it ever since.</p>

             sworn. - The prisoner at the bar offered me this ladle in pledge on the 18th of March; I asked her who it belonged to, and she said a Mr. Fisher, a master cabinet-maker, in Oxford-road; I said it was not marked with Mr. Fisher's name; she said that may be, because my master is out, and my mistress is ill in bed, and, I believe, her son went out and borrowed it to raise some money; I rather doubted the story altogether; she said there was a person lived in the next street that, if I would send to, would vouch for her character; I told her I would charge the watch with her; she said, if I would not charge the watch with her she would tell me the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you would not charge the watch with her? - A. No, I did not; she then began to say that she had been dabbling in the lottery, and she meant to have pawned this to get out some clothes that a person, where she had chaired, had had a death in their family, and had given her a suit of black; she had made free with it, and wanted to get it out to appear in at the gentleman's house the next day; I was determined to call the watch, she was taken to the watch-house, and there she named Mr. Gunter, in consequence of which, I went to him. (The ladle was deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. Mr. Gunter has been a worthy master to me, I hope he will be favourable; he always behaved well to me.</p>

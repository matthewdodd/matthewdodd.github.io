                  </hi>. I am acting mate to a steam boat which plys between Woolwich and the North Woolwich Station. On Saturday night, 20th Aug., we left Woolwich on our last journey, at 11 o'clock, and got over about 10 minutes past 11 o'clock—the passengers had all gone ashore except about half a dozen, when I observed the prisoner leaning on the after companion—I went up to him, and asked him to go ashore; he turned round, and said he was not going—I told him he must go, for we bad done, and were not going back any more—I left him standing there—Captain Allen gave me orders to moor the vessel, and I went to throw the stern rope out to do so—while I was in the act of mooring the vessel, the prisoner came behind roe, and put me right over the vessel—he chucked me over the rail at the stern of the vessel; as I fell, I caught hold of the lower rail with my left hand, and so saved myself from falling into the water—the prisoner then knocked my fingers with his fist, and tried to make me let go, and tried to lift my fingers up—I called out to Captain Allen for assistance; he came, and took bold of my legs, and said, "All right! I have got hold of your legs"—I could not have held on any longer if Allen had not come—the water is about twenty feet deep there—it was nearly high water—Allen palled me on board, and the prisoner was given in charge—he had been drinking, but he knew perfectly well what he was about—I went to the station with him—before he was taken, he caught hold of Allen by the hair of his bead, and said, "You b——r, I should like to drown you for saving the other"—the stern of the vessel from which I was thrown was from ten to fifteen feet from the pier.</p>

                  </hi>. I am master of the Kent steamboat. On our arrival at North Woolwich on Saturday night, 20th Aug., I was standing at the gangway—the passengers were all out except about two that were on the gangway—I heard a voice call out, "Allen! help!"—I was then on the pier, at the gangway—I directly went on board, and went to the after part of the vessel—I saw Thomas hanging over, holding by his left hand, and the prisoner was hammering away at his fingers—seeing I could not do anything there, I leant through the timber head, and caught hold of his legs—he said,</p>

               <p>Hold me! hold me! he is knocking my hand"—I said, "I have got you, never mind"—as I held him the prisoner went ashore, and had got half way up the ground when 1 caught hold of his collar, and said, "I shall give you in charge"—he said, "Oh, I will kill him, I can fight him; I can fight Caunt, and I can throw any roan"—he tried to throw me—the policeman came up, and took him in charge—the prisoner made use of very bad language, and said to the policeman, "You shake, you shiver; I don't care for you; you b——, I will throttle you"—I said to the policeman, Call for assistance," and he called me—the prisoner tore a handful of hair right out of my head—we got him into a skiff, to take him to Woolwich—we had to use a little violence to get him down—as we were going across he said, "Can any of you swim?"—one of them answered, "No"—there were eight in the boat—the prisoner then said, "Here goes, then."—I got up in the boat, and said, "If you offer to move from your seat I will cut you right down with my hand"—he did offer to move—when we got into the middle of the river he spat in my face, and said, "You b——, I should like to drown you for coming to the other man's assistance," and just before we got to the shore he said, "I can do it for you nicely now"—the prisoner was a little me liquor, but not a great deal—he knew perfectly well what he was doing, or he would not have done what he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q.</hi> Is that your reason for thinking he knew what he was about? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there were seven or eight of us in the boat—the prisoner was sitting down—the policeman had hold of one of his hands, and the stoker of the boat the other—he was trying to keep him quiet till we got across, and he said to him, "I am a prisoner as well as you are."</p>

I was standing at the pier at North Woolwich on 20th Aug., a few minutes past 11 o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner on board, leaning on the after companion—I saw the prosecutor walk from the wheel to the prisoner—I did not hear what he said—he walked back again, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the rope out—I saw the prisoner come after him, take him between the legs, and heave him over the rails—I should say that part of the vessel was from twelve to fifteen feet from the pier—the prosecutor called out for assistance, and Allen went to him—I saw him hanging over the vessel's side with one hand on the rails—I ran on board to his assistance, and found that Allen had conveyed him on board.</p>

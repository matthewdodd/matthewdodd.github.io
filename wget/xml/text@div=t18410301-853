                  </hi>. I live in Weston-street, Somers-town, and keep a tobacconist's shop. On Saturday night, the 6th of February, about twelve o'clock, I was going into my house, and saw the prisoner lift up the lid of the glass case, take about four dozen cigars, and put them into his pocket—he then attempted to get out—I caught hold of him, and said he was not going till he gave me up my property—he said, did I accuse him of theft?—I said, "Yes"—he hustled with me; said I was no officer, and I had no right to take him—I said I had, and he turned and threw the cigars at my feet, gave me a violent slap on my head, and said, "Take that, you b—!"</p>

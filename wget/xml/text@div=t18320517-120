               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You say, on the day he was married, he gave you this certificate, but I see, by the date, it could not be this? A. I do not know whether it was this one, but two or three certificates were got, because he said he was not married to her - this is not a prosecution of the second wife's - when he went away, he left his place of business, and three sovereigns; I believe he had laid out 200l. or 300l. for the good will of the place; and his father furnished the place - the furniture fetched 22l.</p>

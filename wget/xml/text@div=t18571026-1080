On Sunday, 27th Sept., Mariano Francisco was brought to my place, about 8 o'clock in the evening—I did not see him immediately on his admission—when I saw him, he was in bed—he had a small wound in the chest about an inch long, but as it had been closed I did not open it; it was over the breast bone, and apparently made with a knife; it was about two-thirds down the breast—a knife like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might have inflicted the wound.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Victoria Street, Shadwell. On Sunday, 27th Sept., I went into the Royal Sovereign public house with the Manilla men—there were about fifteen persons—the two prisoners were there—I did not see any other men come in—Ali began calling the Manilla men names; be spoke in English as well as he could—the Manilla men wanted to fight, and Ali got up, and wanted to strike me in the public house, and Mahomet kept him back; Ali then went out of the public house, and I went out—I saw one of the Manilla men strike Ali, and he fell; he got up, took a knife out of his pocket, and called for his countrymen—the other Arabs came out; they had ropes and knives and sticks in their hands, and all the Arabs got fighting with the Manilla men—I observed Mariano Francisco; he was passing by—he had nothing to do with the fight that I saw—I saw him receive a stab in the chest from Ali.</p>

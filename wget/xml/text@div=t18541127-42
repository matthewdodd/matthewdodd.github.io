                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Edward Hanson, of No. 42, King-street, Borough-road. On 6th Nov., about a quarter past 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Wellclose-square—Stebbing spoke to me—I felt in my dress pocket, and missed two half crowns, some pence, and a halfpenny with a hole in it—I had noticed that halfpenny, because I was going to give it to a Guy Fawkes two minutes before, but would not do so as it had a hole in it—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went up to the prisoner, laid hold of him, and said, "You have got my money"—while I had hold of him, I saw him pass his hand to another man with a flannel jacket, who was about as far off as he could reach—a mob had gathered round, and that man was among them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and work with my lather, at No. 10, William-street, St. George's. On 6th Nov., about 3 o'clock, I was in Wellclose-square, and saw the prosecutrix standing at the door of a bottle warehouse, with two other females, one on each side of her—the prisoner, and one or two more, came up and turned their backs to the prosecutrix—the prisoner put his hand into his coat pocket through a hole at the bottom of it, and into the gown pocket of the prosecutrix—I pointed out the pri<lb></lb>soner to her, and saw her go across the road—I followed her.</p>

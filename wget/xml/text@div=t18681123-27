                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Brentford—on the 10th October I was at Vinoe's house, where I live, drinking with the prisoner—I said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Charley</hi>, you have begun your old game again"—I was not quite sober—I knocked him out of his chair three times—he then went behind the screen, by the street door, and said, "I won't fight you, but I am ready for you"—I went to him, we closed, and both fell on the ground—I did not see anything in his hand at that time—Vince separated us—I got up and sat in the chair—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards I felt very queer and sick, and was obliged to go out fox air—I went with Vince to the Alton Arms, leaving the prisoner in the house—I then went back home and went to bed, and slept all night in the same bed with the prisoner—I did not find out that I was wounded till about 7 o'clock, then I discovered some blood on the sheet and on my clothes—I found that I was stabbed in my left side, under the lower rib—I showed the wound to the prisoner, and he said he would not have had it happen for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "I shall always judge you as the man that has done it"—he made no answer—I went to the hospital, and remained there till the 27th October—I had no quarrel with anyone but the prisoner—I was not fighting with any other person.</p>

I am a surgeon—I examined the prosecutor on the 11th October—I found a wound penetrating his abdomen—a knife like this would cause such a wound—it was a dangerous wound—he is so far well now that unless a complication should come on he will do well—unless there should be internal mischief—I can't tell that—there is no symptom of the bowels being injured—the knife must have been held perpendicularly to have caused such a wound—it could not have been caused by his falling upon it, if it had been on the ground—I think it must have been a stab.</p>

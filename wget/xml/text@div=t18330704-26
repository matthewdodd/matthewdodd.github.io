             (police-serjeant N 9). I live in River-street, Islington. On the 4th of June, I took the prisoner sitting on a stone in Chapel-street, Pentonville; I asked if his name was not Darby, he said, No; I said, "I am certain you are the person" - in going to the station-house, he mentioned two boys who had had part of the money, and requested him to do it; I said, "You had better say nothing;""Oh! No, no," he said; he then said they had robbed him of part of it; I asked him how, he said one of them had kept the change of a sovereign for a pot of beer - I found on him this box of powder, which he said he had bought of a waterman, at Gravesend, to poison fish; and that a landlord there had kept him till all his money was gone, and then sent him home to London - he also said he did not break the box open.</p>

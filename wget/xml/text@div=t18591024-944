                  </hi>. I am the wife of Robert Allen, who lives in Gough-street, Poplar; he is in the service of the Trinity Company—the prisoner and the deceased came to lodge at our house on 10th November last—the deceased took the lodgings in the name of Mr. and Mrs. Royal; they took a back parlour—the prisoner was then working for a firm in Whitechapel as a shoemaker—they seemed to be living together on middling terms—her health was particularly good—I knew she was in the family way from the time she came; she had told me so; I could see it—I remember the child being born—I was present; it was on 28th April—there was a midwife there at the time of the confinement; her name was Medwin—she had a very good confinement, and a good getting up; she was able to go about, about a fortnight after her confinement—I know that, Mrs. Medwin is herself just now lying in—on 31st May I heard a moaning sound in their room, which attracted my attention; that was before 3 o'clock in the morning—I had not heard any moving about the room before that; I did afterwards—at 4 o'clock my husband knocked at the door and inquired what was the matter—the prisoner answered him; he said that his wife had got the cramp in her inside—I told him to get some brandy for her, and bring the baby to me, for the baby was crying—my husband brought it to me—there was some brandy sent for, to his sister's, I believe; the prisoner went himself for it—he took it into the room—I went into their room that morning about 7 o'clock, the first time; the deceased was vomiting then—the prisoner was not in the room; he came in afterwards—he said he had fomented her stomach with hot water and flannels—I don't think he said any more—I asked her what she had been taking, and she at that time said she had taken nothing; but further in the day she said she had had some coffee on the night before when she went to bed—they had been out together the day before, all the afternoon, and came home in the evening; she had had nothing out only a little beer—I made her some tea several times, and made her gruel and arrowroot—I applied some hot fomentations to her stomach, with flannel—I procured those flannels from out of the house; but that was not until the forenoon—I did not see any flannels in her room—when I first questioned her she said she was very sick, and said she had a very violent pain in her stomach; and further in the day, when I made inquiry again, she said she had a burning sensation in her throat, and her feet and legs were numbed to the knees, and a very severe pain in her stomach; that never left her—during that day she vomited a great many times, more in the after<lb></lb>noon—her bowels were acted upon a great many times—she was too bad to be moved—in the evening I went to look for a doctor, because I found the prisoner had not brought one; and then I went to look for her mother—I had asked the deceased twice if the prisoner had gone for a doctor; she said she did not know, and I said, "Well, if one does not come soon I will go and fetch one"—that was about 4 o'clock in the day—I then went to the parish and told Mr. Smith, and he gave me a powder to take home to her, and he told me to get an order from the house, and he would attend—I gave her the powder in sugar and water—after I had given it to her I remained with her about a quarter of an hour, not longer—the prisoner was not there during that time—I then went after her mother—she came about 8 o'clock, I think, and she was with her almost the whole time until her death.</p>

"she said, "Only one glass of beer, and George drank the remainder"—I said, "Well, did you have anything after you came home at night?" she said, "Yes; I had a little coffee, and it was very bitter"—I said, "What did you drink it for, then?" she said, "Because George made me; there was nothing else in the room"—she said nothing more to me on that occasion—further in the day, I asked her if I should go and fetch a minister, and she said, "Oh, yes; do fetch somebody to pray for me"—she did not say anything else when I had that conversation with her, but afterwards she said, "God forgive that wicked man"—she said that a great many times—the child that was born was a fine healthy baby—she suckled it twice only in my presence during her illness—I can't say on what day; it was when she was first taken ill; she was unable afterwards to give it suck; she tried—the child died some weeks after her death—it was very ill from her death—before she went out on the Monday, I saw her with some cotton stockings—she had been drying them in the yard, and was taking them to her own room to put them on—I said, "Don't do that; hang them to the fire first"—she took them away afterwards; they appeared dry to me; I turned them myself.</p>

I waited for a little time, and then I heard her—I said, "See what is the matter;" and then my granddaughter got up, gave her some hot water, and she made the tea herself—I believe that was it—I have twice made ginger tea for her when she has been attacked with spasms and cramp—I have</p>

               <p>only done it twice myself—I can't say whether the prisoner on one of these occasions, when she was seized with pain in the stomach, went out and got some brandy for her—I do not remember—Sunday was a wet day, but not particularly so; it rained several times in the day—the deceased went out on the Sunday evening to go to chapel—it was not very wet, because I was out myself and I did not get wet—it could not have been raining very much, but it had been raining several times during the day—on that night I was at home when the deceased came in from church—I had the baby—I nursed it for her whilst she went—she did not go to church alone—her husband went with her—they went together and they returned together—I do not remember when they returned the prisoner asking her to take off her shoes and stockings, because her feet were wet, and she might get the cramp as she had done before—she had strong leather boots on, and her feet were not wet, because I inquired of her—I said, "Have you wet your feet when you were out?" and she said, "Oh, no; my boots are thick"—I asked her the question, thinking she was a short time out of her confine<lb></lb>ment, and if she got wet, she might be ill—I did not hear the prisoner say to her, "Don't mind about the thickness of your boots, you take them off, your feet may have got damp"—he may have said so—I don't remember hearing him say so—I cannot go to the extent of saying positively that he did not say so—I can't tell whether they had supper together that night—I never saw them at meals together but twice—I can't tell you what kind of food they usually lived upon—I only saw the mother of the deceased in the house once before she was taken ill—that was on Christmas eve, or Christmas night, I don't know which—from Christmas night till she was taken ill in May the mother had not been there at all, that I had seen—when I had the conversation with her about the coffee and its being bitter, she said, "There was nothing else in the room but the coffee"—she did not say there was no sugar when" she said it was bitter—she did not say, "We had no sugar in the room, and I was so thirsty I was obliged to drink it, for we had nothing else"—she never named thirst at all—I said to her, "Why did not you send in to me for a cup of tea?" she said "Oh, you had got some one with you that evening, and I did not like"—I had some person with me up to half-past 10 that night—my daughter went away at that time—she did not tell me at what time in the evening before the persons went away she had taken the coffee—my friends were with me all the afternoon—it must have been some time after 8 o'clock, I saw her at 8, and she did not ask for anything then—she was unable to give the child suck after the Tuesday—she told me on the Wednesday that she had no milk for it, and was not able to suckle it; but on the Tuesday we attempted to give the baby the breast, and she said she had no milk to give it—I saw the child put to the breast—it appeared to suck but not to get anything—she had a full supply of milk up to the day before she was taken ill—I saw her nursing the child on the Monday morning—I do not know whether she attempted to give it the breast on the Tuesday morning—I did not see her—the prisoner might have gone twice to the doctor's, but not with me—I think he went there with the deceased's mother; I think that was afterwards—the mother came on the Tuesday evening—I fetched her—I could not walk so fast as her, and she was there before me and she was speaking to the prisoner when I came home—I do not know what it was about—it was in their own room—she did not, before me, charge him with poisoning her daughter—I heard from others that it was so—I cannot tell whether it was on that Tuesday evening that the prisoner and the mother went to the doctor's together—on</p>

               <p>the Wednesday he said if any one would go with him to the doctor's he would go, and I said I would—he did not say, "I have been once, and I will go again as often as you please, to any doctor you like to take me to"—what he said was, "I should like to go to the doctor's if any one will go with me, and I said, "I will go"—it was not the subject of conversation, in my presence, on the Tuesday evening, that the prisoner had poisoned the woman; it was on the Wednesday morning in the kitchen—there were six persons living in the house at this time besides myself, the prisoner, and the deceased—I had just previously read in the papers of another case in which somebody was said to have been poisoned—the prisoner read it to me on Sunday morning—ho was in the habit of reading the newspaper—he asked me if I had read it, and I said, "No, read it to me"—I was cooking at the time—my mind was not full of that case; I thought nothing more about it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But when the deceased was suddenly taken ill then it all came back to your mind, I suppose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I had seen other persons that had been poisoned; thirteen at one time, and they all had the same appearance—sometimes the prisoner would come into the kitchen on the Sunday morning and read the paper to me; but not to all in the house—I think it was the very Sunday morning before this occurred; but I am not positive.</p>

I am a charwoman, living at 19, New-street, Poplar—I lived formerly at 10, Grove-street, Poplar—I went to 44, Gough-street to assist Mrs. Royal at her confinement—I had seen her at Mrs. Allen's several times before her confinement—her health appeared very good for a woman in her situation—she got well over her confinement—I used to see her during the month of May—she went out three of four times after her confinement—on Tuesday morning, 31st May, I heard that she was ill—I went to the house to wash for Mrs. Allen—I did not see Mrs. Royal when I came to the house—I was washing—I saw the prisoner in the course of the morning—I think it was about 1 o'clock, as near as I can say—he came into the washhouse where I was—he said she was very ill; he did not know what to make of her—I don't think I made him any answer at the time—I saw the deceased herself about 5 o'clock in the afternoon—she was then in bed—at that time Mrs. Allen had left the house—she soon afterwards came</p>

               <p>back with some medicine—at the time I saw the deceased she complained of a burning sensation in her throat, and great pain in the stomach—a little after 6 o'clock in the evening I went to Mr. Jeffreys for some medicine, and got the order for the surgeon and left it at Mr. Smith's—I afterwards brought some medicine from the surgery, about 8 o'clock in the evening I think—I gave it to the prisoner—I did not see whether he gave it to the deceased, because he told me I could leave the room—the mother and the sister were both there when I came back—when I came back with the medicine the prisoner said to me, "Did the doctor say I had poisoned her," and I said, "He did not"—it was then he told me to leave the room—I went home on that Tuesday night—I called again on Wednesday morning between 10 and 11 o'clock—I should think the deceased was still in bed—she appeared to me to be a little better than she was on the Tuesday—she said she felt a little better—I did not stay long on the Wednesday because her mother was there, and said she would do anything she wanted—I left the mother there—on Thursday morning I came again to the house—I dare say it was between 10 and 11 o'clock, the same as the day before—I went into the room of the deceased—I found the prisoner and her, and he had got the baby in his arms—the deceased complained of being very thirsty, and asked for a drink—at that time there was a cup of milk standing on a chair by her bedside—it was there when I went into the room—the prisoner gave it to her—she drank the milk that was in the cup, and she still said she was thirsty, and she had two cups of water afterwards—the prisoner gave her the water—she drank the water from the same cup that she had the milk in—after he had given her the last cup of water, he went out almost directly, washed himself, and left the house—he washed himself in the washhouse—almost directly after she had taken the milk and the water, she complained of great pain, and Mr. Webb called and ordered turpentine for her stomach—she complained of pain, particularly in the stomach—Dr. Webb had not been sent for; he came himself—it was between 11 and 12 that he called on Thursday morning, and I should think about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after she had taken the last cup of water—I was directed by Dr. Webb to go to his surgery for some medicine at 1 o'clock—as I went from the house I met the prisoner a few yards from the house; he was coming towards home—I told him I was going to the doctor's for a powder, and he said he would remain there till I came back, meaning at the house—when I came back with the powder, I found him in the house, in the front parlour, sitting with Mrs. Allen; that was her room—he asked to look at the powder—I gave it him, and he opened it and said, "That will do her good, I know"—the powder was then given to her by Mrs. Allen—there was no one with the deceased at that time—I left the house in a very few minutes afterwards, because I had to go out to work—on the Friday morning I came again to the house about 8 o'clock—she was still in bed as before—the prisoner was not there—the mother of the deceased was there—Mrs. Allen was in and out of the room, but not to stay with her—she seemed to be very ill indeed—I never saw anything of the prisoner after the Thursday when I gave him the powder.</p>

Did it hurt you?" she said, "Not at all"—I then said I would go home, and left my boy to see how she was going on; and he came running to me, and saying, "Make haste, mother, sister is dying"—that was about dinner-time, it might be about 12, or it might be 1 or later—I was very much excited at hearing it, and hastened back to Gough-street—I found my daughter in a dying state, not as she was when I left her—she complained of burning in the throat, and continual thirst, and pain in the bowels; I had not been there very long before she was sick, and I held the basin for the vomit; and directly she had vomited I poured it into a large jar, and left her in charge of Mrs. Allen—and then I took it to Dr. Webb, warm—she after that, gradually got worse—when Dr. Webb came, I followed him into the passage—that was on Friday afternoon—and I asked him what he thought, and he said, "Thirty hours will decide it"—the prisoner was out on the Thursday afternoon, and returned in the evening; he came down on Friday morning soon after 5 o'clock—on Thursday evening, when he returned, he was in Mrs. Allen's parlour, and I went in and held him by the throat or collar, or something, and told him he had murdered my daughter, and he turned deadly pale, and said he had not; and I told him his death-bed would be bell, which it will—on Friday morning when he came down, he came into the room and asked my daughter how she was; and I said, "She is asleep"—he said, "She is not, for I have heard her talking"—he asked her how she was; she said, "Very bad"—she asked him if he was going out to his sister's to work, as she could not bear the noise of his knocking in the</p>

WELSBY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What portions of the body did you put apart for further examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The stomach and the inflamed portion of the small intestines; I think one kidney, and a portion of the liver and lung-the stomach and intestines, to the best of my recollection, were placed in, one vessel, and the portion of the lungs, liver, and kidney, were placed in another vessel—I tied the vessels down, and then sealed the string—I took them to my own house and looked them up, in the same cupboard with the vomited matter—I afterwards delivered them all to Dr. Letheby, I think on the Wednesday-morning—they were then in the same condition as they were when I put them by—the peritoneum appeared to be slightly inflamed, as if the inflammation of the mucous membrane and the muscular coat of the intestines had extended to the peritoneum, but the inflammation was not so intense as to cause death—some fortnight afterwards, the body was exhumed—I then took out a portion of the liver, and the whole of the body remaining intestines, and took them to Dr. Letheby—I was present when Dr. Letheby made an analysis of those portions of the body first sent to him—he obtained from the vomited matter, from the contents of the stomach, as well as from the stomach and intestines, an acrid matter, small in quantity, but very pungent, very acrid indeed—I tasted it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he obtained it, how did he get it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By analysis; he dissolved out the acrid matter by means of ether, and evaporated the, ether, leaving this extract as the result.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WELSBY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment, from what you observed during life and after death, what was the proximate cause of death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240066"></xptr>
               <p>irritant poison, producing inflammation of the lining membrane of the bowels, and of the muscular coat of the bowels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Upon what do you form your judgment that the inflammation was produced by some irritant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> First, you have the description of the patient herself; her statement with respect to the coffee in the one instance, and the milk in the other, soon followed by pain, vomiting, purging, and the usual characteristics of inflammation; the post mortem appearances; the result of the analysis, and the effects of the extract which Dr. Letheby obtained, produced on Dr. Letheby's own lip, which I witnessed, and on my own tongue—on Dr. Letheby's lip in a few minutes some vesicles or small blisters made their appearance, intense inflammation spreading round within a quarter of an hour, which blisters remained for two days, I think; and upon my tongue it produced a very stinging pungent sensation, causing considerable pain for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before I could get rid of it—I believe shoemakers occasionally use oxalic acid in their trade for the whitening of boot tops—the appearances in this case were not at all consistent with the administration of oxalic acid; the death was much more rapid, and that is easily re-obtained by analysis—I am not able to pronounce with certainty what the irritant was that was extracted by the analysis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say among what class of substances it would probably be found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it is either an animal or a vegetable irritant; it pos<lb></lb>sibly may be cantharides; I cannot say for certainty that it is—it may be croton oil; it is as much like croton oil as cantharides; or it may be a combination of that with other vegetable irritants—there is no one vegetable or animal irritant that I know of that would bear out all the symptoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At the time you were called in, there had been severe diarrhoea prevalent in the neighbourhood, had there not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There had been diarrhoea prevalent—the account which the deceased gave of her symptoms led me at first to believe it might possibly be something of that kind—I felt her abdomen; there was not a general tenderness of the abdomen; there was a tenderness of the stomach, but only elicited upon firm, deep pressure, showing that it was in the lining membrane of the stomach—pain or pressure is an indication of the presence of inflammation—there is a difference in the character of the pain in inflammation of the mucous and serous membranes—when I first saw the deceased she complained of a pain over the pit of the stomach—Mr. Smith had given her calomel and opium; calomel alone would act as a purgative, with opium it would not; the opium controls its purgative effects; whether it would do so entirely, would depend upon the dose of calomel given—I believe the dose Mr. Smith gave was something like three grains of calomel, with two grains of opium, which would not purge—I believe before I went he also sent some chalk mixture—I approved of the treatment he had pursued—up to that time he had communicated to me upon the case.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And up to the time when you first saw her, and examined her, you still believed that she was labouring under something in the form of severe English cholera? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not quite so; I believed that it might possibly be so—I also believed that all the symptoms might be produced by some irritant administered in the coffee, as stated by the patient—the symptoms were not consistent with peritoneal inflammation; there would be a difference in the character of the pulse; the pulse of peritoneal inflammation is essentially hard and wiry; and there is a difference in the character of the pain; the pain of pe✗onitis is a short lancet-like pain, exceedingly tender upon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240067"></xptr>
               <p>pressure so that the patient can hardly bear the pressure of the bed-clothes; in this case it required firm deep pressure to elicit the pain—there was no peritoneal inflammation present at that time; that was on Tuesday-night—on the post mortem examination the peritoneum presented evidence of inflammation, as if it was an extension of the inflammation of the muscular coat of the stomach and bowels; it was only to a slight degree; not sufficient to kill—it was generally over the intestines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were not the symptoms which were developed by the deceased perfectly consistent with <hi rend="italic">enteritis</hi>? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; up to a certain extent they might be consistent with <hi rend="italic">enteritis,</hi> because the effect of an irritant is to produce <hi rend="italic">enteritis</hi>—that which is known as <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis</hi> is a complication of it—as far as the symptoms themselves went, they were substantially the same as in <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis—gastro-enteritis</hi> might be produced by natural causes, or from an irritant—I have conducted many post mortem examinations—I have never seen a death from <hi rend="italic">gastroenteritis</hi> from natural causes; such cases are very rare indeed—I do not know that "The Principles and Practice of Medicine" by Dr. Rogers and Professor Lee is a work of authority; I saw the book some ten or fifteen years ago, but I do not know it as a work of authority in the profession; I dare say it is, I don't know it as such—I believe they are Dr. Elliotson's lectures edited by those gentlemen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does this coincide with your opinion, in reference to <hi rend="italic">gastritis:</hi> "Although it is very possible that death may ensue from things taken into the stomach, we are never justified in saying, from inflammation of that organ, that the various morbid appearances which we see there, have been owing to poison, unless we prove its presence; if it were not for an accurate knowledge of those circumstances we might suspect that poison has been taken without there being any justifiable reason whatever for the opinion, for the appearances within the stomach may be precisely the same as those induced by taking poison or some other injurious matter, when it is simply common inflammation, and the effects of it"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; common inflammation, certainly, but the post mortem appearances, as described by me, are not com<lb></lb>mon—to a certain extent what you have read does meet with my sanction; but common inflammation, however produced, will produce the same appearances—I happen to have attended those very lectures of Dr. Elliotson's, but as far as the work itself is concerned, I have not read it, nor do I know that it is at the present day recognised as a work of authority by the profession; I had thought that the work was obsolete—I know Dr. Christison's work on poisons; I recognise that as a work of authority—I agree with the following passage: "It is necessary here to give a detailed account of the symptoms of simple cholera; there is the same burning in the stomach and bowels as in irritant poison, the same incessant vomiting and frequent purging, the same tension and tenderness of the belly, the same sense of acidity in the throat, and irritation in the anus, the same depression and anxiety, the same state of the pulse."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From your knowledge and reading in respect of death from poison and from natural causes, do you think that there may arise cases in which death from irritant poison may not be distinguishable from death by natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> From the symptoms during life alone, I think it possible—without a post mortem examination I would not venture to say that the person did not die a natural death, with this reservation, that here all the pain and all the symptoms appeared to have arisen, in the first instance, from the taking of the coffee, and in the second instance from the taking of the milk; the woman stated that she was perfectly well up to the taking of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240068"></xptr>
               <p>coffee; that the coffee was very bitter, and that soon after the taking of the coffee she felt pain and inconvenience of the stomach; that the pain increased for two or three hours, until vomiting was produced, and purging, and that pain continued for perhaps twenty-four hours—she told me that she had vomited two or three hours after taking the coffee—vomiting does not usually take place in much less than two or three hours after the intro<lb></lb>duction of a violent irritant poison into the stomach; ordinarily speaking, it takes place very soon after the introduction, sometimes in a quarter of an hour, sometimes an hour, but it may extend: take arsenic as an example; arsenic may produce vomiting within a quarter of an hour, or not for six or eight hours—I do not suggest arsenic in this case—I do not suggest any mineral; I believe it to be a vegetable, an acrid oil of a vegetable nature—the period at which vomiting would take place, would depend upon the dose, the quantity of food in the stomach, and a variety of things; it is very uncertain in the action—as a rule I should expect that a large dose of an irritant would produce vomiting in a quarter of an hour—irritant poisons, as a class, are very uncertain in their action, as regards the time of the pro<lb></lb>duction of the symptoms—if the extract which is said to have killed animals was introduced in that form into the stomach, it might produce vomiting immediately, but it does not follow that it was given in that form; it might have been given in a dose larger in quantity, but less active in its principle—I have no very great experience of the action of vegetable irritants as a poison—I have attended several persons who have died from poisoning; those were from mineral poisons, principally oxalic acid—an acrid oil would, I think, be insoluble in water or coffee; if put in either it would float, being specifically lighter; but it might have been well mixed with the coffee, and so diluted—what I mean is that it would divide the globules or drops; I don't say that it would be dissolved—I knew that the deceased had been confined about a month previously—supposing she had caught cold by exposure to wet, the proximate effect of that would probably be peritoneal inflammation, but very different in its character to the condition of this patient—the probable result of that inflammation being set up, would be a suppression of the lacteal secretion—I have heard that the deceased was not able to give the milk to the child on the Tuesday evening—in puerperal fever the milk is absorbed into the tissues as a result of the inflammation—if the deceased had caught cold on the Sunday previous, suppression of the milk might follow from that cold, two days afterwards, but the other symptoms would be very different—the absorption of bile into the system sometimes causes a pernicious effect upon the blood—I do not know that the absorption of the milk into the system causes a vitiating or poisoning of the blood—I have dissected puerperal patients—the slightest puncture in dissecting a puerperal patient will sometimes cause the death of the operator—the condition of the system when suffering from puerperal fever will produce poisonous effects upon any one dissecting a dead person—the system of a patient suffering from the absorption of the secretions is poisoned undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing the secretion of milk to be suppressed on the Tuesday evening, and the milk as a natural consequence to be absorbed into the system, would not that which remained secreted, be by some process, the operation of which is not yet known, converted into a poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not agree to that point; I am not satisfied that it is so—it may be that animal fluids secreted during disease are believed occasionally to act as poisons—I know "Beck's Medical Jurisprudence"—I am not acquainted with Morganie, the French toxicologist—I have read Beck—I can conceive that a large</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240069"></xptr>
               <p>quantity of the fluid secretions of the human body may acquire from disease such an acrimony as to be fatal to animals, without the introduction of any irritant poison—I do not know it to be a fact that the fluid found in the stomach of a diseased person dying from natural causes has been administered to animals and caused their death; I never knew an instance of that sort—I have never beard of a poison called the <hi rend="italic">necroscopic</hi> poison—I am acquainted with Dr. Copland's "Dictionary of Medical Science"—I do not happen to have read in that book of a poison of that description generated in, the system, and not referable to any poison whatever—I have not heard or read of animals being killed by the introduction of a fluid found in the stomach of a person dying of natural disease—it may be seventeen, eighteen, or twenty years since I read Beck, I have not looked into him at all before coming here (<hi rend="italic">Upon</hi>

               <p>symptoms of the deceased, when I saw and examined her, were consistent with an attack of <hi rend="italic">gastro enteritis</hi>—in a complication of diseases of the abdominal viscera, you may sometimes find inflammation both of the peritoneum and of the mucous membrane—I cannot say that in any post mortem I have met with the mucous membrane in a softened condition where death has arisen from natural disease—the gastric juices on the mucous membrane, if there are no contents in the stomach upon which to act, will act upon the stomach itself; and after death still more violently and powerfully than during life, and to that extent as to cause a considerable softening of the mucous membrane, and also an abrasion—it will cause inflammatory appearance and occasional patches of abrasion in the duodenum and the ilium—I was present when the analysis was made by Dr. Letheby—the contents were sent to him on the 8th—he set about the analysis immediately, the same morning—he did not carry out the whole of the analysis—he commenced first to test for mineral poisons—I think he did that on the Wednesday—he placed some of the organs that I took, in a bottle, and poured some ether upon them—the viscera that were placed in bottles were not put into any fluid, simply the viscera as taken from the stomach were placed in a bottle without any preservative; without alcohol—the post mortem was on the Monday—I put the viscera into a bottle and corked it up, and sealed the cork, without any alcohol or any preparation to preserve it—I left it from Monday till Wednesday to be the subject of decomposition and putrefaction, without anything in the shape of an antiseptic—the analysis was not proceeded with on the Thursday; it was arranged that it should stand over for four or five days—I did not replace the viscera in the same bottles—I saw them placed in another bottle—the bottle in which I had placed them was left in charge of Dr. Letheby—I left the viscera in charge of Dr. Letheby on the Wednesday, and arranged to come four or five days subsequently, I forget the exact day, and see the result of the analysis—after the Wednesday I had nothing to do with the mode in which the viscera were preserved—the matter which was vomited on the previous Wednesday, I sent to Dr. Letheby the week after I had it, together with the viscera, in separate bottles—to the best of my recollection the portions of the intestines with the stomach were placed in one bottle, and a portion of the liver, lungs, and kidneys, in another bottle—I did nothing with the vomited matter between the Thursday when it was sent to me, and the succeeding Wednesday—I did not subject it to any analysis—I put it in a bottle and sealed it up—it appeared to me more of a yellowish colour than green—I did not observe any difference in the vomited matter between the time I received it on the Thursday and the Wednesday—the colouring matter was bile—the bile naturally flows from the liver through the proper vessel into the duodenum, not into the stomach; it is out of place in the stomach; that is caused by a reversion of the action—some-times it is ejected from the mouth in vomiting—the natural colour of bile is a yellowish brown—when it obtains anything of a greenish colour, that I believe is the result generally of the action of the gastric juices upon it—I have tasted bile that has been taken from the stomach of a diseased person—I cannot say that I am familiar with the taste of bile in its natural condition—it is very nauseous—if thrown out through the oesophagus in the shape of a vomit, it would produce a very nasty sensation in the throat, together with the muscular action of vomiting; that gives rise to that which patients frequently complain of, a nasty rasping sensation in the throat—I assisted in the second post mortem when the body was exhumed,</p>

               <p>about a fortnight afterwards; it was not then that I applied the vomited matter to my lip; that was within ten days of the death; within ten days of the first post mortem—the death took place on the 4th or 5th, and the post mortem on the Monday—on the 8th I had the conference with Dr. Letheby, when I made the first examination—on that occasion I did not put any of the vomited matter or any other matter to my lip—I think it was on the following Monday, but I am not quite sure as to the exact day—that was nine or ten days after the death—no solution of alcohol or anything was put into the bottle with: the vomit—it had twelve or thirteen days for whatever chemical process might be going on, to affect it, before I made any test of it—it was before the exhumation that Dr. Letheby mode the alcoholic solution of the stomach and intestines which resulted in the four drops—the results of the different processes were placed side by side and found to be all alike—after the exhumation, I had a portion of the viscera which I took to Dr. Letheby and have seen nothing of it since—I was present when he made an alcoholic solution of the stomach and portion of the intestines which I first took him—at that time he made an analysis of the vomited matter and also of the contents of the stomach—when the body was exhumed, decomposition had set in—I placed the portion of the viscera which I then took, into a stoppered bottle and sealed it up.</p>

                  </hi>. In May last I was in partnership with Mr. Webb—on Tuesday, 31st May, I was sent for to see the deceased, Zipporah Wright, about 5 o'clock in the evening—she was suffering from great pain in the region of the stomach—she complained of a dryness in the throat and great thirst—the first thing I administered was a powder containing three grains of calomel and two grains of powdered opium, and I afterwards gave a chalk mixture—I sent that, I think, two hours afterwards; I mean two hours after the calomel was given—the chalk mixture consisted of chalk, sugar, and powdered gum arabic and water—that was before Mr. Webb had seen the woman—I afterwards attended her for several days with Mr. Webb—I saw her on the Wednesday—I found her symptoms better; there was still a redness in the mouth and tongue, but it was not so dry as on the Tuesday evening—the vomiting had ceased when I saw her on the Wednesday; I did not see her on the Thursday—on the Friday I saw her with Mr. Webb—at that time she was sinking rapidly—it did not appear to me that there was any inflammation of the peritoneum; if so, very slight—I did not see it—I was present when Dr. Webb made the post mortem examination—I have heard what he has stated with regard to the appearances that the body then presented.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry at the London Hospi<lb></lb>tal, and medical officer of health to the City of London—some portions of a human body were brought to me by Dr. Webb for the purpose of chemical analysis—the first portions were brought to me on Wednesday morning, 8th June—4 bottles were brought to me; the first bottle contained a stomach and two pieces of small intestines; the second bottle contained a piece of liver, a piece of kidney, and a piece of lung; a third bottle contained 4 ounces of matter vomited by the deceased; and the fourth bottle contained the contents of the stomach—each bottle was carefully secured with the seals, which I produce unbroken; I proceeded to the chemical analysis of the contents of these various bottles—I first took the stomach from the bottle and found it to be inflamed on the mucous coat—the mucous coat was everywhere softened, and in one place dissolved off; it was covered with a dark-brown mucus, which I found, upon examination microscopically, to be altered blood—the walls of the stomach were very slightly acid to litmus paper—there was no odour whatever of any volatile poison—the stomach was immediately treated with alcohol, and I searched in the alcoholic solution for mineral poisons but did not find any—I then con<lb></lb>tinued the search for organic poisons, and obtained from the alcoholic solu<lb></lb>tion a small quantity of a treacle-like liquor, which, upon digestion with ether, furnished, as nearly as possible, one drop of an oily-liquor, which I tasted and found to be very acrid—I then rubbed a small quantity of it on the corner of my lip; it produced severe burning pain in the course of 5 minutes, and at the end of a quarter of-an-hour my lip was considerably swollen, and was covered with little watery vesicles, pimples; the next day a scab formed there, and the effects lasted for 3 or 4 days—that was the result of the examination of the stomach only—the stomach was then treated by Reinsch's tests for mineral poisons, and it furnished a trace of mercury, but nothing else—the lungs were also there, and they were treated in a similar way, but I found nothing in the lungs; in fact, the stomach and the lungs, with all of that bottle, was at once treated with alcohol—the first bottle contained the stomach and some portion of the small intestines, they</p>

               <p>were treated together, with alcohol—I have given the result of the first bottle—the second contained a piece of the liver and kidney, and a piece of lung; they were all treated for mineral poisons by Reinsch's test, and I sought for mercury, for arsenic, and for antimony, but I did not find any<lb></lb>thing—I then examined the vomited matter—I found, as it stood in the bottle, that it had separated into two portions, an upper layer of curd and a lower layer of whey; that was in bottle No. 3—the second bottle was not tested for organic poison, only for mineral; in the tissues themselves you would not find anything but a mineral poison; it would have been waste of labour—a few organic poisons get into the tissues, but not generally so; here it would have been quite a waste of labour—the vomited matter in the third bottle was of a greenish-yellow colour; I ascertained by proper tests that the colour was due to bile—I examined the curd under the microscope and found that it consisted of the curd of milk, together with a small quantity of starch, like arrow-root; it was treated with alcohol together with the clear liquor, and I found in it precisely the same kind of acrid matter that I had obtained from the stomach; I also obtained from it a mere trace of mercury, but nothing else—I then took the contents of the fourth bottle, it was labelled, "The contents of the stomach;" it contained 2 ounces of a dark brownish-red fluid which was very alkaline in its aspect, and which I found, by examination under the microscope, consisted entirely of altered blood; a little of it was filtered away, and I sought in the filtered liquor for oxalic acid, but I did not find any—I then treated it with alcohol, in the same way as I had treated the former portions, and I obtained a resinous looking matter, which gave to ether the same kind of acrid substance, which blistered the other corner of my mouth—I searched in the residue for mineral poisons and I found only this small quantity of mercury (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), nothing else.</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the result of your examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That there was present in the stomach, mercury, which had been ad<lb></lb>ministered, and an acrid matter, the nature of which I could not determine—I then requested that the body should be exhumed, in order that I might have further matter for investigation—that was done on 21st June, and I received a large wide-mouthed bottle and a glass jar, both secured and sealed; the bottle contained a spleen, bladder, uterus, kidney, and 6 pieces of intestines; the intestines were cut open from end to end, and there was nothing except altered blood lining the interior part of them; the mucous coat throughout, near to the large intestines, was very much inflamed and softened; at least it was red and softened—at that distance of time I could hardly tell whether the redness was due to inflammation, or to post mortem appearance—I searched very carefully throughout the whole of the intestinal canal for solid particles, fancying I might discover some solid material, and all I found was about 8 or 9 small seeds which I found to be the seeds of black currant jam, and a small quantity of the pulp of orange; that was all the solid matter I found in the intestines—that would give no result to assist me in my search—I sought, by means of the microscope, for the presence of vegetable poison, but I found none—I then treated the contents of the stomach with alcohol and ether, as I had done before, and again I obtained the same acrid matter from the intestines—the acrid matter alto<lb></lb>gether that I had then got amounted to just four grains; it was mixed so</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240075"></xptr>
               <p>as to obtain the whole, in the endeavour to ascertain what its nature was—the fact of Mr. Webb not having put alcohol, or any other antiseptic into the bottle, would not at all interfere with the proper result of the analysis; 5 it is not the rule to do such a thing; it would tend to affect the inquiry to such a degree, that the identity of the material would be lost; we should not be able to judge of post mortem appearances, if alcohol was added; instead of aiding it would obstruct, it would not have interfered with my chemical investigation, but it would have interfered with my post mortem inquiry into the case; it is not at all a usual thing to do—when I received the various bottles, they were closely sealed down—I was not able to determine the nature of the acrid matter, I thought it might be cantharides, and I set to work to make experiments with cantharides on my lip, but I found it pro<lb></lb>duced a very different effect—I did not come to any conclusion in regard to the nature of the substance, until I had made experiments upon all the pure acids that I could obtain—I examined croton oil, veratria or white hellebore, mazerium, black hellebore, colchicum, euphorbium, colo<lb></lb>cynth, gamboge, and cantharides: all these are vegetables—I tried the effects of all these on my lip, and I found that the only one that pro<lb></lb>duced effects like it, was croton oil—the cantharides blistered, but in a much longer time, and in a very different way; but croton oil produced effects on the lip exactly like it—I then tried the effect of this which I had extracted from the stomach, on a guinea pig—I mixed it with a little water, injected it into its mouth, and it died in 10 minutes, as I thought, from spasm of the glottis—I then took it from the stomach of the guinea pig, by means of alchohol and ether, in a similar manner, and then tried it on sparrows; it was dropped into the mouths of the birds—it killed the first bird in 4 minutes—it killed the second bird in between 4 and 5 minutes—I then concluded that these effects were entirely due to the irritating effect on the throat of the birds—I took a third bird and gave it some treacle and water first; to distend its stomach and lubricate its throat, and the bird was violently sick in a quarter of an hour, and died, I think, the next day—I then tried to get it from the stomachs of the birds, and administer it to another, but it had no effect, it had become mixed with so much fatty matter, which I obtained from the stomachs of the birds, that it seemed to destroy its action—I then proceeded to examine the action of these various irritants upon birds, and upon guinea pigs, and the result was, that only one out of all these irritants, produced any effects like it; and that was veratria—so that veratria did not blister my lip, but killed the birds; the croton oil blistered my lip, but would not kill the birds—the result is that I cannot speak positively as to the nature of the material that I found—I can speak very positively to its being an irritant poison of a very formidable character; I have not the least doubt about that; it acted upon both sides of my mouth, and upon Mr. Webb's also—the whole quantity that I found was very small—if a larger quantity had been administered, although very much diluted, constant vomiting and purging would no doubt be very likely to have god rid of a considerable portion of it—I should not look fur it in the state in which I experimented upon it; I had it in a concentrated form, and it produced greater action on my lip and on the birds than it would in the state in which I found it in the stomach.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It has been suggested that this acrid matter may, by some process of nature, have been the result of spontaneous generation in the body; in your opinion, could that have taken place under the circumstances as they have been stated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak as to what is possible; all I can say is, that I have examined perhaps more than a hundred bodies chemically, and I never found such a thing arising from natural causes—I am not aware, from my reading or knowledge, of such a thing being generated naturally, or in consequence of decomposition—I found a portion of the same in the vomited matter—I think that fact would completely negative any such supposition: the fact of its being found in the stomach, in the vomited matter, and in the contents of the intestines, shows that it was right through the alimentary canal—I have never met with a case of <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis</hi>—I have opened bodies in which death has taken place from <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis,</hi> but I know of no case in my experience of <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis</hi> arising spontaneously.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The conclusion at which you have arrived is based upon the symptoms detailed to you, the post mortem appearances observed by you on the mucous membrane, and your experiments with that which you extracted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I do not think I should have come to that conclusion from the symptoms alone, nor from the post mortem appearances alone—a draught of cold water might produce effects such as I saw—I don't think I have observed similar appearances in death from <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis;</hi> not taking them altogether—there was a break in the symptoms which is very remarkable—taking the post mortem appearances alone, they were not such as I have observed where persons have died from natural causes; they were of the kind that I should hesitate to form a positive opinion upon—I think it possible that such a condition might arise from natural causes, but I have never seen such a thing—I think I saw the mucous membrane within ten days of the death—the mucous membrane is liable to very important changes "within ten days, and within three or four days; but there was an effusion of altered blood, from post mortem effects, on the inner lining of the membrane, the inner walls of the intestines—although I might meet with a post mortem appearance, viz. great redness,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240077"></xptr>
               <p>which I should have great difficulty in forming an opinion upon, as to whether it arose during life or was a post mortem effect, I should have no difficulty in deciding upon the case, when I found altered blood along the lining of the intestines—in inflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach from natural causes, you do not find blood poured forth, unless there be ulceration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We have already heard that the gastric juice has a power upon dead mucous membrane of softening and even of dissolving? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You must first get the gastric juice there to do it; and when there is a stomach empty, and when, in my testing, I do not find gastric juice, I am relieved at once from any doubt that might be in my mind from the action of gastric juice—there was no gastric juice—the mucous membrane was in a softened and partially dissolved state—where that has been produced by the action of the gastric juice, there is a chemical and corrosive action—the gastric juice is an animal matter, a combination formed between them; but the gastric juice is not poured out into the stomach or intestines unless there be food or something in the stomach to cause the gastric juice to flow—in the case of a person who has died of disease and has not had any food for some time, there is an entire absence of gastric juice—I never saw a case of a circulation of gastric juice when the process of digestion has been going on at the time of death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the gastric juice would not distinguish the state of the stomach before and after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all; but there is no gastric juice in an empty stomach.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does not the appearance considerably depend on the distance of time at which the examination takes place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all; we may have a redness of the whole alimentary canal simply from post mortem action, without there having been any redness there at the time of death, simply from the action of sulphurated hydrogen, from the blood being locked up in the intestines, which makes it dark—the morbid appearances vary as the examination is made at a proximate or remote period—we find the intestines after death becoming of a very dark red, although there might have been no redness or inflammation at the time of death—that is entirely a post mortem appearance; but I never found another Appearance which I had here, and that was extravasation of blood into the intestines, and that altered blood; I never saw that as a post mortem appearance—the viscera to which I am now referring was obtained after the exhumation of the body.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean that you never saw extravasated blood as the result of post mortem action? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to the extent of this—recollect I had two ounces of blood taken from the stomach—when I speak of post mortem action, I mean what takes place in the body after death—blood in the interior of the stomach is a post mortem appearance.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>of blood taken from the stomach two days after death, and no post mortem effect could have produced such an appearance as that—I know M. Belard, the pathologist, by repute—I do not know it to be a fact that there is extreme difficulty in distinguishing between the morbid and pseudo-morbid redness of the inner coat of the alimentary canal; not when the exami<lb></lb>nation is made immediately after death; it is certainly very difficult when made some days after—no doubt, in order to arrive at an opinion as regards the contents of the viscera and their morbid appearances, the examination ought to take place as immediately as possible after death—it is of great importance that the examination should be made immediately, that there may be no dispute with regard to the degree of the colour, and the vascularity of the parts—I do not say that if that course is not pursued, membranes, in which few or no blood-vessels are at first observed by the naked eye, would become vascular and venous, and assume the appearance of inflammation—there is extravasation of darkening blood into the tissues, which is so likely to be deceptive as to create a good deal of difficulty in deciding as to the case.</p>

               <p>finished my investigation and have found an acrid, then I have found the cause—the mere finding of blood in the stomach would tell me nothing beyond this, that it had been effused; I could form no opinion of the cause—from the symptoms alone I should not have been very positive in my opinion as to poison; but I say that there was a break in the symptoms that is not in accordance with symptoms arising from natural causes—I am anxious to qualify my previous answer to this extent, that I say the symptoms alone would not have justified me in forming a positive opinion, nor would the post mortem appearances alone, or the fact of there being blood in the stomach; but then I go to the chemical analysis—the blood might have been in the stomach as the result of disease or natural causes—the four drops was the result of alcoholic solution, and etheral solution—it was an oily matter of about four drops, and was the result of the analysis of all the viscera, and the contents of the stomach, which were given to me, from beginning to end—I did not, for the purpose of making that analysis, put together the contents of the stomach, the vomit, and the viscera—I treated them all separately; I got about a drop from each, altogether four drops, or four grains—I put it in a pair of scales and weighed it; a fluid drop of oily matter is equivalent to a solid grain—the duodenum and the stomach were in the same bottle—there was very little of the oesophagus attached to the stomach, just where the pyloric opens into the duodenum the contents had been taken out, and put into a separate bottle, before the stomach was put into the jar—a portion of the duodenum was cut open, also—I was not present at the exhumation—the fourth bottle contained the intestines taken after the exhumation—the spleen, the bladder, the uterus, and the kidney were all in one jar.; they were separately examined, and I found nothing in them—I don't think I submitted them to alcoholic treatment; I think I searched only for mineral poisons in them—in all cases of mineral poisoning the tissues ought to be examined, and tested for its presence—I first applied this condensed matter to my lip; the croton oil blistered my lip—it produced the same vesicles, I can't call it a blister; a blister is produced by a Spanish fly different from that—the croton oil killed the animal, but not so quickly as the other substance—I treated it in exactly the same way as I did the contents of the stomach—I did not give the croton oil, as croton oil, to the sparrows; but I treated it with ether, in order that it might have the same effect, and that killed the birds in three-quarters-of-an-hour—the veratria did not blister my lip, but killed the animals in three, four, or five minutes, just like that I got from the stomach—I tried the croton oil upon two birds; one died in three-quarters-of-an-hour, and the other in an hour—it produced vomiting, but not purging; there was no time—the birds that were killed with the acrid substance did not vomit, only the last one, which I gave the treacle to, was very sick—I gave some treacle alone to others, and that had no effect—I selected a guinea-pig for my experiments, because I had so small a quantity that I could not venture to try it upon a very large animal—I do not say that no reliance is to be placed upon birds—I do not know that Orfila has obtained such results as to render that doubtful; I dont remember such a statement—I read Orfila much—there is a difference in the minds of toxicologists in regard the value of experiments upon animals—Orfila, and the French toxicologists place great reliance upon them, and English toxicologists but little—as to the whole class of acrids which we are now speaking of, we only know of their effects from the experiments made on animals, by Orfila—I don't think that it is regularly laid down by toxicologists that experiments on animals should rarely form a</p>

               <p>part of a medical man's inquiry into a charge of poisoning—there are many poisons that we know nothing of, except by experiments on animals—I selected the animals because of their smallness—a guinea-pig is very closely related to man, that is, it feeds on food which is not very different from our own; it is not an animal feeder, but a vegetable feeder, therefore the experiment would be against me, because vegetable feeders are not so susceptible—the guinea<lb></lb>pig is not so different in the quality of its food, and in its structure from man as to justify me in not selecting it; or rather to form an objection to my selecting it.</p>

               <p>stomach, but the main reason is because dogs vomit so readily—I treated the sparrows in this way, I had the material in a small glass, and held the sparrow by the wings; blowing at the sparrow it opens its mouth, catches the glass, and while biting at it, it is carefully tilted and it drops into its mouth—I used a small glass beaker, like an inkstand—it is quite true that what is poison to man is not always poison to the lower animals, and that some of the lower animals are poisoned by substances not hurtful to man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you agree with this: "With respect to <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis,</hi> the previous illness is not essential to the supposition of a case of <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis;</hi> it some-times makes its attack suddenly without any precursory symptoms first appearing, by vomiting and frequent evacuations, with griping and purging?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If by <hi rend="italic">gastro-enteritis</hi> you mean what I have stated, universal inflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines, I do not agree with it—in the term "universal inflammation" I do not include the serous as well as the mucous membrane—if I had heard nothing of the history of this case, or of the symptoms, but had merely heard the post mortem appearances, I should have said that they were not the result of disease produced by natural causes—I do not intend to say that it is impossible to have arisen from natural disease, but it is altogether opposed to my experience and knowledge—I do not know that there is a marked sympathy between the soles of the feet and the peritoneum—it is stated in books that peritonitis is sometimes the result of damp feet, but I have never known anything of the kind occur—I do not agree with that statement—I do not think that inflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach may be produced by natural causes, without the introduction of any foreign matter—I believe the opinion of the profession generally at the present day is that acute in<lb></lb>flammation, as in this case, of the mucous membrane of the stomach does not arise except from the direct application of an irritant—I do not believe that a poison can be generated in the human frame capable of producing inflam<lb></lb>mation of the mucous membrane of the stomach—I cannot say that a case has ever fallen under my own observation where the post mortem appearances have been so analogous to poisoning as to induce an opinion that the death was the result of poison, and where subsequent research has proved that opinion to be a mistaken one; but I can hardly doubt that it may be so—I am not acquainted with a case reported by Dr. Hastings, of a young lady who was supposed to have died from the administration of cantharides—I do not remember the case—I have formed no opinion as to the nature of the irritant obtained from the viscera of the deceased—I never met with a case of poisoning by croton oil—I should not think that in a case of poisoning by croton oil the inflammation would be greater in the large intestines than in the small; but I have no knowledge of the matter—I have only seen one case of poisoning by cantharides, and in that case there was a specific effect upon the kidneys causing strangula—I do not think Bichat is looked upon as a very high authority now—upon some points he is, but many discoveries have been made since his day—there is no doubt that in disease the secretions from the different glands become greatly changed; but I am not aware of any gland secreting in disease that which would be more poisonous than that which it secretes in health: I do not know that the bile may, from disease, acquire such an acrimony as to be fatal to animals; I do not know it from my personal observation, or by communication with other medical men, or by my reading—I have read Christison on poisons—I have not read Orfila; I have read extracts from Morganie in other works—Christison and Orfila are first-class authorities as toxicologists—there is not much reliance placed upon anything in Morganie at present—in the older writers I know that cases are cited of the bile becoming so vitiated by some unaccountable change as to prove poisonous to animals; but my belief is that among toxi<lb></lb>cologists of the present day it is not believed—I do not mean that the cases to which I have referred were fabricated cases; but I believe they are not now accepted as the foundation of medical opinion—I believe that the bile may have been given to animals, and that the animals may have died after</p>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever taste this washing soda by itself, without being in the tea? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have put it into my mouth when I have suffered violently with the toothache—Mrs. Wright's house is about a mile and a half from Mrs. Allen's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. LETHEBY</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). The fact of the deceased person having used some washing soda on Friday evening, in making the tea, and its having given Mrs. Stubbs a violent pain in her stomach, does not make any alteration at all in my view of the case—it is not in any way calculated to throw any light upon it; soda is commonly used for the purpose of softening water, particularly where they wish to have apparently a strong cup of tea—druggist's carbonate of soda is mostly employed, but many persons use the common soda—there is a difference; that which the chemists sell is a bi-carbonate and the other is a neutral carbonate, containing one equivalent of carbonic acid, the other contains two, but they both have precisely the same effect upon water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The bi-carbonate is what is popularly called the carbo<lb></lb>nate refined, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there is very little impurity in common carbonate of soda sold in commerce; it is kept by oilmen and druggists in large quantities for the purpose of selling to washerwomen—the bi-carbonate is a purified preparation kept in stoppered bottles—if taken in large quantities carbonate of soda has a chemical action upon the stomach; it would very likely produce a burning sensation in passing down the throat; if taken in a large quantity, it would act as an irritant, on the stomach as an emetic, and</p>

               <p>on the intestines as a purgative; I may be permitted perhaps to say that the tests I employed, viz. alcohol and ether, will not dissolve carbonate of soda, therefore what I obtained could not have been any preparation of soda; I further ascertained that, the ackaline of the blood was due to the phosphate of soda, a natural constituent of the blood—if the soda bad been taken some days before, no doubt a good deal of it would be carried away by the vomiting and purging, but I should expect to find some of it.</p>

               <p>Q.Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you ever receive any paper from the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, I did, on the 7th of May. On the 5th of May he came and bought some sewing silks, to the amount of five pounds and upwards, and said, that he was leaving Mr. Searle, whom he had lived with and should go into business for himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - Yes, I did. On the 6th he came again, and bought to the amount of between two and three pounds; he gave me four guineas on account of what he had then bought, and what he had bought on the 5th it left four pounds and upwards in my favour. On the 7th he came again, about one o'clock, and looked out a parcel of died sewing silks, to the amount of twenty-one pounds and upwards; after he had looked them out, he gave me a thirty pounds bill, a promissory note.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got it about you? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the drawer of that note? - Richard Ball.(Produces it.) My account came to twenty six pounds three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179505200169"></xptr>shillings, with the balance of what he had on the 7th, and he gave me that note, and said, it was his brother-in law's, who lived at Greenwich, and had married his sister, who kept a reputable boarding school at Greenwich. I think it was Church-row, from what I heard since; and that he had a place in Woolwich Warren of near two hundred pounds a year.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you asked him who the drawer was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Look at that note again; I see there is thirty pounds in figures, and the 9th of July; were those on at the time you received it of the prisoner at the bar? - No; they were not. I believe either my son or clerk did it.</p>
               <p>Q.Before or after he had tendered it to you? - After.</p>
               <p>Q. I see it is dated the 6th of May. The 9th of July is when it becomes due of course? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner at this time live? - No. 22, Golden-lane, Barbican.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take this note in discharge of your balance? - I was to give him three pounds seventeen shillings in cash as his balance, and I had not so much about me, and I promised to give it him in two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. What past after that? - He gave me an order of fifty pounds weight more of silk. In consequence of that I went to Mr. Scarle where he had lived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards entertain any suspicions about this, and what did you do in consequence of those suspicions? - I thought it was a bad bill and I went to his house in Golden lane.</p>
               <p>Q.How long after you had received this note? - I suppose in two or three hours, and I asked whether he was at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him at home? - No, I did not. I then see his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards make any enquiries at this place where he had described the bill was to be paid? - My clerk went down to make enquiries.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been able to see any such person as Richard Ball from that time to this? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this that the prisoner was taken up? - He came to my house Friday evening with four men, I had had the note a day then. He came between eight and nine o'clock, he himself and four men, to take me up for a felony, that I had taken away his property for which he had given a very good bill. You will observe that I was out of the house when this man came first, and he came again on Saturday morning about eleven o'clock with a constable and fourmen, and carried me before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you then taken any of his goods? - I had not taken any thing but part of my own property.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you done at his house? - I see some sewing silk lay there, and I said it was my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these things part that you sold him? - Yes, part.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before or after that you received information that gave suspicion of the bill? - After, On Saturday he came, and I was taken before the Lord Mayor, and he made a charge against me that I had taken his property, and swore that he had given me a very good bill.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the information taken in writing? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. How did that matter end? - He accused me of this robbery, and my Lord Mayor said it was a serious charge against me; he gave me my liberty, he did not require bail if I would appear when I was called upon. In the mean time Mr. Searle arrested him for a debt of twenty-one pounds, Mr. Searle told me so. Then on Tuesday following he was had up again to make good his charge against me.</p>

            And you see him in custody of a sheriss's officer? - Yes. He then said that he had taken this bill of a person that had gone to sea.</p>
               <p>Q.Was what he said taken in writing? - I really don't know, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.What was done in consequence of that? - Mr. Davenport and my man, on Saturday, went down to Woolwich, and they came forward on Tuesday, and the Lord Mayor committed him for forgery. He discharged me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. I see this note purports to be payable at the house of the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he lives there, No. 22, Golden-lane, Barbican? - Yes. He gave it me as his brother-in-law's.</p>
               <p>Q.It does not look much like a forgery, for a man to be in possession of a note payable at his own house. I believe you know, in point of fact, that he has a brother in-law of the name of Ball? - He has.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, Mr. Saywell, with respect to these goods the prisoner had of you, you went to his house to reclaim these goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Have a care what you say Mr. Saywell. On your oath, did not you take some goods that he had not had of you? - Upon my oath, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I would have you be cautious? - I shall be cautious. I took none but my own property.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it seems the prisoner first made a charge of felony against you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And by way of doing away that charge you impute forgery to him? - He certainly gave me that note, and said it was his brother-in-law's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember taking away any black silk from the prisoner's house when you went to reclaim these goods? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you sold these goods to the prisoner, you gave him a bill of parcels? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, if it should turn out in the bill of parcels there is no black silk mentioned, what will you say to that? (The bill of parcels shewn him.) - There is raven grey, and that is black.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you had suspected this note not to be a good one, and had called at his house, and could not find him at home, on which you took the silk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He bought goods of you on the fifth and sixth. Did you give him a bill of parcels with these goods likewise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Another thing. His charge against you was heard before the magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you communicated at his house that that note was a bad one? - Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. This raven grey, does it pass for black silk? - It is a lighter die than black.</p>
               <p>Court. Were all the goods that you took away, goods that you had sold to him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. You do distinguish between raven grey and black? - Yes, we do.</p>

               <p>Mr. Davenport. If it is not out of order, I would beg leave to state a circumstance, which I hope will operate greatly in favour of the prisoner. I had occasion to go to Mr. Saywell's, in order to go with his young man to the attorney, for the purpose of consulting what was best to do in this affair; and while I was there the prisoner at the bar came in along with two officers of justice, and he betrayed such a degree of wildness and distraction in his looks, and he acted with such a degree of anxiety on his mind that it struck me he was suffering under a temporary derangement of mind.</p>

Wilson was my clerk—it was his duty to enter the orders in the order-book, then in the delivery-book, and then send them out by Brook, the carman, who would have to take them—the delivery-book was always placed in Wilson's possession, to be sent out with the carman, where his goods were sent—there is no entry in the order-book kept by Wilson of any goods sold or delivered to Mr. Carter, of Croydon—there is an entry in the delivery-book—there is no corresponding entry without the name that could be applied to these goods—we have no customer of the name of Carter, and never had—these are the two chests of matches—supposing each chest to contain eight gross of match-boxes, their value would be 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have never been paid for either of these chests of matches.</p>

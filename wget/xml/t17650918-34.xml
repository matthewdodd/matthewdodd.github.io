About the 10th or 12th of July I received 10 guineas, and 4 s. 6 d. in silver, for some wheat that was carried to the market: I wrapt it up in a piece of paper, and laid it in a private room under some clean linen that was in a room we call the hall; it was not under lock and key, though nobody could see it: I have two men-servants, but it was very seldom any body went into that room but my maid-servant and myself. I went to look for the money, and it was gone: I said, Sarah, I have lost this money, or mislaid it: she lived with me better than three weeks after I miss'd it (I was in hopes she had not been that bad person); she said she never had it: I used to say, Well, Sarah, I can't find the money; and one day I said to her, Suppose, Sarah, I was your servant, what would you think of me? This was on a Tuesday: she gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176509180021"></xptr> herself airs, and fell out with me; she went away immediately, without giving me warning, and went to Justice Baker's for a warrant for her wages. On Thursday I went before the Justice, and paid her her wages: I said there, Sarah, I am afraid you are guilty of taking my money; she said she had but one halfpenny. On the same afternoon a relation of mine, who knew of my loss, seeing her have a great deal of money, acquainted me with it: I went the next morning and got a warrant, and on the Sunday evening took her up at Battersea.</p>

She owned to me at Battersea that she took the money, and said she intended to have gone home upon the morrow, and acquainted Mr. White with it, the person at whose house she lodged, to have his advice in conducting the money back again. She told me she had left the money in care of a person at Hounslow: I desired her to give me a note for it; she said she would, with all her heart: she accordingly wrote a note to Mr. Sumpter for 10 l. 14 s. she had left in his care; I carried it before the bench of justices; they said they could give no order for the delivery of the money till the girl was tried.</p>

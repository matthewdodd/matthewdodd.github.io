                  </hi>. I am a journeyman-baker, and live in Duke's-court, Bow-street. On Sunday morning, the 10th of February, I came from the East-end of the town, and went to a public-house in Newcastle-court, Strand, for about two hours—I did not see the prisoner there—I left about twenty minutes before six o'clock, and went to No. 3, in the same court, nearly opposite the public-house—I did not go into the house It first—there was a young woman standing at the door of No. 3—I merely asked her how she did—I had not been there more than half a minute be<lb></lb>fore the prisoner struck me with a stick while I was standing outside the door—it gave me a slight scar on the forehead, and struck me on the left shoulder—he came from the front parlour of the house—I followed him into the passage, and from the passage into the room he came from—he must have known that I was following him, for before I could get up to him, he took the poker from the fire, and struck me on the left side of the head—I had got into the room, but not close up to him, not to touch</p>

               <p>him—the blow caused me to fell on the ground senseless—I bled a great deal—I never saw the prisoner again till be was in custody, about six o'clock I was taken to Bow Street first, and from there to Charing Cross Hospital, where my wound was dressed—I went to bed, and remained in the hospital a fortnight—I was then discharged as being better, but was not able to work then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman baker, and live in Silver-street, Wood-street, Cheapside. On the 10th of February I was with Harris and Brimley, at Newcastle-court, Strand—when we came out of the public-house, I was talking to another young man, who had not been with us before—he is not here—Harris then went towards the top of the court—I then heard a <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> and saw Brimley enter the house—I believe it was the third door on the right-hand side—I followed him in, hearing the <hi rend="italic">row,</hi> and saw <hi rend="italic">Harrison</hi> standing by the prisoner, bleeding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you call him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Harris, not Harrison—I am not parti<lb></lb>cularly acquainted with the name—he was standing upright—I saw the</p>

               <p>prisoner strike Brimley on the hat with the poker—I went to his assist<lb></lb>ance, and tried to rescue the poker from the prisoner—he got the best of me, and ran out of the house with the poker, and I after him—the pro<lb></lb>secutor was then in the house bleeding—I cannot say whether he was sitting down or standing, for my attention was directed to the prisoner—I followed him till the policeman stopped him—about ten yards before the police<lb></lb>man sewed him, he saw the policeman draw his staff, and he dropped something of the sound of iron—the policeman took him into custody, and desired me to assist him, as he seemed rather afraid of the man—I did so, till another policeman came to his assistance—after the policeman took him, the prisoner said, "I know I have done it, and am sorry for it"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> On your oath, did not he call out for the police as he was running? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not as I heard—I called, "Police"—I was within, I should say, three yards of him, from the time he left the house till the policeman caught him—if he had called "Police" I must have heard him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you happen to slip out the name of Harrison just now? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A thing may slip out—it was mere accident—I might have said so—it was mere chance—I first met the prosecutor and Brimley about ten o'clock, at the White Bear, in Bartholomew-close, or square—they found me there—it is a house of call—I belong to a club there—I had something to drink, I cannot say how much, it was half-and-half—they drank with me at times—I do not know what they drank—they had not any gin there, to my recollection—we left there about one o'clock, and went from there to Newcastle-court—we loitered about, because we found it too late to get to our lodgings—I parted from them to go to my lodgings, and met them again in Newcastle-court, about four o'clock—I was not doing any thing parti<lb></lb>cular from one till four o'clock—I was walking about the street—it was by accident I met them in Newcastle-court—we bad two pots of half-and-half there, and a quartern of gin, as we left the bar—we left there, I should say, at twenty minutes to six o'clock—we were quite orderly and sober—there was no disturbance or knocking at the doors in the street—when I saw Harris in the house bleeding he was standing up—I did not speak to him, or he to me—I did not notice whether he was stanching the wound with any cloth, or any thing—he was not lying senseless on the ground—it is a house of ill fame, I believe—I was never in it before—I have found that out since—I had heard of it before.</p>

On. the night of the 10th of February, about twenty minutes to six o'clock, I left the public-house in Newcastle-court, with Harris and Palmer—there was a young woman standing on the opposite side of the way—I saw Harris make towards her—we had not been out of the public-house above a minute before I saw the prisoner come and strike him on the shoulder with a stick—I cannot say where he came from—it was from inside the house—the prosecutor was outside the house, at the door, and the prisoner struck him as he stood in the passage—there is a step to the door—Harris was in the court, not on the step—I then saw Harris go into the passage—I walked towards the door on seeing him do so, and when I got to the door I heard a noise—they were out of the passage then, in a room on the right hand—I walked in, and when I got to the room door which opened into the passage, I heard a noise like iron moving, and saw Harris and the prisoner scuffling together—I imme<lb></lb>diately went towards them, to Harris's assistance, and saw the prisoner</p>

               <p>strike Harris on the head with a poker—he struck me also, and had it not been for my hat I dare say I should have had a cut—the blow Dearly knocked Harris down—I cannot say whether he was quite down, for I ran to his assistance directly—I was nearly down myself, and by that time the prisoner had made his escape out of the house, before I could recover my<lb></lb>self—I saw him run out at the door, and followed him—I believe he had the poker in his band, but I cannot positively say—Harris was bleeding from the head very much when I ran out after the prisoner—we both came out of the house nearly together—he came out very little after me—I ran after the prisoner a little way, but stopped for Harris—he came out of the house, and walked as far as he was able, to the end of the court, and then stopped, from the loss of blood, I suppose, which made him faint—I had observed Palmer follow me into the house—I cannot say what he did, because as he got into the house I had the blow on my hat, and by the time I could recover myself he and the prisoner were both gone—I did not observe Palmer endeavour to wrest the poker from the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you got the blow before Palmer came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, after—I saw him come in clear enough—I did not see him attempt to do any thing before I was struck—I have known Harris between three and four years—we went out together that evening to see a few friends—I first saw him about six or seven o'clock that evening, and went to the east-end of the town—we went to a public-house in Bartholomew-square—that was not the first public-house I went to with him—the first pub<lb></lb>lic-house we went to, was the Adam and Eve in Jewin-street—I think we got there about nine o'clock—we did not stay there more than half or three-quarters of an hour, and we went from there to the house in Bartho<lb></lb>lomew-square—we met Palmer there—I cannot say whether he was there when we went in—I drank with him there—we had a pint, or perhaps two pints of half-and-half—we did not have four—that was the only liquor I had—what the rest had I cannot say—I did not hear them call for any spirits—I drank no gin as I left the bar—I cannot say what they did—I left with them—Harris and I then walked through Smithfield—we lost Palmer in Smithfield—we walked up Holborn, through Lincoln's Inn-fields, into the Strand, and into Newcastle-court—we had a glass of half-and-half each there—before that we went into a public-house at the corner of Red Lion-street, Holborn—that was about two o'clock—we did not stay there more than twenty minutes, I should think—we had some half-and-half, or porter there—we then went through Lincoln's Inn-fields into the Strand—Harris was with me from the time I left Bartholomew-square till I got to Newcastle-court—we never parted company—he was not two mi<lb></lb>nutes from me—the first thing I saw when I went into this room, was Harris and the prisoner scuffling—I saw the blood running down Harris's face—I do not know which I saw first, the bleeding or the scuffling—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—this is my handwriting—it was read over to me before I signed it—I said, "I went in directly, and saw Harris in the front parlour, bleeding from the head, and the prisoner was standing near him with the poker in his hand, and then I saw him strike Harris on the head with the poker."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you reconcile that with sweating to-day that the first thing you saw was Harris and the prisoner scuffling, and you then saw the prisoner strike Harris on the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was bleeding from the head at the time they were scuffling together—it was about four o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Sunday morning, the 10th of February, about ten minutes before six o'clock, I heard a loud noise and cry of "Police"—I turned round the corner and saw the prisoner running furiously up Little Shire-lane—I could not discern positively whether there was any thing in his hand, but seeing the fury he was in, I drew out my staff to stop him—I perceived him slacken his pace, and he said, "Police, I called police first, I give the charge"—I took hold of his collar on the left, and said, "Never mind that, you must go back again"—in turning round I saw another man come up, he seemed to be frightened to approach the prisoner, and said, "Where is the poker, where is the poker? he had a poker, he struck my friend, and wanted to strike me"—I said, "Seize hold of him, seize hold of him, lest he should get from me"—he took hold of his opposite collar, and we returned to meet the mob—there were but very few persons in the street—I saw none but the mob, who seemed connected with this affair—I walked about ten yards, and saw the poker lay—I snatched it up and produce it—when we got to the bottom of Little Shire-lane I saw the prosecutor bleeding very much down his coat and waistcoat, and without a hat—he said, "That is him, I give him into custody"—in going along, a female came up, and said to the prisoner, "Have you got your watch safe?"—I gave her into custody of the first policeman I met—the next policeman I met, I asked to assist me, and li<lb></lb>berate the man who came up at first, which I believe was the witness Palmer—when I met more constables, I looked round to arrest the others, but they disappeared—I proceeded to the station-house where I received this stick, I believe from the prosecutor—the prisoner said over and over again, that he had called the police, and he would give the charge, he knew Sergeant Pocock.</p>

I am the person the policeman took into custody—about half-past four or five o'clock on this morning, I was standing at a door, and saw seven or eight men about the court, making a dreadful riot, and knocking at the doors—two of them approached me, and I called a policeman, but there was none about—I went into the house, and shut myself in—they forced the door open, and I got a dreadful blow in my face, which made my nose bleed—this was half or three quarters of an hour before I was taken into custody—I heard a disturbance two or three times—I heard a noise in the parlour of a house in the court, as if they were fighting—the candle-sticks were thrown down, and they were all in the dark—I saw the prisoner dragged out of the parlour into the court, by the men—his watch was hanging out of his waistcoat-pocket—he was quite a stranger to me, only he was very kind in taking my part—I did not see a person come out with his head bleeding—the prisoner at last ran away, and some of the men threw the poker at him—they all ran out of the house, and I ran after them—when I saw the prisoner in custody, I went up, and asked him if he had his watch—I asked the policemen what they were going to take him for, as he had done nothing, he had only taken my part—they took me to the station-house, but I was released in a few minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live at No. 241, Strand, three doors from Temple-bar. Harris once lived with me—two years ago he summoned me in the name of Harrison—I was ill in bed at the time, and my wife attended for me, but I saw the summons—I would not believe him on his oath.</p>

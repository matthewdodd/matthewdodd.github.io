On the 4th of June, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening the prisoner came into the shop, and said he wanted a hat - I asked what price he would go to; he said 19 s. or 20 s.

            . I took the hat, and went with the prisoner to Lower Seymour-street - he took it of me at a door, and said he would bring me out the money. He came out in about two minutes, and said, "My master is not at home, if you will bring the bill about ten o'clock in the morning, you will get paid;" I said I would bring the hat up next morning - he said there was no occasion for that, for he had spoken to the shopman, and told him he was not sure he should pay him that night, and if not he would send it in the morning - he said he was going further. I watched him into Sommerset-street; he knocked at several doors, but went in at none, and then turned towards Seymour-street again; I lost him, and knocked at the door where I had left the hat, and asked for it. A lady made some enquiry, and then the butler said he had fetched the hat away. I did not go to the house next morning.</p>

On the Sunday following he passed me in Regent-street; I knew him - he ran down Jeremy-street; I pursued, and secured him, and took the hat off his head. He said he had paid for it - we never received the money.</p>

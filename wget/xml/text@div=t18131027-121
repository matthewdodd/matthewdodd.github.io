On the 27th of October, the prisoner came into our shop, between six and seven o'clock. I was in the parlour, with my back towards the door; I saw the prisoner take something out of the pan; I went into the shop to catch hold of him, he then went out of the door sideways; he went out of the door, and whistled. I went into back-hill; I saw him, a cook-shop man was running after him, the man was beating the boy; when I came up I bid him stop; I said, that boy had been in our shop, and had robbed the shop. The man asked me if I saw the meat in his hand; I said, I did not; his back was towards me. I am sure the prisoner is the boy; he had something before him, and kept his back towards me. I lost a leg of lamb, a piece of salt beef, and some breast of mutton. It appeared to me as though he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270066"></xptr>crossed the shop twice, by the marks of his feet on the floor.</p>

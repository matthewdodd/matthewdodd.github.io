                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, living at Woolwich—the prisoners were in my employ. On the 26th of October, I sent them to Plumpstead-common with two wagons of coals, each containing thirty sacks, and each sack 2341bs.—they returned at half-past ten in the morning—Henderson told me they were all right—I thought that rather singular—Adamson was not present then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Power, at Plump<lb></lb>stead. About half-past six in the morning of the 26th of October, I saw the two prisoners coming with coals—I saw Henderson undo the rope at the back of the wagon—Adamson took a sack, and went in the way to Bull's-fields—Henderson was doing the rope up—Adamson returned with an empty sack under his arm—I then went to work—I undid the gates when the prisoners came to the house, and afterwards found there was a sack deficient —Henderson said to me, "Do you live here?"—I said, "Yes"—he then said, "We are <hi rend="italic">done</hi>."</p>

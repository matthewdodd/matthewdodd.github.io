                  </hi>. I am bar maid at the Half Moon, in West Smithfield—my brother in law keeps it. On Friday, night, 14th May, about 7 o'clock, the prisoner and another man came to the house together—they had half a quartern of gin, and they waited some time, and then the other man had half a quartern of brandy, and they had two pick wick cigars—I asked for payment, and the prisoner's companion gave me a sovereign—I gave him change—the prisoner said, "Don't change, I will pay," and he asked me to return the sovereign; which I returned to his companion—I put it on the counter, and took the change back—the prisoner's companion insisted on paying himself, and he asked me to give him the change—I took up a sovereign, and gave the change back—the prisoner's companion put the second sovereign on the counter—that was not the sovereign I took at first—the servant in the bar parlour gave me some information, and I went to the drawer and looked at the second sovereign, which I had received—I did not look at it when I took it up from the counter, supposing it was the same I had taken before—I found the sovereign was bad—the prisoner was then in the bar, his companion was gone—I went to the prisoner, who was stand<lb></lb>ing near the door, and asked him where bis companion was—he said, "What is the matter?"—I had the bad sovereign in my hand, and I said, "He has given me a bad sovereign"—the prisoner took it out of my hand and said, "I will find him"—he went out—my brother in law went out and brought him back, in about five minutes afterwards, and he was given in custody.</p>

On 14th May, the prisoner came there with another person—they drank half a quartern of gin between them, and then the prisoner's companion asked for half a quartern of brandy, and they drank that between them—they asked me to give them a cup of tea, which I did—I saw the prisoner's companion offer a sovereign, in payment—the prisoner said, "Don't you change, I will pay for it"—Miss Sanderson gave the companion the sovereign back, on the counter—he took up the good sovereign, and dropped another out of the lower part of his hand, while I gave him the tea—I had put it on the counter—I saw Miss Sanderson take up that other sovereign, and put it into the till—I told her to look at it, which she did—she came out of the bar, and tapped the prisoner on the shoulder, and said, "Where is your companion?"—he said, "What is the matter?"</p>

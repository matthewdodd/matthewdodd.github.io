                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. George Adam Lurby, who keeps the Salutation public-house; the prisoner was his pot-boy. On Sunday morning, the 26th of Oct., at half-past seven o'clock, I came down stairs—the bar was closed, and I went to light the kitchen fire—I came up again in about ten minutes—the top sash of the bar door was open, and I saw the prisoner drawing the brandy into a quart pot—I said, "William, what are you doing?"—he said, "I am only drawing a little brandy; it is a very cold morning; don't say any thing"—I went down, and came up again in five or seven minutes—the bar door was closed then, and he was in the parlour—I went to go in, but he put his arm across the door and snid, "Go down stairs"—I went down, and in a few minutes after I was in the area—I saw a man go out of the door—the prisoner came down and filled a pint bottle with brandy out of the quart pot—he left about a tea-spoonful—he asked me to drink—I said no, it would make me sick—he said, "You are not half a one; Sarah, the last servant was the one to drink brandy; she drank so much one morning that she left drunk"—it is not the business of the pot-boy to draw brandy, nor even to go into the bar, except to clean the counter—I saw the man go out of the house—I saw the prisoner let him out.</p>

PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say at the police-office that you saw the prisoner let him out, or that you heard him go out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard him go out, and I saw his feet go across the rails—this occurred on Sunday morning, and I told my master on Thursday—I did not like to tell him on Sunday—I had only been there a week—I was in my last place for nine months—that was a public-house—I have said before that I saw the prisoner put the brandy into a pint bottle—I have had no quarrel with him, further than I asked him one day to fill a very large iron kettle, and he told me to fill it myself—I said, "You emptied it, William; fill it"—I never spoke ill of him to any one—I never drink brandy.</p>

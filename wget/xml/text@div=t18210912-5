On the 9th of August, about a quarter after twelve o'clock at noon, I was in my bar; the prisoner was in the tap-room. My tea chest, containing my money and trinkets, was in the bar. At nine o'clock I had deposited several valuable things in it. - there was 163 sovereigns, 6 half sovereigns, 13 guineas, four half guineas, three 7 s. pieces, and 27 l. in silver. I had put the chest, in the bar, expecting the distiller would call for money. At a quarter past twelve o'clock I was giving change out of the tea chest, for a sovereign, and was counting the money over, ready for the distiller; I cannot say whether the prisoner saw me or not, he was in the tap-room. I had occasion to go into the yard to fetch some pots, I was not absent half a minute, on returning to the bar, my wife called out from up stairs, saying that Wilson was running very hard towards Whitechapel, I turned round, and missed the chest from the bureau drawer, and the prisoner was gone. In about a quarter of an hour he was apprehended.</p>

            . On the 9th of August, about a quarter past twelve o'clock at noon, I saw the prisoner in Church-lane, Whitechapel - (it was the day of the robbery) - with a woman, they were struggling together. I was on the opposite side of the way, in company with Smith, and seeing them struggling, I advanced towards them, and as I advanced the prisoner threw the caddy from under his arm. I told Smith to secure him. I picked up the caddy, a quantity of silver and sovereigns fell out, and I picked them up; we took them to Lambeth-street, and gave them to an officer, with the chest.</p>

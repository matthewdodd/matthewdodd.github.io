                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 205.) On the 10th of Feb. I was on duty in Abingdon-street, and saw the prisoner with another man, oppo<lb></lb>site the new House of Lords—I watched them—they went a little way up Abingdon-street and then returned—the prisoner then crossed to the new houses of Parliament, and came out from the side of them with this pipe on his right shoulder—I stopped him, and asked what he was going to do with it—he said to take it home—he said he bought it six months ago, but he refused to say who he bought it of, or to give any account of himself—it was covered with snow.</p>

               <p>at the new House of Lords—I was fixing lead pipe on the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th of Dec.—I know this pipe—I fixed it inside against the wall, to bring water from the upper part to the lower part of the building—I have matched this to my work and it supplies the deficiency—it was fixed—I have the end here that was left, and the end of this in the prisoner's possession, fits it to a nicety—this end is stamped, showing the number of lengths that were made.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> If I stole it it is hardly reasonable I should be car<lb></lb>rying it openly on my shoulder at that time of night; it was out in the snow when I saw it; I was not on the premises after half-past five o'clock—I knew it did not belong to me; and when the policeman stopped me I did not know what to say.</p>

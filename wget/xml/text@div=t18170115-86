I had delivered my letters, and had received 10l. for them, consisting of eight of 1l. bank-notes and the rest in silver and copper, there were shillings, sixpences, and half-crowns among it. I was stopped by three men, one of them held my right arm down, while the prisoner robbed me of the money stated in the indictment. The notes were in my right hand breeches pocket, the silver in the left, and the copper in my left hand waistcoat pocket, which he tore in taking the copper out. The third man stood by; they were with me about five minutes; they then ran away. I gave information at the police office, and described the men. I saw the prisoner in custody at Lambeth-street, on the 21st, I knew him directly. I am sure the prisoner is the man, I picked him out immediately from several others. There was a good light at the place, from a factory lamp; it was by the lamp that I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you intoxicated at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MILLER. I am an officer of Lambeth-street office. I took the prisoner into custody, on the 28th of November, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, from the description that I received from Judd. I found him walking along Whitechapel. I told him that I wanted him for a robbery, and the next morning I took Judd to look at him, and then told him, that I wanted him for the robbery of the postman in Bell-lane, with two others; I did not tell him what day it was, he said, he knew nothing about it. Judd saw him when he was before the magistrate. This (producing a paper) is the examination before the magistrate I heard him state what has been taken down.(read.)</p>

            . I am in the silk line. I called upon Mrs. Elliot on the 5th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, and waited there till eight o'clock in the evening. The prisoner lodges with her. I left him there when I left, he was not out of the house all the time that I was there. Mrs. Elliot lives at Dog-row, Whitechapel-road.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. GURNEY. I live in Dukesbery-court, Whitechapel. The prisoner lives more than half a mile from Bell-lane. I did not go to inform the magistrate that he was at home on that day. I knew he was taken up, but it was three weeks after he was taken up, that I knew he was charged with doing any thing on the 5th of November. I do not know what day of the week the 5th of November was on. I had been to buy some linen and called on Mrs. Elliot, she was sitting by the fire reading, when I went in; the prisoner was nailing his shoes; the prisoner drank tea with us; I staid till eight o'clock Mrs. Elliot went to her needle-work after tea, another woman came in while I was there, and staid till four o'clock. She was Mrs. Elliot's acquaintance - I do not know her name. It was eight o'clock when I went away.</p>
               <p>DIANNA ELLIOT. I live in the Dog-row; the prisoner has lodged six months with me; he is a rope-maker. He came in about half-past one o'clock, and nailed his shoes; it was a wet day; he was nearly all the afternoon nailing them. He drank tea with us. Mrs. Carr also drank tea with us; she came to my house about three o'clock. I see her almost every evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do while she was there - A. I was chiefly talking to her. and looking at her things: she went away about eight o'clock; the prisoner did not go out at all. I heard that he was taken up on the 29th. I do not know what day the 5th of November was, I only noticed it by its being wet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. REYNOLDS. The prisoner lives at my house; I was cleaning my room when Mrs. Carr came up.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150038"></xptr>Q. Did any body come in while Carr was in the room - A. Mrs. Clayton came in with her; I knwo her by sight. The reason of her coming was because she was with Carr; we all three came home on Saturday together. Mrs. Clayton stopped at my house, drank tea with us, and went away with Carr. I had not been reading the whole of that day.</p>

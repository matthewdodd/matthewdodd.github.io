                  </hi>. I am wife of William Jannaway, a pawn<lb></lb>broker, of Exeter-street, Chelsea—the prisoner was our servant for six weeks, and had been so once before for three months. On 10th Oct. I sent her for some beer for supper—when she came back she seemed to have a bundle under her apron—she moved her hand, and it seemed as if she had put it into her pocket—next morning I missed some rings from my jewel-case in my bed-room—the key was in it—I had given the prisoner notice to quit the evening before—on the next evening she asked leave to go to her aunt's to tell her she was going to leave—I gave her leave, and then told my husband—he would not let her go—he went up and spoke to her—he is not here—I was present when he asked her if she had seen anything of Miss Louisa's brooch, my cousin—she said she bad not, and did not know what kind of brooch it was—Mr. Jannaway said if she was innocent she would have no objection to his searching her boxes—she said she had not—we found nothing in them which we could swear to—Mr. Jannaway turned her bed down and found a bundle, containing a night-gown and two aprons, which</p>

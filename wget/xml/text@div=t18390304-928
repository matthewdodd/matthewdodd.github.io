                  </hi>. I lived in Compton-street, Soho, with Mr. and Mrs. Segrave. I am not married, hut live with a person named Benjamin Hawkins, as his wife—I have known the prisoner between seven and eight months—on the 6th of February, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I met him at the Crown and Anchor—we drank together—I changed a sovereign to pay for a glass of rum and water, and got six half-crowns, and three shillings change, which I put into my bag—I do not know ex<lb></lb>actly at what time we left, but the prisoner told me he had leave till twelve o'clock, and I think it must have been nearly twelve o'clock—in crossing some square, from there to my own house, he persuaded me to go to another public-house to have some other liquor—I do not know the name of it, it is kept by a person named Kendrick—we had a glass of rum</p>

               <p>and water there—I cannot say who paid for it—I was sober—my bag was placed on the table, during this time, with the money in it, and two letters, on? from a physician, and one from my mother at Bath, and a pocket handkerchief, which he had lent me in the evening—on leaving, I took the bag up, and found it completely empty.</p>

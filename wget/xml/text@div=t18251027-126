On the 8th of October, soon after coming to town, I received information - I inquired of him what molasses had been filled out within two or three days - he said two or three puncheons, but perhaps it might be three or four - I think that was his answer - I said was that all? - after a little hesitation he said, there was a half puncheon more for a friend of his; I had the book in my hand at the time, and said, "What, for a friend of your's, and not entered? I am afraid this is not all - I have reason to believe there is more." He then said there was another half puncheon. I said "That is not all." He then said "There is one more." I said "There is more yet." He said, in all there were four puncheons and a half. I expressed surprise at their being delivered without an entry - he said "Two were paid for, and two were not." I have since seen a person named Wade, to whom the prisoner had no right to sell - he is a stranger - this memorandum of figures is the prisoner's writing (looking at it) - it is not in the form in which an invoice would go from our house, having no name to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you seen Mr. Wade since? A. Yes; I never received money of him before; if they had been entered, it would not have been right, as the prisoner had no right to sell to a person of this description - he had authority to sell to general dealers who we had business with - I cannot say I had given him any limit - he had never received money from the regular dealers, except once or twice when I sent him out for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you authorise him to receive money from regular dealers? A. I think in one or two instances I have - he has received money from others - there is a man who was a very faithful servant in our employ, and we have indulged him with a small quantity of sugar and molasses, and from him the prisoner received money - this will explain one part of what may be called irregular dealing. About the month of April the prisoner came into the counting-house and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is a person, who has been in the habit of coming from a wholesale grocer, for a half puncheon of molasses; he has no order now; but will you let him have half a puncheon? he will pay you." I said "You may let him have it," and I received the money the next day - that is another irregularity. About August the prisoner said, "Will you let a friend of mine have half a puncheon?" I said "I don't like it." He said "It is a friend of mine, a gingerbread baker, at the west end of the town; he will pay you for it;" and that is all I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear there is no more? A. I cannot tell what may have been twelve months ago - I never gave the prisoner orders to receive generally, nor told him that the old servant was to be an exception - he was so well acquainted with the duties of a sugar-house I had no occasion to tell him - if he had entered these molasses, and paid the money, there would not have been a word of this here - I should have mentioned it - I never saw Mr. Wade pay any money to my clerk to my knowledge - I will swear he never paid money to me - I will not swear he never paid my clerk.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Whether the molasses were sold to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182510270052"></xptr>a regular dealer, or an irregular one, was not the irregularity in not entering them in the book? A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you had an account with that house? A. About six months; I once paid some money to the prisoner in the presence of Mr. Plaxton, who has seen me there several times before. There is an account between me and Mr. Plaxton - I owe him money - it is to me these molasses are charged as being sold.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you ever deal with Mr. Plaxton or Mr. Dames for any article you had from their house? I was introduced by another grocer; I never personally dealt with Mr. Plaxton or Mr. Dames; what transactions I have had have been with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At the time you paid money to the prisoner, in Mr. Plaxton's presence, did he interfere or take any notice of it, or make any complaint? A. No, not the least.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILMOT</hi> Prosecuted; and Mr. Grain Defended Santry. George Pitt. I am a plumber, of 8, Perry Street, Millwall—on 28th February, about 10.30 p.m., I was in High Street, Poplar, and accidentally knocked up against the prisoners—I may have asked them to have a glass of ale, but I do not recollect it—I went with them to the Greenwich Pensioners public-house, and treated them to liquor—they both asked me to go in there—we stayed about an hour, and I had two or three glasses of whisky—I had a watch and chain and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loose in my trousers pocket in gold and silver—I took out my gold watch and chain while I was there, and placed them in my trousers pocket because I did not wish to lose them—only we three were in that compartment—we came out and went down a court, and when I got to the bottom of it I was knocked on the head and knocked down senseless from the front—it was perfectly dark; you could not see your hand before you—there was no gas—the prisoners were with me, and I saw nobody else—when I recovered consciousness I found myself lying on my face on the ground in the court—I got up on my knees, felt in my trousers pocket, and found my watch and everything was gone, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903310085"></xptr>
               <p>my hat as well; the women were gone also—this is my watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was seriously hurt; I was in bed three days; my left eye was completely stopped up; I could not open it for three days, and I could hardly see out of the other—a doctor attended me for three or four days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I know Cotton Street—I do not know Mr. Laxford, a grocer, of Poplar—the prisoners must have been standing outside the Rising Sun in High Street, Poplar—I recollect being with them, but as to meeting them I do not recollect it—I hare no recollection where I first put eyes on them—I asked them to go and have a glass of something—I had been looking for work all day—I had a pint of beer with my dinner at 1 o'clock, and I was not sober when I met the prisoners—I dare say I had had four or five glasses of spirits—not more, because I had been laid up—I was not perfectly drunk—they walked with me when I came out—I first asked them to go to the Rising Sun, the house I came out of; but they refused, and we went to the Pensioners—Santry had some rum there—she is married, and I have heard from her relations that she is a respectable woman and the mother of a family—I walked and talked with them when I came out—I could not make out anything else but that they were going to take me to their house—Santry did not leave before we got to the passage—I can vouch for the two going down the court with me, and Santry had her baby in her arms—Driscoll went into the passage first, and I walked behind her, and Santry behind me; there was not room for two to walk in the passage—I suppose Santry's baby was still in her arms—I never saw it put down—the passage is about 40 yards long, and I received the blow at the end of it—there is a sort of courtyard at the end and a door which you would run your head against if you walked to the end—it opens easily—it is not kept locked, but it shuts and blocks up the end of the passage—you cannot go through if it is fastened—I know because I saw it—there is no door at the end I entered by—the blow was a very hard knock, and I laid senseless for an hour or more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Driscoll.</hi> They did not refuse to serve me with drink when I went into the Greenwich pensioner—I had several glasses of whisky there—they did not serve me with soda-water that I am aware of—I did not tell you that I had not too much money because I had been all day on the loose—I broke some panes of glass in Greenwich Pensioner Alley, which my father had to pay about 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for next morning, but that was after I came to myself—it was done accidentally; the court was in pitch darkness, and I made my way to a light which I saw in one of the cottages—I came to the door, which was fast, and I shoved up against it—it was beyond the door in the passage; the door was not open, but I shoved up against it, and it gave way—they turned me out of there, and I broke the glass, or else I should never have known where the place was—I broke the glass to identify the place, and then went home—I did not take my watch out when I paid for the drink and lay it down on a seat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was not light enough for me to see the door at the end of the passage, but I know it was there because afterwards when I broke the glass a man opened it—I am sure I did not run my head against the door at the end—there was a light at the other end, but it did not throw any light down the passage—I thought they were going to take me to their house or into High Street, Poplar—they refused to go into the Rising Sun—Driscoll said she had just been into the b—house, and would not go in again; she would go to the Pensioners.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 413). On 26th February I received information, and went to Sentry's house, 7, Pock Street, Poplar—I said "Is your name Santry?"—she said "Yes"—I said "Do you remember being at the Greenwich Pensioners last night with a gentleman between 10 and 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>?"—she said "Yes, and I had some drink"—I was in uniform—I said "What is the woman's name who was along with you?"—she said "I dont know her name; she is a friend of mine; I meet her occasionally"—I said "You must know her name; you had better tell me"—she said "I shan't, unless you tell me what you want to know for"—I said "That gentleman has been robbed"—the prosecutor's father, who was with me, said "You had better be careful, and tell where this woman lives"—I said "Is her name Driss or Driscoll?"—she said "I think Driscoll"—I said "Where does she live?"—she said "I think next door but one to a public-house called the Brick in Ashton Street"—I went the same day to 22, Ashton Street, and ascertained that Driscoll lived in the front parlour, but was not at home—I reported to the inspector on duty, and on Thursday, 27th February, the two prisoners were brought to the station by the prosecutor's father—I said to both, "Have you got any money or anything on you?"—Driscoll said "No"—Santry said "I know nothing of it"—Driscoll then accompanied me to her room at 22, Ashton Street, but on the way she escaped from me into a house in a low court—I was walking beside her—I had not made her a prisoner—I found her two minutes afterwards in a small house in a court—she said "Are you going to lock me up?"—I said "I shall now, you will be made a prisoner of"—I went to her house, and in the front parlour, which is her room, in a box which was locked I found 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—she had pre<lb></lb>viously stated that she had no money—I then charged her on suspicion of stealing the watch and money and assaulting Pitt—she was remanded for a week at the Thames Police-court—I failed to get any more information and she was discharged on 7th March—I then said to her "I am determined to come and search your place again"—she said "Very well, I am a respectable girl"—she left the station a little before me, but I went to her house the same day and found her in the back yard—I said "How did you come in?"—she said "Through the front door"—I then dug a portion of the yard up, and at the iron door of the closet, stuck behind the skirting board, I found this watch wrapped in paper and covered over with a handful of soot—I said "Here is something here; here is the gold watch and the chain and five francs and a locket containing the photograph of the complainant's father and mother; you will now be charged with stealing this property and the money of George Pitt"—she said "I do not deny being in his com<lb></lb>pany; when we left him he never had a mark or a blemish on him"—she was taken to the station, and before the charge was taken she said to the inspector "This man says that I pawned the watch"—I said "I might have said so before, but you see I have found it now"—I took Santry the same afternoon at her house, 7, Dock Street, and charged her with being con<lb></lb>cerned, with her sister, Driscoll, in assaulting George Pitt—she said "Very well, policeman, I will go to the station with you quietly; if my sister had that watch I know nothing about that;" and she said at the station "I had the misfortune to meet this young man, me and my sister, in High Street, Poplar; he knocked up against us; he asked us to go and have a glass of ale and we did in the Greenwich Pensioners; we had gome more drink after that, and had some rum" or "brandy</p>

               <p>in a bottle; I went in first; my sister went out with a jug to get some ale and I stopped in to mind my baby"—the court where this took place is just at the rear of Santry's house, which is about 200 yards from the Greenwich Pensioners—her husband is a very respectable hard-working man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. He is here—I know that his wife has a family and a child at her breast, which is in prison with her—no Judge has ever told me that it is highly improper to question prisoners—I did not tell her that I was going to charge her—I do not think it is my duty to caution people that what they say may have relation to some charge, but it would be my duty if I was certain she was the guilty party—it would certainly be my duty to caution persons before I cross-examined them—she was not actually given in charge till 7th March—I found no property at her house on 26th February; I did not search—I went there to make inquiries, to get the other female's address—I had no good authority to search the house, I had not sufficient suspicion—I believe I had a right to pat all those leading questions to her without a caution, although I dare not search her house—I know that not one of the Jury has a right to question the prisoners—when the prisoners were brought to the station by the prosecutor's father I asked Driscoll "Have you anything about you?"—she said "No;" and Santry said "No, I am a respectable married woman"—I had not power to charge them then, and they went away free people—she voluntarily offered that I should search her house, and I went with her, but she bolted from me—I made a prisoner of her as I found 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in her house—I did not take Santry when I took Driscoll, because I went by my superior's directions that there was not sufficient evidence against her on the first occasion—the additional evidence was Pitt identifying her—the door at the end of the alley is 7 or 8 feet high.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Driscoll.</hi> Pitt would not swear to the amount he lost, and therefore the charge was not entered—the inspector did not say that Pitt could only charge you with the watch—he did not say "You cannot charge her again for the money she has already been discharged for. Re-examined. It is a blind alley; you cannot get through to any place to my knowledge—the door at the end is for any vehicle to go in—when the door is shut the alley is blocked up, and if the door is open you cannot get beyond the courtyard—Driscoll was present when I found the watch, and made no remark whatever—I got information from Pitt's father—I was in the station when he came and complained on Wednesday morning about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners' Statements before the Magistrate.</hi> Driscoll says: "When he was paying for the brandy he pulled the watch out with the coppers. He left the watch there and I picked it up. He was blind-drunk; he could not remember what he was doing."Santry says: "I know nothing about the watch, Me and my sister went down High Street, Poplar. He knocked against my sister. He took us in to have a drink. When we were coming out he paid for half a pint of brandy; she brought it down to my place, and I did not see her till next morning."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Driscoll's Defence.</hi> I had the watch before I came out of the Greenwich Pensioners at all. As I came out I saw it lying on the seat, and picked it up and put it in my pocket We came out and drank a little of the brandy outside. He said he could not drink any more. We bade him good night, and left him in Cotton Street I would have given the watch up next</p>

               <p>morning, but I was afraid of being taken in custody. I did not make away with it The money in my box I got by the sweat of my brow. If he speaks the truth he knows we never struck him, we never had a word of anger, and he had not a blemish on him when when we left him. If he had kept his watch in his pocket I should not have been a prisoner to-day.</p>

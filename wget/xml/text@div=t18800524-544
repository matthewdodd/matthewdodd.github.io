                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Eagle Tavern, East India Dock Road, Poplar—I have been a licensed victualler seven years come June—I once lived and held a licence at the Tenterden Arms, Devons Road, Bromley-by-Bow—I kept a barmaid, potman, and a servant, and con<lb></lb>ducted the business with that staff—the adopted daughter of Mrs. Flowers is my wife—Mrs. Flowers is a widow—she is interested in the Tenterden Arms—the licences are in her name, the mortgages are in mine—I left the Tenterden Arms to go to the Eagle on the 25th March, 1879—the Ten<lb></lb>terden</p>

               <p>Arms was then conducted by a manager ana nis wife, a Mr. and Mrs. H. Evans—I had no knowledge of the prisoners before June or July, 1879—Brooks first called at the Eagle; it was on a Saturday evening, between 16 and 8 o'clock—he said "Mr. Parsons, I have come about the Tenterden; I hear you want a manager and his wife"—I said "How did you know?"—he said "I heard it at Mr. Cast's"—I said "It is rather a funny night to come about an engagement as manager and his wife, being Saturday"—he said "It is"—I said "Where have you been living?"—he said "At the Wellington, with Mr. White"—I said "How long hare you been living with Mr. White?"—he said "About 11 months"—I said "Is Mr. White living there now?"—he said "No, he has sold his house"—I said "How long have you been away?"—he said "About two or three months; I could not say exactly"—I said "Did Mr. White follow Nick Argent?"—he said "He is a wide man" (meaning Argent); "I managed to pull the trade together with Mr. White, and he sold the house for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more than he gave"—I said "Well, what about the neighbourhood? the Tenterden is rough at times"—he said "It can't be much rougher than the Wellington"—I said "Has your wife been used to the business?"—he said "Yes, both in London and America, but Mrs. Brooks has been more particularly employed at the Wellington to look after the children, as Mrs. White was having a family very fast"—I made an appointment to meet him and his wile at the Tenterden Arms the next day, Sunday—I met him, and he introduced the female prisoner by saying "Good evening, sir; Mrs. Brooks"—I said "Good evening; what do you think of the house?"—he said "I think we can do very well here," and Wretton said "Yes, I think we can do here," or "Yes, I think so," or words to that effect—I said "Where is Mr. White living?"—one of them said "At 53, Almorah Road, Islington" I said "What would be the best time to see him?"—he said "If you come upto-morrow evening about 7 o'clock he will be at home; don't make it later, he is a man that has regular hours"—Wretton wrote down these addresses produced (Mr. White, 53, Almorah Road, Islington, and Mr. Brook, 15, Charlotte Street, Caledonian Road, N.)—the second address I was to write to to tell the prisoner if his reference suited—Brooks referred to Wretton's experience as a barmaid in America, in her presence—I went to 53, Almorah Road, the following Monday evening—I saw a female who said she was Mrs. White—it was in the front room, level with the front door—I said "I have come respecting Mr. and Mrs. Brooks"—she said "I never give characters; I always leave that to Mr. White," and that he had waited till 7 o'clock for me, but would not be in again that evening—we made an appointment for 10.30 the next morning—Wretton then came through the folding door—I said "This is Mrs. Brooks, Mrs. White"—she said "Yes"—I said "Good evening," and left—the same evening, about 9.45, the female who called herself Mrs. White came to the Eagle in company with a man she introduced as Mr. White—he was not the witness White—he said "Halloa, old fellow, how are you?" and shook hands; "you have been up to my place"—I said "Yes, I waited till 7 o'clock for you; well, how about Fred Brooks? what sort of a fellow is he in the bar?"—he said "He is a first-rate fellow, and he is a good worker; he is a man that will pull the trade together; he got me some money together at the Wellington"—I said "I hope and trust he is a trustworthy fellow; he will have the management of the place and have the engaging of all the servants"—he said "You will</p>

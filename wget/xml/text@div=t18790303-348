                  </hi>. I keep the Railway Hotel, Church End, Finchley—on the morning of 24th Feb., between 5 and 6 o'clock, my bell was rung by a constable—on searching the house with him I found the prisoner under the bed in the best bedroom on the first floor—this was a spare room—she had a shawl and a new blanket—the wardrobe had been disturbed—she had evidently fetched the shawl out of it—the blanket lay on the bed—she was in my house on the Saturday evening previous—no one had seen her there on the Sunday.</p>

On Monday, 24th February, I was on duty near the hotel about 5.30—I saw a light in the front room, which used to be the nursery—I thought it strange—I saw the light going into the coffee-room—I looked through the keyhole, and saw the prisoner come and put</p>

I went over the house with the last witness, and I corroborate what he says—I did not go in the room where the prisoner was—she was given over into my custody outside the house—I said "How came you to be in the house?"—she said "I came up from London last night, and was drinking at the bar with a man, and how I came to be in the house I do not know"—she was quite sober.</p>

She denied stealing the goods.</hi>

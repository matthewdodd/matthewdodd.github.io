On 21st Jan., I saw the prisoner on the steps which lead into the garden at the back of my house—I said, "What are you doing?"—he said, "A bill, a bill!"—I said, "What are you doing?"—he said, "I don't know whether this belongs to you"—he had got this coat on one of his arm, and was putting his other arm into the sleeve of it—I called "Police!"and he ran away—my cook pursued him, and a man brought him back—the policeman arrived—the prisoner went down on his knees, and said he hoped I would forgive him—I said I could not—the place he was at was a private entrance to my house, leading to my garden—this coat had been in the hall; there are two doors to it—I think very likely the outer door was open—the inner door had been fastened a few minutes before, and I believe no one had been out—to have taken</p>

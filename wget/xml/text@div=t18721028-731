I am a clerk in the War Office, and live at 3, York Place, Baker Street—I have been married more than three years—on 16th September my wife was at Scarborough—I was standing at my own door, smoking, and saw the prisoner pass—he said "Are you in want of a groom, sir?"—I said "No"—he said that he had been living in the service of the Hon. Mrs. Something, and was then living in the Mews opposite—he left me, and I said that if I heard of a situation I would send to him—I opened my door with a latch-key, and I do not remember taking it out—I went up stairs to bed, and put my watch on a small table by the side of the bed—I awoke next morning at 5.45, and found my dressing-room in partial disorder—the wardrobe was open, and some of my clothes were lying about the floor—I missed my watch, and my jewel-box from a drawer—it contained two chains, and some lockets and breastpins—I also missed a locket containing the hair and a photograph of my deceased mother, which was on a chest of drawers—I raised an alarm, and had the police sent for—I had not invited the prisoner into my bed-room, and given him any of these things; that I solemnly swear—the value of the property I missed is over 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

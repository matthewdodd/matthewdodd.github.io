We had a gelding; I saw it put into the stable about five o'clock last Thursday evening, and missed it about seven o'clock - the prisoner has lived there till within the last five or six months; my father searched about, as we thought the door might have blown open; we could not find the gelding - we made diligent search the next morning; we searched about the common, but could not find it - we found it in Smithfield the next day; a man had it for sale, who told me his name was Moss; the prisoner came afterwards - I asked him if it was his horse; he said it was: I said again, "Is this your horse?" - he said, Yes: I said,"You know it is my father's;" he looked at it, and said "I see it is your father's;" Moss asked him for the shilling which he said he would give him: he told him he would give it to him when he found the man he bought the horse of; we went to several places where he thought he could find the man, but could not, and the officer took him; the last time I saw the prisoner at High Wycomb was six days ago; the bridle and saddle on the horse were not our's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far do you live from High Wycomb? A. About three miles, or it may be four - the prisoner and his father are horse dealers; he said he had bought the horse, and seemed anxious to find the man; no one had hold of him for half an hour - he did not attempt to escape; he said he bought it of a tall man in a straw hat, and had seen him in the market that day.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Wycomb-marsh, about six miles from Napwell; I have known the prisoner about four months - he lived at my house: last Thursday evening, he came home about eight o'clock, and went to bed about nine; he had his bridle and saddle in his hand - that was a common thing: he has had them ever since he has been at my house, which was a fortnight last Monday: I am sure he slept in my house that night, and got up the next morning about four o'clock, I expect, but I cannot tell exactly. <rs id="t18290219-179-verdict1031" type="verdictDescription">

I had the care of his brown mare, and put it into the stable on the evening of the 15th of January - I left the stable at nine o'clock; she was then locked in the stable - she had a flaxen mane and tail; I went to the stable about eleven o'clock that night, in consequence of something mistress said to me, and as the dog barked; I found the mare was gone - I went in pursuit, but could not find her: I saw her again about eight days after, at Uxbridge, in Middlesex, in the possession of Ingram; it was the same mare as I had locked up safe on the night of the 15th - I missed a set of harness for a shaft horse from the same stable, at the same time, and found that with Ingram.</p>

            . I am a builder, and live at Uxbridge, in Middlesex. On the 20th of January, in the evening, I went to a public-house with Ingram, in consequence of information, and saw the prisoner; he had nothing then - Ingram said he wanted him; he asked what for - Ingram said he could not tell him, but asked him for the key of the warehouse or stable, which he rented; he at first refused to give it - Ingram said if he did not he should take it from him; he then gave it to him, and we went to a house for a light, and then to the warehouse; we took the prisoner with us - he said nothing, except asking if the landlord was afraid of his rent; I unlocked the door, and saw a dark brown mare there - I asked him whose it was; he said his - I said, "How came it yours?" he said he bought it of his brother, who bought it last August, at Stourbridge fair; a set of harness for a shaft horse hung<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183202160007"></xptr>up there on a peg - Ingram questioned him about that; I did not hear what he said - the mare's mane and tail were flaxen; I was afterwards present when Hall saw the mare - he knew her the moment he saw her, and identified the harness.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the prisoner in Uxbridge? A. Not for a year or two before, to my knowledge; we found a cart in the stable - the name of

            . I am constable of Uxbridge. I accompanied Murray to the public-house where the prisoner was found, and in the stable we found the mare and harness; I asked the prisoner whose harness that was - he said it was his; Murray's account of the conversation about the mare is true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the prisoner shortly before that? A. No, not for more than a month; I was informed he was in possession of a mare and cart, and went there - Uxbridge is a hundred and sixteen miles from Litchfield.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went about the Tuesday before Christmas-day, for a holiday, to Birmingham, and on my return, about Woodstock, was overtaken by a man with this horse and cart together - I asked him to give me a ride; I got into his cart, and asked him where he was going - he said he did not know, for he was in trouble; I asked what trouble he was in - he said he had got the bailiffs on his premises, and brought the horse and cart from home intending to sell them, but did not know where - I said I wanted to buy a horse and cart; he said he would sell them - I got out, and looked at them; he asked thirty guineas for them - I offered him 20l., and then 25l.; he said he would take that - I wanted him to go into a little public-house just by, but he said he did not wish, because he was known there, and the people would want to know why he sold his horse and cart; I paid him on the road, just outside the public-house - it was on Wednesday; I came home; the man turned back, but where he went I cannot tell.</p>

            . I live in Uxbridge, and have known the prisoner two years; he was in the habit of going about the country with earthenware - I saw him shortly before Christmas; I cannot tell where he was going - I saw him take out his pocket-book; he had a great bulk of money, and put some gold on the table - he bears a good character.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever know him keep a horse and cart? A. No, his father did; I do not know where he was on the 15th of January - he has two brothers younger than himself; the eldest is about sixteen - he goes about with a horse and cart for his master, Mr. Smith.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the prisoner driving the horse and cart about Uxbridge? A. No.</p>

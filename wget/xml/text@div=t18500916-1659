I went to the Maypole, at Barking-side, on 26th Aug., about four o'clock in the afternoon—I afterwards saw the prisoner there—he was alone—there were other persons in the room—I was carrying two glasses of liquor in my hand to the parlour, and I felt a jerk from my left-hand pocket where I had my watch—the chain was round my neck, and the watch in my pocket—the chain was joined to the watch—I looked down and found my watch was gone, and the chain hanging round my neck—the prisoner was the nearest to me; he had a coat over his arm, and I saw him put his hand under the coat, and he walked away—I went after him, and said to him, "You have got my watch"—he said he had not—I saw him with the watch, and was going to take it from him, but he dropped it just outside the door—I saw him drop it—there was no one near him when I saw it drop—I was about a yard from him—I picked the watch up, and took him in the passage—I gave him and the watch to the policeman—this is the watch.</p>

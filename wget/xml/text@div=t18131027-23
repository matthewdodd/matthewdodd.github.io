            . I am a servant to Mr. Simons. On the 25th of September. I let a lodging to the prisoner and his wife for two shillings. They came about nine o'clock at night; went up stairs, and came down; about two minutes after they said they were going out to get something for supper; they would return again. They gave me eighteen pence. He said when he returned back again he would give me the other sixpence. In the mean time they were gone I went up to get the children's clothes to put them to bed. I found the bed furniture, one sheet, a pillow-case, and napkin were gone. I directly ran out, and halloaed out stop thief, and two gentlemen laid hold of the prisoner. I am sure he is the man, I can swear to him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 25th of September I heard the cry of stop thief; I pursued the prisoner; he was stopped at Aldermanbury. I took him to the Compter. In his pocket I found a napkin; in his hat a pillow-case. I undressed him. He had all this bed furniture wrapped round him, and pinned with this large pin in his breeches and round his body. We could not find the woman.</p>

            . The prisoner let a sheet fall at a door; I picked it up, and gave it to the officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been drinking freely all day with the woman that took me to this lodging; she took me to this house, and took the curtains down, as she said, from her bed. She begged me to take them with her to the pawnbrokers. I had not been out of the house long before I heard the cry of stop thief. I was stopped and taken. I looked round; the woman was missing. I was taken to the Compter. I did not know but the property belonged to the woman. Gentlemen, none but a madman or a drunken fool would have done such a barefaced robbery.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Basing Row, Greenwich, and am a hammer<lb></lb>man—on 2nd October, between 9 and 10 at night, I was standing at my door, with my wife and Mrs. Mars—the prisoner lives next door, at No. 7—I said "There is always a bother here, you can get no rest night or day"—as I said that, the prisoner opened his door and came out—he was near enough to hear me—he said "What is your game?"—I said "What is yours?"—he said "I will soon show you," and struck me with a knife on the right breast—he struck me three times in the face with the knife—I lost a good deal of blood, and was losing my senses when the doctor came—my with came to my assistance and I saw the prisoner stab her as I got up—he was kneeling on my chest, and stabbed me after I was down—I cannot tell whether he stabbed my face before I fell or after—my wife got him by the hand, and he pulled the knife out of ray throat and stabbed her—the prisoner's wife stood by his side, but I never heard her speak—I had had no quarrel with the prisoner, no more than I have with you, nor any dispute in my life—I had not challenged him to fight—I never interchanged a word with him.</p>

I live at 3, Basing Row, East Greenwich, and am a hammer-man—on Saturday night, 2nd October, about 9.45, I heard a dis<lb></lb>turbance outside my door, and saw the prisoner, who lives six doors off—I know him intimately, by living in the neighbourhood, but do not know what he is—I heard him say, "Is not there time to mend? Is not there time to mend?"—he mentioned that three of four times over—he was standing in front of Williams—they closed and fell to the ground, the prisoner uppermost—they rushed into one another's arms, but I cannot say which began, it was all at once—the prisoner was lifted up by the collar by a female, not the prosecutor's wife—he passed me as I was going to the man who was stabbed, and went in at his own door—I cannot say whether he had anything in his hand, as it was very dark—I went to Williams' assistance, and fetched a doctor and the police.</p>

I am a mechanical engineer, of 4, Lampton Terrace, East Greenwich—on 2nd October, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I was in Mile Street, Greenwich, and heard cries of "Murder!" and "Oh, my poor father!"—I went to the spot, and saw Williams on his knees, with one hand on the ground and the other on his cheek, just outside his own door—I did not see the prisoner then—I took Williams up in my arms and carried him into the house—he was bleeding from his face, breast, and arm, profusely—I asked for a cloth, they gave me a towel, and I attended him till a doctor came—I afterwards accompanied the police-sergeant to the next house, and saw the prisoner sitting on a sofa—I said, "It is a very bad case, and very bad cuts, I should like to see the knife it was done with"—the prisoner's wife said that what her husband had done he had done with his fist, he had no knife, and it was in his own self-defence—the prisoner said that all he had done was to stand in his own self-defence, and he had no knife—the sergeant told me to go and get a candle—previous to that the prisoner's wife produced two table-knives, and said they were all the knives she had in the house—</p>

               <p>the prisoner was present at that time—I obtained a caudle, and went up stairs with the constable—the prisoner's wife went up first—I went on one side of the bed, and the constable on the other—I held the candle, he took the bed off, and said, "It is pot here, but we turned up the mattrass, which was in two halves, and something dropped on the ground; he then picked up this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had been washed, but there was a little blood on the shoulder—I know it had been washed, because both blade and handle were wet, and there was water on the floor—it was closed.</p>

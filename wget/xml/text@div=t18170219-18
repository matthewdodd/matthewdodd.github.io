On the afternoon of the 13th of February, about four o'clock, as I was coming down stairs I saw the prisoner come out of the room where the tools were, I asked her what she wanted, she said she had been sent to do half a day's work by a person down the alley - She had something in her left hand, under her apron; after she was gone I missed the articles stated in the indictment directly, I had seen them safe half an hour before. I followed her, and asked her what she had taken out of the room that she had just come out of, she said, she had taken nothing. I found the tools under her apron, and brought her back.</p>

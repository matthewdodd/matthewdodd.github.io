            . I am fifteen years old, and live with Mr. Thompson, who is in the Commission way - he lives in Coventry-place. I am his clerk - Turner was walking along - I saw the man at the bar in company with two other persons - I saw the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Turner's pocket, and draw out something in his hand - I was close to him - Turner looked round and said he had lost his purse, and I told him what I had seen - I pointed to the prisoner, and said "That's the man who has got your purse;" the prisoner then hobbled away - I am quite sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see him hobble when he first took the purse out; I was going to Knightsbridge with some bottles - I had never seen him before - he merely pushed against the prosecutor, and then put his hand into the pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. John Augustus Thrupp and two other partners—they are coach-makers, and live at No. 269, Oxford-street. The prisoner had been in their employ about eighteen months—on the 20th of October, in consequence of information, I went to a back part of the shop, and found some new bolts concealed under some hay; I marked two, and set a person to watch—about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner in the street—I sent a man to fetch him back—when he came to the front of the shop, I went and took him by the arm, and told him to walk into the counting-house—he told me to let go his arm, and he would walk—the counting-house door which I went to was locked—I sent a man round to open it, and when I was going in with the prisoner, I saw at his feet some bolts—I took them up, and two of them were those I had marked—I sent for the officer, who found on the prisoner twenty-one bolts and nuts—I have no doubt they were Messrs. Thrupp's, but there was no mark on them.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable T</hi> 71.) I was called into the counting-house, and found the prisoner. I took him into custody—Mr. Mott said it was for stealing the bolts—there were five of them on the desk—I found one more bolt in one of the prisoner's jacket pockets; twelve in the other jacket pocket, which were loose; and eight in his breeches pocket, which were tied in a piece of paper—when I was taking him to the station-house, he said it was but a very small trifle, that they were worth but a shilling, and he was only to get a shilling for them at Paddington—when he got to the station, he said they did not belong to Messrs. Thrupp.</p>

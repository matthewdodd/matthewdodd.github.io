On the 6th of January, I left home between seven and eight o'clock, and left nobody at home; my wife went out before me - it was quite dark. I fastened all the doors and windows. Between nine and ten o'clock, in consequence of an alarm, I returned home, and found people outside the door. Turner, went to the back of the house, and I to the front door, which I found fastened as usual - I opened it with the key. I had seen a light up on the first floor before I got to the house; I had left a light on the ground floor myself. On opening the door, I held it in my hand - two men came rustling down stairs; I said,</p>
               <p>"You are not coming out this way," holding the door fast; they then ran to the back part of the house - one escaped, and Turner took the other, who was the prisoner; we brought him into the house, searched him, and found a picklock key, matches, a piece of wax candle, a phosphorus bottle, and 13 s., but nothing of mine. I went up stairs, found the drawers all pulled out, and all the best of my wife's wearing apparel sorted out, tied up, and taken into the shop below. My clothes were taken out of the back room, and carried into the shop. Seven spoons were taken out of the cupboard down stairs, and one from up stairs, and taken away entirely - they have not been found. Those clothes which were not so good as the rest were thrown on the floor and trampled upon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The persons who got into the house must have entered at the back - A. No, they must have got in in front, with a picklock key. I did not find my back door open - they opened it when they ran to the back of the house. Several persons followed after me into the house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could any of those persons remove the property down stairs - A. No, my Lord. Twelve or thirteen picklock keys were found on the premises. I tried one to the street door; it unlocked it. They opened the back door as they went out.</p>

            . I joined the prosecutor opposite his own door. I went round to the back premises, and when I got to the door, I heard a great bustle, and before I got up to the door two men came out; the first had a dark lantern, nearly shut, but sufficiently open to shew a small light. I attempted to seize him, but did not succeed. I took the second, which was the prisoner. The lantern was found in the back ground afterwards. I pushed the prisoner into the back parlour, searched him, and found a picklock key on him, also some matches, a phosphorus bottle, and 13 s. I assisted in taking him to the watch-house, and when I returned I got a light, searched further, and close to the back parlour door, I found six more<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182401140011"></xptr>picklock keys, laying in the wash-house, inside the house - the back door comes from the wash-house. I found a crow-bar and hat in the garden. Till and I applied the picklock keys to the front door; one of them opened it. I went up stairs, and found the drawers broken open, and things in disorder - there were marks on the drawers and boxes, which matched with the crow-bar.</p>

            . I went out before my husband, and came home a few minutes after him, and found the prisoner in charge. A bundle was in the shop, containing two shawls, two tablecloths, and other things, which I had left locked up in the drawers; the boxes in the back room were broken open and robbed. I had locked up a desert spoon in the drawer up stairs; the tea spoons and sugar tongs were down in the parlour cupboard, which was not locked. I had used them all at tea.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was in my way home from Mile-end, and passing the back of this house, which is a public thoroughfare, I heard a cry of thieves - the gate at the back of his premises was open. I immediately ran towards the back of the house, when a man ran against me, and almost pushed me down. I went towards the other two men; they laid hold of me, and said,</p>
               <p>"You are one." Seven or eight men ran through the house, into the garden, took me into the shop, and took 13 s. out of my pocket; but the key, phosphorus bottle, and matches I never had about me, as God is my Judge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 197). I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Devonshire-street, Commercial-road, on 3d February, about half-past eleven o'clock at night—the houses there are almost all brothels—a woman of the town, named Walters, made a communication to me, and while she was doing that, the prisoner came out of No. 3—the woman said to me, "That is him; stop him; stop thief!"—I caught him by the left side—what the woman said, was said loud enough for the prisoner to hear it, and he seemed to run the faster—when I stopped him, he put his hand in his right hand pocket, drew out a handful of white coins, and threw them away—they sounded like metal when they fell on the stones—he scattered them very much—I picked up six shillings—I had him still in custody—I proceeded on with him to the station, and searched him there—I found in the breast pocket of his coat, two florins—I then went back, and the young woman who called on me to stop him, gave me this other florin, and here are two other shillings which were picked up in the street afterwards—as I was going with him to the station, he wanted to get away, and threatened to knock me down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> He handled me so rough, he tore my coat, I said if he would let me go I would quietly—the young woman said I had passed two bad two-shilling-pieces to her, and that I took them away again. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi> Yes; she said so.</p>

                  </hi>. These six shillings are all bad—three are from one mould, and three from another—they are all the same date—the three florins are bad, but from different moulds.</p>

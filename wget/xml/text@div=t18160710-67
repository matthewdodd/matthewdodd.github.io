               <p>RICHARD SEARLE. On the 19th of June last, at about eleven o'clock in the morning, I was getting my spirits up from the cellar, when my wife called me, telling me a man had gone up stairs. On my going to her, the man had gone out, and she pointed the prisoner out to me. I brought him back, and found the property in question on him.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner coming down our stairs, and I called my husband. The prisoner went out of the house; my husband followed him and brought him back.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been a sailor, and was in the greatest distress; I have been in several engagements, and cutting out, and in cutting out a french frigate under Commodore Linsey, I fell off the ship side, and cut my head on the side of our boat; after that I was rather incapable of doing regular duty, and was put in port; after some time, my ship was paid off, and I came to London in hopes of getting some employment. I found that every where there was a want of work, and I could get none; at last. I bethought myself of offering to eater on board the Tender; I went down, and presented myself to the officer on duty, who hearing my distress, ordered me a day's provision. The next morning, the regulating captain examined me, and said, old man, you will not do; you are two old; with a heavy heart I went on shore again, with no other prospect before me than that of famishing in the street; my reflections overcome me, and I sat down on Tower Hill, and my lord, I am sorry to say, I was unmanly enough to cry. While I was in this situation an old ship-mate came by, he asked me how I got on; and I told him, there was no work to be got any where, and I was starving. He said, never mind, I have got a little money, and will see what we can do with that; with that he took me to a public-house, and we had some beer, and he gave me some gin, which on account of my head, and my stomach being empty, took such an effect of me, that I was driven to take the prosecutor's property. This my lord, I assure you, is the truth.</p>

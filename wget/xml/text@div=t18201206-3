On the 1st of November, I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and left the house all fast. I had been in the cellar before dinner that day, the flap was then fast. I was disturbed between twelve and one o'clock by the watchman knocking at the shutters; he said somebody was in the house. I went down, let two watchmen in, and they went into the cellar. I saw the prisoner in custody at the watch-house. Upon going into the cellar, I found a pistol, loaded with ball and gunpowder, concealed under some boards, also two skeleton keys, a box of phosphorus with matches, they all laid together. Before going to the watch-house, I examined the flap, and found it had been wrenched; the shutters also appeared to have been wrenched. I am sure the pistol, keys, and things were not in the cellar when I was there before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. The cellar is open to all the family - A. Yes; it is dark when the flap is down. My motive for going into the cellar before dinner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182012060004"></xptr>was to see whether it was clear to receive coals - I went up to the flap, it was down. I did not touch the bolts, but had they not been fast, I must have seen it. I had a candle with me. The flap had not been opened for two years as the coals were shot from the shop. My wife knew the coals were coming, but she could not open the flap; I examined it before I went to the watch-house, there were marks of the crow-bar in several places, one part was broken. I found the pistol and keys under some boards, which had been moved to cover them - they were not there in the morning - there are no stairs leading from the flap, I have no doubt it was bolted.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went into the cellar with Avis; I found a screw driver and crow-bar (producing them.) The marks on the flap corresponded with the crow-bar, and in my judgment the flap was forced open by it - I did not examine the bolts.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the flap in a socket - A. Yes, it would be necessary to use the crow to lift it up outside.</p>

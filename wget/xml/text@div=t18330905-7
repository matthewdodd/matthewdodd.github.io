I shut up my house about ten o'clock at night on the 14th of August; I fastened my shop window shutters with screws, and between twelve and one o'clock I was knocked up by the policeman, who gave me information; I came down and examined the shop window, and observed the shutter was pulled down - it was forced out - it was an outside shutter; it could not be got down without being forced down by some instrument; the nut of the screw was slipped; the window does not open - the glass was broken; I had left some shoes in the window when I went to bed; I dare say there were about twenty pair; I examined the shoes and missed three pair then, and on taking what was left up stairs, about one o'clock, I missed a fourth pair; the four are worth 13s. 6d. - 5s. 6d. a pair; they were my property, (looking at one pair) these are the shoes; I swear they are part of what I lost that night; they are the only pair of this sort I had in my window; I bought them on the 6th of April, of Robert Cumming, of Red Lion-street, and they are stamped R.

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prosecutor came to me about these shoes, and the prisoner afterwards brought the pair of shoes now produced, and offered them to me in pawn; these are the shoes, they have not been out of my possession; I have produced them now; they are the same I produced before the magistrate: he asked 2s. 6d. on them, they were stamped on the bottom with R. C., which is now on them; I detained him, and gave him in custody; I asked him if they were his own property, he said yes, that he bought them in Petticoat-lane for 2s; it was about twelve o'clock on the 15th of August, that he came: I live at No. 25, Whitechapel-road, and am servant to Mr. Dexter.</p>

            . My father serves the prosecutor with shoes; I know he bought this pair of shoes of me on the 6th of August - I know them by the stamp, and also it is twelve months since I made such a pair of shoes; I made them twelve months ago; it is very seldom we make such shoes - I did not make them myself; I am positive they are the shoes.</p>

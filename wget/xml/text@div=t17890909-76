               <p>Might not those hooks be in the scale house, and you not know it? - I am positive these hooks were not there at all.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday the 5th of August, I was appointed that morning by Mr. Church the prosecutor, to follow carts loaded with tea, from Botolph wharf, the upper station, to Parker's-gardens, the India-warehouse, and in my turn, I did my duty in that, and at the hour of two, I left my station; and prior to that Mr. Church (the prosecutor) came to me, and told me, Madgett, it is almost high water, there is a great glut of work come in, and I fear I shall fall short of men; I, sensible of the many obligations I laid under to Mr. Church, as being a distressed young man with a large family to support, I said I would; I set out for my station again, on coming down thro' the station, I recollected having put a little cane in the scale-house, belonging to the same station, and among some cordage and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090091"></xptr>boards, I found these two hooks, and an old adze, and two old chissels laying: upon that my lord, on taking up this cane, and seeing these hooks, and hearing my worthy Mr. Church (my appointer) say he was short of those hooks, I took them out, and publicly carried them along the middle station towards the scale house, where I intended to deposit them for my own work, but Mr. Wilson, m landwaiter, and a gentleman, the gangsman, crying out, Madgett, Madgett, marker, marker, I immediately repaired to my gangsman; and knowing it was not safe, to lay these hooks out of my hands; I publicly put one into each pocket; I marked forty-five bags of coffee; then I went up into the scale-house and made a memorandum of the transactions, concerning the coffee; the prosecutor came in; it was my duty to make way, which I did; on getting up, I put my left hand to my pocket; on which he said, what have you Madgett? two hooks, said I; he said I have lost so many of these hooks, and I believe your intention is to take them; I, sensible of my intention, said it was not so; Mr. Church took one of the hooks out of my pocket; when I had taken the other out, I went out and staid by my duty, and took care of the coffee: Mr. Church (the prosecutor) happened to come by; I told him, I hope you are sensible that necessity never brought me to that pitch, of thinking those hooks worthy of being picked up out of the gutter, and I hope you will think no more of it; his answer was, he was very sorry for it; I stood my duty till I was relieved by the king's watch, when I went home, and came at six to relieve him; about half past six, the prosecutor happened to come by, I said to him, shall I go to the India work, or take care of this coffee; says he, Madgett take care of the coffee, and see it delivered; very well Sir, says I; I also mentioned to Mr. Church, that I hoped he was sensible of his error, in making a charge of the kind upon me; he said he was very sorry for it; I stood my duty; and about seven, or half past, the prosecutor came, and told me, Madget, says he, you are wanted in the Surveyor's Office; I went with him and he made his charge; and on my defence I was ordered back to my duty; which I went to on the upper station, then I attended the Surveyor's office again, and then Mr. Church made the charge against me, and I made my defence; upon which the gentlemen surveyors said, that they wish propriety, could not discuss the matter, but that they would know the pleasure of the Board; I said what is to be done with me in the evening? one gentleman said was under a penalty of 100 l. for my bondsmen, and it was not safe for them to let me at liberty; then I desired I might be committed to the care of a constable, and they desired to know where my lodging was; that they might search it, told them No. 2, Rose-court, Tower-street; they searched and found nothing, it was the pleasure of the Board, that I should be taken before a Magistrate, I was put into the Poultry Compter without any examination, and then one of the prosecutors said, he would do for me; the subsequent morning, I was taken before the Lord Mayor, and my iron knocked off; and still the rigorous designs of my Prosecutors were such, that I have been credibly informed by one of the turnkeys, that they prevailed so far; or at least forged an order to the Lord Mayor to commit me, whether or no; there are gentlemen in Court I believe on my behalf, I was on the verge of promotion; I should not know to what use to convert them hooks; I could not sell them, as they have the king's broad arrow upon them; and by the 7th article, it is my duty to take care of the weights and scales.</p>

            . I am surveyor to the New River Company. On the 22nd or 23rd of July this plank was stolen; I saw it again in the possession of three little boys on the 6th of August - one of them was named Cole; in consequence of what he said I had the prisoner taken.</p>

            . I live with my father. I was employed to keep possession of some goods at the King's Arms; I got into conversation with the prisoner one morning, who said he was going to saw this plank up for fire-wood; he asked if I would buy it - I asked what he wanted for it; he said 2s. - I gave him 1s. and a pot of beer for it - it was in my possession two or three days; I then sent it home by a cart and donkey, and it was stopped by Mr. Treacher.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. Cole was given in charge in my presence; he said he gave 1s. 6d. for the plank to a person who lived at the back of the premises, but he did not know his name - I found the prisoner, and took him to Enfield, before Mr. Hardy; I did not say it would better or worse for him to tell the truth - he made this confession, and put his signature to it (read.)</p>
               <p>"Last sunday fortnight two boys were fishing pulled the plank out of the river; I took it home, and not finding an owner, I sold it for 1s. 6d. to

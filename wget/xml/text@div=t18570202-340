                  </hi>. I live in North Woolwich road. On Saturday evening, 10th Jan., about a quarter to 8 o'clock, I saw the prisoners together, and another man with them, standing two yards from the kerb, twelve or fourteen yards from the prosecutor's window—Croker said, "Now is the time;"I thought he meant it for me, and as I had just got my money, and that being a dangerous place, I put two sovereigns into my boot; but he went direct to the prosecutor's window, and made a blow with his hand—I thought he struck the sash; he then struck a second blow, which broke the glass, and drew his hand sharply back, and ran away; French made off with him—Croker moved his hand sharply, but I cannot say whether he threw anything or not—I caught him by the throat as he ran towards me, and he fell down; I took him back to the prosecutor's—he pretended to be drunk—I gave him into custody.</p>

               <p>since; I did not tell the police—I told sergeant Gamble that it was French before he was in custody, on the Sunday, and I told another policeman, whose name I do not know—I do not know why I did not tell the prose<lb></lb>cutor at the time that I knew the man's name—I did not go to the station to sergeant Gamble, he came to me—I left my address with the prosecutor—French generally goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi>; I believe I did not tell any person his name till he was in custody.</p>

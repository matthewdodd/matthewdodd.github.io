                  </hi>. I keep the General Elliott's Head, 1, Bedford bury, Chandos-street—about a quarter-past 2, on the afternoon of 11th May, the prisoner came to my house for a pint of beer, and he gave me a bad florin—I gave him a shilling, a sixpence, and halfpence change—he went away, and I put the florin in the till—there was no other florin there—I had just taken all the money out—after the prisoner had gone I took the florin out, tried it, and found it was a very bad one—I put it in my pocket, and afterwards gave it to the constable—next day the prisoner came again about the same time—I recognised him directly—he asked for half a pint of beer and a screw of tobacco, and gave me a bad shilling in payment—I tried it as soon as I took it off the counter—it bent double—I went round</p>

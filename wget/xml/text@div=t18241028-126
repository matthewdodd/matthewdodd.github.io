            . I am an officer of the Thames-police. I apprehended the prisoner at a marine store-shop, in Cow-cross, on the 20th of October, with a bundle on his arm, with 7 lbs. of new iron-nails in it - I asked where he got them; he said from his own house, the Crown and Cann public-house, Clerkenwell. He said he had bought them in Long-lane - I asked the name of the person - he made no answer - I asked him to go and show me the shop - we set off; but when we had walked about a dozen yards, he said</p>

               <p>"I will tell you the truth," he then said that he had taken them from his maste, Messrs. Williams, at different times.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Did he tell you who his masters were - A. Yes. He was not offering the nails for sale - there were three or four customers in the shop.</p>

            . The prisoner has been in our employ for three years - these nails exactly correspond with what we had. He said it was the first time he had ever done so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he a good character before he came to you - A. Yes. We lost a great quantity of nails; but had no suspicion of him. We had a man who left us about a fortnight before, on a charge of stealing a saw.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had some of the nails before, which I bought.</p>

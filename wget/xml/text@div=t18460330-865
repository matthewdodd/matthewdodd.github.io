At a quarter after ten o'clock at night, on the 21st of March, I met the prisoner on the Pembroke-road, two or three hundred yards from the prosecutor's premises, with a bundle—I asked what it contained—he said his breakfast things—I asked him to show them to me—he said, "Come round the corner, and I will show you them"—I said, I would not—I collared and pulled him to the corner—he struck me a violent blow on the mouth, and got away—he dropped the bundle—I pursued him, but he got away—I came back to the bundle, and found it contained this lead—I have fitted it to the place the prosecutor describes, and it corresponds—I took the prisoner about half-past two o'clock on the following morning—I pounced out upon him, and said, "I have got you; I won't give you the chance of getting away now"—he said he could if he tried—I had seen him frequently before—he lives in the neighbourhood.</p>

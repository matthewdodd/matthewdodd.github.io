                  </hi>. I am the wife of Daniel Neale, and live in Walt<lb></lb>ham-place, Whitechapel. The prisoner is my husband's mother. On the 1st of September, I was at my husband's sister's house in King-street, Wapping—the prisoner and her sister came up to my place afterwards, and brought my husband with them—as I went up stairs the three of them attacked me together on the stairs, and I got cut in the left hand—I do not know which of them did it—I cannot swear the prisoner did it—she had threatened me about a fortnight or three weeks ago, but she was drunk at the time—she is an old woman, and I do not wish to injure her—I was not much hurt—the three of them beat me together—I cannot say of one more than another—she can understand English, but cannot speak it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 253.) On the 1st of September I went to King-street, and saw the prosecutrix on the stairs, and blood flowing from a wound in her left hand very profusely—she made a com<lb></lb>plaint of having been cut—in consequence of what she said I went into the back yard, and found the prisoner concealed in the privy—I found this razor in her pocket—there is no mark of blood 00 it—the prosecutrix gave charge of her.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you made any noise to call any body before Cullen came up A. No; I was only challenging the prisoner, Cullen told me that he saw the prisoner put the watch in his pocket, in the prisoner's presence, I had hold of the prisoner by his coat, he immediately gave me a blow which knocked me down, he ran away, and I and Cullen pursued him, he run up a court, there was no passage through the court, and as I went to the bottom of the court I saw him coming down with a knife in his hand; stop thief! was cried out by me and the witness repeatedly, and Prince the officer came up and stopped him, and took him in custody; the other man ran away immediately. The pocket book was found near the place where he was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this. A. Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in liquor. A. I had been drinking, but I was sober. No other person run up the court but the prisoner when I was pursuing him.</p>
               <p>Mr. CULLEN. I live at No. 13, Great Arthur-street.</p>
               <p>Q. That is near where this robbery took place. A. Yes; I was standing looking out of my window, I saw this Kendrick between two men, towards the bottom of Great Arthur-street, they were holding him by the coat, I saw soon after a watch in the prisoner's right hand, which I saw him put into his right hand waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw him the watch was not in his hand, was it. A. I did not perceive it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with that watch? A. He put it into his right hand waistcoat pocket, I still kept looking at him; I saw Kendrick put his hand down to his breeches, as if to feel for something; I judged then there was something amiss, I opened the front door, I heard Kendrick say he had lost his watch, I supposed they were acquaintances, I said your friend has got your watch in his right hand waistcoat pocket. Then he made his escape and ran away, and I followed after, by my following of him and the alarm of stop thief, he ran into a court in Golden Lane, where there was no thoroughfare; he returned, and I followed him with Mr. Kenrick up Golden Lane, I saw Prince the officer standing in the middle of the street he stopped him and took him into his house and searched him, I said you will find the watch in his right hand waistcoat pocket; I came away and a man a stranger that followed him as well as myself, we went up the court to search for the watch, we could find none, I returned and went home, I heard the watch was found, that is all know of my own knowledge except what I have heard.</p>

Yes, the prisoner was running up Golden-lane towards Old-street; I saw a great mob, I heard the cry of stop thief, as I was in Golden-lane, I went to stop him, he up with his fist, he said you b - r I will knock you down if you offer to stop me; I collared him with my left hand and seized him with my other hand, we had a bit of a scuffle, I took him into my own house and searched him, I found nothing upon him but his knife. This pocket-book was just at my back door. I stopped him a great way from Arthur-street, where he started. The watch was found by Mr. Walden.</p>
               <p>MR. WALDEN. I am a corn-chandler, 64, Golden-lane; I heard the alarm of stop thief on the 22d of October; I believe, about one o'clock, I saw the prisoner running down Turks-head court, he crossed Golden-lane, and went into Bannister-court where there was no thoroughfare, he returned in a very short time. I turned down that court to make a search, there we found nothing in the court; I afterwards went through my own house into my back yard. In Bannister court there is a wall about five feet high, and the paling about three feet; at the top of the wall the paling is not close, a person might put his hand through between the paling and the wall. I looked out of my own yard, and saw the watch lay behind the wall of Bannister-court; I went over my yard into that yard and picked it up, and went through my neighbour's house into the street again. I took the watch to Mr. Prince's house, the prosecutor Kendrick was there, I desired him to explain what kind of a watch it was, before I gave it to the officer; he described the name and the number, and the chain and seal answered to his description</p>
               <p>Q. to Prince. Have you got the watch - A. Yes, and the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Court. Shew it to the Prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch, and the chain and seal is mine, and the pocket book is mine; I believe it is in the same situation now as when I lost it.</p>

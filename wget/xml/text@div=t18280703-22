On Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, I saw a hind quarter of veal hung in the slaughter-house; which was not sufficiently fastened - the hinges were off one door; it used to be fastened with two hooks, but was only fastened with one; I went there next morning, and the veal was gone - I sent for Harris, the officer, who shewed me some mutton fat, which we put over the veal to prevent its turning; I went to the prisoner's house with Harris - he was in bed; I saw part of a loin of veal on the table - he said it did not belong to me, that he had bought it elsewhere; either he or the officer brought the other part of the veal from the closet - the prisoner then said he hoped I would forgive him, and consider his family; I afterwards wished to forgive him, as his wife was heavy in the family-way - he said he had done it from want, and his wife expected to be confined every hour; the officer said he must not give up a prisoner like him - I knew the veal by the colour, it was much whiter than common; he lives about forty yards from me.</p>

            . I am shop-boy to Mr. Chalkley. I was in the slaughter-house when the veal was hung up - I fastened the door with one hook instead of two; the hinges were off - a person could pull the door open; I heard a noise next morning about two o'clock, and heard the bar fall which I put across the door, which had the book in it - it opens into a court: I went into the slaughter-house, but did not miss the veal then - I fastened the house up, and master in the morning missed the veal; there is a way from the shop to the slaughter-house without going through the court.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Sunday morning, about a month ago, I went to Mr. Chalkley's - I saw some bits of fat on the ground, and traced them about thirty yards along to where the prisoner lived, and in the passage some more pieces of fat lay; the gate opens into the court he lives in; I knocked at the door - the prisoner asked who was there; I said it was an officer - he immediately got up and opened the door; it was about ten o'clock in the morning - I found in the cupboard part of a loin of veal, with a piece of a breast of mutton; he said he had bought the mutton of Chalkley, and the veal at another place - I put it on the table, and called Chalkley in; I went towards another cupboard - the prisoner hallooed out that it was there; he brought it out, begged Chalkley to forgive him, and hung round his shoulder - I said I could not let him go, but if the Magistrate chose I did not care.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Council for the prosecution, opened the case as follows:</p>
               <p>My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, the burglary in question has already been the subject of investigation in a former sessions, in which one man has been convicted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260051"></xptr> for this burglary; and I have the authority* of a very learned Judge, who attended in the last sessions, to say, that the burglary is, in point of law, proved; and therefore the whole question is , whether these prisoners are the accomplices in a burglary, which the learned Judge has described to be of a very atrocious nature, though not within the common cases of burglary. The circumstances of the case are shortly these; that Mr. Thompson, being an old gentletleman, and living at Islington, the prisoners at the bar, in company with some others, came there on the 10th of March last, they knocked at the door, and the servant having opened it, they said they had a letter for somebody, they delivered the letter, and immediately rushed in; having got into the house, they secured the maid servant and the mistress, who is an old lady, and they then stripped the house of almost every thing of value. Gentlemen, I shall call the witnesses in proof of these facts, and you will, in that case, have no doubt in pronouncing the prisoners Guilty.</p>
               <p>* See Sessions Paper, No. V. Part I.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Willes. There is no doubt of the law, if a man knocks at any door at night, and gets admittance by a false pretence, that is burglary.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Examined by Mr. Garrow.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Thompson, he lives at No. 3, in the Lower-street, Islington, I have lived with him almost seven years; about a quarter after seven in the evening, the 10th of March -</p>
               <p>Court. Was it dark then? - Quite dark, it was a rainy night, we had lighted candles about a quarter of an hour; there was a gentle knock at the door, my mistress said, somebody knocks: I went to the door and I asked who was there, and I thought they said there was a letter of importance, but however they said there was a letter; I opened the door a little way, and a man presented the letter, I put the door a little way open, this is the letter, I saw a part of the direction.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you a candle in your hand? - Yes, in a flat candlestick.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. To whom is it directed? - To Miss Young, Islington; I told them it was not for me, nor any body in that house; I was going to push to the door, they said stop, and they pushed the door in, and all rushed in; and one of them took me by the throat; I think to the best of my knowledge there were six of them that came in, one of them seized me by the throat, which stopped me from crying out, but he dropped his hand a little, and I cried out, O Lord Jesus! we shall all be murdered!</p>
               <p>Court. How long had you lighted candles before this? - About a quarter of an hour, or rather better.</p>
               <p>It was not twilight, it was dark? - It was dark.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did they do then? - Then I desired them to let me go into the parlour to my mistress, who was just come out of a fit of sickness, as they would frighten her to death.</p>
               <p>Court. What is become of the man that was convicted last sessions? - He is under sentence of death.</p>
               <p>Has the report been made? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Have these prisoners any Council?</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I am for Branton; take the accomplice out of Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What did they say or do on that? - They all went into the parlour, and one of them, who I believe is the tall man that had the cutlass, took my mistress by the head; when they let me go again, I screeched out, and some of them said damn them, gag them, and the other said cut them down the head; one of them had a cutlass, which he pulled out of his breast, he was a tall man in a brown coat, he had a cocked hat on, and a white cloth over the left side of his face, he is one of the evidences; they let me go, and one of them took my mistress by the head; to the best of my remembrance they all went into the parlour at first.</p>
               <p>Court. Did they put your candle out, or did it continue? - No, Sir, they took my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260052"></xptr> candle into the parlour, they went behind my mistress, and I was afraid they were going to kill her, and I began to scream, and then they began to swear again, and bid us be quiet and they would do no harm; I believe they were about ten minutes in the parlour altogether, they stood till we were quiet, then four of them went out and left two in the parlour.</p>

               <p>Court. Had they any disguises? - I saw none of them disguised but the tall man.</p>
               <p>How many candles had you in the parlour at this time? - My mistress had no candle while I went to the door, and until the four men went of the room we had but one candle lighted, I believe the men lighted the other candle.</p>
               <p>Court. As there was but one candle in the parlour, and none of them were disguised, had you an opportunity of observing the faces of the men? - I observed the face of the tall man, and the man at the bar, which is Branton, they were the men that were left in the room, he was dressed in a brown great coat buttoned up.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any part of his face covered? - I do not know, he was buttoned up very close, and his hat a great way over his face, and I observed him to be very broad over the shoulders and thick, especially his neck; I saw his nose, and his mouth, and his chin.</p>
               <p>Can you swear that man was the man? - I am sure he was the man, I am sure to the best of my knowledge that is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you or can you not swear that that is the man? - I am sure he is the man that walked with the pistol in his hand, from the parlour door to the card-table which stood in the room.</p>
               <p>How long had you a light after the four men were gone out of the room? - It might be twenty minutes; I saw a pistol in Branton's hand as soon as he got into the parlour.</p>
               <p>What were they doing in the parlour? - They never left the room till my mistress said, somebody knocks at the door, let your master in; the accomplice, who had a disguise on his face, 
               <persName id="t17840526-23-person270">

             and the prisoner Branton were walking backwards and forwards all the time; my mistress said, there is somebody knocks at the door, and she said it is your master; I said, no madam, my master cannot be come yet, it is not nigh eight o'clock, for he said he would be at home at eight o'clock; upon that the prisoner Branton left the room, and the other went to follow him, and Branton bid him stop, which he did; he continued in the room with me and my mistress, and some time after that it might be a quarter of an hour as I believe, I heard the street-door open, and the man came into the room in a short jacket, that is him who was tried last sessions, his name is Ganley or Ganby, (now the Judge called for a Sessions Paper of last sessions.) he took the candle out of the parlour, I saw him go in for the tongs, and break open the desk, I saw him take the tongs; nobody was present then but Haskey and Ganley, he came into the foreroom for a candle, soon after that the man in the short dress, that is Ganley, came into the room, and looked round the parlour, and the other followed him, and I saw no more, I did not observe he came in with a candle, there was no candle, but there was a good fire in the room, then Haskey and Ganby went away, then they went out of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. I suppose they riffled the house above? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who was in the house besides your master and mistress? - A washer-woman, and a child of about seven years old, a niece of my master's, whom they frightened very much.</p>
               <p>What things were lost? - Four silver table spoons and one odd one, and a pair of salts, but my mistress can give you a more particular account; I know there was a watch hanging up at the chamber chimney.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of the other prisoner? - He might be in the house but I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. They were all out before eight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long before eight? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260053"></xptr>You was very much frightened? - I was not so frightened but I was sensible; I was very much alarmed, I did not think of myself, but I was afraid they would frighten my mistress.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When they first came into the house, did you observe any thing like gags in their hands at that time? - Yes, I observed several pieces of wood in their hands, in the hands of one of them at that time of different sizes, I observed them in the parlour, when they were about my mistress, they cried several times gag them, the child was wrapped up in the curtain, she screamed violently, and when the washerwoman came up, Haskey desired the woman to take the child and quiet her, she took the child and quieted her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You say you was very much alarmed the whole of this time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One man was dressed in a brown great coat buttoned up very close? - Yes, the man with the pistol, it was so buttoned up that I could not see any other cloathing; he had a flapped hat a good way over his forehead; I could see his nose, and his mouth and his chin.</p>
               <p>I see you are subject to be frightened a good deal? - I was not so frightened then.</p>
               <p>What made you so frightened just now? - Because I could not help it; when they were all still and quiet, I had an opportunity of viewing the men, I never saw this man before to my knowledge, nor since till he was taken up; the men were put to the bar, and they asked me if ever a one of them was the man.</p>
               <p>You knew there was a reward? - As for reward, I do not come about reward.</p>
               <p>Answer my question, that refreshed your memory wonderfully; have not you had part of it this sessions? - No, nor do not intend to have any.</p>
               <p>You have had none? - I have had none of it, I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you had any part of the reward for the conviction of the other man? - No, Sir, I never heard there was any for me, but for the man that took them I heard there was, I did not intend to have any, I am not fond of any such things, I came here to speak the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. You never saw? - It is very true.</p>
               <p>Who has told you what I am going to ask you, because you tell me it is very true, before you know what it is; now I ask you, as you never saw the man in your life before, and was frightened as every man and woman must be, when six people break into their house, and a man was muffled up with his hat over his face, can you venture to swear to him? - I know the very gait of him.</p>
               <p>Does he hobble in his gait? - No he has a stooping manner, I do not know that ever I saw any man walk in his gait like him, I do believe that he is the very man I saw in the parlour.</p>
               <p>You say to the best of your knowledge? - I know he is the same.</p>
               <p>By what do you know him? - I know very well that he is the same identical man, that had that long cutlass. When people are frightened, they often take a more particular idea of people, than they do at other times, I saw many men at all the offices before these men were taken up, and I never pretended to know any but the man that were in the parlour, and the man who was cast last sessions, who came in and out.</p>
               <p>Then you mean to swear to the lower part of the man's face, and to his gait? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are as certain of the one as the other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. They were 25 minutes in the room, and a candle in the room.</p>
               <p>(The letter produced, being a blank sheet of paper, directed to Miss Young, Islington.)</p>
               <p>Was it sealed? - No, it was just as it is now.</p>

               <p>So much of the account I suppose, as this girl has given of what passed in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178405260054"></xptr> passage, is true as far as you know; what passed in the parlour when these men came in, how many came in into the parlour at first? - I was too much frightened to count them.</p>
               <p>Were there two or three? - Yes, I dare say there was.</p>
               <p>Do you believe there were six; Yes, I believe there were; the maid and myself were in the parlour, and the child.</p>

               <p>What did you lose? - I lost my watch which was hanging up in my chamber, it was a gold inner case and a black shagreen case; and a silver milk pot, five table spoons which were in a case up stairs, with some silver handled knives and forks, they only took the spoons, six silver tea spoons, a pair of silver tea tongs, a pair of silver salts, one silver pepper caster, a pair of stone shoe buckles set in silver, one pair of steel shoe buckles.</p>
               <p>Did you lose any purse? - A little silver net purse, with a crown piece, and two half-crown pieces, and a silver threepence; I heard them up stairs over my head pulling out the drawers.</p>
               <p>Court. They did not rifle you or pick your pockets? - No, they did not, the drawers were all pulled out and rummaged, they were not locked, I saw them go to the desk in the back parlour, I do not know which it was.</p>
               <p>Which of the things were taken out of the desk? - A pair of steel buckles, and a silver milk pot, and the tea-spoons and tongs, they were in a green bag in one of the drawers which was not locked.</p>

               <p>Why you may as well tell the whole, you know you are safe now? - You would not have me say people were there, that were not there, and there were no more.</p>
               <p>When was you taken up? - About a month or five weeks ago, on Wednesday morning the last day of the sessions.</p>
               <p>You did not give evidence, or information before you was taken up? - I had not heard that they could swear to me at that time, I had no share of the property only the pepper box, I afterwards sold that.</p>
               <p>That you did not bring to the account of the partnership, did you? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Branton. Ask the accomplice how I came into his company? - He was along with Ganley and Jacobs, and young Ganley, I did not know he was to be of the party, I never saw him but once before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Branton called three witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, I will just state the law as to the circumstances of the case: the Jury on the former trial received the opinion of the learned Judge who sat here at that time, which opinion exactly corresponds with mine; for if a person gains admission into a house by fraud in the night, that fraud is in the sight of the law a violence; so if a thief by colour of law, by a a false affidavit, gets into possession of a house, or if he gets possession under pretence of taking lodgings.

             was indicted for burglary; she knew the house, and knew the family were in the country; she got a boy to go with her to the house with the key, he went and opened the door, and let her in, and she robbed the house; her case was reserved for the opinion of the Judges, and it was their opinion that it was a burglary, because she prevailed on the boy by fraud to open the door with the key which she had; therefore they no doubt in this case, that it is that kind of fraud, which in the eye of the law supplies the want of violence and breaking, and is a burglary.

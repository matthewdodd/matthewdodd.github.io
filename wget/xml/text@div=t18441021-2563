                  </hi>. I am clerk to Ann Elizabeth Norton, widow, of Knight's-place, Belmont-wharf, Battersea—she is a coal-merchant. The horses are kept on the premises, and their provision in a loft over the stable—the corn and chaff was mixed on the floor of the loft—rn consequence of suspicion I entertained, I introduced some small pieces of brown paper into a mixture of chaff and oats in the loft and gave information to a policeman—the prisoners Banbury and Gillard were in my mistress's employ, Banbury as horsekeeper, and Gillard as coal-porter—Groves works with a horse and cart, but we never employ him—I afterwards saw at the Wandsworth station a sack of oats and chaff mixed, with pieces of paper among them, which I believe to be the same—Alfred Brown, the policeman, produced it to me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable V</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) In consequence of information, I watched the premises of Mrs. Norton, at Nine Elms, and between nine and ten o'clock at night, on the 3rd of Oct., I saw Banbury and Gillard standing near the entrance of the wharf—Groves came up and entered into conversation with them—Gillard left them, went into the premises, and returned with a sack, which I saw Groves receive, and walk away from the premises—I jumped over the fence, and secured him with it—Gillard stopped there till I returned, and I secured him—Banbury went to the stable—I sent another con<lb></lb>stable to secure him—Groves had entered into conversation with them before the sack was given to him—Banbury stood about two yards from Groves at the time he received the sack; Groves then walked off towards his own stable, where his horses were standing—I stopped him about twelve yards from the prosecutrix's—he begged me not to take him into custody—the mixture had pieces of paper in it.</p>

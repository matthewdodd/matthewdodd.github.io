            . I am a lighterman. I carry on my business at Isleworth. I employ a number of sacks; I never sell them; I frequently miss them to a large amount; to the amount of two or three hundred pounds a year, by being stolen from the house. I lost a vast quantity last year. From information, I procured a search warrant, and took two officers to search the house of Lunnis, Queenhithe. I saw the defendant there; he said he expected us; a person came from Abingdon to tell him. We there saw a quantity of sacking under a great deal of rope. They were very good sacks: they were cut in pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sacks did you find these pieces to make up - A. Five or six.</p>

            . I am one of the marshalmen. I went with a search warrant to Lunnis's house. Mr. Lunnis met us at the door; he opened the door with a key. I told him that I had got a search warrant. He said he expected a visit of that sort. He said, a person came from Abingdon who told him that Mr. Friday had been to Abingdon in the sack mending room. We found these two pieces of sack, and several other pieces of sacks under some old ropes. These are the pieces of sacks. I asked the defendant if he kept an account of the persons he bought his goods of. He said, no; he brought them of people indiscriminately.</p>

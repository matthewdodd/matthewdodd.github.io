                  </hi>. I am 28 years of age—from September, 1878, I have been employed by the South-Eastern Railway Company at the Bricklayers' Arms Goods Station as a clerk—I work in an office by myself—I had a man with me for some short time, but he was taken into another office—my wife was employed in a business, not on lier own account—some time before April, 1879, I had put out a child to nurse with a Mr. Meyer, a greengrocer in the Old Kent Road—I was then living at 224, New Kent Road—the first time I saw Josephs was at Mr. Meyer's, about a month after my child</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188009130080"></xptr>
               <p>went there—I don't suppose I saw Josephs above twice in Meyer's house—when we met in the street we said "Good morning"—he knew I was in the service of the South-Eastern Railway—on 27th June this year I saw him accidentally in the Bricklayers' Arms public-house—I went in for a little refreshment—he said to me "Are you a porter on the bank?"—I said "No, I am a clerk there"—he said "Do you have any bullion come up by your line?"—I said "No, it would come up by the passenger train"—he said "Well, if you can make up your mind to lift anything, I can dispose of it to advantage"—I said "Do any of them know you at our place?"—he said "There are some of them that have made their fortunes," he would not say they worked at our place, but he said "I have been a fool, or I should have been in the same position"—he said that Stephen Smith, a party he knew that is now dead, had often talked about me, and he thought I was too quiet, and could not be trusted—I said "Well, perhaps I am as old-fashioned as either of you"—we had some drink Josephs paid for it principally—I promised to meet him next morning opposite the Bricklayers' Arms Station—I did so, and he came to my office with me—there was no one there then—he said "This is just the place for business; we ought to make our fortunes quick"—I said "Do you think so? you had better come down with me and go across tile station"—he did so—we came out again, and I said "Does any one know you in the place?"—he said "I dare say they do, but I should not come in to fetch the goods myself, I shall have them carted"—I said "Who is going to cart them?"—he said "I shall find some one to cart them"—he then left—when in the office I showed him an order of the Messagerie Parisienne, and he said "That is all I want to know, only let me know what goods are in, and I will have them fetched"—I did not know Foster at this time; I first saw him on 28th June in Goldsmith Row, Hackney—on Sunday, the 27th, Josephs came to my house at dinner-time—I was then living at 27 Darwin Street, Old Kent Road—he said "Will you go up to Hackney? I have got the man who will do the lifting job"—I said "Who is he?"—he said "He lives at Hackney; will you hate a ran over now?"—I said "No, I am just going to have dinner; but I will meet you to-morrow night," which I did, at the bottom of Bermondsey New Road, outside the King's Arms, at 6 o'clock—I had to wait three quarters of an hour—I then saw Josephs and two other men, who I did not know—I never saw them before or since—we went into the King's Arms and had a little refreshment—I could not say who paid for it; I know it cost me a shilling or two: then Josephs and I got on a 'bus and went out just opposite the workhouse in Kingsland Road, and then took a short street or two into Goldsmith Row, where we saw Foster standing on a costermonger's barrow—Josephs introduced Foster to D M as "A <hi rend="italic">pal</hi> of mine"—Foster said to me "What is your name?"—I said "Thompson," but they knew different, for in about fire minutes after Josephs called me Brown—Josephs said he had promised to meet Foster there to come down, and he would be the one to cart the goods out—Foster said "You will see me do the job"—he said "Do you remember that van of furniture being <hi rend="italic">sneaked</hi> from the Great Eastern? I said "Yes, I think I remember something about it;" he said "I am the man that did it;" I laughed, and said, "Oh!"—I did not think it was true—Foster said "I dare say you will be able to lift a case"—we then parted,</p>

               <p>with a promise to meet at 9 next morning, at the Apollo, in East Street, Walworth—I did not go there—about 10 o'clock Foster came to my office and Said "What about my case?" I said "i am too buisy now, I will see you at the Apollo at 12 o'clock"—I went there at I, and saw Foster and Josephs there—I took with me an old order of the Messagerie Parislenne, and I tore it up into about four pieces in their presence—I did that with the object of checking the forgery—I said "Can you get that reprinted?" Joseph said "Yes, I can do so, and I will let you have it; meet me here at 8 this evening, and I will let you see some blank forms"—I said there would be a case marked pb—I said that for want of something better to say—I did not see Josephs in the evening; I only saw Foster; he stood on the step of the Apollo public-house—I said "Where is Josephs; he said "He has not turned up"—I said "I must have that old order back;" he said "We had better go to Josephs's house," which we did in East Street, Walworth; it was a marine store shop, with the name of "Jackson" up—I had never seen the shop before—Foster went in, I waited outside—he came back and said "Josephs is not there, we must do it by ourselves," I said "I shan't have anything to do with it"—I know Holmes, we had been in the same service at Carter paterson's in Goawell Road—I remember an occasion when Holmes walked into my office—I should say that was two or three weeks after the visit to Jacson's shop—in the interval I only saw Josephs once, that was at his house in the Old Kent Road—I don't know the number, it was a fruiterer's shop—he told me he lived there, and that he was going by the name of Jackson—he told me that when he first came to my office, he had moved out of Standard Street, and he told me his new address—he had only got apartment there—I went there to get the order back—it was on 16th July, about 9.30 in the morning, that I was at my office when Holmes came in, and whilst he was there Foster came in; he said "What about my case," I said "It has not yet arrived, but as soon as it does arrive I will advise you of it"—he had a good look at Holmes sad went out—Holmes came in again to see me, and we sent out together about I 0'clock to the Kent Tap, kept by Mr. Stanford, and the prisoners came in as we were coming out; they made some remark which I could not catch—I walked with Holmes pretty quick, and had some con<lb></lb>versation with him, and we went to my lodging in Darwin Street, and when we came out met the prisoners, and we all four went into the Globe public-house—Foster was going to fight me—he said "We have had a horse and cart waiting for two or three hours, and it is all to come to nothing," I said "I shall not be intimidated, and if you are going to carry on like that I shall give you into custody," he said "Do you want your brains knocked out," I said "If it is fisticuffs you want you can have it, but I am not going to be intimidated by you"—he swore and used filthy language—we went into the public-house for decency's sake—when we came out I called Holmes Joe; Foster turned upon me and wanted to know who the hell Joe was; I said "Don't say anything to him, he is a friend of mine"—Foster turned upon Holmes and said "What do you know about the case?" Holmes said "As much as you"—they got into conversation then—I did not hear it—they stood on one side of the road, and Josephs and I went on the other side—we then went to the Brewery Tap at the corner of Page's walk—Josephs and I went in—Foster and Holmes stood on the other side still in conversation—in the Tap Josephs said to me "We hope to have 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>each at the bank Holiday, and I am only too glad to think we shall have it in time for the bank holiday"—next day I saw Holmes in my office—we had some conversation—Foster came ion while Holmes was there, and said "What about my case?" I said "I will let you know about it Shortly"—he then left, and that same afternoon, saturday the 16th, about 2 o'clock I went to the police-station with Holmes, and saw sergeant kimber—I made a statement to him in Holmes's presence—on Sunday the 18th, Mr. Major, one of our out-door superintendents, came to me and I went that night to the office of our-door superintendent, and made a statement to him; and from that time I acted under the instructions, and with the Knowledge, of both Mr. Wallis and Kimber—I next saw Josephs on the Wednesday night following at his house in the old Kent Road—Holmes had made the appointment—his wife was present—he said "I hope you are coming to business now"—I took out of my pocket this advice note of the Messagerie, dated July 21, of the arrival of a case from paris, marked R. W., 18337, 123 kilometres, which I explained to him was equal to 246lb. in weight—he said "Well it, it will be be worth lifting—he had before this shown me some blank order forms, which be said he had got printed; that was in East Street—they were similar to the torn order, and he said "Is ther any silk in now?—I said "Yes P.B.," such a number—that was what I had put on the blank form, and then tore up—upon that there was the signature of W. Butler, a person in the employment of the Messagerie Parisienne—the four pieces were put together again on a sheet of paper, and given back to me, and was torn up by me finally—both foster and Josephs said that it was a very awkward signature to forge—I don't know who was to write it; it was on wednesday night that I showed it to them—we then went to meet Holmes at the Thomas a Becket at 9 o'clock—I saw Josephs there, and appointed to meet in Bermondsey Square nest morning at 8 o'clock—I saw him there with Holmes—Josesphs had given Holmes some blank forms of the Messagerie—Josephs said "I must get away to get my horse and cart ready"—Josephs said to Holmes "you fill up one of the blank forms with the No. R. W., 18337 and sign W. Butler's name"—he said he would go and get his horse and cart ready, and meet us in Mason street at 10 o'clock—I saw him there at 10 o'clock with Holmes; he had not got the horse and cart—he said "Here is a nice nuisance, Foster not turned up"—Holmes said "Take a cab"—I said "Telegraph"—Josephs said he had only got enough in his pocket for a 'bus—I proposed going to the station to get him some money—he said "No", and jumped on a passing 'bus, and went to Hackeny to fetch Foster—at 11.30 the same morning I saw foster and Josephs opposite the Prince consort in the New Kent Road with a young man who I never saw before or since; they had a horse and cart; Foster was just getting out of the cart when I arrived there—we went in to have a drink; Foster said "This is a caution"—I said "Yes, you nearly lost the case"—he said he had mistaken the date—I then told them to drive down to Holmes in the old Kent Road, which he did; I walked behind—I saw foster, Josephs, and Holmes together in the Old Kent Road—they had got out of the cart, and all stood on the footpath—foster said to Josephs "Have you the order"—Josephs said" No, Joe has got it"—Holmes pulled it out of his pocket and showed it them—Foster said it was a d—bad signature—this is the document marked A—I said "you must not come in before 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour"—I then went into the station—I was</p>

R.H"—Clanusen was the delivery man—he gave it to Foster—I showed him the way back—he got gate-pass from Mr. Hodson-Foster them went and took hold of a sack-barrow on the platform, and ran it up to the case R. W., 18337—Harris, one of the porters, pointed it out to him, and he ran it into his cart, which was backed up to the platform—he put it on one corner: it was too much for one, and I just gave him a lift—he them drove off with it—I got behind some trucks, and ran out of the station to see it them were going to take it into Paragon Mews, becomes Josephs had told me the night before that they had taken a stable there to break open the case, and put the silk in secks, and cart it away—I did not see the cart again, and I returned to the station—I did not see the prisoners again till they were in custody.</p>

               <p>was at the Great Eastern Railway, Goodman's Yard—I first saw the prisoners on friday, 16th Huly last—I saw foster first in the Bricklayer's Arms station, in an office on the company's premises; he came in while I was there speaking to Brown; I had been there about half an hour—I have known Brown four or five years—When foster came in he said "Have my goods arrived?" Brown said "No, I have had no advice of them"—foster said "Is it any use my calling later in the afternoon?" Brown replied "No, I will advise you immediately on their arrival"—he said "if don't get them this afternoon, I shall lose the sale of them"—he then withdrew—I stayed with Brown about 20 minutes afterwards, we left together—during his dinner hour we went to the public-house kept by Mr. Standford, I don't know the name of it—Brown made a communication to me directly after Foster left—as we were leaving the public-house we met foster and Josephs on the threshold—foster made some remark that I did not catch, and I don't know that Brown replied to it—nothing further passed—me and Brown went for a walk some little distance, and on our return we met Josephs and foster in Darwin street—foster began to abuse Brown, and said that he had not fulfilled his promise to him—I can't give the exact words, because at that time I was not paying any particular attention to them; he was complaining that Brown did not deliver a case of silk to him marked P B, and he used very abusive language to Brown, and swore and threatened him with personal violence—after that Brown and him reconciled the affair, and we all went into a public-house in Darwin street together and had some bitter ale—foster engaged Brown in conversation, and at the same time Josephs began to complain to me, saying that Brown had made a fool of him, that he had a horse and cart waiting there all the previous day, thursday, and on Friday he had it there half a day, and that it had cost him a couple of sovereigns, and then it had come to nothing in the finish—Brown left us then to resume his duty, and I and Josephs and foster went into the castle public-house in Old Kent Road—foster then asked me who and what I was—I told him that I was a railway man, but was not employed at that time—he then suggested that I should try to obtain a situation on the London and North Western Railway, and he would try his best to get on the bank, and that if the affair was successfully managed we should do a very good business—Josephs was present at the time, and he said if the affair was successfully managed, by christmas we should have from 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that was all that passed—on that same friday afternoon, in Darwin street, foster showed me a portion of an order, the bottom part of it bearing the signature of W.

               <p>in Bermondsey street—I nest saw the prisoners on Monday morning accidentally, between 9 and 10 near the Bricklayers' Arms station, and they again asked me to go and and see Brown, Which I did and I had scarcely got into the office before Foster walked in and asked brown if he had any Further orders—Brown said "Joe knows all about it, and he will meet you on the Greyhound bridge in 20 minutes"—I went to the Greyhound bridge and met the Prisoners there together—we walked for some little distance, and Josephs said that Brown was funking—I said "Well I think I shall turn up the business"—after that they asked me where I should be able to see them again—I said I had been too often about the station, and I would not go there again—we then arranged to meet at the Thomas a Becket in the old Kent Road next wednesday evening at 9 o'clock—I went there with sergeant Kimber—I met Josephs and Brown standing outside—Kimber was waiting outside—me and Brown and Josephs went into the house and had some beer—we arranged to meet next morning at 8 o'clock in Bermondsey square—I saw an advice note—Brown communicated to Josephs the number of the case—it was 18337 or 18537 RM—Brown made some rather sharp remarks to me because I had detained them a little while, and Josephs said "He is not so very late"—I went to Bermondsey street on the Thursday morning—I was two or three minutes behind time—Josephs was there—I asked him if Brown and foster had arrived—he said no, he had not seen Brown, and he did not expect foster until the first' bus, about 8.40, and that he had left orders, at home for foster to wait there until he came—Brown was rather late, and Josephs asked me to go to his house and bring him along—I went, and met Brown at the corner of Bermondsey New Road and we went back together to where Josephs was standing—Brown asked Josephs if he had got any orders—Josephs then produced three blank forms, and said "You must allow me a little time to get the cart ready"—We went into the sampson's Castle in Greenwich Road—we arranged to meet at 10 o'clock in Mason Street, Old Kent Road, opposite the Bricklayer's Arms station—Josephs gave me this form (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and told me how to fill it up, and I filled it up in the Bricklayers' Arms station—he gave me three; one I spoiled in copying, on the other I wrote the name—I believe the third one was destroyed—when I got to Mason Street Josephs was there—he said "what a nuisance it is that Foster has not turned up"—Brown suggested that he should telegraph to him—I suggested that he should take a cab—he said he had not sufficient money—just then an omnibus was passing, and he jumped on it and went away—he said he would be back in an hour and a half—I had not seen any horse and cart up to that time—I waited about in the Kent Road for some time, and Foster and Josephs drove up in a light cart—Foster was driving—they got out, and Josephs asked me if I had got the order—I put it into Foster's hands—he examined it very carefully, and said "it is a d——d bad copy"—Josephs said no, he thought it was a very good one I said it would be passed immediately, as it was not the writing they studied so much as the form—Foster then took the order, got into the cart, and drove into the station, which was only 50 or 100 yards off—Josephs and I waited about a little while—he then said "We must have some money," and he went into his house in the Kent Road and brought out a florin—Foster was to drive out at the further gate, and we had to be on the look-out for him—we had just got there when Foster drove out—there was a case in the cart—just at that moment Josephs drew my attention to a man</p>

               <p>who walked out of the principal gate of the station with a sack on his head; his head was covered with the sack—Foster said "Who is that fellow there?" I said "I suppose it is some costermonger coming out of the gate"—Josephs continued to watch him very attentively for a little while up the Kent Road, and after that he walked up to Foster and directed him to drive to a public-house behind Horsemonger Lane Gaol; he said he believed we were being watched—he kept a strict watch on the man with a sack till we came to a hoarding, where the man concealed himself—we then walked along the Kent Road, and took a side street and walked up to where Foster was waiting with the horse and cart, and saw no more of the man; it was Ser<lb></lb>geant Kimber—we all got into the cart, and drove away over London Bridge to a public-house in President Street, Central Street, St. Luke's—Foster said he had a brother or a brother-in-law who had a stable there, and that we would take it in there—Josephs and I waited some time while Foster was away—he returned, and said his brother was away and had the key of the stable with him—so we drove to Hoxton by a very circuitous route; when we had gone some distance Josephs called Foster's attention to a cab that was following us—Foster said he did not believe it was any one for us, but as the cab continued to follow us he put his horse into a gallop, and we went by several streets till we lost sight of the cab—at last we got to Gold<lb></lb>smith's Row, Hackney, and pulled up at a public-house at the corner of the street—Josephs instructed me to wait there till they were ready for me—I got cut, and they drove about 20 yards farther to a second-hand clothes shop—they there took the case out of the cart, and carried it inside between them—when they came out I joined them, and we all got into the cart and drove to a little by-street, I think no thoroughfare—we left the pony and trap there for a woman to mind, and walked back to Goldsmith's Row after having some beer at a public-house—when we were nearing Foster's house, where the case was left, he told me to go and look in at the window and ask the price of a pair of old boots or something—I went and examined the stock and vent inside, and behind a little partition there was the case—while there I wrote a telegram on a slip of paper to Inspector Fox—I had scarcely finished it when the two prisoners entered—Josephs began to knock open the case with a little hatchet or chopper—Foster took it from him, and very soon opened the case—they unpacked the things, and I kept the tally—they were rather disappointed with the contents—Foster said it was only satin, when he expected silk—there were 18 parcels altogether, 35 pieces—after they had inspected it they took a sample from one of the pieces—I came outside—I said "The place stinks so abominably I must have a little fresh air"—I gave my telegram to a constable—I then went into the shop again, and we all walked back to the cart and got in and drove to Cherry Tree Court, Aldersgate Street—we all got out, and Foster stood by the horse's head, and Josephs went to a place with the satin—I went with him to the entrance of Cherry Tree Court; he said I could not be admitted, as they would only recog<lb></lb>nise him—I waited in Aldersgate Street—he came back, and said "How much would it come to at 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard?"I reckoned it up at 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he said if he could take his price he had to be there next day at 12; he said he was not satisfied, and he would try another place—heathen went to 7, Castle Street; he came out, and said the man could not do with it—he had left a sample with the first man he went to see, and said he had drawn</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant M</hi>). I was at the Bermondsey station when Holmes and Brown came on Saturday, 17th July, about 3.30 p.m.—both made statements—I put myself in communication with Mr. Wallis, the goods superintendent—I saw Holmes from time to time—I knew from the time of the communication Brown and Holmes were acting in concert with the prisoners—I first followed Holmes and Brown on Wednesday, the 21st July, in the Albany Road; they were joined by Josephs at the Thomas a Becket public-house—they remained in conversation some 5 or 10 minutes in the road, and then went into the public-house, and were there 10 minutes or a quarter of an hour, it might have been more—when they came out I followed Josephs to his home—he occupies two rooms over a fruiterer's in the Old Kent Road—I next saw him on the 22nd outside the Brick-layers' Arms Station about 10 o'clock—he was near the Swan public-house, which is opposite the station—I went into the station; I next saw Foster come into the station driving a horse and cart—I saw the goods put in the cart, and Foster drive out of the station—I had a sack over my head—I am well known—I saw Josephs looking into the station—Foster drove down the Old Kent Road—I followed down the road—in the New Kent Road I saw Josephs and Holmes walking together—I went back to get a horse and cart that was waiting for me—I did not see Josephs get in the van—I then followed into the Union Road—Robinson, another officer, and I followed Josephs and Holmes from Union Road to Hackney, where I lost sight of them, and left them to Robinson—I next saw them in custody.</p>

               <p>had got a printed letter, and that it must be filled up; that it was forged—I was in communication with Inspector Fox the whole time, also with Kimber and Holmes, Holmes more particulary—it is true that Holmes communicated with me and fox before going to Goldsmith Row—I cannot say whether Holmes knew it was a forged order or not—Holmes told me he had seen a printed order that Josephs had get, and the goods were to be obtained on that order—I knew the goods were to be obtained on a forged order—I got my infornmation from Holmes.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective M</hi>). I acted with Kimber in this matter—I first saw foster at the Mason's Arms, Union Road, Swan Street—that is about three-quarters of a mile from the Bricklayer's Arms station—I followed Josephs and Holmes on foot the Old Kent Road through the New Kent Road, Theobald Street, Stanley Street into the union Road, where foster joined them—josephs and Holmes were in foot—they went into the Masons' Arms and then got in the cart—I was a few yards off—they drove down Swan street to the Dover Road—when I got to St. George's church cab rank I took a four-wheel cab—I followed the prisoners as far as South Hackeny—they went over London Bridge—in Southgate Street, Hackney, Josephs looked at me and called Holmes's attention to me, and their horse was put at a greater pace—I saw Foster hold up the whip, and the horse then went like a racehorse, and my horse in the four-wheel cab could not keep up.</p>

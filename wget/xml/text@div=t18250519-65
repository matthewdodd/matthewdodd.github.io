On the 16th of March, about two o'clock in the day, I fed these two geldings in the park, which is about fifty acres - I missed them about five that evening, and found one of the park gates which lead to the forest open; it had been pinned up with a wooden pin, and nailed with a great nail, and was always kept nailed up - the other gates were locked. I saw two parcels of corn within about two rods of the gate, and traced the horses feet on to the forest. One was a light brown gig horse, with a rat tail; the other a dark brown muzzled saddle horse - I have known them for eight or nine years, and always looked after them. Master's coachman brought them home of the Saturday night; the rat-tailed one had a bit cut off the switch then.</p>

            . I am hostler at the King's Head, and have frequently seen Yaxley at master's, but never saw Cutts that I know of. Yaxley and another man brought three horses to the stables about a fortnight before the officers came, and these two brown ones were brought between eleven and twelve o'clock the night before the officers came - the other man called me out of the house, and said, "Hostler, come and take my horses" - I went out to him, and he delivered them to me; they were down the yard: Yaxley stood five or six yards off. The horses were quite warm - one had a saddle, and the other a halter on - they appeared to have come a good way. The man said, "Give them half a peck of corn a piece, and that will do for the night;" Yaxley did not speak: the other man said he should want them at ten o'clock in the morning, and I was to put the saddle on the same horse. I had a lantern, and saw both the men - the other man was not like Cutts. I got them ready next morning just before ten, but did not see either of the men. The officers came before I had got them quite ready.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The man might lead one and ride the other? A. Yes. Yaxley lodged in the house, and was standing in the yard.</p>

            . I assist the hostler. On the morning of the 17th of March, when I got up, I found these horses in the stable. Yaxley came down the stable about nine o'clock, while I was cleaning them, and as he walked out he said, "Make haste." The officers came about half-past nine o'clock; Yaxley followed them to the stable, close behind them; they all came into the stable, and went out, without speaking to me. I saw Yaxley in the skittle-ground two minutes after, and did not see him again till he was taken.</p>

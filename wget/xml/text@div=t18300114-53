On the 26th of November I had forty sheep in a field adjoining the prisoner's house; I went to Smithfield, returned on Friday morning, the 27th of November, and, in consequence of what my young man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140040"></xptr>said, I missed two sheep on Saturday morning - on going round the field I found a sheep had been drawn through the hedge of his garden; there were the marks of wool in the hedge, and marks of two men's feet in the garden, going from the house - the heels were towards the house, and there were marks of sheep's feet; I could trace the sheep no where but to his house - going towards the house, in the path-way in front, there were marks of wool and blood coming out of the house towards the road; the other marks were in the back-garden - I saw Hodsden, Jun. on the 3rd of December, and, from what he said. I saw his father, who showed me two skins at his barn door; they had both got my mark on them; I found the bark and fat of the off shoulder on one of them - in the off thigh, part of the skin was out of the hide; I went to the prisoner's cottage next morning, the 4th of December, and found Mrs. Ball there -Levick. the constable, was with me; I found a leg and shoulder of mutton boiled in the cupboard - there was a piece cut out across the leg, as if it had been eaten; the shoulder had the fat and bark torn off the back - it was the off shoulder; the leg had got a piece of skin on the thigh, and matched with the skin - it was the off leg; I compared the leg and shoulder with the skin - they corresponded; I have no doubt the meat found belonged to that skin - I have been a butcher these twenty years; we went and apprehended the prisoner's son, at Roxey, about a mile off - he said something to me; he was discharged by the Magistrate, and we had orders to take the father - we went on Saturday, and took him at Mr. Holsden's; he said something before Colonel

            , which was taken down I believe - I went to his cottage on Saturday, and found a raw leg of mutton, part of it cut away; it was in a blue handkerchief, and placed on the top of the bedstead in the prisoner's bed-room - there was a saucepan on the fire, with a pot full of pieces boiling; they were very dirty outside, and in a state it never could come from a butcher's - I found a knife and chopper in the back-room, and the blade of the knife had wool and fat on it; it had been used to cut and skin a sheep - the chopper had blood and fat on it, and a little wool in places - it appeared as if it had been used to cut up mutton hot, when it was just dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The prisoner is married? A. No - I do not know his daughter Emily. not by that name; I understand he is not married, but lives with a woman - he has two or three children; his family came to my house to kick up a row after the son was taken up - I have seen that young woman (

               <p>Q. Did you not tell him that Ball was taken and had split, and said that he, Bolton, had stolen the sheep? A. I did not - I knew Bolton, because he wanted to steal some sheep a year ago; I was at Brentford when Bolton was there - he was taken there to acquaint Colonel Clithe row about it, if he wanted him Colonel; Clitherow said we had no occasion to have him examined - I found the wool in the hedge on the Saturday, but did not go into the cottage to search till the Friday following, as I had not found the skins - I had no authority to go before; I did not search minutely on the Friday - I came away on finding the mutton, to go and look for the skins; boiling does not alter the colour of the fat much, and makes very little difference in the appearance; any butcher could identify it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know the prisoner was working nine miles off when you lost your sheep? A. He came home the night they were lost; my man had missed them on the 27th - he is not here; I keep a public-house, and am a butcher also - I never made

            . I am a butcher, and live in North-street, Edgware-road. I examined the skins of two down sheep at the prosecutor's house, and compared one with a leg and shoulder of mutton, on the Saturday before Christmas-day; there was a deficiency of the bark on the shoulder, and the remainder of the bark was left on the skin - they matched; there was a piece of skin cut off the thigh of the mutton - it caused a hole in the skin, and tallied with the leg.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Have you brought the leg here? A. Yes - it was boiled when I saw it; I compared it a full month after it was lost; I believe the shoulder was the first I ever saw boiled - the bark is not likely to come off in boiling.</p>
               <p>JOHN LEVICK. I am a constable. I went to the prisoner's house on the 4th of December to search for two pigs which were lost, and found a whole shoulder and part of a leg of mutton - the shoulder attracted my notice by the bone not being broken; Hitchcock was backward - I called him in, and shewed it to him; I took the prisoner - I searched the house again on the Saturday morning. and on the tester of the bed found a leg of mutton tied up in a handkerchief; I produce the mutton and the skin - I saw the shoulder compared, and it matched; here is part of the skin left over it - the pieces in the pot were very dirty outside; I found a chopper and knife - there is wool and hair on the knife now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Now do you call this a leg, or is there the third of a leg here? A. I never swore it was a leg: it is part of a leg - I am not a butcher; I saw it matched - the skin on it fits the place; there is only a piece cut off the shoulder - it has been over boiled; it was in this state then, except that it has shrivelled up.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. When you matched it, were you quite satisfied it tallied with the skin? A. I was.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's daughter. I know Hitchcock, and have often spoken to him; I was never at his house till my brother was taken - there are some little woods in a field near my father's house; Hitchcock proposed to me to go into those woods - I refused; when I went out to go to Roxey he followed me, and offered me 5l., and then 10l. to go with him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.What, to go into a wood with him? A.No, into a field; he enticed me over the wood - I am seventeen years old next April; I have been out of place six months - I lived with Mr. Knight, at Knightsbridge, and was not strong enough to do the work; it was a place of all work - I lived there six months; I went to the prosecutor's house when my brother was taken - they pushed me out of the house, and I told his wife how he had behaved to me; when I had done telling her I went home; I did not use violent language - I only told his wife how he had behaved to me; I live with my father - my brother had brought the mutton home on Thursday evening - there were two legs and a shoulder, but no pieces; the pieces found were cut up to boil - my brother had bought it on Tuesday at Watford, and brought it home on Thursday; we often put victuals on the top of the bed as we are troubled with mice and rats - my brother put it up there; we had chopped wood with the chopper on the Friday - I saw no blood on it or the knife; they hung up in the back kitchen when I left the house on Saturday morning, and I will be on my oath there was no blood on them.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What time did you leave? A. Between seven and eight o'clock on Saturday morning; I went to the prosecutor's to see my brother; that was the cause of the disturbance.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you complain of this offer before this? A. Yes, to my mother-in-law; she is here.</p>
               <p>JAMES BALL. I am the prisoner's son. I and my father left the house on Tuesday morning for Watford to work - we returned on Thursday, and brought home two legs and a shoulder of mutton from Watford market - I was taken up for this on the Friday; I did not tell where I bought it - I was before Colonel 
               <persName id="t18300114-53-person484">Clitherow</persName>
            , who discharged me - Watford is nine miles from our house.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Are you acquainted with Bolton? A.No; I have known him three or four years - I have not seen him for near a month; I have not lived at my father's lately, as there was no work doing there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, when taken up, that you bought the mutton in London? A.No. so help me God, I did not; I swear I never did - I had slept at home for several nights before I was taken; my sister slept at Shepherd's-bush at her sister's - she stays there for a week, then comes home again; it is about nine miles off - she often goes there with Mr. Herbert's carter; I do not know that there was any wool on the mutton, or any dirt - I did not observe any wool on it, or any fat turn off the shoulder; I gave 5 1/2 d. a lb. for it - it came to 7s. 6d.; I do not know what it weighed - I think the chopper hung in the back kitchen when I saw it last; there is some blood and wool on it now, and some wool on the knife - the sheep got through the hedge into my father's garden, through a hole which was made to drain the ground, and I suppose tore the wool off in coming through; they told us, when we got home, that they had crept through - I did not see it myself.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When your sister did not sleep at home, was she at her sister's? A. Yes; that sister is married - her husband used to drive Scott's brick-cart; Herbert's carman goes that way, and gives her a lift - we have known him some years.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 88). On the morning of 5th May, I was on duty in County Terrace Street, New Kent Road, about 5 o'clock in the morning, and met the prisoners about five minutes walk from the prosecutor's house—Edwards was carrying a bundle of hearth rugs—I said, "What have you got there?" and neither of them made any reply—Edwards threw the bundle down, and they both ran in the same direction; Grace then turned down Cottage Place, which leads into William Street and Haley Street—Grace'shouse is at the Corner of Cottage Place—Edwards continued to run along Harper Street, and on his getting to the corner of the New Kent Road,</p>

               <p>he stopped, turned round, and threw something at me; I did not stop to pick it up, but followed him, and kept him in sight till he was stopped by Griffin—Isaw this <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> found at the corner of Harper Street, when he threw something at me.</p>

Q.</hi> Was my face in shade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Your back was towards the lamp—youwere the first, but I did not speak to you, my attention was more par<lb></lb>ticularly turned to Edwards, who had a bundle under his arm—I came with the other officers, but did not go up stairs; you were in charge of No. 91 and me, while the sergeant was up stairs—I knew you by sight, and I saw your features directly you were on the other side of the lamp, before I met you.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police sergeant, M</hi> 29.) On May 8th, I went, in consequence of information, to Grace's house—I knocked at the front door, left a constable there, and went round to the back, and saw Grace with his waistcoat and trousers on, just inside the back room—it was open—he met me face to face, and I said, "Where is this parcel, or <hi rend="italic">swag</hi>, which has just been brought into your house?"—he said, "I know nothing about any"—I said, "I have good reason to believe that they came in here over your wall, and I wish to search your house"—he said, "Very well, you can do so"—I left another constable at the rear—searched the house and yard, and found nothing—my attention was attracted by a piece of cord which hung over the wall in the yard, the other end being in the adjoining yard—I pulled it, and found it was rather heavy—something seemed to drop from it—I borrowed a constable's lamp, got over, and found these five hearth rugs (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) sus<lb></lb>pended by this cord—when I first went I asked him how long he had been in, and he said, "Some time."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Grace. Q.</hi> Did I invite you up stairs to see three more rooms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—you denied all knowledge of it—about three feet of rope was hanging over your wall—the wall is about five feet high—it was impossible for the rugs to have been thrown there from the thoroughfare, so as to leave three feet of the rope over the wall—it is sixteen feet from wall to wall, from the street to where I found the hearth rugs, and then it must have gone over two walls three feet high—they weigh 16Ibs. or 181bs.—I have never seen you with Edwards, but I have with others, and I recognized you as you came from the back door—a constable had told me that he saw a parcel drop over the wall—theman who has been on the beat for the last two months gave me a very good description of you, and that, to the best of his belief, the property had gone to your house.</p>

On 4th May, at twenty minutes after 12 o'clock at night, everything was secure, and the hearth rugs were safe; about 3 o'clock in the morning, I was called up by a policeman; I went down and let him in—I found several panes in the sky<lb></lb>light taken out; this bar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was taken out, and a person then had</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Grace.

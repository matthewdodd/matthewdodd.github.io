                  </hi>. I am a tea and sugar broker, and live at No. 14, Minc<lb></lb>ing-lane. I have three partners—I have known the prisoner from about three months before the 11th of August—he was a wholesale grocer and tea-dealer, carrying on business in Botolph-lane—my partners have done business for him-purchased tea and sugar for him—on the 11th of August he brought me this bill of exchange, and said he had large payments to make, and wished to discount this bill with others—I discounted this bill for him, with others, and paid him the money, minus the discount—he said he had taken all the bills in the course of business from his customers, and that his cus<lb></lb>tomers would not accept bills unless they had the goods in their possession.</p>

               <p>put off, and that he might be admitted out on bail—I did not give Mr. Hobler any instruction on that subject—the prisoner was in Newgate then—if Mr. Hobler has given any consent it is without my knowledge—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—this "F. Hobler" looks like his writing, but I do not know that it is—I never saw him write—I have not received any letters from him—it looks like his writing—I did receive a letter from him last evening, desiring me to attend here to-day—I forgot that—this writing resembles the note I received last night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, have you authorised any body to negotiate for money with the prisoner since his commitment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I did not know of any negotiations whatever—we were very cautious in having any thing to do—I have not authorised any negotiations—we knew nothing at all about it—we would have nothing whatever to do with the assignees—we referred them to the lawyer, and what they did with him we knew nothing about—they applied to us repeatedly to let the prisoner out on bail.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you make any inquiry before you dealt with him in this large way, as to his solvency? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did, of Mr. Rowden—I do not know who introduced him to me—I do not myself go to the sales of sugar—I do not think Barnett introduced him to us—the prisoner was taken into cus<lb></lb>tody at his first examination in Guildhall—he surrendered himself under the commission, to be examined—John Hulbert, my nephew, employed the officer to apprehend him—the bill becomes due on the 7th of November.</p>

                  </hi>. I am of the firm of Rowden and Co., wholesale gro<lb></lb>cers. I know Mr. Hulbert, the prosecutor—I have seen him on the subject of this indictment—I went to him, to know if he would consent to the pri<lb></lb>soner being bailed, and asked him to allow the trial to be put off—I told him the creditors at large considered the liberation of the prisoner on bail was very essential to their interest—he said he was before the public as a prosecutor, and he thought he could not, with propriety, interfere—after a great deal of persuasion on my part, he did consent to Mr. Hobler being seen by the assignees of the bankrupt—what took place between them I do not know—I have seen the prisoner in Newgate, I think, twice—I saw him there within one or two days after seeing Mr. Hulbert—I saw the prisoner before the commissioners, after I had seen him in Newgate, I think only once—nothing more, of any moment, passed between Mr. Hulbert and myself on the subject of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you known the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think, two years—I thought him honest, or I should not have trusted him—I trusted him to a large amount.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HAWES</hi>. I carry on business as a tallow-chandler. I have known Mr. Burton, of the firm of Wilson, Green, and Burton, since he has been assignee to this estate, but not before—I have known Mr. Row<lb></lb>den many years—I have called on the prisoner in Newgate repeatedly, from the 11th of September up to the last week—I was in frequent confer<lb></lb>ence with him as an assignee—I first called on him either the latter end of September or beginning of October, since I was appointed assignee—I had not seen any thing of Mr. Hulbert before I-called on the prisoner the first time—I have seen the prisoner I should think seven or eight times in Newgate—I never had any interview with Mr. Hulbert till the latter end of last week, I think—the first time I saw Mr. Hulbert was on Friday last, and since that I have not been in Newgate to the prisoner—I think I can say positively I have not seen the prisoner in Newgate since I have seen Mr. Hulbert or Mr. Hobler—I have seen Mr. Hobler here to-day—he spoke to me in the passage—I think I told him I was subpoenaed to the prisoner's character—he had some conversation with me—he spoke gene<lb></lb>rally—this is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>)—it is a communication to Mr. King, who is clerk to Mr. Archer, the prisoner's attorney—I knew that at the time I addressed it—to the best of my recollection, I first saw Mr. Hulhert last Friday, but I am not certain of the day—I never saw him more than once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Hulbert state to you that if, on Saturday, 230<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid into Lubbock's bank, he would abandon the prosecution, or words to that effect? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—we were referred by Mr. Hulbert to Mr. Hobler, to the best of my recollection—we went to Mr. Hobler—the assignees did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What application had you made to Mr. Hulbert, on which he referred you to Mr. Hobler? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To put the trial off till next session, and to allow a moderate bail, which he could find, that the creditors might have the benefit of his evidence before the commissioners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you told us all the conversation you had with Mr. Hulbert? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have, I believe, except persuading him to comply—my object was not to negotiate with Mr. Hulbert to put an end to</p>

               <p>this prosecution, nor would I have dared to propose such a thing—I only asked him to adjourn the trial—Mr. Hulbert gave us no encouragement whatever, but after using arguments that it would be of real benefit to the estate, he waited until Mr. Layton came in, and I believe Mr. Lay ton referred us to the solicitor—no proposition was made at any time in Mr. Hulbert's presence by any person, that any money should be paid into Lubbock's bank, to my knowledge—I do not know from Mr. Hulbert whether Lubbock is his banker—I did not know who his banker was, nor do I know, myself, only from hearsay, from my own clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you, at any time, any negociation with Mr. Hulbert, from which you expressed a desire to see the prisoner's attorney, to concert measures immediately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a letter</hi>)—I wrote this letter after having an interview with Mr. Hulbert—I did not write it with the sanc<lb></lb>tion of Mr. Hulbert—I wrote it without his knowledge—my object was to get the prisoner out on bail.</p>

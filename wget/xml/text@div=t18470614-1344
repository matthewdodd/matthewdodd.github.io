I thought it was bad, and told her so—she said she did not know it was bad, that a gentleman gave it her, who she was certain would not give her a bad one if he knew it—she said she knew him; she did not say she knew where he lived—I gave the half-crown to a friend to ask him what he thought of it—I lost sight of it for about a minute—the prisoner put it in her basket—I got it back from her—I have no doubt of it being the same half-crown, it was not out of my sight after that—it was marked by Mr. Huggett, in the prisoner's presence—she was taken into custody—I saw some half-crowns taken from the corner of her shawl.</p>

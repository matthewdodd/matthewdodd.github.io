                  </hi>. I live in Bentinck-street, and am shopman to a draper. About six weeks ago I put an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper—this is it—<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>: "A douceur of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will be given to any lady or gentleman who can procure for the advertiser a permanent situation, mercantile or railway, legally saleable. Address A. B., Post-office, East Cowes."—I saw this adver<lb></lb>tisement in the paper—I had this piece from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> office, cut out of the paper (I did not allude to this advertisement in subsequent conversation with the prisoner, nor show it to him)—I received a letter in answer to it, which was acknowledged by the prisoner—the advertisement had been in the paper three days before I received this letter—I afterwards had some conversation with the prisoner—I alluded to this letter, and showed it to him—he did not say anything about this letter—I showed all my letters that he had written to me—he said he could give me a situation of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, if I would give him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and accept a bill of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was in consequence of these letters so re<lb></lb>ceived by me that I had an interview with the prisoner—this is one of the letters I showed him—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"43, Moorgate-street, City of London. Sir,—If you will give 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I am at liberty of giving you a situation of 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum on a rising salary. I do not ask the money down, but the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. must be paid into a London banker's to meet two bills of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, four and eight months' date. It is in a railway office, and forward your answer by post. I hold a situation in the line above mentioned. I have inclosed a card. Direct to either of our offices. Your obedient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">BENJM.

Sir,—I told you, I be<lb></lb>lieve, that I was about to use my interest under Government with two lines of property in or about February, but you would be required after Monday, 7th Dec, 1845. One line will be from Hyde-park-corner to Windsor; the other from London, branching off to Windsor, Aylcsbury, Oxford, &amp;c. Money is not all the object, but I have been offered 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by a party from Bewdlcy, near Birmingham, but he has not kept his word, therefore I will</p>

Bring up my let<lb></lb>ter, as I shall make out an agreement satisfactory to all parties on what is stated therein. I wish to hear from you before you come up. If you are not used to London, I will see you most respectably situated. "Sir, your obe<lb></lb>dient servant, <hi rend="smallCaps">B. BROWN</hi>." I wrote an answer to this letter and posted it—I then received this letter—<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"43, Moorgate-street, Dec. 4,—Sir, if you have business to settle, say on the 12th or 13th, you will see London. If you have no friends here I will see what can be done for you. Your obedient servant, B. <hi rend="smallCaps">BROWN</hi>. To Mr. Charles Jacobs." In this letter this other was enclosed:—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>)—"Jamaica, Southern, Eastern, and Northern Railway, 43, Moorgate-street,—Sir, since you applied I have been offered 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not make me forfeit my word; therefore, to make the matter safe, send up by return of post a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. order; and on the 13th, when you enter the office, an arrangement as proposed for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and a bill. This may be shown to any of your advisers, but not to our firm, as it is a private and honourable transaction between us. I have private property lent out on mortgage in Somerset—Income-tax Office proves my income. If reference is required apply to A. G. Aquila, Esq., No. 94, Cheapside, Lon<lb></lb>don, or No. 4, Charlotte-place, Mansion-house, City."—I wrote an answer to this letter, and received this letter in reply:—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Jamaica, Southern, Eastern, and Northern Railway, 43, Moorgate-street, Dec. 5,—Sir, Understand me, that I do not want to cheat you out of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. written for; but should the gentleman have called upon me who was about to become secretary to this move, and asked me who the clerk is, and I had mentioned your name, and then you to have failed in coming, that would have made me look very foolish. If you come to town on Wednesday I shall be most happy to see you, but you will not be wanted till the 13th, as the new offices will not be ready, and it would be a pity to waste the carriage of coming up twice. Do as you please. Send on Monday, and then say when you will for certain be in London. Sir, I am your obliged, <hi rend="smallCaps">B. BROWN</hi>. To Mr. Charles Jacobs." I came to town on the 10th of Dec. and saw the prisoner for the first time at the office, No. 43, Moorgate-street—there was something of an announcement of the Jamaica Railway on the door—on that occasion I produced the letters—the office the prisoner was to get me was clerk on the Prince of Wales, Oxford and London, and London and Windsor railway—I was to give him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down, and a bill at eighteen months for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not do so on that occasion, but made an appointment to meet at that office the next afternoon—I met him there, and this document was prepared at that time—all the letters which have been read were produced on that occasion, and next day he produced this agreement.</p>

I fairly told you in all my letters that I was about to project one or two lines of railway, and, further, I told you that before Christmas I intended registering the lines, and, further, you and me went to see one.

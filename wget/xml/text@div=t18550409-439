                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and am a surgeon at Guy's Hospital. On 21st March my attention was called to the state of a lad named Samuel Sullock, in Guy's Hospital—as regarded his general health, it was excessively low, and his mental condition was almost idiotic—he had a remarkably idiotic appearance, and had very great diffi<lb></lb>culty in replying to questions—we endeavoured to elicit whether that state was constitutional, or from his state of health; and whether he had ever had any fits—there were wounds over his legs, and on the abdomen, in different processes of healing; wounds on the hands, and bruises on the left hand particularly; a wound on the nose, and two wounds on the head, which were seen after the head was shaved—the wounds on the legs and body were only skin deep; that on the head had affected all the tissues external to the skull, considerable contusion being around the wounds on the head; the peri<lb></lb>cranium</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185504090031"></xptr>
               <p>was separated, as the result of the injury; it ought to have been firmly in contact with the skull—I ascertained that before death, because I was called upon to make an incision, to see whether there was not some matter there—I attended him up to the time of his death, on the 25th; I saw him three or four times a day—I did not discover, during his life, that he was suffering from bronchitis, or from any positive disease—he had no cough that I heard—on the 22nd he rather recovered, and he ate a very good breakfast; but after that we never could get him to take nourishment, and he died on the 25th—I was present when the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination was made by Dr. Wilsh—all the organs of the body were perfectly healthy, with the exception of the lungs—the lungs were what is generally termed congested, the air cells full of fluid, the tubes of the lungs were inflamed, and obstructed by thick mucus—those are the usual signs of bronchitis—I should say that bronchitis was the primary cause of death—I examined the skull; it was healthy as regards the bone, and diseased as regards the sepa<lb></lb>ration of the pericranium from the bone—the separation was about two inches in diameter—there was no injury inside the skull, and the brain was perfectly healthy; there was no wound about the body which was sufficient to account for death—they were precisely such wounds as would be inflicted by a blunt instrument, those on the head especially.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Assuming the blows to have been from a broomstick, can you say that death was accelerated by those blows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not; I think he had no wound but what he would have recovered from—if the blows had never been given, the bronchitis might have terminated fatally; at the same time, it might have been recovered from—there is a form of bronchitis that we may associate with, and do meet with, after such injuries—it is not free from doubt; it would be a very good question for medical discussion, I think, but nothing more.</p>

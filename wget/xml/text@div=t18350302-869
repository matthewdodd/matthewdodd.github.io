                  </hi>. I live at Stockwell. On the Thursday previous to the 14th of February, I went into the City—I was returning over Lon<lb></lb>don-bridge, and saw a countryman, as I thought—he said a bad misfortune had happened in the country to his family—that one of his brothers had stolen some money out of his father's box, and he had come to look for him, that his father was gone one way and his brother another—but he found he was gone to America, and had taken the money with him—I was very faint—he said he was going to have a drop of beer—I said, "I am going to have a pint of beer"—we went into a <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jerry</hi> shop, as they call it, and had two pints of ale—then, in came another man—I had no knowledge of him—I wanted to go, and got up, but was taken very poorly, and was obliged to call at a place for my convenience—they both came out with me, and went into the King's Head, between the Elephant and Castle and the turnpike—I went into the parlour, and the other man said he had dropped into a good thing—I cannot say these are the men, for I had very <hi rend="italic">little look at them</hi> when I was in their company, and I said all I knew about them at Union-Hall—I think it was the biggest one said tome, "I have dropped into a good thing—somebody has come and told me that an estate I worked on was my father's, and it came to my eldest brother, but I find my mother was not married till after he was born"—that he had come to London, and the lawyers had supplied him with plenty of money, and he was sure to have it, though his brother had had it fifteen years—I said, "Let him have half of it"—he said, "No, I will not"—he said, "I have a handful of Bank-notes;" and then he said, "Any body who can show me a sovereign I will let him have half-a-sovereign"—the other pulled out his bag, and I, fool-like, pulled out mine, with fifteen sovereigns and some silver in it—I put it down—he said, "I will put it up for you into your pocket," and he pretended to put it into a paper, as I thought, but he put halfpence into it instead—I was a little fresh—I did not take much notice—we had had two shillings' worth of brandy-and-water, and came out—a policeman came up to me, and said, "Have you lost any thing?"—I found my watch safe, and my sovereigns, as I thought, and said, "I have lost nothing"—I went to the Elephant and Castle to get an omnibus—the policeman said, "You must go to the watch-house with me," and I pulled out the paper of money, and there was only 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in it—two men afterwards came and brought me the money back again—I never saw those two men before, nor since—I cannot swear to the prisoners, for I took so little notice of them—there were not more than two men in my company, and two men brought me the money back—I lost my money at the King's Head—the same men were at the King's Head with me that I saw at the Bridge Tavern beer-shop—I saw no other man that I know of—I have not got quite all my money back—I think I went to the Globe public-house with them—I went into a house in the Borough when I was unwell—I was not drunk—I had nobody with me at all, only the two men—I cannot say whether the prisoners are the men.</p>

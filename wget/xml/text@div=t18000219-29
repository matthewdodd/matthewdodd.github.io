               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoner had been at that time? - A. Greatest part of the time in the tap-room; about seven o'clock I thought I heard somebody at the door, I suppose he did not know anybody was there; I opened the door and asked who is there, in the dark; he made me no answer, and I saw him go up stairs to his own room; I came out and locked the door, and came down stairs, my husband was in another room above; I saw no more of the prisoner that evening; when I went up stairs, I found the hasp that holds the lock forced off, the door was wide open, and the watches gone; he never came home after that night; the pawnbroker has one of the watches in Court, I found it about a week afterwards; the watch that was found my husband had had about four months, and the other about two years.</p>

            , Esq.; the horse was pasturing in a field nearly adjoining to the house of the prosecutor: On Saturday, the 11th of May last, I saw the horse there at eleven o'clock in the day; between ten and eleven o'clock that evening, I heard the horse neigh; at six o'clock the next morning I missed the horse, he was gone; I went directly and searched round the field for a track, where he could be supposed to have gone over, as I imagined he might have broken pasture, and, by searching, found out a place where he had been taken over a ditch of about two yards, or two yards and a half wide; and, on Monday following, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the horse at Queen-square-office; a Mr. Minton had him, who apprehended the prisoner, and detained the horse.</p>

             sworn. - I am a horse slaughterer, I live in Tothill-fields; I know the prisoner at the bar; he came to me on Sunday, the 12th of of May last, about seven o'clock in the morning; he said, master, I have got a horse for you, this was a chesnut horse; I asked him where he got it; he said, he bought it at Staines-fair, and that it did not signify, if I would not have the horse, somebody else would; I said to him, you are a thief, as he refused to bring some man of credit to vouch for his having come honestly by him, as I desired; I therefore had the prisoner confined, and took him to Queen-square-office the next day, with the horse.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Charter-house-lane. On the 21st of February, I was going home, I was attacked in <placeName id="t18130407-8-crimeloc42">Charter-house-lane</placeName>

I was attacked by three men; one of them laid hold of my neck handkerchief, and the other two laid hold of my collar and set my arms fast. They had one hand over each of my shoulders. They held my shoulders so that my arms was totally confined. I immediately called watch. They were at my pockets. I felt my watch go, as I thought, out of my pocket. I felt a pull at my watch-chain, and my watch-chain broke. Here is part of my watch-chain attached to my watch now. There was a metal seal and steel key, and the chain was steel. They took to their heels as soon as the chain broke. I pursued them, crying out, stop thief. I saw the prisoner when the patrol laid hold of him. I immediately told the patrol he was one of them that stopped me. He was taken about five yards from me. I had run with him about twenty or thirty yards or more. I was within a yard of him all the way down the lane, and the greatest distance I was from him was when he was taken; that might be nine or ten yards, or not so much. I never lost sight of him. It was a clear night. I am sure he is the same man that I pursued. There was no one else in the street that I saw, but the three men that stopped me.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last felt your chain and seal hang to your watch - A. I looked at my watch ten minutes before they laid hold of me. I looked at my watch to see what o'clock it was. I pulled it out by the chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I was. I had not drank anything at all.</p>
               <p>- MACKDONALD. I am a patrol. On Sunday night, the 21st of February, I was on duty in Cow-cross, and hearing a person crying out, watch, I ran up. I saw the prisoner running. When I got half way across the road, he stopped. I said, where are you running. He said, I am going home. I said, where are you running. He said, I am going home. I said, I must know first what they call watch for. I took him back to the prosecutor. He said, that is the man. He gave me charge of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>JOHN RAY. On the 18th of January, I observed the prisoner in High-street, Aldgate; I watched him; I saw him go into Mr. New's, a stationer's shop; in a little time he came out; I went in, I made some enquiry of Elizabeth Church; she produced me a shilling. I followed the prisoner, and took him into the Blue Boar Inn; I found three counterfeit sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know much about money - A. I do. In his coat pocket I found sixteen pennyworth of good copper, and three good sixpences; these three counterfeit sixpences were put in a pocket by themselves; in his other pocket I found a quantity of good silver, about twelve or fourteen shillings; the good money I returned to him, that he has had; there was a small quantity of tea and about twopenny of soap.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH CHURCH. Q. You live at Mr. New, the stationer's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You remember the prisoner coming to your shop - A. Yes, I do; he came for two sheets of brown paper and a pen, he put down a shilling; I gave him ninepence change; Ray came in, and asked me what the man had changed; I produced the shilling; he desired me to mark it; I gave the same shilling to Ray, that I am sure I received of the prisoner, and no other. This is the same shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I certainly did change a shillings with her.</p>

            . I am clerk to the solicitor of the Mint.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that shilling - A. It is a counterfeit; it is merely washed, it is quite fresh.</p>
               <p>Q. to Ray. Hand over the sixpences - A. These are them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sewell. They are all counterfeits; they are quite new.</p>
               <p>Ray. The sixpences were in paper, and the paper folded over each of them to prevent their rubbing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of paying money at the Excise Office for brokerage, and in the habit of paying money at the Chronicle Office, and the Star Office. I always look, over the money; I am very cautious what money I take; I thought they were three bad sixpences, I put them in paper not to offer them to any person; the reason of my putting them in paper was not to offer them to any body; I put them in my coat pocket; the shilling I thought was a good one. I wanted to buy two fish at the corner of Petticoat-lane to send to Ilford, I went back to this lady's house to get two sheets of brown paper to put them in, and likewise a pen to put the direction on the paper; when I came out of the shop with the paper, this gentleman went in; I went away; I was gone no great while, I had not reached Petticoat-lane, this gentleman beckoned me; I voluntary went back. He searched me, and returned me the bag, containing three dollars and two three-shilling tokens; I considered these three sixpences doubtful; I would not offer either of them for the paper; I knew I had halfpence, but it was extremely difficult for me to get at them; I am an old man. When I went back to the lady, I said I was very sorry for giving her the shilling.</p>

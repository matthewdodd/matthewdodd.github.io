               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, I have had the pleasure of seeing him twice, I saw him on the first of July. I live in Mr. Baxter's house, the house is all let out to lodgers; the owner of the house does not sleep in it, I have one room on the two pair of stairs. On the 1st of July, I and my wife went to my father-in-law, No. 15, Brownlow-street; the prisoner was there, in company with us, from between one and two o'clock till half past four, then we were going to see a debtor in Newgate, the prisoner came with us, and coming along I took him up into my room, to shew him a long drum that I had for sale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that you had a shirt and two bank notes - A. Yes, the notes were in a little box inside of a big box, and my shirt laid on the box, there were three pound in this little box, whoever took them dropped one.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that little box locked - A. No, it was fastened down with iron clamps, it is my wife's saving box for a rainy day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he remain in your room with you - A. Not two minutes, my wife stopped behind to lock the door; he and I came down together, my wife, and he, and me were the only three that were in my room, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to your father-in-laws at one o'clock, your room door was not locked - A. No, it was not, when I brought the prisoner up, the door was not locked.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the prisoner had been there before - A. No, I had seen him before where he worked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know where you lodged - A. No, not before I shewed him.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you staid there two or three minutes, had you shewn him this box, or did you open the large box - A. No, I only shewed him the large drum.</p>
               <p>A. Are you quite sure that when you went to see your father-in-law, that the money was in the little box, and that you had it safe in the large box - A. I am not in the habit of going to the large box, my wife was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it afterwards that you discovered that you had lost the property - A. As we were going on in Holborn, the prisoner made an excuse that he had a complaint in his bowels, he left me and told me he would follow me, he did not; I and my wife went to see our acquaintance and returned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this person that you were going to see in Newgate an acquaintance of yours or his - A. An acquaintance of both, but more of his, the prisoner worked under him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you were walking to Holborn, could you see whether the prisoner had any thing under his coat - A. No, not as I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out of your room to go to see your acquaintance in Newgate, did you lock the door - A. I cannot say, my wife stopped behind to lock the door.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stop in Newgate to see this acquaintance of yours - A. About an hour, the prisoner never came to us; I had a couple of pots of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180038"></xptr>poster in Newgate with the debtor; I returned and my wife back to my room, and the door was a jar, I thought it had been left locked; I suspected I was robbed, I went to the box and found the money box broken open; the shirt my wife did not miss till the next day; I examined my box, three notes were gone, one was found upon the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your great box been broken open - A. No, the key was in the great box.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the little box taken from the great box - A. No, only broken open, the iron clamps had been wrenched up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the contents of the box - A. Yes, I was by at the time it was put in, there were three separate one pound notes, I put one in myself, and my wife put in two.</p>
               <p>Q. On examining the little box two one pound notes had been taken away, and one dropped on the floor of your room - A. Yes; this happened on the 1st of July, on the third I saw the prisoner at Bow-street, I went to the

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing respecting the taking the bank notes - A. No, I believe he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever recovered your two pound notes again - A. No; the duplicate of the shirt was found upon him when he was taken in custody, I would not take exactly upon me to swear to the shirt.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you all three went towards Newgate, to see this prisoner - A.

The prisoner went as far as Middle-row, Holborn, with us; my husband and he walked together. I did not hear his reason for leaving us there; he left us and went across the road. I did not see him any more till the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from Newgate, did you go immediately from Newgate to your own lodgings -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180039"></xptr>A. Yes, my husband went before me, I met him in Queen-street, he told me the door was broken open.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left your lodgings to go to Newgate, are you certain that you locked the door or not - A. I am quite certain of that, the prisoner bid me go back to see if I had locked it, I did go back, and it was locked. On going up into my room, I saw the cover of the little box in the chair, with this knife, and the body of the box was in the great box; the knife was my knife, it had been laying in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the knife been at all notched or bent by opening the little box - A. The knife is bent, it was not bent when I went out, the knife was laying under the chair.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of this - A. My father and mother went to his lodgings the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inform your father what you had discovered - A. Yes; he went to look after the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the prisoner again - A. On the Monday, in St. John-street, in Smithfield, in the morning, part of the day my mother and father were with me. I asked him how he came to break the door open, and come into my place after we left it, and take my money; the prisoner said, there is an officer, if you choose to take me up you may.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him upon his word and did take him up - A. Yes, he was taken up; he was searched in the Poultry compter yard, I was by at the time, and a duplicate of a shirt was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the duplicate to the pawnbroker - A. Me and the officer did, to a pawnbroker in St. John-street, Smithfield; we found the shirt, I knew the shirt to be my husband's, there was the initials of his name, P. E.; I knew it to be my husband's, I use to wash for him, he had it for about three months; I can speak with positiveness that it is my husband's shirt; I told the prisoner at Bow-street of the shirt, he said he did take that. He was taken to Bow-street the same day, my husband did not see the prisoner till the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. This first of July was on a Sunday - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You and your husband went to your father-in-laws before you saw the prisoner - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out you locked the door as you thought - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went up stairs in your way from your father's to Newgate, the door was not locked - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Yet you supposed you had locked it - A. I did not go out then meaning to leave it open, I thought I had locked it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had made one mistake that day - when the prisoner went up with you on your return from your father's, that was the first time of his going in your room - A. The first time, he did not know where we lived before then.</p>
               <p>Q. Much less where your money was - A. I suppose he guessed at it.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a lock is it to your door - A. Not a very good lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence when you came back - A. No, I thought it was opened by a key, my husband was the first that went into the room.</p>
               <p>- JOHNSON. I am a servant to Mr. Briggs, a pawnbroker, St. John-street. On the 2d of July, the prisoner pawned a shirt with me, I have known him some time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that duplicate afterwards brought the same day - A. Yes; Mrs. Egin and the officer came between eleven and twelve, they claimed the shirt; I shewed them the shirt, I have kept it ever since; he pawned it in the name of Hinton, I have known him by the name of Hinton, always. He lived in St. John-street, and that is the duplicate I gave to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>- CADMAN. Q. You took charge of this man - A. Yes, I searched him in the presence of Mrs. Egin, I found the duplicate upon him; I afterwards went with the duplicate to the pawnbroker's, the shirt was produced to me there. It was an old man that took charge of him, he delivered him up to me; the officer that had him first, said he knew him from a child.</p>

               <p>Q. You pronounce it in your dialect Agin, is it not Egin - A. Yes. This shirt is not clean, it was laid out for the purpose of washing; I neither marked it, nor made it, I know it very well, it is my husband's shirt.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe it is my shirt, but not to say punctually upon my oath, at present that it is mine.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday, the 1st of July, I was taken by Peter Egin to his house, for the purpose of shewing me a big drum. We were going to see a person in Newgate, I carried provision, and they gave me a bottle of liquor; I left him at Gray's-inn-lane, I told him the occasion; I went into the first public house, and there I met a friend, he told me the consequence of taking liquor into a prison, in consequence of that I did not go. I returned in about three quarters of an hour, to Egin's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180040"></xptr>house, I asked if Egin was at home, they told me no, I returned down, I saw Egin no more untill I was taken into custody, he told me at his father's, that he should not stop in Newgate more than a quarter of an hour, and my stopping with my friend made me go to his room.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Were you going to take any thing to this friend of yours in Newgate - A. Yes, my father in law sent it in a bottle.</p>

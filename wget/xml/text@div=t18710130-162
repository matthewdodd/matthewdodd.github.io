I am an agent, at 9, York Buildings, Finsbury—the prisoner was in my employment, as traveller, for about three months, from September till 15th December—his business was to go out and obtain orders for jewellery and other goods—I entrusted him with a quantity of gold and silver watches and rings, to be used as samples, to the value of about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had some suspicion, and I went to the tavern where the horse and trap were kept in which he went his rounds—I met him there, and asked him where the samples were—he said they were at home—I insisted on their being produced, and I went to his house with him, and then we went to the office—I went through his stock of samples there, and found a quantity missing—he said he had sold them—he had no authority to do so—I asked him to whom he had sold them, and he said to his uncle, a Mr. Hole, at Bayswater—I said "Come along we must go and see where he is "—I went with him, but we could not and the house—he said</p>

               <p>he knew the house, and had been there frequently, and Mr. Hole was a man of means—I said "Where did you leave the samples with him"—he said "At his office, three doors from Fleet Street "—I went there on the following morning, but could not find him there—he then said that he had left them at the "Bell," or at "Punch's Tavern," in Fleet Street—the goods were afterwards found to have been pawned, and I gave him into custody—various articles have been produced by different pawnbrokers, and I identify them as my property.</p>

On 22nd July, at 7.30 p.m., I was on duty in High Street, Deptford, and saw thirty or thirty-five persons at the bottom of the street, blocking up the thoroughfare on the pavement, and causing an obstruction—I spoke to Connolly who was there, and told him to move on—he said that he should not—I said that the shop-keepers complained that respectable people could not pass, and begged he would move away—he said, "No, I shall not, not for you; I shall stand here just as long as I like"—I asked him civilly to move again—he said, "No, I shall not, not for a b—like you"—I went into High Street and got the assistance of Beard, we returned together, and Connolly used very bad language—Beard asked him to move away and not make a disturbance there, upon which Connolly struck him a violent blow on the mouth with his fist, and ran twenty yards down King Street—I ran after him and caught him—Beard came up, and Edwards and Walsh—Connolly knocked me down twice, a mob got round, and stones and brickbats were thrown in all directions—I still held Connolly when I was knocked down—I was struck on the arm with a stone, thrown by Kirby—I also received a kick in the ribs—I cannot say who from, but Connolly hit me in the chest—I saw Mansell within four yards of me, throwing stones—I lost my helmet in the tussle with Connolly, he was so violent—I held him a quarter of an hour, and then he got away, and went down Old King Street—Kirby was taken on the Saturday night.</p>

I live in Queen's Court, opposite Mrs. Willing—on 22nd July, when the mob came, her door was shut; her lodger came and opened it and she came out and folded her arms, and never stooped or turned, and I saw the police pass by a step or two, and drag her by the shoulders—there are no loose stones in the court—she did not throw stones—she had her arms folded till the policeman dragged her by the shoulders.</p>

I am married, and live at 22, Barnes' Alley, Deptford—on the night of the 22nd July I saw Connolly lying on his back in the road, and the four policemen beating him with their staves—I asked a policeman not to kill him, and he turned round and struck me on the arm—Connolly did not tear his clothes off, the policemen tore them off—the tallest policeman, Welch, is the one who I asked not to kill him—he struck me a slight blow with his staff, on my arm—I saw one man strike the police, but I should not know him again—everybody cried out that he was killed, and this man used him most shamefully.</p>

I live at 16, Queen Street, Deptford—I was at the bottom of High Street on the night in question, and saw Connolly standing quietly, kicking up no row by insulting anybody: but the policeman shoved him, and hit him on the head, and felled him—he said to the policeman, "I am quiet enough, and not insulting anybody; give us a lucifer, I want to kick up no row in the street"—the policeman took out his staff, and Connolly ran—he had not struck him then—the policeman struck him first, before he drew his staff, and shoved him down, and Connolly said, "Give us a lucifer to light a pipe; I do not want to get cross," and then the policeman floored him, and pulled out his staff to hit him—Connolly was standing on the kerb stone—I saw him standing there about ten minutes before the policeman came up—he was near the corner of High Street—I do not know which of these policemen it was, because I did not notice his number—I was only just across the road—the policeman hit Connolly on the side of the head with his fist, when he asked for a match, and Connolly returned the blow—the policeman then took out his staff to hit him—I told Connolly to run, or he would get killed—he ran away, and four policemen caught him before he got far; but he got away from them, by two of them being drunk—I saw no more, because I had my baby in my arms, and I went home.</p>

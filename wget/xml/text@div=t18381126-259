                  </hi>. I am manager of Mr. Plimley's iron-works, in the Borough. Giles was the carman—he had 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and Gibbs was our labourer—we always keep on our premises large quantities of iron—the men have no authority to deal with it without I order them—on the 15th of this month I gave directions to Gibbs to remove some earth at the entrance of the yard at Bankside, to enable the horses to come in better—I sent Giles with the horse and cart to him—I went to the yard again that evening—the horse and cart stood at the entrance of the gate, and I heard them putting some iron hoops which are here into the cart—I put my head over the head of the cart and saw some hoops on the earth which they had just put in—only the two prisoners were in the yard—I asked what the hoops were put in for—they both said "For Ainger and Handy side," a house we do business for—I said that could not be the case, because they had some hoops of us in the afternoon, and sent their own cart for them—the prisoners then seemed confused, and proceeded to take part of the hoops out of the cart again, making some remark that they were only a few hoops—I said, "No, you shall go home with them now in the cart to the Broad wav" where our other yard is—"I will examine them there"—these hoops are broken up to be remelted—they drove the cart to the Broadway—neither of them gave me any account where this iron came from—there was some earth in the cart—there was llcwt. of iron in the cart—the</p>

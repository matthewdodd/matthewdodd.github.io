On the 3d of May. between two and three o'clock in the morning, I lost several wooden ornaments, which were fixed to the front of my house; my dog alarmed me - I got up, and saw two men, one on the shoulders of the other, getting on the front of the house; I called, and said unless they got away I would shoot them - they got down; I saw them go down the street, and into a house at the bottom - I dressed, then went and listened; I heard the prisoner and another consulting whether they should go back - one said, "You heard what he said, that he would shoot us;" I got a watchman, who went down with me - the prisoner was coming out of the house, but the watchman would not take him; I know the prisoner was the man who was on the shoulders of the other - I knew his person well; I had seen the ornaments safe when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me with any thing in my hand? A. Yes, when you ran down the street; I cannot say what it was - I did not see him again till the 9th of May, when he came down the street with two others, and pointed up to my front; he went into the same house -I saw him again on the Monday; he was alone - I went and took him - I said I wanted him for a felony; I got him to my door - he knocked me down, cut my eye, and got away; I heard he was in the neighbourhood, and went to Worship-street - Garton sent three officers to take him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE SIMMONDS. I am a dyer. I live in the house to which the prisoner went, and was alarmed by hearing some persons at the door; I got up, and went to get a light - I heard some persons walking in the yard, in the direction of the privy, and they were talking whether it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182906110132"></xptr>would be better to throw them down; I could not say what they alluded to - when they came into the room again, they said now the property was done away with, they did not care a d-n who came in; I know the prisoner was there at that time in the lower room, where two people live.</p>

            . I am a silk manufacturer. On the 11th of May I saw the prosecutor holding the prisoner, who knocked him down two or three times - the prosecutor called for assistance, and I went; the prisoner got away - he went into a skittle-ground of a public-house, and said he would not be taken by any one; the prisoner then came up to me, and said he had taken the ornaments, but did it only for a lark.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the Two Brewers public-house, in Spital-street; I saw the prisoner in a yard adjoining the skittle-ground - he said he would go with me, but not with any parish officer; if the property had been taken it could not be found, as there is a common sewer runs through the privy, which would carry them away.</p>

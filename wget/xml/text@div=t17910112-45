               <p>And previous to the time you delivered this silk, did you read it over? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you make any sense of it? - It is plain enough for me to understand; unmarked, is without the threads round it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Can you read writing yourself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now do you think that is Mr. Desormeaux, or Mr. Desamoacks? - I did not know how Mr. Desormeaux spelt his name; if I had been so particular to examine every thing, I should not have given it him; but by this he got it.</p>
               <p>Then you did not think it came from Mr. Desormeaux? - Yes; he told me so, and I thought so.</p>

               <p>Did you look attentively to the spelling of his name, before you gave it? - I did not particularly attend to the spelling of the name.</p>
               <p>Would you deliver it on such a note now? - Yes, I should deliver it on a note.</p>
               <p>Therefore you trusted to his representation of it? - Yes; the note convinced me that he was sent for the silk; it was a perfect satisfaction to me, till he got out of the house.</p>
               <p>In short, you did not pay much attention to the note till he went away? - I looked at the note, and saw it was as he said; I did not trust to what he said; I gave it on account of the note.</p>

My lord, there has been afterwards cases which have been of this sort: an order directed to the person holding the possession of goods, as coming from the owner of those goods, the person having a real property in those goods, but the order signed by the owner. My lord, I submit the prosecutor must go this length to bring this case within the construction of the act of parliament; he must go the length of putting a sufficient charge of that sort on the record; that that order does come from a person, purporting to be the owner of the goods, and to have the disposal of them; now this order, which is expressly shewn on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120064"></xptr>the record, not to come from the real owner of the goods, does come from some person who stands within the situation of the owner; there they fail; first the indictment itself shews, that the property is in the father; next the indictment shews, that the person giving the order, is not the owner, but some other person, but a servant; to bring it within the construction of the act of parliament, they should have established this in evidence; supposing the indictment to be correct; that this servant was a servant sui juris; that he gave orders; that all persons acquiesced with his orders; and that his orders were in the usual course of business, and paid as much attention to as the master himself. I submit, my lord, that there is no evidence of the situation of the person himself, as an apprentice only, and under the command of the master; the father has not said, and no servant acting in the house has said, he was in the habit of giving orders, and that the tradesmen were in the habit of receiving orders.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then I have an objection to the form of the indictment. This is averred to purport to be an order from

            , by the name and description of L. Desamoacks: I take it there must be some purporting on the indictment; and this name cannot be healed by any oral testimony, that it did purport to be that, and so he intended to represent it; besides that, I take it this must be an order on the person holding the possession of the goods; and here it is not affirmed that this is an order directed to the holder of the goods, and therefore non constat upon the face of it, that it is an order on the person holding the goods, for the delivery of those goods. My lord, the next point which I think bears a great deal stronger against this case, than any one I have mentioned yet, is to the form of the indictment likewise: I take it the regular form of the indictment should have been, that the person did publish a certain order, purporting to be an order for the delivery of goods, signed so and so, against the statute: I take it, that the prosecutors, by their extreme caution to bring this particularly within the bearing of the law, have overshot their mark, and rendered this indictment insufficient; they have gone out of the regular form, and indicted him this way: that the owner of the goods was in possession of such and such goods; that this defendant, well knowing these facts, did present an order, purporting to be the order of the servant to the holder of the goods, to receive the goods; that the prisoner was then a servant; having so particularly put it; it has not gone on to state that that servant was the servant empowered by the master, to give and deliver such orders to persons to deliver those goods; thefore they have gone out of the regular form of the indictment, that he did publish such an order as described; who has done this as described? that it is done by a person being a servant; that is averring that the servant had an authority. Now if they had left it generally as an order for the delivery of goods, signed so and so, and then put it upon evidence, whether such an order was an order within the act of parliament; then it must have fallen, or not, within the construction of the act of parliament: they have said it was by a person having particular authority, and have not stated that he had a complete authority; if they had confined themselves to general terms, I could have had no objection, except that the evidence did not apply to the construction of the act of parliament; but in this case there is a defect in the indictment, of which I am entitled to avail myself, in point of form, so far as may be to the benefit of my client.</p>

My lord, on the part of the prosecution, I beg leave to observe on the objection, which beyond all question, if it had the best of all foundations for an objection, a foundation of fact, would have been one to which I am quite unprepared to give any answer, namely, that if this was so decidedly in the nature of Mitchell's case, that the person whose authority this was, had no authority over the goods; your lordship has relieved me of that, by observing that this person had an authority. There is a very remarkable expression in the decision of the judges, in some of those cases which my learned friend has seen, which he did not state; that the person giving the order, ought to possess some interest in the goods, or disposing power over them. It is enough; for bringing this out of Mitchell's case, and bringing it into Jones's case, that the person claims to have a disposing power, not for his own benefit, not sui juris, but a disposing power; then beyond all question, Mr.

               <p>Mr. Garrow. There is Lockitt's case, which was of the same sort:</p>
               <p>"Please to pay the bearer ten guineas." It was said, this does not assume to be an order for the disposition of it, and looks like a request to be favoured with something; it is not an order to dispose of it, or any authority to alter the possession of the thing. In Mitchell's case, it did not proceed on that which my learned friend has said, but it was only a ticket, authorising a pauper to receive a certain thing. There was a case of Jones, which was in October sessions, 1764, before the late Lord

This was the case of a work sent to be assayed; this was the ticket to deliver it: first, it was not addressed to any body, nor in the indictment was it said to be addressed to any body; but in this case, the question is, does this purport to be the order of Mr. Desormeaux? if it does, then the fact is made out to the satisfaction of the jury; is equally a forgery, and equally made good by these statutes.

               <p>My lord, if you consider the extreme mischief in all the banking houses, in all the manufacturing towns, who carry on the greatest part of their business by their foremen, and in goods to the amount of many millions of money in the year; they are transferred from hand to hand, by the foreman; still the party whose name is purported to be forged, had not a disposing dominion of the goods transferred; and we know how many of those things are transferred by tickets with initials; and we know how many by hieroglyphicks. My lord, on the subject of the name, you have only to be referred to a case, in which it has been determined, that if you forge another man's mark, with intent to defraud him, that is as much a forgery, as to forge his name. The indictment charges, this was intended as a forgery of Mr. Desormeaux's name. Then there is a very formidable objection to the form of this indictment; for it seems it has stated a little too much, and a little too little. My learned friend agrees, in the common form, that it would have done; but he says, inasmuch as I have added to the name of

            , then and there being the son; why you may reject it as a surplusage, taking it, it was necessary to state this, which I think is the better opinion; then I say the other is a mere matter of evidence. Says my learned friend, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179101120066"></xptr>either must be on the record stated, or it must be in evidence.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Therefore, my lord, it is the offence of forging that warrant and order of a servant of a particular name, purporting to be the servant of the owner of the goods; therefore I contend, my lord, that this is a forgery; it is certainly the exhibition of a false token; I say this appears to be a forging an order for the delivery of the goods for the proprietor; therefore I shall add this to it, that that servant was authorised by the proprietor, to give such orders for the delivery of the goods.</p>

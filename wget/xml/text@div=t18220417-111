            . I am of no trade now; I was brought up to the law. On the 7th of March I had been dining with some friends, the party broke up late, I was induced to go about three o'clock in the morning with some women to <placeName id="t18220417-111-crimeloc579">the Constitution, Bedford-street</placeName>

               <p>"You need not be alarmed, all is right," and placed herself by my side, and she asked me a great many questions, and occasionally smacking my pocket which had the watch in, I thought I felt her hand in my pocket, she made a spring from me, I missed my watch, she ran down stairs and got into a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182204170046"></xptr>room on the left side of the passage, and fastened herself in; I ran up stairs and broke the windows, in order to procure assistance; the landlord called the watchman, two watchmen came up, and after some time they got her, and went to the watch-house; some altercation took place between me and the landlord, and in the mean time the watchmen and the prisoner disappeared; I went to Bow-street and described her, the watchmen are not here; I believe they would rather give evidence in her favour; she was taken again between seven and eight o'clock; I was merry, but had my recollection about me; I might have been drunk when I went to the Constitution; I might be under the influence of liquor when I went with her, but was not deprived of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not bite me - A. She struck me in the mouth, and I believe I bit her.</p>

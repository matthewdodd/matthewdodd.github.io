               <p>Was you at Mr. Langdale's on the day his house was destroyed? - Yes. On Wednesday the 7th of June, about a quarter before six in the evening, the prisoner Mooney, with a drawn sword in his hand, at the head of three or four hundred people, came down Holbourn towards Mr. Langdale's house. I saw him coming when I was at Mr. Langdale's shop door serving the people, who had then assembled, with gin; at that time Mooney was opposite St. Andrew's Church. I left the people I was serving with gin and went to meet him to endeavour to stop him from coming to the house, fearing the consequence that might attend his coming. I laid my hand upon his shoulder and told him that if he would be so kind as not to go to the house he should have as much gin as he pleased where he was then standing; accordingly he stopped and ordered all his men to stop, whom he had behind him.</p>
               <p>Did they obey that order? - They did; the prisoner immediately went along with me to where the pipe of gin was, opposite Field-lane, and the men with him; the pipe of gin was brought out; they could not get conveniently to it without a cock. I asked the prisoner to go with me to the warehouse and I would get him a cock; he went with me; we could not conveniently get in at the door, on account of the many people who were assembled. He flourished his sword about his head three or four times, and a scuffle ensued between him and several of the people; they not being pleased to see him flourish his sword; they laid hold of it; a scuffle ensued, and he got his sword broke; while that scuffle happened I went into the warehouse and got a cock, but saw no more of the prisoner that evening, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>The mob had not then broke into the house? - The mob had not broke into the house at that time; when the prisoner was examined before Sir

               <p>What was Henry doing? - He was knocking at the window with the iron bar. After that I saw a scuffle between him and the party at the door, and they broke the sword. I could not get up Holbourn with the men. I went round Fleet-street, to the Strand, and staid with the men at the New Church till the officers sent for us.</p>

               <p>What time did Henry break the windows? - Between six and seven o'clock; after the time I last saw the prisoner, when I went to get the cock, I served some people with gin, I saw Henry on the leads, and went up stairs, that was after I saw this prisoner.</p>
               <p>What state was the house in when you left it? - They were then pulling down every thing; the lower and upper windows were demolished at the time.</p>

               <p>The prisoner I believe knows nothing of you, you came here by accident? - By accident; I know something of this circumstance respecting the sword.</p>
               <p>Will you relate what you saw? - I was coming by Mr. Langdale's house, there was a great mob; I am not certain of the time; I suppose it was after five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Between five and six? - Most probably so.</p>
               <p>Did you distinguish the prisoner there? - I distinguished the prisoner, to the best of my recollection, I am almost certain; there was a person with a blue coat and white waistcoat struggling with the prisoner for the sword, and the prisoner was rather in liquor.</p>

               <p>The prisoner and another person were struggling for the sword? - Yes; at the end of Hatton-garden almost.</p>
               <p>Did you observe which had the sword first before they began? - The prisoner brought it under the window to the man the jacket and blue apron; and the man said any body should have that sword for half a crown. I believe the prisoner had the sword first, and was bringing it down sheathed, not in a hostile way; but I cannot be positive that it was the prisoner. A struggle ensued between them; the man with the blue apron seemed to want to make a property of the sword. That circumstance in his defence is true respecting the sword, and its being sheathed.</p>

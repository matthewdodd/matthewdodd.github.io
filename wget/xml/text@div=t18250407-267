             at Newgate-market. I used to deliver the accounts to him, from time to time, and received the money from him for ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070095"></xptr>years or more - the prisoner has gone for me occasionally, and I have given him a written order; he knew the nature of my business. I was in London on the 4th of March, and he asked me if I should want him to go for my accounts, I said No, I should go myself. I did not send him to Mr. King's, nor did he bring me any money that day, or since, from Mr. King; I did not see him again till the 25th, when I charged an officer with him. I saw him searched - he had not a farthing about him.</p>

I know the prisoner, and had frequently paid him money - it was not usual for him to produce an order. On the 4th of March there was a balance of 19 l. 18 s. 5 d. due to Mr. Holden for pigs delivered between five and six o'clock that morning - it was customary to settle the same day, and the prisoner came about half-past ten o'clock that morning, which was rather earlier than usual - he said he called for Mr. Holden's bill for articles sent by Fielden and Sadler. I thought it was all right, and I paid him nineteen sovereigns, seven half-crowns, and one shilling, and he gave me 1 d. In about a hour and a half Mr. Holden came for the bill; I told him I had paid his man; he said he had not told him to come, but perhaps he had taken it home - I saw the prisoner about a fortnight afterwards at Guildhall.</p>

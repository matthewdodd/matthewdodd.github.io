                  </hi>. I am a bill poster and live in High Street, Hounslow—on 10th February last I was out collecting some debts—I went to the Five Oaks on Twickenham Common and had a glass of beer—the prisoner was there and a woman named Humphreys sat by his side—I was only there a few minutes, I left and when I had got about 100 yards the prisoner followed me, grabbed me by the neck, threw me down in a ditch on my backside, and took my watch and silver guard chain—I hallooed out and the prisoner disappeared up the Hanworth Road—I got home the best way I could and next day I went and told the police—I was frightened to go back that night—I described the man to the police and I went to where he used to work at some drainage works, but could not find him) I had seen him several times before—I saw nothing of him until the 25th of last month when he came into my house as I was at dinner and said "Does Graham live here"—I said "Yes"—he sat and said "Did you lose a silver watch with a silver guard to it 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "I said "I did"—he said "If you come along with me I will take you to the party as has got it"—as we were going along he said "If you follow me and sweat hard and fast that this woman robbed you I will swear the same"—I knew the man directly he came into my place, but I did not tell him so—he took me to Wilton and I went with Kerridge the policeman—he brought the woman out; the prisoner kept calling her nasty names and said to me "Will you swear this woman took your watch?"—I said "You come along, don't make a noise"—we went to the station, the woman was let go and the prisoner was locked up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Kerridge was not called before the Magistrate—I had only been into one public-house, I was as sober as a Judge and was making the best of my way home—it was quite light, I saw the man distinctly—the woman was in the public-house when I was there, but she was not near me when the prisoner took my watch.</p>

On 25th of last month the prisoner, the prosecutor, and Sarah Humphreys came to me at the station with Kerridge—the prisoner said "'I wish to give information about a watch, this is the woman (pointing to Humphreys) that took it; she brought it home and showed it tome; I said '<hi rend="italic">Sal</hi>, don't have anything to do with it; she then took it into the garden and buried it and next day I found it and took it to London and sold it to a man, if you lock up the woman I will bring back the watch"—she said "I know nothing about it"—I said to the prisoner "There is no evidence at present that the woman took the watch, and according to your own statement the watch was in your possession and she was living with you as your wife, I shall detain you" and I locked him</p>

               <p>up—I left him in the cell for a little time and when I went to him I found him lying on his back black in the face, with a silk handkerchief tied tightly round his neck and the ends of it in his hands—I loosened it at once and after some time he came to—he said he would kill himself if I did not lock up the woman, that she was a b----whore and was living with a police-constable—the woman said she had been living with him eight years and she had left him because he broke her leg.</p>

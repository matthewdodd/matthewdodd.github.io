                  </hi>. My father is a grocer, in Henry-street, Woolwich. On 12th Sept., about 9 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Jackson came and wanted one ounce of tea and half a pound of loaf sugar—I served her, and she gave me a shilling—I saw it was bad, and I said, "This is a bad shilling"—she said she was very sorry, that she had taken it for needlework, in Shoreditch, and she would-change it the next day—I bent it, and returned it to her—she gave me a good shilling, and I gave her a sixpence in change—she left, and crossed the road, and joined the male prisoner—I saw him waiting for her, and she went and joined him—they went on down Henry-street, which leads to Sandwell-street—I put on my bonnet, and followed them—they went on to Mr. Leeder's; they both went in there—I waited till they came out, and I went in and made a communication—the officer was called, and the prisoners were taken into custody.</p>

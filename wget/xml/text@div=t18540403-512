                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Gibbs, who sells coals, in Turk's-row, Chelsea. On Saturday, 4th March, a person named Modley came, and in consequence of what he said a cwt. of coals were to be taken to No. 2, York-terrace, and the change for a half sovereign—the coals came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I took 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and the coals—when I got there I saw the prisoner in the garden, in front of the house—he walked from the house, as if he came out of the door, but the door was shut—he took one half cwt. of coals out of the truck, and gave me the half sovereign—I did not give him the change; seeing the house door shut I had suspicion, and I said I had not brought the change, I would run back for it—I took the half sovereign, and showed it to my master, who is an aged person—it was not out of my sight while I showed it him—he said it was bad—I did not return to No. 2, York-terrace, but I gave information to a man, and told him to go—I kept the half sovereign in my hand, and afterwards gave it to the constable—I did not see the prisoner again that night; I saw him at the police station, at Rochester-row, on the 8th—I am sure he is the same person—this is the half sovereign (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

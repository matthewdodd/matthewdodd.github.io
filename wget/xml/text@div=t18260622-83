            . I am a bedstead-maker, and live in Colchester-street, Whitechapel. The prisoner came to my house with these six bedstead pillars on the 8th of June; he asked me to purchase them for 3l.; I thought they were stolen, and told him I would not have anything to do with them - he then said I should have them at my own price - I should have them for two sovereigns and two pots of beer; he left them, and said he was going somewhere else; I went and asked Mr. Partridge what to do - he said he thought they had been stolen, and the prisoner was taken.</p>

            . I am a beadle. Mr. Maddam came to me, and said the prisoner had offered him some pillars, and he thought they had been stolen, as they were worth 7l., and the prisoner had gone with another person down Church-lane - we went and took him.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. William Hunter, an upholsterer, of Finsbury-place South. These pillars are his property; they were packed up to go to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and are worth 5l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A gentleman asked me if I would earn half-a-crown, to carry these pillars to Bell-lane; I took them there, and waited three hours; I went to the Baker and Basket public-house - Mr. Maddam was sitting there; I told him how I had been served - he told me to bring them to his house, and he would take care of them - I did not offer them for sale.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of James Stillwell, a silk-manufac<lb></lb>turer in White Lion-street, Norton Falgate. On the 1st of January, between twelve and one o'clock at noon, I was leaving our warehouse on the ground-floor going through a passage into our back premises, and met the prisoner at the bottom of the stair-case—she had just come off the stairs—she had something in her apron—I asked what she had—she made no answer—I would not allow her to go till she showed me what she had got, and she produced the coat out of her apron—it was my brother Edward's coat—it had been hanging on a rail on the first-floor landing—the prisoner told me she had been up stairs to apply for work from Mr. Wilson's, who is our next door neighbour, and that her husband had worked for the firm—I sent for Mr. Phillips, one of the firm, who said he did not know her, and I gave her in charge—this is my brother's coat—(<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

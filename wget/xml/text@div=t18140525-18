            . I live in White Hart-court, in Whitechapel. On the 5th of April, about a quarter before nine at night, the prisoner came to my house; I was in bed; I heard her offer a little girl two pence to pawn some things for her, and the prisoner came to me and said she wanted to leave some things with me until the next morning. About five minutes before nine, the prisoner opened my door; she desired me to let her leave a blanket and a bolster there. I refused her. She took them down into the cellar of my house. The cellar belongs to the landlord of the house. The cellar door was open. I have nothing to do with the cellar. The prisoner told me she took the things to the cellar. I told her I would have nothing left in my place. My bed is right before the cellar door. I saw her take the things into the cellar, and the next morning I saw the things in the cellar. The next morning the prisoner came to my room at seven o'clock; she said she had a sheet, a blanket, and a counterpane at the pawnbrokers, which cost her thirty shillings before she was married, and that she had pawned them at Mr. Ellis's for seven shillings, and he had always lent her a guinea upon them. She asked me if I would take the ticket to Mr. Ellis, the pawnbroker; I denied it. She wanted Mr. Ellis to make it two shillings more than what she had on it. She said if her husband met her with it he would use her ill. I took the ticket to Mr. Ellis's shop; the man would not lend any more on it. I brought her back the ticket; she went away, and left the ticket on the table. I did not see her any more until she was taken. About eleven o'clock, the constable came to my room, and asked if any thing had been left in my house. I went in the cellar, and fetched up a blanket, a bolster, and a bed gown. I delivered them to him.</p>

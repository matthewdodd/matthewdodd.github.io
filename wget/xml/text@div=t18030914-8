             sworn. - I am an officer, I was sent for by Mr. Foulds to take charge of the prisoner; I told him I must search him for tobacco; he said, he had none about him; I then told him I must search him; I pulled off his cap and his waistcoat, but found nothing; he still persisted he had none about him; I then unbuttoned his breeches, and found the tobacco, which I have here; it weighed exactly one pound three quarters; as he was going to the watch-house, he said in tears, he had robbed the best and dearest of masters; had I kept myself honest, I should not have been in this trouble; those were the only words exchanged between us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Foulds. This is the same sort of tobacco that he was at work upon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been in the habit where I have been at work of taking a little tobacco for my own use, and I took this; I acknowledged it when I was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Mr. Foulds.

             this time I had the highest opinion of the prisoner. It has been the custom of the trade, instead of giving them tobacco, to give them an equivalent in money, and sell them tobacco at the wholesale price.</p>

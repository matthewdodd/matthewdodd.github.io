On Saturday, the 17th of June, my son went up stairs, returned, and said he missed his gold watch—I inquired for the prisoner, and he was absent—I went out to Long-lane, and saw him on the other side of the street—when he saw me he ran away, and I after him, calling "Stop thief"—he was stopped by Smith—I came up and asked what he had done with the watch—he said, "I have sold it"—I said, "Have you"—he said, "No, here it is," and gave it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner Hepple came into my service on the 18th of October, and was with me till the 13th of January—I have lost my wife, and I engaged with her for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to attend to my children—I came things I asked her where they were—she asked me if I wanted them—I said, "Yes, "—she said she would fetch them when she chose—she made no reply when I taxed her with the coat—I gave her in charge, and the policeman found the duplicates on her—Mumford used to come and see her—I gave her no permission to pawn any thing, and did not know that she had—I first missed my coat, and then other things.</p>

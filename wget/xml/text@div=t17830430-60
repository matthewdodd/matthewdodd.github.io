               <p>Court. It is necessary to state, that the attack was made, and the demand of money likewise was made; this indictment only states that the assault was made, and that no demand of money was made, it struck me that this indictment was defective, therefore, I desired to see the indictment and act of parliament; it appears to me that the indictment is bad upon the face of it, for this reason? This is made felony, by the act of parliament of the 7th

            . which was only a misdemeanour before; in order to bring the fact within this act of parliament, the description of the act of parliament, must be fully expressed in the indictment, and accordingly pursued, if not in the very terms of the act, which is always the best and safest way, yet in terms expressing the same purport and effect: If any persons after the 1st of May, shall (then comes the description of the offence,) with any offensive weapon or instrument unlawfully, and maliciously assault, or shall by menaces, or in or by a forcible manner, demand any money, goods, &amp;c. with felonious intent, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"The offence is in</p>
               <p>"the disjunctive certainly; the construction</p>
               <p>"is this, if any person shall assault, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"and then comes the word, or with felonious</p>
               <p>"intent to rob, or commit robbiese</p>
               <p>"or shall by menaces, or in and by a for cibl'</p>
               <p>"and violent manner, demand any monies.' It seems to me, to be indispensably necessary in an indictment on this act, to lay the whole fact, and either to charge, that the assault was made with an offensive weapon, or that money was demanded, one or the other; but not both. The word or seems to be necessary to this act of parliament: The indictment has not laid it with an offensive weapon, therefore it is clearly necessary that by menaces, he did demand money or &amp;c. the indictment states, that he made an assault, without stating it to be with an offensive weapon, and that he did menace with intent to rob; I am of opinion that this indictment cannot be supported, but as it is an offence of some consequence to the public, and both the Judges are up stairs, I will send a short note up to them, to know if their opinion concur with mine: The shortest way will be to send up the indictment, and act of parliament, in the mean time we will go on with the cause, and the prisoner will have the benefit of it, if the Court are of the same opinion that I am.</p>

               <p>"not a word or we will</p>
               <p>"blow your brains out;" I think more then one of them said it; and the words were repeated: Being so suddenly attacked, I said nothing, but as I recollect very well, that I saw one of them, put his hand to the inside of his coat, as I apprehended to pull out a pistol, or some weapon to present to me. As he fumbled a little, and did not produce a pistol immediately, I seized that moment, and laid hold of two of them, one with either hand and called out, Watch! It occurred to me that they could not instantly destroy me, and that was really the reason, I took that opportunity of making my resistance; when they found themselves held fast, they all joined in attempting to escape, and did not attempt any further violence; the prisoner Jackson was the man, who was longest in my hands, and last of all in my hands, and he set off to run: I pursued him a few steps to the edge of the paving, and as he stept across the kennel, I got a blow at him with this stick, and knocked his hat off, which he left behind: It occurred to me at the moment, if I should pursue this man, and he out run me, I should lose all three, I therefore immediately turned about, knowing that the other could not escape me: By this time a watchman up, I charged him with one of the men, and I took the other: This one who is since admitted an evidence, is the one that the watchman took hold of; I took hold of Randall, he struggled to get from me, finding he could not, he got with his back to the door, where there was a bow window, and he made a motion to let something drop very quietly, he stooped a little to one side, I observed him at the time, and said to him, in terms of very high resentment, being very much provoked, you damned eternal rascal or villain, what is that you are dropping, you are dropping your arms I suppose; upon which, I stooped down and took up this iron bar.</p>
               <p>Court. Was any other weapon found on either of them? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Was any thing else suspicious found on them, when they were searched? - No.</p>
               <p>When was Jackson taken? - About eight days after.</p>
               <p>With respect to Randall, was he ever out of your sight? - I cannot say my face was to him all the time, because I pursued

             a few steps, but he was not out of view, he never was from the place till I took him.</p>
               <p>Did Randall and the other when you pursued Jackson, stand still? - They did, they waited to see which of us could run fastest.</p>
               <p>Are you equally sure with respect to Jackson, that he was one of the men, understand me right, I mean that you should speak from your own sight and recollection? - He is the man that I had the greatest struggle with, and the best view of, he was under a lamp, and the impression of his countenance was more on my mind, than either of the other two, if I had not apprehended them on the spot.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure he is the same man? - I think I may say, he is with a great deal of clearness; when Justice Hyde sent for me, and told me he was apprehended, I began to write his description; I then desired to be shewn him with others, and I immediately picked him out.</p>
               <p>Then you have no doubt that he is the man? - I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, I submit the evidence does not go a jot further than the indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. It does not; and if the indictment had been right, there might have been a doubt, whether this evidence would have supported it; but I am not so clear upon that point as the other; I should leave it to the Jury, whether they would infer a demand from this.</p>

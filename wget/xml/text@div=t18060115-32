             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What are you? - A. I am a poor man, I live very near where the beasts were stole, I looked after the beasts.</p>
               <p>Q. How late had you seen the beasts? - A. On the Sunday night about five o'clock, they were in a cherry orchard belonging to Mr. Ranyard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave the gates secure? - A. Yes, the gates were both locked; one was a stop lock, and the other was a little round lock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you go to the field in the morning? - A. I went about six o'clock in the morning, but I did not miss them till about seven o'clock, when it came day-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing with respect to the gates? - A. The gate was lifted off the hooks and just open, sufficient for the beasts to get out, and as far as they well could; it was locked upon a staple, and the staple was a little bent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any hides afterwards? - A. Yes, at Dorking. On the Saturday following I fetched one hide, and the other I saw at Guildhall; I am quite sure they were the hides of these two steers.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the hides that you have been describing were the hides that belonged to these steers, and whether the steers were your master's property? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen him there before? - A. Yes, several times; he asked me if I could tell him of a slaughter-house; I told him there was one at the top of Bear Alley, where I have kept a house these nine years. I told him if he would ask for one Mr. Ellis, he would tell him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by the prisoner about any bullocks to you? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are a slaughterman living in Bear Alley, Fleet-market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner: do you remember his coming to your slaughter-house at any time? - A. Yes, on Christmas day in the morning part, before dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring any thing with him? - A. Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you? - A. He said he was recommended to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say who he was recommended to you by? - A. No, he asked me if I could kill him a couple of beasts, I told him yes, I could; he asked me when would be the best time of the market; he should wait to make the best account of them he could, that he had more coming if these answered his purpose, and that he was given to understand that I could set them off in the best manner.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you understand by beasts? A. I understood that they were oxen or steers.</p>
               <p>Q. Steer is a young ox? - A. Yes; he said they wanted a good deal as dressing; I agreed to butcher them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. When did you afterwards see him again? - A. I think it was on the Saturday following; he came to me at the salesman's that I told him that I would get to sell the beasts; he came, and made an excuse for not bringing them as he had promised, he was to have brought them on the Saturday. He then asked me if Sunday morning would do, I told him he might bring them on Sunday if he pleased; I asked him what time, he said about six o'clock; I told him six o'clock was too early, I should not be up before seven or eight on Sunday morning. He never brought them on Sunday morning. On Monday morning about twenty minutes before six o'clock, he called me up himself, I got up and received these two steers in question. One was very nice meat indeed, and the other was not sat enough; when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150028"></xptr>he brought them, we put them into the slaughterhouse; he wanted me to kill them then, I told him I could not kill them till day light came; when day light came, I took them to another slaughterhouse, there not being utensils enough to kill them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you agreed with him for the price? - A. No, I killed them in a common slaughter-house about nine o'clock on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had killed them what became of the hides? - A. The hides I sent to a salesman at Leadenhall-market, and sent word to send the money for the hides to Mr. - , who was to sell the meat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any marks on the hides before you sent them to be sold? - A. Yes, they have got the marks on them now.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the the prisoner again? - A. About one o'clock on the Monday, he then asked me if he could have the money for the beasts, I told him I did not know that they might be sold so soon.</p>
               <p>Q. The hides that you have seen afterwards, and were produced to you, the one which was at Guildhall, and the other at Dorking, were they the hides of the beasts that the prisoner brought to you? - A. I have not any doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the prisoner at the bar being the person who came to you three different times? - A. I am sure of it.</p>

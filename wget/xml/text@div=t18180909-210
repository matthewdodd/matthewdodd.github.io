            . I am a collar and harness-maker, and live in Ray-street, Clerkenwell. On the 27th of June, about half past six in the morning, the prisoner came and asked if I bought harness; I said I did; he produced the articles stated in the indictment. I asked him where he brought them from; he said his master was at the Bull and Mouth, and had sent him to sell them, as he was going out of town, and he was to take him the money. He wanted 2l. for them, and said he had lived nearly three years with his master. I told him to call again. I got a constable ready, who took him when he came. He left the things with me.</p>

            . I am a constable. I waited at Davis's house; the prisoner came, and I took him. He said he got the harness from the Bull and Mouth, and made a rush out of the shop, I collared him in the middle of the street. He made a great resistance, and knocked me down - He was secured. I found two keys on him, which opened the stables in the yard. Two iron bars were wrenched from the stable window.</p>

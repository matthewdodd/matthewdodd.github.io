On Tuesday morning, the 7th of October, I went to bed about half-past two o'clock, leaving my mother and the servant up; the house was secure, to the best of my knowledge, when I went to bed - I was called up about four, by my father, who lives with me, but I am the housekeeper - I jumped out of bed, ran down stairs in my night clothes, and found a candle burning under the kitchen table, and a pair of wet shoes in the kitchen; they did not belong to any of the family - I then saw the kitchen-window open, and the shutter closed. I and my father went out, after dressing myself, towards London, in the Hornsey-road; we went about half a mile up Hornsey-lane, and then returned to Crouch-end, my father going another way - I had not proceeded far before I saw the prisoner and another man coming towards me, and towards London; when they came up to me I asked if they had met any one - they hesitated some time, and then the other man said they had met two men in Lordship-lane, Tottenham; I said I had had my house broken open, and as I was rather suspicious, I wished to know their names, and where they were going - they said they were bricklayers, and were going to work at the top of the hill; I then cast my eye down, and perceived either shoes or boots shining on the prisoner's feet - they turned out to be top boots, just fresh put on; that increased my suspicion: I lifted up his smock-frock with a poker which I had taken with me, and saw they were top-boots; I took them down to the village, and the other man ran away - the prisoner never got out of my custody; the boots were taken off his feet, and I found they were my father's.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's father, and live with him. In consequence of the alarm I called him up, looked down stairs, saw a light in the kitchen, and on going down saw a pair of shoes - we dressed, and went out in pursuit; we took different roads as we returned, and in half an hour my son brought the prisoner back to me, with my top-boots on - when they were taken off I knew them to be mine; these are them (looking at them) - they hung up in the kitchen: I should know them from a hundred, by the sparables at the bottom; I have not the least doubt of them.</p>

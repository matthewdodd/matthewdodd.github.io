                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Evans, a silk-mercer, in Tottenham Court-road. The prisoner has been a customer two or three years—she came on the 30th of September, and asked for some ribbons and calico—Mr. Nelson attended on her while she was there, he made a communications to me, and as the prisoner was going out, I asked her to walk into the counting-house, and said one of our young men suspected</p>

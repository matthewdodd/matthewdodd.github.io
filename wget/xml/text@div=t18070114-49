On the 7th of this month, about half past six in the evening, a man and woman came into the shop, and the prisoner followed behind; he stood behind the man and woman for a little time, and looked over their shoulders to the person that was serving them. I stood at a short distance from him and looked at him all the time, from the first of his coming into the shop till I saw him take two cheeses under his arm; he went out of the door with them; before he went out of the door, I called out that man has got the cheeses, stop thief. They never turned their heads. or else they could have stopped him before he had got out. I run out of the shop after him, I saw him turn to the right, he turned up a court, there he dropped the cheeses, both of them. He ran out again immediately, ran across the road, turned to the left hand, and was taken at a short distance.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man. - A. I am certain of it, I never took my eyes off him from the time that he came into the shop till the time he took the cheeses.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was a going to Mr. Dixon's in Cheapside, that I work for, I called into the Flower pot, Bishopsgate street, there was a young man in there that told me that there was a shop in Threadneedle street where he could get a cheese for nothing, and if I would go with him I should have half of it. There was a call out when I got to Threadneedle street of Stop thief, and a man stopped me and said I was the thief.</p>

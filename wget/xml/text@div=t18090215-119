On the 14th of January, about six o'clock, I was going from one part of the premises to the other, I heard a noise in the passage; I approached to see what it was, a man came out in a confused manner; I asked him what he had been doing there, after talking to him, all I could get from him was that he had been in the office to see William; I suspected that he had been upon no good; I had to direct a letter for the post, for which I had to go to another part of the premises, and on returning I had to go into the passage where the noise had been; on opening the door into the passage this form, that is in court, fell against me; I went after the man; he was gone, he had ran away; I concluded from the form being so heavy that more than one was concerned in it; I immediately shut to the printing office door; I waited there about half a minute, I heard a foot seemingly in confusion going backwards and forwards; after waiting about half a minute I saw the prisoner, I knew him, he had worked for me a twelvemonth before that; he said in a confused way, Mr. Wilkes I came to see if you would have given me work; I had no doubt then but he must be the man that was concerned with the man that ran away; I was then anxious to get him up stairs, I said, certainly go up stairs, I will give you plenty of work; he said very well and went up stairs; I listened and observed that he did not go further than the second flight of stairs; I heard him stop there; about half a minute after that I heard him come down stairs again; when I saw him approach I called loud why do you not go up stairs, and I will come up to you; instead of going up again he ran down as fast as he could and knocked me down, he aimed at the door to get away; I stood at the door to prevent him going away, he knocked me from the door to get away, we struggled about half a minute he attempting to get away; I then fearing violence called out murder; about a dozen men came down from the top of the house and secured him. This is the form of types, we had two stolen; one I detected him with; we found three on the stairs that they were in the act of taking off when I discovered him. This is my property.</p>

On the 8th of May, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came into the shop - I came into the shop myself at half-past five o'clock and saw her and Maddy serving her-there were no other persons in the shop - I was looking at my books. I looked at her again, and saw something bulky under her arm, which made me suspect her. I went up to her, and saw the corner of the print from under her shawl, which was very large. I took hold of it, and asked her how she came to have it there - She laughed in my face, and said I must have put it there - I told her that was impossible, it could not have got there accidentally. I took it from under her arm; it had my mark on it, and is worth about 20s. cost-price. I gave her in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. I do not think she was sober; she smelt of liquor. I did not see her take it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MADDY. I am shopman to Messrs. James. The prisoner came into the shop between five and six o'clock, and asked for some gingham which another wo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181705210021"></xptr>man had been looking at in the morning. She asked the price of the print when she first came in-the same print was afterwards taken from under her shawl-when I told her the price she said it was too high for her. I shewed her several ginghams, and cut her off one yard, at 1s. 6d. per yard; she was paying for it when Mr. James came up, and pulled the print from under her arm; it was the same that she had asked the price of. I pulled down several ginghams to shew her, and left them on the counter. I did not see her take the print. I turned my back to her to take the things down; she could not have got it by accident. If Mr. James had not stopped her, I should not have known that she had got-it there were nineteen yards, it is worth 20s. I asked her 3s. per yard for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was no other person in the shop. The boy was in the shop when she first came in, but he went out, and I saw the print on the counter after that. She was twenty minutes in the shop.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BROWN. I am an officer. I took the prisoner into custody. I thought she was not sober.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MR. JAMES. I did not see her take it, or put any thing under her arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent.</p>

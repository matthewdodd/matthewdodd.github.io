                  </hi>. I live at Sudbury, in the parish of Harrow. On Tues<lb></lb>day, 22nd Jan., I left home about 4 o'clock in the afternoon—before I left I fastened up the house—I locked the front door and the back door, and went out at the kitchen door, and took that key with me—I went through the stable, which has a stock lock, and left the key of the stable with the prisoner, who was in my service—I took the key of the house with me—I have known the pri<lb></lb>soner seven or eight years—he took care of my horse when I had one, and attended to the garden—I had not a horse of my own that day—there is a pantry window in the back, over the wash house—that window had a per<lb></lb>forated zinc plate outside—when I left home it was safe—the zinc plate was fastened with one nail—it was merely to keep the flies out—if that were away any one could get into the house through that opening—when I went away I told the prisoner to tell no one that we were out, to come round at 10 o'clock at night to see that all was right, and to come to meet us at the 11 o'clock train the next morning—when we left home there was an iron chest in my bed room—it contained a dozen or fourteen knives and forks—some plated candlesticks, and branches, a carver and fork, a fish slice, a pocket book, and in it a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note—some deeds and some papers—there was a good sharp dog in the stable—I kept him there for protection—I told the prisoner not to let that dog loose till I came back—the prisoner frequently assisted in the house when we had any friends there—I do not think he knew much about where the plated goods were kept, but he knew the chest was there—he had it when he wanted to clean the windows—I had some silver goods, but they were in another cupboard—on the following day the prisoner met me at the station—he said, "They have been at it again"—I said, "What do you mean"—he said, "They have been robbing old Sparrow "(he lives near me); "this is the third time"—I said I was very sorry for it, they had robbed the poor man two or three times—I said, "How is our house?"—he said, "I went round about 11 o'clock at night; I heard the dog barking, I ran across the fields and went round, and when I got there I saw a man (or a <hi rend="italic">cove</hi>) hanging over the gate"—I said, "What did you say to him?"—he said, "I said, 'Halloo, my friend, what do you do there?' and he said, 'I have got up out of the wind;' and he wanted to see a man of some name, I forget the name, who used to live there some years ago"—I asked him how the man was dressed—he said, "He had a smock frock on down to his knees"—he said, "I said to him, 'It is a good thing that my master has gone to bed, or very likely he would put a chance shot into you'"—he said, "I went through the stable and shut the door, and got be<lb></lb>hind the water butts, and I saw the man sneak down the road, towards Mr. Greenhill's farm"—I think he said, two or three times, that he had a smock frock on down to his knees—I asked him if all was right—he said all was right, the locks and doors were quite fast—all this took place between the station and my house—the prisoner went on with us till I stopped at the Swan and had a glass of beer, and he went on with Mrs. Chapman—after I left there, I met the prisoner coming back to meet me—he said, "Come along, somebody has broke into the house"—I went home, and Mr. Morris went with me, and the prisoner—when we got near the house Mr. Morris looked about for foot marks—he pointed to a foot mark over the flat, and the prisoner said, "That is my foot mark, I rolled the flat this morning"—that foot mark was nine or ten yards from the zinc plate—I went to the</p>

               <p>house and found the zinc plate was down half way—it was so removed that any one could get in—this is it, (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), it had been taken quite down and was just laid against the window—it had had only one nail, and that was drawn—I found the door was open, I went in—my wife had been in before me—I searched the house and missed the iron chest—a large cup<lb></lb>board had been broken open in the front parlour, and the chest was gone from the bed room—two bottles of wine had been taken out of the cupboard, and two tumblers were three parts full of wine, but I do not think they had drank any—I informed the police, and the next day I saw the prisoner—I said to him," You go and search round, and try to find these things"—he said, "Very well"—he came back in about an hour, or an hour and a half—he said, "I have got some of them, master;" and he gave me the candlesticks and branches, the knives and forks, and the fish slice—he was carrying them in a sack—the knives were wrapped up in two cloths—they were quite dry—he said he found them in an old haycock in Miller's field—I was so pleased that I gave him a pint of ale—I told him to go and search the ponds—he said he was going to search Sparrow's pond, and Mr. Hill's, for the chest, and he would rather have a policeman with him—I said, "You do it very well by yourself, try and find it if you can"—about 4 o'clock that afternoon I went to Mr. Green well's pond, which is about 300 yards from my house—I saw the prisoner and two or three little boys with him—I saw my iron chest, the lid was broken and was inside—it was about four or five feet from the blink of the pond, in the water—I found the papers in the chest—a little boy and the prisoner carried them down to my house—I told the prisoner all the things were found except the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I gave him another glass of ale.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. I recollect coming to town on 23rd Jan., and returning home on the following morning—I had left the house all safe the evening before—when I got there I went to the front door, and I gave the prisoner the key of the side door to unlock it, and come and let me in at the front door—he went and opened the side door, but he did not open the front door—he went into the stable—I went to the stable door, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, I told you to open the front door"—he said that he did not hear me—he then went round and opened the front door—he unbolted it, and let me in—when I went in, the right hand parlour door was ajar—it opens into the passage—I had left it shut the night before—the key was in it, but it was not locked—I then went along the passage, and saw the pantry door open—I had left that door shut the night before—I said to him, <hi rend="italic">"Jem</hi>, have you opened this door"—he said, "No;" and he said "This door was open also," that was the kitchen door, leading to the passage—I went into the pantry, and on the shelf there was a cruet stand, which had been the nigbt before in a cupboard in the parlour on the left hand side—I said to the prisoner, "Some one has been in"—I then went to the parlour on the right hand side, telling him to come with me, and on the table stood two decanters and two tumblers—there was port and sherry in the decanters, and the tumblers were half full, one of port, and one of sherry—those decanters had been in the cupboard which was locked, and I had the key with me—I then saw that the cupboard door had been forced open—I said, "Come up stairs, and let us see what has been done"—I saw my bed room door was open—it had been shut the night before—the key was in it, it was not locked—I missed the iron chest which used to stand at the fireplace—the chest was locked, and the key was in the wardrobe in my room—I afterwards found the key in the wardrobe—I told the prisoner to fetch Mr. Chapman, and in going down he called my attention to the staircase window—he pulled the blind back, and said, "This is unfastened, ma'am"—I said, "They did not get in there, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>"—I could not say whether that window had been fastened the night before—that window looks to the back, over the passage door—I had a screwdriver, which had been usually kept in the drawer in the bade kitchen—I looked for it the next morning, and could not find it—I asked the prisoner for it, and he fetched it from the stable—I said, "What did you take it out of the drawer for? you have no right to take it without my leave"—he said he had it to put a lock on Ann's box (Ann lives just by)—this took place on</p>

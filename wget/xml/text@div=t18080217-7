               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at your shop at any time. A. On the 19th of January she came in my shop about two o'clock. When she came in I was engaged with a customer in the back shop; I supposed she was in a hurry, she went out; there was no person in the shop at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she speak to you. - A. She did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay. - A. I suppose not more than a minute, and then went away; I did not speak to her, she did not come into the back shop.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was gone, did you miss any thing. - A. About a minute and a half after she was gone, I went forward to the counter, and missed a dozen of stockings I had on the counter; they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of cotton stockings were they. - A. White cotton stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put them. - A. They were laying on the counter when she came in; upon missing them I put on my hat and went after her, I observed her to turn to the left of the door; I perfectly recollected the colour of the gown; I turned down Brick-lane, I saw her walking as fast as she could; when I came up to her I observed her looking into her apron; I did not say any thing to her at the time, but let her go on till I saw some person that I thought would be a witness; she turned down Church-street towards Spital fields church; I saw a gentlemen of the name of Austin coming along; I observed to him that she had robbed me of a dozen pair of stockings, and had them in her apron, we let her walk on till she came into Crispin street; I observed that we had better lay hold of her, I then went up to her and asked her what she had got in her apron; she said, nothing; I asked her how she could say such a falsity, and pulled down the apron; there was the stooking then in her apron; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170008"></xptr>took her to Worship-street office and gave her in charge to Kennedy.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of these stockings. - A. They are invoiced at fifty shillings; the net value is forty-seven and sixpence, taking off the five per cent.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see her take them. - A. No, I did not see her take them. I was certain she had taken them because no other person could; they were on the counter two minutes before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shop part of your dwelling house. - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the occupier of the house. - A. Yes; no other person occupies the house, nor have I any partner.</p>

I did, on the 19th of January last; when I saw her she was just turned the corner of Church-street, Brick-lane; I saw the prosecutor there; he asked me if I saw that woman before us; I said, yes; he said, she has stolen a dozen stockings from me; he desired me to follow her with him; I did, it was all in my way home; when we came up to the woman Mr. White asked her what she had got and likewise myself; she said she had nothing. Mr. White said how could she assert such a falsehood, and took a dozen pair of cotton stockings from her apron; we took her to the office in Worship street.</p>

            . I am a constable belonging to Worship street office. I received a dozen pair of cotton stockings of Mr. White on the 19th of January; I took charge of the prisoner at the same time; I searched the prisoner. I found a few halfpence in her pocket.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this gentleman's shop to buy a yard of ribbon; I went out again to see if my eyes deceived me; a woman came up in a black gown; she says carry this parcel for me. I am going after my child; I walked on softly, I went to the corner of the street; I then stopped, I looked into my apron; the gentlemen said that is my property; I said, it is not your property; it is property of the woman that gave it me; I have not stolen it. if I had been guilty of stealing it; I should have concealed it. I stood still, thinking the woman would come up. I did not thieve it.</p>
               <p>COURT. The fact of the woman taking the goods seems pretty well established; it is a capital offence in law to steal in a dwelling house to the value of forty shillings; you are to be fully satisfied that they are worth forty shillings; you find the prosecutor says they are of the value of forty seven shillings, that is running pretty nigh the value; you will have to say whether you find the woman guilty of the capital offence, or guilty of simple larceny.</p>

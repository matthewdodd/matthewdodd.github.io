I missed a quantity of coals from my cellar, and observed that the last thing the prisoner did of an evening before she left, was to get up a quantity of coals, and the same in the morning, and knowing I could not use them I was resolved to watch her. Last Saturday I saw her bring a very large pile of very large coals. When she had done every thing but opening the shutters, she went outside the door for that purpose, and in that interval of time I got out of bed, took a candle, and went into the attic room, and saw that the coals were there; she immediately returned, and left the room - the moment she shut the door I got out of bed again with my two sons, and the large coals were all gone. It was impossible anybody could have taken them but her; I had seen them not two minutes before. She has only lived with me since Christmas. I should think something less than half a bushel were taken - she returned about eleven o'clock in the day; I told her she had caused me great uneasiness that morning, she trembled - I charged her with it, she denied it. I told her how I had watched her; she still denied it, and said she would send somebody to silence me, and abruptly left the room, and returned with her husband. I had told her she had better throw herself on my compassion than insult me - her husband also insulted and threatened me. I told him it was not suspicion, but ocular proof; he then said his wife was innocent, and if I would not prosecute his wife, he would prosecute me. I gave her in charge.</p>

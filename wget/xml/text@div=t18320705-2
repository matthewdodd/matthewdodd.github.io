On Tuesday last, the 3rd of July, I was in my shop - the glass in my window was then whole, and this gold watch laid a good way in the window - I did not hear the window break; it is plate glass - but in a quarter of an hour I found a pane of glass broken and pushed in; I missed the gold watch - I did not see any body take it; I went into the street and saw three suspicions young men standing at an oyster-stand, nearly opposite; I went in, and got my hat - when I returned they had dispersed; I went after the Police of our division, but there were none on duty for two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any of the three men? A. I discerned one with a green coat and yellow buttons on, and two boys with round jackets; I wrote down the particulars of the watch, and sent down to the Police, offering 5l. reward for the apprehension, and on Wednesday night Thomas came to me - I went next morning to Walter's, the pawnbroker, saw my watch, and knew it to be the one I had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen any of the three young men before? A. Frequently; I have seen the prisoner three or four times a week - I do not know whether he was one of the three, for his dress is changed since - he is just the same size; I know him from his passing, and being continually at my window - I cannot say whether he is one of those who stood at the oyster-stall; I described the dress like person had on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before on that day? A. Not before I saw him at the oyster-stand, if he was there -I gave 5l. for the watch; it is worth that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you not take me instead of going for your hat? A. I went out to look for a Policeman to take them - I believe the oyster-man was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183206050004"></xptr>concerned with you, for I have been robbed before, and found persons standing there.</p>

            . I am shopman to John Walters, pawnbroker, of No. 106, Aldersgate-street. I have a gold watch. which was brought to our shop on Tuesday, the 3rd of July, by the prisoner - I think it was a little after two o'clock - he offered it in pledge in the name of

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner last Wednesday afternoon, in Holborn, on another charge - I took him to Covent-garden station-house, searched him, and found the duplicate produced in his trousers pocket; I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL LEVY. This is the watch I lost.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - My father was a respectable attorney, residing at Ludlow, Shropshire - I was committed to this prison last Thursday, with but a shilling and a few halfpence; my friends, if I have any, live at that distance from town - I have not had it in my power to send to them to come forward; I lived with Mr. Porter, No. 23, Lancaster-place, Burton-crescent, as clerk, and served him faithfully till nearly the time of his decease in 1829, and gave him 50l. security for the money he might have in my hands - I got none of that back; but when my father died he left me 300l., and his wife, who was not my mother, left me 400l.; I have had many expences to pay out of the money, and money was paid to me during my minority: my father died eight years ago - since I left Mr. Porter I lived with Mr. 
               <persName id="t18320705-2-person114">T. </persName>
            Burgess, of Curzon-street, May-fair, and had not left him more than six weeks, since that I had money from different friends in town, and have been in expectation of another situation. As to the charge of breaking the window, the prosecutor says quite wrong; I never had a green coat on, and never was seen at the oyster-stall opposite his shop in my life; if I had had money and time to bring witnesses to character, I could prove it is the first time I was ever arraigned at a bar of justice; I hope you will take it into your merciful consideration, that though the witness swears I pawned the watch, he says I had a brown coat or some such colour, but if I could have brought witnesses forward, they could prove what dress I have worn for twelve months; as to my pawning the watch, he must be quite under a mistake, and I am convinced Levy is totally wrong in his charge against me - I never, to my knowledge, was near his shop: knowing the consequence of such a crime, do you think I should commit myself in such a manner, for so trifling a thing? I have had watches of my own, but being reduced, have been compelled to sell them, and should have waited a little longer before I took to such means as this, having been brought up in quite a different manner.</p>

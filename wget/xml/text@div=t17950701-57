               <p>Q. Did the bar appear to be wrenched? - Very much so; I perceived that all the closets except two had been broke open, and in those two there was nothing material of consequence, there was earthen ware in one, and a few things in the other, of very little value.</p>

There was a silver tea pot and stand, and several spoons, table spoons and tea spoons, and several other articles which I cannot rightly tell, because I never see them from the time they packed them up; there were some sugar things what they put sugar in.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was he gone? - I believe about twenty minutes, for it was so early; he brought two shillings worth of rum, and a large basket, like a butter basket, that he had borrowed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should know it again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that basket large enough to hold all the things? - No, I gave half a crown to White and Tidmarsh, to get some hampers, like wine hampers, to put the remainder in. They were gone a good while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go before Green came back? - No; they were gone some time, the shops being shut up they could not get them.</p>

               <p>Q. And then when they brought the baskets, who were then in the room? - They were in the room, all four men and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Brown had not gone out of the room? - No, he still remained on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with Brown while they were gone? - All the conversation I had was, he said he was very ill, and very much afflicted with the rheumatism.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you not talk any thing about the things? - No; for Green was packing the things up while I was talking to Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. When Green came back with his butter flat, and the others with their wine baskets, did they do any thing? - Green was packing up the linen and plate in the butter basket, and he put as much in as eit co uldh old.</p>
               <p>Q. When White and Tidmarsh came back, what did they do? - Then White packed up one of the other hampers, and Green had done his, and tied it up with cords, and then he helped to pack up the others.

               <p>Q. That is what I have been asking you for these five minutes. Did Samuel, your lodger, in the course of that morning come home? - He did so, in the course of half an hour; he went up stairs; he likewise stopped for about half an hour, and came down with the hamper in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the same condition when he brought it down stairs as when the boy carried it up? - It was not; it was entirely empty with the lid hanging down. He said, Mrs. Golding, I will be obliged to you to let me put this hamper back, it will be a lumber in my room.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the hamper brought? - It was brought on the boy's shoulders shut. I cannot tell what it contained.</p>
               <p>Q. It was full? - I cannot tell, it might, it was on the boy's shoulder, fastened up.</p>
               <p>Q. It had the appearance as if it had some thing in it? - Certainly it had. I gave the hamper to the officer when he came for his linen.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find any basket at Mrs. Golding's? - Yes, but there was no property in it. The hamper is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const to Golding. At your house, I believe the husband's brother lived, not the husband? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on this day that you have described, the only hamper was brought by this receiver's son? - By a little lad that passed for the son.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner White did not bring a hamper as she has told us, but her son? - Nobody else came on earth.</p>
               <p>Q. Samuel owned the hamper? - He brought the hamper down, and asked me to let it be there, as it would be lumber in his room, and it was there till I gave it the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lived with you? - Ever since the first of last October? -</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). About six years ago I was convicted at the Old Bailey, and sentenced to be transported for life, when I was sent to New South Wales, at which place I arrived about five years and a half ago: when I got there I was taken into the service of Mr. Bodman, an auctioneer, resident there; I continued in his service only a few weeks, and after that time he gave me a little liberty, for this reason - as I was in my bed I was awakened by a noise in the back kitchen which was occasioned by two men breaking into his house, I got up and alarmed the master and the rest of the family; my master's clerk fired at one of the men out of the window, when they ran off, and were seen no more. In a few days afterwards I had occasion to go out upon some business for my master, when I was stopped by two men, who threatened to take my life away if they caught me going about after dark; when I returned I acquainted my master with it, and he told me he would see if something could not be done for me: on the Sunday following he gave me a new suit of clothes, and told me I might have a little liberty; I was afterwards persuaded by a friend to go on board of the New Zealand schooner bound for the River Thames, at New Zealand; when I got on board I went to work for the captain, who told me, if I would sail with him he would give me £3 current money, per month, which offer I accepted; when we were cleared out I answered to my name at the custom-house, and I considered that my master had done something for me, as there was no objection to my going away in the New Zealand. I was away from Sidney about seven weeks, when I returned with a cargo of flax and Indian corn. I remained at Sidney about thirteen days, and was paid off there; and then I joined the New Zealand schooner again, when we went to a place called the Bay of Islands, where the crew left her. When I left the schooner I went into the service of Mr. Fishwick, a settler of New Zealand; after I left the service of Mr. Fishwick I then shipped on board the ship Thetis, of London, sperm whaler, bound for the Coast of Japan, Captain

I remained in China about three months when I shipped on board the Tremont, of Boston, Captain Russell Sturgess, bound for England and from thence to Germany, there I remained, by my own request, about six weeks, and then I returned to England again, where I have remained ever since; and when the people took me into custody, they found me at work in the stable belonging to the master that I have been working for ever since I came home. I have always considered myself a freeman, as I was cleared out of the Customs and Police at Sidney twice, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170010"></xptr>likewise, my master, Mr. Bodman and my brother, who was at that time living as second coachman to his late majesty

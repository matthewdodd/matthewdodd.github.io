               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Had he lodged with you? A. No; I gave him leave to sleep in the spare stall in the stable - I did not tell him he should not sleep there any more - I did not put his things away from the premises, but they were not in any room - the place where his things were, was open to half a dozen people - they were in an open space belonging to all persons - it was not locked up.</p>

            . I am a coachman, and live in this mews - on the 23rd of August, about twelve o'clock at night, I was awoke - I heard somebody lift the latch - I heard it a second time - I got up and heard the prisoner's voice, asking if any body was at home - he then went towards Carter's room, and unlocked the door or something like it- he remained there some time - he then came out, and returned a second time to Carter's room - he remained there some time with a woman, and then went down - I looked and saw the woman go away first, and he after her - I got up at half-past five o'clock - I saw him coming up the mews, and he opened his trunk, and put something in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know that he had been in the habit of being there? A. Yes; in the stable - he had nothing when he went out the second time.</p>

             (police-constable C 109). I was on duty in South Moulton-street - I met the prisoner, and after he had passed me, I picked up a duplicate - I had not seen it there before - I went to the place it referred to, and found these articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was it since you had been at that place? A. About ten minutes - there were not many persons then passing - it was half-past five o'clock- it had not been there all night, for it was quite light, and I must have seen it.</p>

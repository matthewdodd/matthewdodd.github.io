I went to apply—Mrs. Sammons was out; I left our porter in the house—when I returned he had taken half the goods—there were a great many other people taking their goods away also—there was a van of furniture at the corner of New Church-court—there was no appear<lb></lb>ance of Mr. Hammond coming into possession, or of anybody but Mrs. Sam<lb></lb>nions being in possession—she acted as mistress whenever I went—Dump is the man I took the order from, in the name of Hammond, but J never saw him there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milliner, and live at No. 48, lisle-street, Leicester-square. I know the prisoners—I have seen them at the coffee I house at New Church-court—I lived there for a fortnight—Mrs. Sammons kept the house; it is a gay house—I saw Durup there once—I never knew him by the name of Hammond—I believe I was living there on 20th Jan. I—I was there in the middle of Jan.—I was not there till after the crockery came, and then Mrs. Sammons said that she had a set of china, and showed me a pattern of them—Durup was not there—she did not say how they had been obtained, but she said it came from Si Paul's Churchyard—I heard Durup say that Mrs. Sammons had given him a card, and told him to repre<lb></lb>sent himself as Mr. Hammond, and she would give him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—she was not there when he told me that—neither of them said anything to me about what had become of it—I know that the young man frequently came for for, the money—Durup came in one night very much frightened; he said the officers were after him, and would I lend him a penny to get his whiskers shaved off—I and another young woman were there; Mrs. Sam<lb></lb>mons told him not to be frightened, and said why did not he give them a further order, and put them off for a fortnight—she said she would go round to the Falstaff after him, and would make him go and tell Mr. Allsup so—I was present several times when the parties came for the china, and she told the young man that Mr. Hammond lived over the water; and on another occasion that he had taken the coffee shop—she mentioned the name of Hammond on one or two occasions when the young man called—I have seen a great many cards like this—Mrs. Sammons was the keeper of the coffee house.</p>

                  </hi>. I was living at this coffee house on 20th Jan., and for three weeks or a month—I know the prisoners—Mrs. Sammons kept the house while I was there—other ladies lodged there—<hi rend="italic">The Fairy</hi> lived there, and so did <hi rend="italic">Politics; The Greek</hi> did not—I heard Mrs. Sammons tell Durup that if he would get her some china she would give him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he got the china—I did not hear her say anything about the name—I hare seen cards like this there—she told him to take one of these cards and represent himself as Mr. Hammond, and that he kept the coffee house, and he was to get as many things as he could, and she would pay him accordingly—she sold the cups, saucers, and plates in my presence, for 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I believe—I recollect the person coming for the money for the china, and Mrs. Sammons said that Mr. Hammond was out, and if he would call in the morning she would settle with him; and after she had sent him away she laughed and said, well, she had <hi rend="italic">done</hi> him—I have heard Durup complain and say to her that if she did not pay him he would break up the whole concern—he never told me how much she had paid him, but he said that she was going to give him half a crown—he had said that he would get them in for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I am living at home now.</p>

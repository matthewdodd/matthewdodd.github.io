I do not know that the man was ever there. The bed-room door was always open. The regular servant attended Mrs. Alexander, and the prisoner did the work of the house. The 15 l. note has been stopped at the Bank and delivered to me. I produce it. I took it of Messrs. Smith, Payne and Co. Bankers - it was given me from the Bank on the 19th of June. On missing the notes I had Martha taken up - she denied it, and said her brother was never in the house.</p>

He said he knew nothing of it. Taylor searched him in my presence, and found four 1 l. notes and 10 s. on him - it was returned to him. We took him to Bow-street; he was remanded till seven o'clock, and before seven we took Martha, at her mother's, in Chapel-street, Pentonville - I said I wanted her to go to Bow-street, and asked if she had been there before - she said, Yes - I said I had her brother in custody.

The prisoner at the bar came to my shop on the 7th of March last, about half past seven in the morning. I was down stairs; my lad came down with the list of books that he brought. I went to the shop and found the prisoner there, and the apprentice only. My lad's name is Thomas. I told the prisoner I had two books which were mentioned in his list; and he told me to put the names of them, and their lowest price on a bit of paper. I did so, and he went away, saying he would call again about one. While he was in the shop; I observed a vacancy on a shelf, on the left hand side coming from up stairs. I did not take any notice of it while the prisoner was in the shop, but suffered him to depart. I did not perceive that he took any thing with him. After he was gone, I spoke to my apprentice, and shewed him the vacancy, and sent him after the prisoner. The vacancy excited a suspicion in my mind. My boy went out and returned immediately, and then I went out myself; I saw the prisoner in St. Martin's-lane, and saw a boy with him; I suppose about fourteen years of age. The boy had a bag of books with him over his shoulder. I did not know either the boy or the prisoner before; I gently took the prisoner by the lappel of his coat, and desired him to come back with me. There was nobody with me; he hesitated at first, and then returned immediately. In returning, at the corner of New-street, I saw the prisoner drop on his left knee and stoop; and on turning round, I saw he had placed three books on the sill of the door of Mr. Grane; he stooped sideways on his left knee. I immediately took the books and seiz

             the prisoner, and he walked quietly with me to my shop. The boy followed him. When I got to the shop, I examined the three books. They were volumes of Sir John Froittart's Chronicles of France and Spain, There was not room for them in the book-case, where the remainder of the set was, and they had been placed on the shelf close by. The set of twelve volumes, and one volume of plates, sell for seven guineas. Perhaps, if they were offered to me separately. I would not give three shillings for them.</p>

               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>JOHN SIMMONDS. (A little boy.) The prisoner lodged at my mother's. I went out with him on the morning when he was taken into custody. He asked me to go with him; I took a pillow-case, and went with him; he brought two books out of Mr. Setchell's and put them into the pillow-case. Before Mr. Setchell came up to us, he took them out, and put them into his handkerchief, and when Mr. Setchell came. I saw him drop them on the step of a door; that was when he was going back with Mr. Setchell. I saw Mr. Setchell pick them up, and carry them to his shop.</p>

               <p>Five respectable witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

               <p>THE COURT, in summing up the evidence for the consideration of the Jury, told them, that the value stolen privately in a shop must be five shillings, to constitute a capital offence; but with respect to value in the present case, though Mr. Setchell or any one else, would not perhaps give three shillings for the three odd volumes; yet the intrinsic value was what they were worth to Mr. Setchell, at the time they were stolen; and certainly Mr. Setchell's loss would be considerably above five shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Chapel Road, Stoke Newington, and am gub—cashier at the Bank of England—on Saturday, 28th February, about 4 p.m., I was going home, and was in Church Path with a bag in one hand and an umbrella in the other—I felt a hand behind me on my coat collar, and a tremendous lug at my chain—I staggered, and conld not recover myself, and fell and severely injured my hand—I jumped up directly, and saw the prisoner running away—he was the only person I could see—I immediately gave chase, and called "Stop thief"—I lost sight of him when he turned up the path—I went up the path, and saw him in Albion Road held by a man named Williams—I charged him with stealing my watch and chain, but I afterwards found that my watch was safe, and only my steel chain was gone—he said that he was not the man; he was as innocent as a baby unborn—Jones then came up and showed me my chain; this is it; the swivel is broken—we could not find a policeman—he kicked, and plunged, and was very violent, but we took him to the station.</p>

I am a tutor, of 78, Walford Road, Stoke Newington—on 8th February, about 4 p.m., I was in a path leading to Albion Road, and heard cries of "Stop thief; he has got my watch"—I saw the prisoner running, and have not the slightest doubt he. is the man—he passed me, and then I gave chase for 150 yards, when he turned round and said "What do you want?"—I said "You have stolen this gentleman's watch"—he took me by surprise, and gave me a violent blow on my face; I closed with him, and after a violent struggle secured his arms and held him till the prosecutor came up—Jones came up and produced the chain—we took him part of the way to the station, and handed him over to a policeman—he was very violent both in manner and language.</p>

I am 9 years old—I was in Church Lane, and saw Mr. Agar walking along and the prisoner behind him—he went in front of him and put his hand to his waistcoat and rushed at him, and the gentleman fell forward on his hands, and they were grazed and bleeding—the prisoner ran up a narrow court—I saw his face before he attacked Mr. Agar.</p>

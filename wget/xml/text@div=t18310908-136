I am a dress-maker, of No. 12, Creechurch-lane, Leadenhall-street. The prisoner came to me on Thursday morning, the 14th of July, and brought six bundles of printed paper; I never looked at them - he asked if he might leave them for half an hour; I said Yes he might, being an acquaintance - he said if I could sell them while he was gone I might; he wanted 31/2d. per lb. for them - I said I did not think I could sell them, but after he was gone I went down to Mr. Raphael, who lived in the house, and dealt in stationery - I asked him about it; he said he would not purchase it, but he took them out and sold them to Mr. Abrahams; he took only a sample - he came back, and said he had got a purchaser; he afterwards gave me 5l. 1s. 6d., which I gave to the prisoner -I delivered the paper to Raphael.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where is Mr. Raphael? A. He is a commercial man, and has been out of town since the day after he sold it - I do not know where he is; he never writes to me - I lodge at his mother's; I have known Raphael many years - he is not related to me; I do no business with his mother, and have no connexion in trade with her or her son, nor has my mother.</p>
               <p>Q.Read this bill? A.This is right, but it only alludes to Passover time - my mother and Mrs. Raphael have a sort of partnership during the Passover.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Is this bill printed for general trade or only at Passover time? A. Only at the Passover, which lasts eight days - persons unite to sell provision among the Jews at that time.</p>

            . I am a grocer and pastry-cook, and live in Petticoat-lane. I bought 312 lbs. of paper of Raphael, for which I gave 36s. a cwt., which is about 4d. per lb. - I do not know what has become of him since; I sent my boy with a truck for the paper - he went with Raphael, but I bargained for it - Raphael brought me a sample: the officer took the paper away afterwards, and it is here now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see it taken by the officer? A. Yes; I can neither read nor write, but I can swear to the size of the paper - I put no mark on it: the officer put a mark on it, and took it away about five days after I bought it - I had other paper in the house, but not made up in bundles like this; not such a quantity - it stood in my parlour at the back of the shop.</p>

            . I am an extra patrol of the City. In consequence of information I went to Abrahams' house, and found these six bundles of paper in a little room, adjoining the shop - there was other paper in the house, but not in the corner where this was; I saw no large bundles - this is what I brought away; it has my mark on it - I did not take Abrahams into custody; I told him to come to Mr. Butterworth's, and he promised he would, but his wife was taken very ill; I returned, and he went up to Mr. Butterworth's - I asked who he bought the paper of, and he showed me a copy of a receipt which Thomas, who was with me, took a copy of - I afterwards took the prisoner, and told him what it was for: he said he had never sold any printed paper in his life - that he had sold writing paper; I took him to Mr. Butterworth's, and then to the Compter - one day, in the Alderman's room, I asked him again where he got it; he was in a bit of a passion, and said he never bought printed paper, but he bought writing paper of several parties at the West-end of the town, but they were now off, and he knew nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prisoner told you all through that he had never sold printed paper? A. Yes; I have been looking for Raphael sometimes till two o'clock in the morning, but cannot find him - I inquired at his house; they say he is travelling, but do not know where.</p>

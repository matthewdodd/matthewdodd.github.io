I was second mate on board the <hi rend="italic">Lady Flora</hi>, I left Melbourne in her, there were passengers with us—I assisted in shipping three tons and a half of gold—Simpson and Branchett were passengers—we put into Rio—I had conversation with Simpson about the gold—there was gambling on board to a great extent, I had lost a considerable sum of money</p>

            . I am a Chairman; I was plying in the Rose Passage , where we commonly ply, and I heard Captain Murray cry out Stop Thief; the Prisoner run up against me, and almost stopped himself by it: The Captain came up, drew his Sword, and the Prisoner was pushed into the Rose Tavern Kitchen, and carried to the Round-House. Mr. Gray received a Blow on the Eye with a Brickbat, though we had the Guard of the Play-house: There were some hundreds of Stones and Brickbats seen lying there the next Morning: They flew so that People thought the Gentleman would have had his Brains beat out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I would ask the Captain, whether he can swear to that Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Murray. I looked at it when I was at the Justice; I know the Handkerchief, it is marked with an S, it is my Sister's Handkerchief. <rs id="t17431207-13-verdict73" type="verdictDescription">

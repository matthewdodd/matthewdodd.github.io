               <p>Q. What were his words - A. Damn you, what did you strike me for.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you struck any body - A. No, I was going peaceably along. He put himself in an attitude to strike me; I turned my hands in a sort of defence, and told him to go along; he went, and I expected I had got rid of him. In a minute afterwards he came up again, turned me round, and made a snatch at my seals; the chain broke, and the seals came off.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I had two small glasses of whiskey with a friend, I knew what I was about. When he snatched at my seals I prevented the watch from going by putting my hand upon it. He took the seals, I pursued him immediately, and of course he was taken in about a minute afterwards. I did not lose sight of him, he turned down Old Bethlem; he was taken before he got to Sun-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you find your seals - A. No; I fancy he throwed them away in the pursuit. I looked for the seals afterward, I did not find them. I can swear positively to his person that he is the man that snatched the seals.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Saturday evening was Bow-fair - A. It was. I had been spending the evening with a friend at Walbrook.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course he snatched so suddenly he got them before you made any resistance -

            He did it so instantly that I had not time to resist. He put himself in an attitude of offence, laid hold of my collar, and snatched them away. The chain broke.</p>
               <p>COURT. He tried at your watch, you prevented it by putting your hand - A. Yes, the watch was almost out, but I seized it. The chain was a base metal chain.</p>

            . I am a labourer in the East India warehouses. On Sunday morning, the 9th of June, between twelve and one, I was coming into Bishopgate street, the prisoner was standing with his back towards the road, and his face towards Bishopsgate church-yard; the moon shone very bright, I could discover him two or three yards off. The prisoner ran up against the prosecutor, and said, d - n you, how dare you strike<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181107100011"></xptr>me, I am one of his Majesty's subjects.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike him - A. No, there were a great many words: I crossed over and said to the prisoner, how could you think of taking advantage of this-man, he is rather in liquor. The prisoner put himself in a fighting attitude, he did not strike him; the prosecutor said, my good fellow, I have nothing at all to do with you, he pushed him away, and went on. The prisoner came along with me, I tried to make up the matter, I did not know either of them, and just as I got from Bishopsgate church-yard there were two women standing, then the prisoner left me. He ran up to me a few minutes afterwards; he said he thought to take one of them bloody bitches home with him, but there was a man with them. Then I was afraid of him; he viewed me all over, he darted away from me, and ran towards Mr. Bolton; when he came up to him he gave him a turn round, he snatched the bunch of seals, I do not know how many there were, only there was a bunch, which he got from him, and ran away; Mr. Bolton called out immediately. I was in the road. The prisoner was stopped before he got to Sun-street, I am sure the prisoner is the man, he walked with me several steps before he came up to the woman; he was taken to the watch-house; Mr. Bolton catched hold of me by the arm, and insisted upon my going into the watchhouse. I left the prisoner then, and Mr. Bolton, and I never saw him or the prisoner until last night, Mr. Bolton called on me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. You said it was not right the prisoner should take advantage of a man that was in liquor - A. I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think the seals were gone before he put his hand there - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. The snatch was made before he put his hand there - A. Of course it must.</p>

            . I was officer of the night. Between twelve and one o'clock in the night the prisoner was brought into the watchhouse, Mr. Bolton charged him with robbing him of three gold seals.</p>
               <p>- MURPHY. I was in the watchhouse. The prisoner was searched, the seals were not found. The prisoner broke out, I followed him, and never lost sight of him. He was taken again in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walford. How far was it from where the seals were taken, to where the prisoner was taken - A. From Old Bethlem to Dunning's-alley, between three and four hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask any of the witnesses if there are any here that took me.</p>
               <p>Hornby. He was stopped by the watchman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I will prove to the contrary, and that this man said he would hang me if he could. I have served his Majesty in the dragoon service nine years; I have been willing to serve my king; I likewise have been an honest, industrious man. I can bring forward the most respectable noblemen and gentlemen to prove that I am an honest man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are they here now - A. No, they are not.</p>

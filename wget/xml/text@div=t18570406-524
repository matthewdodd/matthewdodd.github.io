                  </hi>. I went to vote at the Middlesex election, at Ham<lb></lb>mersmith—I stood with my back to a stall near the polling booth—the prisoner came in front of me, and I felt a tug at my watch, and found it hanging by the guard outside my pocket—the prisoner rushed into the crowd, and I after him—I laid hold of him by the collar, and he said, "It is not me; let me go, and I will show you who it is"—I kept him till the police came up.</p>

                  </hi>. I was standing on the pavement, talking to Mr. Saull, and saw the prisoner come towards us; he looked at Mr. Saull's guard—three ladies came up, and Mr. Saull said to the ladies and gentlemen on the pavement, "Make room; let the ladies pass;" and while he was look<lb></lb>ing round, the prisoner three different times attempted to take hold of his guard—the ladies passed, Mr. Saull looked round at the clock, and the prisoner made a rush, and took the guard in his hand, but it was so strong, he could not break it—I had my eye on him all the time; he ran off, and Mr. Saull after him—I am sure he is the man—I am a policeman, but was on sick leave; I had broken my wrist, and could not take him.</p>

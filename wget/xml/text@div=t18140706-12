            . I am a servant to Mr. Morrison, at the top of Fleet-market. On the 30th of June last, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, the prisoner came with another person to buy a gown. I sold her friend three gowns. In the interim I saw the prisoner with a pair of stockings in her hand; she was endeavouring to put them into her pocket; she could not accomplish it. She took them to a different part of the counter put her handkerchief over them, wrapped them up, and put her handkerchief into her pocket. I sent for an officer. She was going out. I accused her of having a pair of stockings in her pocket; she denied it. She took her handkerchief out with the stockings in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner purchase - A. Nothing that she paid for; her friend paid for three gowns, one of them, she said, was for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not she take them up by accident - A. She took the stockings a yard and a half from me, put her handkerchief over them, and put them into her pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mrs. Benjamin, of Lower Thames street. I remember calling at Bakers-buildings for Mr. Wheeler, after twelve baskets and twenty-four lids, and as I was going I saw Skinner, and asked him if the van had been out that morning—he said that he had been with two boxes to Woodniffe's son—I asked him if any of the cane baskets had been taken out, he said, "No"—I told him that a person had called at the shop and told us that there were some at the marine stores in Willow-walk, and asked him if he knew anything about it—he said that he was positive they did not come from there—I went to Willow-walk, and saw the baskets, and Wheeler said they were Messrs. Benjamin's property—we never sell any of that class of baskets, they cost half a crown each—I returned to Bakers-buildings, and then went back again with an officer to Wheeler's—we then went to a house in Brick-lane—Skinner and Wood<lb></lb>ruffe were brought together, and I said to Wheeler, "Which is the man that you bought the baskets of?" and he pointed to Skinner—I said, "These are Mrs. Benjamin's property, I must give you into custody"—he made no remark, and the officer took him to the station—I went to Skinner's house with the officer, to see if there was any more property there, and Woodruffe was close to the door—I gave him into custody.</p>

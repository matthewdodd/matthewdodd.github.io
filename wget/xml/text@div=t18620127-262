               <p>—he said that he had left an umbrella in the house—Bicknell said that it was an improper hour to be knocking at the door, and advised him to go away—to said he should not, and Bicknell took him in custody—he was the worse for drink, and kicked Bicknell on the legs, and threw him down on his back—the other persons took the prisoner away from Bicknell, and as he was going away I took him in custody—I drew my staff to defend myself and somebody came behind me, caught me under the knee, and threw me on my back—he was then either rescued from me or got away, and came round and wrenched the staff out of my hand, and hit me across the forehead with it when I lying was on my back—he struck me a second time, and I believe again, for I have got two wounds on the back of my head, which I believe to have been done with my staff—I was lying on my back and could see him use the staff—I had a good view of his countenance—the second blow, which was on the back of my head, rendered me insensible—when I recovered my senses I was still on the ground, and the men were gone—I was taken to the hospital by my brother constable—I have been an outpatient several weeks, attended by a surgeon, who is here—I have not been able to attend to duty since—I did not know the prisoner before.</p>

On the 26th of January I took from his house twenty-five dozen of wine—there were these twenty-four bottles in this basket in the body of my cart—I saw them there near one o'clock—I missed them twenty minutes after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Messrs. Templar, Shearman, and Co, solicitors, in Great Tower-street. I never saw the prisoner till I saw him in Newgate the day before yesterday—from what I have heard from our client, who is a cook, and keeps an eating-house, he has borne an excellent character for honesty and sobriety—our client's name is Joseph Chamber<lb></lb>lain Baker—he is plaintiff in an action now close upon trial—the prisoner is a very material witness on the part of the plaintiff—I should say that we should fail without his evidence—the case is not in any way connected with a greengrocer in Clare-market—it is an action of trespass against Mr. Gollings, next door to the plaintiff—I do not know whether the defendant is likely to know any one in Clare-market—Messrs. Templar have de<lb></lb>fended the prisoner at the request of our client.</p>

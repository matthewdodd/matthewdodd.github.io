                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver, of 127, Great Saffron-hill—on Saturday night, 17th February, I was coming from the Havelock Music Hall, into Fox-court, near Brook-street, Holborn, when I was seized by three men, two at my side and one at my back, the latter holding his hands over my mouth—it was the prisoner who did that, and it was done to prevent my speaking—I was pulled to the ground, and one of the men put his hand into my pocket, and took out three half-crowns which were loose—two of them then ran away, while the prisoner, who had been holding his hands over my mouth, continued to hold me, so that they might escape—he afterwards let go and ran away, and I had a good opportunity then of seeing him—I called "Stop thief!" and never lost sight of him till the policeman took him—I was sober, and knew what I was about</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 9). I was in Holborn. about half-past 12 o'clock on Saturday night, 17th of February, and heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I ran down to the spot from which the voice proceeded, and saw the prosecutor on the ground, and the prisoner running away—he was only a yard or two away—he was commencing to run—I followed and took him, having never lost sight of him—he only went about thirty or forty yards before I caught him—I took him back to the prosecutor, who said, "That's the man who held me down, while the others took the money out of my pocket"—his pocket was turned inside out, and he was standing up then—I did not know what the prisoner had done till I brought him back, so I said, "You must come back with me"—the prosecutor said, "That is the man that held me down"—I said, "I shall take you into custody"—he said, "I was only going to assist the man home; I did not know it was a police<lb></lb>man running after me, or I should not have run away"—I found 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2½<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. upon him—a half-crown, a shilling, and the rest in coppers—the prosecutor was quite sober enough to know what he was about, but he had had some<lb></lb>thing to drink—there were no other persons near him but the prisoner when I first came up—he was the only man running away—on the way to the station, he tried very much to get his right hand into his left-hand pocket, where the money was found—there was a scratch on the prosecutor's eye.</p>

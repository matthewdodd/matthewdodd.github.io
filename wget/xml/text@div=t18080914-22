               <p>Q. Did you go in search of the prisoners - A. I did, I went across the way to Flower de luce court with Mr. Hill; as we were passing up the court in the back room of a public house, the window was quite open, Mr. Hill saw three men and I saw three men, I could not see enough to distinguish them; they were looking over a pocket book; they were looking over papers in the pocket book, I could see the red flap to it. We then went for a constable and got one; we returned; as we were going up Flower de luce court presently came a man very near between the constable and myself; Mr. Hill then said that is one of them, I will swear to; that was Joseph. I laid hold of him, and the constable laid hold of him on the other side; there were two more, I believe; one I saw distinctly, his back was towards me. Mr. Hill ran after him. I took Joseph to my chambers in Fig tree court, I left him with my servant and one or two more men. I then went to look after Mr. Hill; I presently found Mr. Hill, he said that he had found the other man, but not knowing where I went to, he was obliged to let him go. When I got into the chambers we searched Joseph, we did not find any thing upon him; he was taken in custody; he said he knew nothing of other man; I said how came you in company with him, he replied it was very easy for one man to pass for another. Mr. Hill coming in he swore to him; he went up to Mr. Hill and said you make a great mistake, or told a story. Joseph said he was a person that belonged to very respectable connections. He was taken to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see the other prisoner - A. The next day, at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>Q. Was you in Fleet street on the 3d of August in the afternoon - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look round, and tell me whether you saw the prisoners, any one of them, or both - A. Both of them, between Bouvelie street and Mitre court. About four o'clock on that day I was passing down Fleet street, I observed three men pursuing the prosecutor; their conduct and actions led me to suppose their intentions were to rob him; I observed Joseph frequently point to the prosecutor's left hand coat pocket; I having proceeded about an hundred yards, watching their actions narrowly, Joseph turned round and observed I was so doing. In order to elude that suspicion I crossed over the way. When they lost sight of me, and when I had crossed over to the opposite side of the way,

             made a sudden stop; he walked continually the whole of the way before the prosecutor; when Joseph and the third person closed in behind the prosecutor, so as to prevent passengers from observing what they were doing; I had a side view, I could see what passed - when I distinctly saw Joseph put his hand into the prosecutor's left hand coat pocket, and withdraw something red, which had the appearance of a pocket book; - the pocket book apparently then went from the hands of Joseph to the third person, that made his escape; they then all crossed over the way together and went up Flower de-luce court. I met them in the middle of the road, in about the middle of Fleet street; I ran and overlook the prosecutor in Mitre court; we both agreed to pursue the prisoners, and going up Flower de luce court I saw Joseph in company of Israel and the other man, they were both looking over some papers which they had in their hands; the pocket book lay on the table, I saw the strop of it; the other part was covered over. We then got a constable, and were upon the point of going into the house, when they all came out; Joseph being the first man I gave charge of him, he was instantly secured and taken to Mr. Zachary's chambers. I followed Israel up Flower de luce court, overtook him and secured him; he asked me what I secured him for, I told him he was charged with a robbery: I begged him to go back with me; I brought him into the Temple. Not knowing where Mr. Zachary lived, and no person assisting of me, the prisoner threatened me for taking him without any proper person. I being a novice in the business let him go; he said if I would not let him go, he would do for me; these words I noticed; I let him go then; I saw Israel the next day and Joseph, at Guildhall; I am quite certain to both their persons.</p>

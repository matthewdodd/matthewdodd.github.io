I showed him a tray of gold seals, he selected two, and then produced some Napoleons in payment. We could not agree about the price that was to be allowed for them - he spoke to me in French, a lady interpreted between us. He appeared not to understand, and intimated that he would bring a friend who understood English; he then left the shop. Next day I saw him before the Alderman at Guildhall. About a week after he had been apprehended my two seals were produced at one of his examinations. I am certain they are part of the stock I had when he came into my shop; I showed them to him. He bought nothing.</p>

            . I am a marshalsman. On the 22d of April I found these two seals at the prisoner's lodgings, Thiott's hotel, in Bucklersbury, in the two pair of stairs front room. I found some coin in the same room, which I delivered to him by the magistrate's order - he received it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mariner, and live in Well-street, London Docks. On Wednesday evening, 19th March, I was passing through the Thames Tunnel, about 8 o'clock—it was the Tunnel fair—there were many persons there—I felt a pulling at my watch, which was in my left waistcoat pocket, and the chain round my neck—I put my hand round and caught the prisoner's hand, and held it fast—he had got my watch guard in his hand—he handed my watch to another man—I caught his left hand on my breast, and his right hand he passed with the watch to another man—I saw the watch, and saw him pass it—I had the guard—I saved that—I held the prisoner, and called the police, and gave him into custody—the ring of the watch was broken—it hung on the guard.</p>

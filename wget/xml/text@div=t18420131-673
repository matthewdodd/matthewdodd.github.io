                  </hi>. I am in the employ of George Hitchcock and Rogers, in St. Paul's Churchyard. About three o'clock in the afternoon of the 15th of January, Lowe, and to the best of my belief Williams, came into the shop—they came in together—Lowe asked for some lining, which I went to get—there was a table near where they stood—they went to the table on which dresses were lying—I asked them to look at the lining first, and if they wanted dresses, I would then show them the dresses—I showed them the lining, and went to the desk with the money—I had paid in the money, and got the bill stamped, when I came back again, they were at the same table—I gave the invoice to Lowe—I asked them again if they wanted to look at the dresses—they said no, and left the shop—there was no conversation about any swansdown—I did not refer either of them to Hall and Allan—they bad no conversation with any one but me.</p>

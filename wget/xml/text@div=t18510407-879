                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You put your head on the same pillow where the box was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The box was under the bed; I saw Mr. Hyett put it there—my head was over the box—I locked the outer door, the window door—I went to sleep—I had seen my master put the box under his bed three or four times—I had not spoken to anybody about his bringing the box over of a night—before I lived with Mr. Hyett I lived with Mr. Martin, in Aldersgate-street, and before that with Mr. Cunliffe, a boot-maker, for two years—I was never in any trouble.</p>

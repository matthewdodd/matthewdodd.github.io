                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Messrs. Wilson, 49, Wardour Street—I am in partnership with my brother William—he is very ill indeed—the prisoner has been in our employment about five years—his duty was to collect moneys and orders, and when he received moneys to enter them into a cash-book which I provided for the purpose, and to hand them to Mr. Williams, the cashier, and no one else—the book I speak of is called a rough cash-book—he was also provided with a traveller's book to take round with him—there was no restriction made about his entering moneys in that—I have not received any money from him beyond what the cashier has received, nor any one else in my establishment—he had no power to pay it to any one else—a man of the name of Snell was in our employment as ledger-keeper—he died on the 15th December last year—shortly after the accounts were investigated, and about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was found to be deficient—that was inclusive of Tovey's-Snell had no power to receive "credit" accounts at all, but during Williams' absence between 1 and 2 o'clock he would receive the cash for any ready money transaction—he had no au<lb></lb>thority to receive money from the prisoner—the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was deficient in the ledger accounts—on the 29th February I called the prisoner into the counting house, and asked him why he had kept money back from the thirty odd accounts that I held in my hand—he informed me he had paid them to Snell—I told him if he could not give me a better explanation than that I should give him into custody in the morning—in the morning I took a policeman with me to the warehouse, and placed him outside the door, but the prisoner never appeared, and did not after that—I took pro<lb></lb>ceedings against him, and he surrendered at the Police Court that was about ten days or a fortnight after he left. (<hi rend="italic">A letter, not dated, from the prisoner to Messrs. Wilson, was put in and read, in which he stated he had not taken a shilling of their money, but had paid it all to Snell, and acknowledged that he had done wrong in following Snell's directions.</hi>) He was paid weekly—I had not paid his week's wages when he left, and he did not come to receive them.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been for nineteen years cashier to the prosecutors—it was the prisoner's duty to account to me only—it was not his duty to pay money or account to Snell—Snell, in my absence, frequently received money—that was between 2 and 3 o'clock, and would be money over the counter—he had no right to receive money from the prisoner—my holiday was from the 17th to the 22nd July, I think—the prisoner used to enter the amounts he had received in a cash-book in Mr. Wilson's office, and then he would bring me a slip of paper with the amounts he would pay me—I never saw his traveller's book—there is in this cash-book, in his handwriting, on the 23rd September, an entry "Littlewood of Addiscombe, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," but there is no further entry of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he accounted to me for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with other moneys received that day—I did not receive the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the balance of the 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there is no entry on the 5th or 6th October—there is no entry of Guy, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the 23rd October there is "Guy, Oxford Street, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," but no entry of 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the prisoner's tra<lb></lb>veller's book, and is in his writing—on the 23rd September there is "Little<lb></lb>wood,</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I have heard that the prisoner came to Messrs. Wilson's with a fourteen years' character—I have nothing at all to do with the ledger—I have never been away ill of late years—there was a suspicion that Snell committed suicide—we had all placed the greatest con<lb></lb>fidence in him—I went through a statement the prisoner submitted to me—in the course of those enquiries which we made, we ascertained that many of the amounts he alleged he had paid to Snell, had never been entered in the books—he did not show me from his traveller's books that he had that day paid the money—he simply stated the fact that he had paid Snell certain moneys which did not appear in the ledger, and not in any book—we found Snell had falsified the ledger accounts in the case of Littlewood, and the two cases of Guy—Snell would prepare the accounts that were sent to the customers—this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Snell's writings—the casting originally was 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and something, and it has been altered to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I remember Tovey telling me that there had been a mistake made by Snell, and that he had gone back and got an extra sovereign—there were two occasions, one the prisoner told me he had made a mistake, and one Snell had made—when I went through the accounts with the prisoner he was anxious in every way to make a full investigation and showed his desire to do so—I had a con<lb></lb>versation with him the day before he left—I do not think young Mr. Wilson was present—it was about his difficulties, and I told him they were going to take him into custody, and I very likely suggested that he should stop away—he told me he had paid moneys over to Snell, because Snell said there was a mistake in the accounts in the ledger, and that Snell would rectify the mistakes—I knew about this time there were frequent mistakes in the accounts sent in by Snell—there were complaints made at the office, as to the inaccuracy of Snell's accounts.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I went over the books with the prisoner, about a week or so after Snell's death—he said he had paid money to Snell, which Snell had not entered—he told me Snell would look over his list when he came back, and would tell him that he must not pay that sum in because there was a mistake in it, and that he would make it right—the day before the prisoner left he told me Mr. Wilson had called him into the counting-house and told him the charges, and had given him till the next morning to meet them—he said "If you were in my position would you go or stop?"—I said "Go"—he could give no explanation why he had not entered the sums in his own book.</p>

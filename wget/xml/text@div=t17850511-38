               <p>Prisoner. When this last witness took me out of the house, all the people said I was not the man, and he let me go directly.</p>

I said what man; why, says he, the thief; come with me; so when we came out, the people said that is not the man. I know nothing of the matter, I am very innocent.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Nothing was found about me.</p>

I came to London to try to get better work; I went to seek for a relation, who I thought would recommend me.</p>

On the 18th of October, about twelve o'clock in the day, I heard an alarm, and found the prisoner in charge with the property, which he had taken from a bedroom up two pair of stairs, where we sleep. The prisoner had no business there - He took them out of a trunk.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Banks. I was in the warehouse, and saw the prisoner in the yard, the people told me to stop him, which I did - He was running about the yard - I brought him back, and gave him in charge. I do not know what parish the house is in. He had some clothes and a waistcoat when the officer took him-the rest of the things were in two bundles, which he dropped in the yard.</p>
               <p>GEORGE READ. I am an officer. On the 18th of October, about twelve o'clock, Mr. Banks sent for me; I found the prisoner in the yard with a large bundle, tied up. I found two shirts, two waistcoats, and a coat on his body, and several things between his shirt and his skin; and a great many things stuffed in his trowsers. When I took the prisoner, he said he committed the robbery to get some<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181710290021"></xptr>money to take him to his own country. I believe it is not Mr. Banks's dwelling-house.</p>

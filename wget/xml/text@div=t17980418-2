             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I went, on the 3d of March, to Newgate, along with Mr. Winter, the solicitor of the Bank, to search a man of the name of Welchman. After searching Welchman, while Mr. Winter was in Mr. Kirby's apartments, Stinson was brought into the room; I immediately asked him what he had got about him; I searched him, and out of one pocket I took this parcel of round blanks of brass, and Townsend, at the same time, took these silver plates out of the other pocket; I then returned the silver and the parcel of brass upon the table, and Stinson put it into his pocket again.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. On Saturday, the 3d of March, I went, in company with Sayers and Mr. Winter, to Newgate, to search the apartments of Welchman there; in the mean time the prisoner at the bar was brought in by Mr. Kirby and Pitt into the front parlour to us; he was searched in my presence, and the things, which Sayers has produced, were taken from him and were given to him again. We took the prisoner, in company with Mrs. Welchman, in a coach, to Bow-street; we left Mrs. Welchman in custody, and then proceeded to the prisoner, Stinson's house, at Sommers-Town; we did not know where Stinson lived, but he took us there himself. When we came there, we went in with the prisoner, he opened a parlour door, where there was kept as a shop, a quantity of stockings and hosiery; then I asked him for the keys of the bureaus, which he gave me; I then opened the bureau drawers, and proceeded to search; and in the front parlour, the articles I shall now produce, I found in the various drawers of that bureau, which keys the prisoner gave to me. (Produces a large quantity of sixpences and shillings, some in a state of perfection, and others in all stages).</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are some of them so perfect as to be fit for circulation? - A. There are a great quantity of them finished. We then proceeded to search the bureau in the back room, where, also, the drawers were full of money finished and unfinished.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In what state were the prisoner's hands, were they clean? - A. I really did not look.</p>
               <p>Q. He was not in a working dress, but was clean? - A.Certainly.</p>
               <p>PATRICK MACMANUS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. I went down into the kitchen first; I afterwards went up stairs, and found the door of the two pair of stairs locked; I returned down to Stinson, and asked him for the key, and he directed me to his wife; I asked the wife, and she said it had been lost for some time; I told her, if you do not find the key, I must break the door open; she said, you may.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180006"></xptr>Mr. Knapp. Q. Was he present at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then we must not hear it. - A. I went up stairs and broke the door open; but I first went into the kitchen, and there I saw a cutting-out press in a chest, and behind the chest I found the block, that it had used to be fixed in, made use of as a dresser, or shelf; in a place like a dust-hole, in the kitchen, I found some cecil, (produces it). I then went up stairs, and forced the door open up two pair of stairs, and there was a large press, with a sort of a wheel that they use in rounding the edges of the money close beside it, both fixed to the floor, and the floor, except where these two articles where fixed, was covered all over with straw, and hay, and litter, three or four inches deep. Then Carpmeal and Townsend, and Stinson himself, gave us a hand in taking down the things, and putting them in a cart; we conveyed them to Bow-street, and they are here in the same state in which we found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Do you happen to know whose room this was, to whom it was let? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it was let, do not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The room that was locked up, did he not say it had been shut up for six months? - A. He said it had been a long time, but he directed me to Mrs. Stinson for the key.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great deal of litter about, not as if it had been recently used? - A. That was to drown the noise of working.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any furnace? - A. No; there was a fire-place in the two pair of stairs, with bricks and bars.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Are you sufficiently conversant in these matters to know, of your own knowledge, that these things would produce that appearance; or is it only from the information of others? - A. From my own knowledge; from my own practice. (Produces a large quantity of half-crowns in an unfinished state).</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. (To Carpmeal.) Q. There was no appearance upon his hands of having been at work? - A. No; they can take it off in two minutes.</p>

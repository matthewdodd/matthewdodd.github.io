                  </hi>. I am deputy at a lodging-house, 34, Milne Street, where the prisoner and the deceased lodged—on Saturday, 2nd August, a dispute arose between them—the deceased got hold of the prisoner, and threw her on the floor, and punched her—they got up, and had their hands in each other's hair—some of the lodgers in the kitchen separated them, and they went at it again—the prisoner struck the deceased, who fell, striking her head against the side of the stool, and broke her neck, dying directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Holloway—I lived then at 34, Milne Street—I heard the two women quarrelling about something that was thought to be lost by the person who does the cleaning there, and the prisoner had had a little to drink, and commenced arguing upstairs with Ann Richards—the latter came down into the kitchen saying when she came down "I cannot stay in my room, as that person intends to quarrel"—the prisoner came into the kitchen, and began to quarrel again, and Richards said the prisoner had had a drop to drink she said "If I have, I don't keep a fancy man"—Richards said "Nor do I," and something passed, but what I don't know, and Richards got up to strike the prisoner—the prisoner got up as quick as Richards, and they struggled in the middle of the kitchen and fell together, and some one called out "Don't hit the woman when she is down"—they got up, and Richards stood in the middle of the kitchen—she didn't then attempt to return the prisoner's blow, but the prisoner hit her again in retaliation, took her hair, which she wore long down her back, threw her down, and fell on top of her—Richards's head must have struck the stool—I un<lb></lb>loosed the prisoner's hands out of Richards's hair—I then said "Ann it in a fit," as she commenced to struggle—we carried her into the yard, and the doctor pronounced her dead.</p>

I live in Bloomsbury—I was sent for about 8 p.m., and saw the deceased lying in the yard quite dead—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination, and found two abrasions on the face, and bruises as well—the neck was, in plain English, broken, which was the cause of death—a fall against a stool accelerated by a push would dislocate a neck.</p>

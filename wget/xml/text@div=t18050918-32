             is bleeding! I saw Mrs. Ryan with the poker in her hand; I catched Ryan by the arm, and wrenched the poker from her; I went between them and lifted them both up; they scuffled together, and went towards the door; Ryan took hold of a quart bottle and went behind the door and swore she would be the death of her.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bottle; did you take it out of her hands? - A. No, another woman took it out of her hands; I took hold of the deceased, turned her out at the door, and put her in her own apartment, and Ryan went down stairs with the child in her arms.</p>
               <p>Q. The deceased was well enough to go up stairs? - A. Yes, she was, and she came down stairs, and pushed the door open to go after Ryan: I washed the deceased, and cut the hair from the wound, and put her to bed. The next morning she went to work as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did she die? - A. In about six weeks afterwards all but one day.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she between the scuffling-time and the time of her death? - A. She complained about her head: I did not take particular notice of her, because she came home rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times had she been in liquor between the time of the scuffle and the time of her death? - A. I cannot tell; I saw her once or twice.</p>

               <p>Q. She used to drink a good deal, I understand? - A. She got drunk once or twice after, I understand.</p>
               <p>Q. They were both of them very drunk when they set to at first? - A. They were.</p>

             sworn. - I am surgeon to St. Bartholomew's hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you inspect this woman at the time of her death? - A. I did; I opened the head; I found an abscess on the left side of the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the occasion of her death? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that owing to the blow? - A. I firmly believe so.</p>
               <p>Q. Her getting drunk afterwards might contribute to it? - A. I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It is impossible for you to say, from the distance of time, that she died merely from the blows? - A. No, it is not impossible, because the wound had not healed when she was brought into the hospital, and it evidently appeared there was mischief done to the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a person got intoxicated, might not that contribute to it? - A. It might, or it might not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. That woman there I asked to take the deceased from my throat, which she did, and turned the deceased out of the room, and she said she would have no murder done in her room. I came down stairs after that, and she followed me down and met me in the passage: there is a woman can prove that she told me to put my child out of my arms: I said no: I was going to scour pots at a gentleman's house, I was afraid something would happen to me; I did not wish to have any more to do with her.</p>

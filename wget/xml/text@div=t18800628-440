                  </hi>.I am the wife of Edwaril Phillips, of 9, Leyton Road, Stratford, Essex, newsagent—he is blind, and I conduct the business, and send out the accounts, and sign the receipts—for some time previously to December last we supplied the Stratford Great Eastern Mechanics Institution with newspapers and periodicals—I sent in this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) about December to the prisoner, who was the secretary; it is in the handwriting of my husband's brother—it is not my signature—there is no date to it—I put dates—this account, dated 14th July, 1879, is my signature—it has a date to it—I have never received this 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not often seen the prisoner write—I cannot say whether this account of the 1st August is his writing.</p>

I am a clerk in the employ of the Great Eastern Railway Company—in April last I audited the books of the Great Eastern Railway Institute—I produce the minute book which is kept by the secretary, whose duty it is to keep all the books, and to enter the receipts in the receipt book, and the money paid in the cash-book—this minute of the 15th December, 1879, is in the prisoner's handwriting, to the best of my belief—I have frequently seen him write—the minute authorises the payment of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Phillips—I produce the cash-book kept by the prisoner, and in December I find "Newspapers, Phillips, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." in the prisoner's handwriting—this cash-book is posted up, and this bill is numbered with a corresponding voucher-book—I produce the voucher-book—this signature, "E. Phillips 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>" is, to the best of my belief, the prisoner's handwriting—we have worked in the same office—I produce the record of the meeting of the investigation committee which is in the prisoner's handwriting'—the investigation was held in consequence of irregularities in the accounts, under the head of "Phillips 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—there is an answer in the hand<lb></lb>writing of the prisoner—"Denial on both sides as to irregularities does not elucidate matters; the only thing I can see is for me to pay the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and hand the vouchers to the Institution"—I produce a letter written to the committee on 27th April, 1880 by the prisoner.

             sworn. - I lived at No. 21, Clare-street, Clare-market, at the time I lost my locket.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in any business? - A. I am not; I am a single woman: on Sunday, the 10th of June last, the watch was upon the cry of half-past ten, I was near the <placeName id="t18040704-6-crimeloc32">New Church, in the Strand</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who were they? - A. The prisoner was one; they met me, and the prisoner accosted me; I had never seen him before; the prisoner tried to tear the locket from my neck; it was fastened by a ribbon; he tried to pull it off but he could not; then he struck me on the face and on the breast; he tore my handkerchief off my neck, knocked me down, and tore my locket from me; I called out watch, and kept hold of him; he said, if I insisted on holding him he would murder me; then the watch came up, and took him out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the locket go from you? - A. Yes, entirely, and he threw it away at the watch-house door; a gentleman came up and said he saw him do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this locket? - A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180407040008"></xptr>gave 25 s. for it; I bought it of a pawnbroker; it was a gold locket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say you do not carry on any business, what have you done for a livelihood? - A. I have lived with a gentleman these three months.</p>
               <p>Q. You describe the prisoner to be one of the men who came up to you without any assault? - A. They did, and then knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. In the way you describe you never had said a word to him; nor ever took hold of his hand at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not kiss you, I dare say; nor you him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live now? - A. No. 50, in Wardour-street, Soho; the other two men walked off; they both left me, and he was the only person that stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. You never said a word to him? - A. Upon my oath I never spoke a word to him, nor he to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Your name is Brown, is it not? - A. No; my name is 
               <persName id="t18040704-6-person94">Mary-Ann Cox</persName>
            .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what you have charged this man with? - A. Yes, with robbing me, and striking me three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know there is 40 l. if you convict him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor ever heard it? - A. I have heard, but do not know what it is.</p>

             sworn. - I am collecting-clerk to Messrs. Hookham and Eamer's circulating-library, in Bond-street; I was going along the Strand, at twelve o'clock at night, as near as I can recollect; I heard a rattle spring, and as I went along, I met a young man and woman, which I believe to be the prisoner at the bar and the prosecutrix, along with two watchmen; they were taking them both to the watch-house; being very near the watch-house, curiosity led me to the door, seeing the woman; I observed something thrown at the door, at the time they were going in; I told the last watchman to bring a light, which he did, and I went out and picked up this locket; I produce it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. So, Bacon, they were both taken to the watch-house, both the young man and the woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who this locket fell from, therefore, whether it fell from the woman or the man you do not know? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know her? you had not seen her before? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Not to your knowledge; there are a great many there to be sure.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: I had this woman and the prisoner in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the woman into custody? - A. The woman gave charge to me of the man, and likewise it was my duty to take them that gave the charge; I took them both together, at half-past eleven o'clock; I left my box, and went down the Strand from St. Clement's church; they were standing in Surry-street, and she was holding him by the neck; I asked her what was the matter, and she gave charge of this man to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came to the watch-house, how were her clothes? - A. They seemed to be very well; I heard her complain a little of the bruises on her breast, while I was there; I was soon sent out on my duty.</p>
               <p>Q. Was her handkerchief torn? - A. No; it was very well.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. About half-past eleven o'clock on Sunday night, as I was coming down the Strand, by Somerset-house, this woman came up to me, and asked me if I would give her something to drink; I said no and went on; there were three or four people coming on; I saw one cross the road, and run away; I came back; she told me she had lost her locket; I told her to call the watch, and she called the watch, and they found the locket in the road, and they took me to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

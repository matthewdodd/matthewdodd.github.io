On the 27th of June he was sent out with some beer; there were fourteen firkins, but I cannot tell how many casks - I had no customer of the name of Parker, to my knowledge, he never gave me any account of any money received from a Mrs. Parker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ANDREWS. Q. Did you, with your own hand, measure the fourteen firkins of beer he took out? A. No; it was the duty of my clerk to do it; it is my clerk's business to count the casks, and when he returns, he gives an account of it - I took him before the Justice, about this 5s. 6d., without asking him about the matter; but this 5s. 6d. was not the only ground of complaint I had against him - I had received a letter before I went to the Magistrate.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Haddon. I remember the prisoner going out on the 27th of June; I can tell by the book what beer he took out - it is put down every morning, and he signs it, and gives an account when he returns. On that day he took out twenty-five casks of different dimensions, containing beer and ale; there was some of it be-spoke; he brought back an account at night - but there was a deficiency of nine gallons of table ale - he did not account for any thing delivered to Mrs. Parker, her name is not mentioned, she had never been a customer of ours.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You take an account when he goes out and when he comes in? A. Yes; it was not till a letter came from Mrs. Paker that we found there was some deficiency - he was authorized to sell beer to any body, if he brought the money; but he gave no account of this.</p>
               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. He accounted for the whole of the casks, but did he account for all the money? A. No, there was a deficiency of 5s. 6d.; it was a nine gallon cask of table-ale; which I afterwards saw at Mrs. Parker's - he accounted for all but that - he had accounted for the casks sent out, so that it was a deficiency, in the value of the beer, of 5s. 6d.; I did not discover this till the letter came a fortnight afterwards.</p>

            . I live at Hackney. On the 27th of June I purchased, of the prisoner, a nine gallon cask of beer, for which I paid him 5s. 6d. in silver - I believe it was five shillings and a sixpence; there were some shillings - this is the receipt he gave me (read) - I had never before bought any beer of Mr. Haddon or of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you certain you did not give him a piece of gold, and receive the change? A. Yes; we were out of beer; my servant saw him, and we bought of him; I heard him tell the Magistrate it must have arisen from mistake my being an accidental customer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had fifty or sixty customers to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182609140141"></xptr>serve in a day, and this must have been put down to an old customer by mistake.</p>

            . Q. Was it customary for him to take down in writing the casks he sold? A. Yes; he had a book for that purpose, and I have it here; this is his writing - this is the money he received, but here is none to Mrs. Parker - it was customary with him to enter it at the time he received it.</p>

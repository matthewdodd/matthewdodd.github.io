                  </hi>. I live in Tryon's-place. Hackney. On Saturday night, the 14th of November, about half-past six o'clock, I was going along Bishopsgate-street, and nearly opposite the Flower Pot public-house, I felt the tail of my coat drop down—I turned round, and saw Mr. Barton picking up a handkerchief—I saw the prisoner there—he began to run—I ran after him, and overtook him, after chasing him, and took him to the station-house—my handkerchief is marked, "S. B. S," which are my fa<lb></lb>ther's initials—I was with Mr. Harley.</p>

                  </hi>. On the night in question, I was coming out of my door. in Bishopagate-street, and saw the prosecutor walking with another gentleman—I saw a lad lift up the tail of his coat, and take out a handkerchief, which he threw on the ground, behind him, into a door-way—I picked it up, and told the prosecutor that was the lad who took his handkerchief—he immediately ran away—he had thrown it about two yards from him, before he was charged with taking it—I have not a doubt of the prisoner's person.</p>
               <p>—I am a policeman. I have the handkerchief—I met the prose<lb></lb>cutor with the prisoner in his custody—I took him in charge, and to the station-house—the handkerchief was given to me by Mr. Barton.</p>

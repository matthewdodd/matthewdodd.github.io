                  </hi>. I live in Mount-Zion, Tunbridge Wells, in Kent. On the 17th of November, between seven and eight o'clock at night, I was in the Lower-road, Rotherhithe—I was intoxicated at the time—I had been drinking the whole day, and was going down to Woolwich—I found myself in the prisoners' company—I have a recollection of that, but how I got into their company I do not know—I went into some public-houses with them—I have a strong knowledge of Bush—the last house we were in was Dawson's, Lower-road, Deptford—I had a pint of beer, and came out—Bush had hold of my arm—Clarke was on before me, and he said to me, "Come along, do not stop so long behind"—Bush said, "Now, you b—, I will do for you," and that is all I can recol<lb></lb>lect; but I believe Clarke is an innocent man, because he wished to have nothing to do with it—I did not hear him say so—Bush knocked me down—I was in a state of insensibility—I do not know that Clarke did not come up—I received a blow on my forehead, and in my ribs, and on my face—I was sober enough to know that it was Bush knocked me down—I had hold of his arm—before I went to the first public-house with them, I had some silver, but to what amount I do not know—I had no gold.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you not sworn you had many sovereigns in your purse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Being intoxicated, I was not in a state to declare any thing—I had only silver—if I ever said I had eighteen or nineteen sovereigns, it is not true—I had not a silver watch—I do not know what I had, that is the truth—this "E. Delves," to this deposition, is my handwriting—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect whether it was read over to me before I signed it—I went before the magistrate on Tuesday; this happened on Monday evening—I had quite lost my blood, and was not in a fit state to be examined.</p>

On the night of the 17th of November, I was on duty in Lower-road, Deptford, and in consequence of information, I remained at the bottom of Grove-lane, Lower-road—I saw the prisoners coming up Grove-lane, arm in arm—I went and stopped them, and told them I believed they were the two men I wanted, as a high<lb></lb>way robbery had been committed by two marines, and I should stop them on suspicion—Clarke said, "You have got the right two"—I took them into custody—my fellow-constable came up and took Clarke—I took Bush—I searched him, and found in his watch fob 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

I was on duty in Russell-street, Rotherhithe, in the evening, and about ten minutes to ten o'clock I saw both the prisoners coming along out of York-street, going towards Deptford Barracks—Bush asked me the way to the barracks—I directed him the way—he went a few paces, then came back, and asked me if I would</p>

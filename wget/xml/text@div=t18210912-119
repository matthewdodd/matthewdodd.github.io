            . I was going down Charles-street, calling for pots at No. 10, and saw the prisoner take a quart pot from No. 6, off the step of the private door, he was walking away quite fast with it; I called Stop thief! he then put it down at No. 5, and ran down the street, and Wilkin's man stopped him - the officer picked up the pot.</p>

            . I am an officer. About nine o'clock in the morning, I heard the cry of Stop thief! ran out and picked the pot up at No. 5, and saw them taking the prisoner to the watch-house - he denied taking it - we took him back to the place, a lady said, in his presence, that he was the man who dropped it; he then said he only took it to get a drink of water - there was no pump near.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Thomas Fardell, a batcher, of High-street, Poplar—the prisoners were his carmen, it was their duty to convey fat occasionally from the shop to Brown and Pattishals, tallow-chandlers, in Fenchurch-street—on 16th Oct. Waller had to convey some fat in a basket, but he had to call at the wharf first—it was his duty to accompany the van to the tallow-chandlers—Wilson was not employed to convey fat that day—he was sent with a van with other goods—I do not know that from my own knowledge, but from books, I have no memorandums here—both the prisoners were employed to accompany the van—I have seen gome fat produced by the policeman—I had a piece from the tallow-chandlers to identify another part—this piece I can identify, it was cut off the side of the mutton, instead of the quarter—this piece ought to have gone to the tallow-chandlers in the course of business—I did not see that fat in the pri<lb></lb>soners' possession—here is no mark on it.</p>

On 16th Oct., between one and two o'clock in the morning, I was on duty with Hudson in High-street, Poplar—I noticed the prisoners—they crossed to the opposite side of the road—they were in conversation—I sent Hudson after them—I heard an altercation between Hudson and Wilson—I went over to see what it was, Wilson had got a nose-bag over his shoulder—I asked what he had got—he said some books belonging to the Steam Navigation Company—Waller stood by—I took the bag off his shoulder, and took two books out of it—I turned my light on, and found that the bag contained mutton fat—I said, "I suppose this came from the Scotch boat?"—he said, "No, it came from the shop"—I told him I should take him to the station, and I ordered Hudson to bring Waller—about twenty yards before we got to the station, Wilson begged me earnestly not to take him—he said it was only a little bit he had token out for his own use; and when at the station, he said he found it loose in the van when they were putting the van up at the stable—this is the bag—it had this fat in it and some other fat.</p>

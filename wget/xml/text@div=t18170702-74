On the night of the 14th of June, I had some pistols in my workshop, two of them were marked BASS on the back of the barrel; I had also several of my own; I locked the counting-house at half-past ten o'clock, and went to bed at eleven; there is a door which leads into a court; I was not disturbed myself, but between five or six o'clock in the morning, my servant called me, I found two squares of glass cut out of the window, and the cross bar taken off, so that a man could get through, I tried to open the counting-house-door but could not, the lock had been strained and hung on the bolt; I put my porter through the hole and he let me in, I found the lock wrenched off, and the handle laid on the counter; I missed twelve pistols which I had locked up in my desk, and the counting-house strewed over with papers; my name was on most of the pistols; two of them had the name of BASS on them; I saw them at the office on the 18th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. When I was first alarmed, it was broad day-light; the window that was broken is an inner one.</p>

On the night of the 14th of June, between twelve and one o'clock, I heard the noise of glass breaking; I went to bed at eleven o'clock, and had been in bed about an hour; I am certain I did not go to sleep before I heard the noise; I also heard a sawing, which continued about ten minutes,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181707020034"></xptr>and then a violent crush; it seemed to proceed from the counting-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am certain I had not been asleep; it was quite dark.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FRANCIS. I am porter to Mr. Baker; I left the house about nine o'clock, on the 14th of June; the door which leads from the work-shop was safe; I went out at the front-door; between four and five o'clock the next morning, I was called up, and went to the work-shop door that leads into the court, and found it half open; I went in and found the counting-house windows were all cut open; I called my master, he came down and went with me to the counting-house.</p>

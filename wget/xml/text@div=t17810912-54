On the 20th of August, between three and four in the afternoon, my wife called me down stairs, and said we had been robbed. I pursued the prisoner, and just as I turned the corner of the next street, about thirty yards from my shop, I saw her drop a piece of cheque linen: I had seen the linen in the shop in the morning: I brought her back to my shop, and a young man picked up the piece of linen.</p>

               <p>On the 20th of last month, I was looking out of a window, opposite the prosecutor's. I saw the prisoner go into his shop, and presently after, come out with a piece of cheque: I went over, and told Mrs. Gordelier of it, and pursued the prisoner. I saw her drop the cheque: I picked it up. Mr. Gordelier, who was behind me, laid hold of the prisoner, and brought her back.</p>

               <p>The last witness came in, and asked if I had lost any thing: I turned round, and said I had lost a piece of cheque: I had left it on the counter.</p>

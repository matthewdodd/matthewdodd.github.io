               <p>Who was at the expence of this prosecution? - I hope the Court will be at the expence, or else I shall be wrong.</p>
               <p>Who pays counsel and attorney, now, Mr. Smith, upon your oath? - I have not paid them at present, but I may do.</p>
               <p>Does not Mr. Thorne lend the money? - I suppose it is not material, I have not paid it; I suppose Mr. Thorne will pay it.</p>
               <p>Did not Mr. Thorne write to you to come up about it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not he write to you that he would be at the expence of your coming up? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Have you got his letter? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did not Mr. Thorne advance the money to prosecute this man? - I understood that he would pay, he knew that I was not capable.</p>

               <p>You understand the question perfectly well; is not Thorne at the whole expences of this prosecution? - I have been at some expences myself.</p>
               <p>Has not he paid both counsel and attorney? - Yes, I suppose he has.</p>
               <p>Do not you know, is not there a dispute between Thorne and this man? - I do not know of any dispute, except that he found out this coat.</p>
               <p>Did you never hear Thorne say this man had an information against him? - No.</p>
               <p>And that he would hang him if he could? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>How came you not to come up before? - I could not come before I heard any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Then the first news was a letter from Thorne? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And he wrote you word, that if you would come up, he would pay the expences? - Yes, he did, or it would have been badly worth fetching, though it cost me eighteen shillings; I had not worn it a great deal, perhaps six or eight days, or a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You came to do your duty to the public to prosecute? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you thought it would have been a very bad thing, unless Thorn would pay your expences? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Had you seen such a thing at any time? - I went into the stable on the 18th of August, on the Sunday morning, and I saw a great coat rolled up in the stable, it was a brown great coat; I asked the prisoner if he knew whose it was, and his answer was, it belonged to himself.</p>
               <p>Have you seen such a great coat? - I have seen that many times since; I have seen the coat which Smith says is his, I believe that to be the coat that I found under the manger; this was the stable that the prisoner had business in, but not the same stable that the countryman's horses were in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you take out the great coat? - No, I did not meddle with it, it was rolled up.</p>
               <p>You could not tell whether it was a loose or a tight coat? - No.</p>
               <p>Has not that great coat been worn by every servant in the inn? - Only by the prisoner; he wore it publicly of cold mornings and evenings.</p>
               <p>I believe he laid an information against your master? - Yes.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was a servant of mine; I remember Smith the waggoner coming to my house the 27th of August, I remember his enquiring about a great coat, I know Smith asked the prisoner in my presence, and I likewise asked him, and he said he had not seen it.</p>
               <p>You went down to Worksop about this business? - I did about three weeks ago, I cannot speak exactly to the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178602220180"></xptr>What induced you to go down? - I will give you my reason for it; the yard I lived in has been repeatedly robbed, and other yards had been robbed; these two men, Carter and the prisoner, had quarrelled about a robbery before, and I thought it my duty to take them into custody; I did not think about going, but the Justice said the waggoner must be produced; I went down after the prisoner was committed.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner given some information against you for penalties? - There was a report so.</p>
               <p>Did you encourage this prosecution out of spite and malice towards him? - Upon my oath, I have no kind of malice against him, neither do I know he is the man that did lay these informations; I should rather have dropped the prosecution.</p>
               <p>When you went down, did you give any particular description of this coat to the man? - I never saw it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Your love of public justice induced you to take a rice down there? - Nothing more than that, and wishing to be secure.</p>
               <p>Your love of public justice induced you to lay down the money for this prosecution? - I am not at the expence of this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Who has paid the counsel and attorney? - The money came out of my pocket; this man is a man that does not carry a great sum of money about him, and he is a stranger to law. I would lend the man money.</p>
               <p>You advanced the money, did not you? - I did, Sir; I advanced it upon the credit of Mr. Smith, I offered to pay his carriage to town, because he was not willing to lay out the money, I advanced it upon this credit, and this only, it was from the Justice's telling him when the man was committed, he was very loth to be bound over to prosecute, and the Justice informed him, and his clerk likewise, that if he prosecuted, the Court would pay his expences.</p>
               <p>The Justice could not tell you that, before you paid the carriage? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Have not there been a few informations against you for running your chaises? - No.</p>
               <p>What was it for, then? - For filling up a ticket for twelve miles instead of thirteen.</p>
               <p>You have declared, upon your oath, that you would be revenged of this man? - Never before this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Did you ever declare you would be revenged of him? - Never, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I do.</p>
               <p>Have not you declared you would sell your best chaise and horses to be revenged of this man? - Never, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you never did? - I will swear I never did.</p>
               <p>Do you know a woman of the name of Curl? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Did you never declare, in her presence, that rather than not be revenged on that man, you would sell your best chaise and horses? - Never, that I know of; she is beneath my notice.</p>
               <p>Did you never declare you would be revenged of him? - Never before the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Did you ever declare so at all? - I never made use of the expression, nor a word to that purpose.</p>
               <p>What could induce you to go to Worksop, if not out of revenge? - It was not; I did not know Smith the prosecutor till he came up that day.</p>
               <p>Who has supported that man since he came to town? - He lived at our house all the time, except when he has been out any where.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Taylor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Wing? - Yes; he keeps a public house in our neighbourhood, and Taylor drives a postchaise.</p>

               <p>I am a post-boy; I know the George in Drury-lane, I do not know the great coat; I was left to take care of this man's business while he was gone, he was absent three days the last Egham races, I do not know when they began; when he went out of the yard, he desired me to take care of his things, and there was a great coat in the stables, and he desired me to take care of it, for if Carter got hold of it, he would pawn it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long had you known him before Egham races? - I lived fellow-servant with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. What is his character? - A very good character as ever I heard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you know him when he lived at Dartford? - Yes; I came away before him, I do not know why he left it, upon my oath; I know no further about him.</p>
               <p>How many days had you been at the George, before you went to Egham races? - Backwards and forwards a few days.</p>
               <p>Have you seen that coat before? - Never; he desired me to take care that Carter should not take it to pawn it; it was under one of the mangers, I never looked to see what sort of coat it was.</p>

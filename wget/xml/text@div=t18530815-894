                  </hi>. I am a provision merchant, and live at Holloway. On Saturday evening, 13th August, between 5 and 6 o'clock, I was outside my shop, and saw the prisoner pass—he stopped at the Pied Bull public house, which is two doors from my house—I saw the deceased Moss pass intoxicated—I saw him and the prisoner together—I did not hear anything pass between them; he came up to the prisoner, and a fight ensued; that was the first thing I saw—Moss fell, he got up again, and they had a second and third round; at the end of the third round the prisoner knocked Moss down; at least it was more a scuffle than anything else, a wrestling—Moss fell against the door-post of the Pied Bull, and fell senseless—I did not see what part of him struck the door-post; I heard the sound of something striking against the post, and I saw his head lying against the door-post—he was carried away by two men—I knew him by seeing him backwards and forwards—I knew by his walk that he was intoxicated.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On Saturday morning, 13th Aug., I was called to see the deceased, at No. 16, Brandt-street; he was lying insensible and motionless on the floor; he died in about three quarters of an hour—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—there was a very extensive fracture at the back part of the skull, producing extravasation of blood at the base of the brain, that was the immediate cause of death—I do not think a violent blow with a fist would cause that; falling violently against a post would be likely to produce it.</p>

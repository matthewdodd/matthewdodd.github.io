                  </hi>, Esq. I live in Millfield-lane, Highgate—on the night of the 14th of January I examined my house before going to bed—it was about half-past twelve—the house was secured in the regular way—the windows were fastened, all the doors were looked and bolted on the inside—about half past three in the morning I heard ray front-door bell ring and heard cries of "Police"—I hastened up and called my sons and we went down to give assistance—I found that the dressing-room had been entered by the window, the dining-room ransacked and a quantity of things removed—a cash-box had been broken open and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver taken from it—a clock had been removed from the man<lb></lb>tel-piece—I went into the garden and saw two constables with two men named Grant and Northgate in custody.</p>

On the morning of 15th January I was on duty at West-hill, Highgate with constable Clark—we were walk<lb></lb>ing through the garden of Mr. Bodkin—we found the windows on the ground-floor open—I sent Clark round to the front-door to ring the bell, and I stationed myself in front of one of the open windows—when the bell rang I heard some voices inside, say, "Go on, George, we will smash the b—s" and directly Northgate came through the window armed with a fire-shovel—he struck at me—directly after Grant came out with the tongs,</p>

               <p>he made a strike at me also—Northgate knocked me down with the fire<lb></lb>shovel—while I was lying on the ground the prisoner came out of the win<lb></lb>dow and he said, "Give it to the b——"and ran away—Clark and I secured Grant and Northgate after a desperate struggle—I did not see the prisoner again until the 2nd of March—I had not known him before the 15th of January—on 2nd of March I went to Highgate police-station—there were seven or eight people there and amongst them some constables in plain clothes—I knew the constables, but there were four others whom I did not know and the prisoner was the fifth—I pointed him out as one concerned in the burglary—he said, "I am sure you do not know men—I said I did—I knew, him more by his voice than anything else—on the night of the bur<lb></lb>glary I noticed that he had a short coat on and a high hat—he was dressed differently to what he is now.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Inspector, G.</hi>) On the morning of 2nd March, between seven and eight o'clock I went to No. 9, Collingwood-street, Cambridge-heath-road—I found the prisoner in bed in a back-room on the first<lb></lb>floor—I was in plain clothes—I said to him, "Well, Wilson," the name I knew him by, "you are wanted for being concerned with two others who are now doing penal servitude for a burglary at Judge Bodkin's, get up and put your clothes on;" he said, "Very well"—after he was dressed I looked about the room and found this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) coat behind the door—he put on the coat which he is wearing now—I examined the coat and saw two holes in it—I said, "You have got two holes behind this, I suppose that was done in getting away"—I showed them to him and he made no reply—afterwards he said, "I have worn that coat, but not lately"—I took him to the Old-street station—when at the station he said, "I know who has done this for me, it is the soldier's old woman"—I said, "Who is the soldier's old woman," he said, "You know, the woman of one of the men that has gone away"—I knew Grant and Northgate—I believe one of them was called "Soldier"—in company with Mr. Fidge I compared the holes in this coat with the spikes on the fence—the two holes fitted on the top of the hooks—they were the same distance apart and are just such holes as would be made by those hooks—when at the station I asked the prisoner to take off his coat and waistcoat and on his arm I found two scars which corresponded with the holes in the coat—the prisoner had not a scarf on when I took him into custody—I first saw the scarf at Highgate-station on the 13th of March—I went to the prisoner and asked him to let me see the scarf—he said, "What do you want with it," and handed it to me—I told him I would take care of it—he said his sister had brought it to him in the House of Detention—I said, "It was rather cold when you came up from the House of Detention this morning, why did you not put it on"—he said, "I thought it was rather too much for you to see"—he afterwards said he could prove it was bought somewhere in Shoreditch, since he bad been in custody—he said either since he had been in custody or since the burglary, I would not be sure which—it is torn in some places.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. On the 9th of May, I was standing behind my father's counter; the tin kettle was on the threshold of the door with other things. As I was standing there, I saw Alexander, the prisoner, come to the door, and with his left hand, he took this kettle off from the threshold of the door, and turned it into his right; then I thought he would come in, and ask the price; the price was on it; instead of that, in the course of a minute or two, he went off with it. I then pursued immediately after him, laid hold of him about the distance of forty yards from my father's house, and took the kettle away from him, and took him into custody; it is my father's sole property; I only work as a journeyman to my father. I delivered the prisoner to Kennedy, the officer.</p>
               <p>- KENNEDY. I took care of the prisoner and the kettle; I searched the prisoner, and found three pennyworth of copper in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Brick-lane, and there was a man hanging up these kettles about three yards from the shop, and I went up to them, and took this down with an intent to buy it.</p>
               <p>James Saunders. It was on the threshold of the door; I put it there myself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>

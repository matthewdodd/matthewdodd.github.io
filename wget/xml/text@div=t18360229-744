                  </hi>. I am a green-grocer, and live at No. 69, Fetter-lane. I have a stable in Ely-place—it was robbed on he 13th of Fe<lb></lb>bruary—it</p>

I am in the service of Mr. Battershell. I left the stable safe between six and seven o'clock that evening—I had been to the stable with a truss of straw, and as I went back I saw the prisoner and two others in the narrow part of Ely-place, little more than eleven door from the stable—the prisoner had nothing about him that I know of—I went to my master's, in Fetter-lane, and about five minutes past seven o'clock I was told something had happened—I went to the stable again on receiv<lb></lb>ing the information, and found the stable open, the lock had been forced back, and the harness was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. On the evening of Saturday, the 13th of February, I was near Ely-place between six and seven o'clock—I saw the prisoner, and two more with him—he had some collars with him, but nothing else that I saw—the other men had the harness, the pad, the bridles, and reins—in consequence of what somebody said, I looked at them particularly, but I said nothing to them—I came back, and let my master know, they went towards Shoe-lane, all three together—my master's name is Smith.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 14th of February, about seven o'clock in he morning—he was sober enough to know what he was about—I told him what I took him for—I made him no promise or threat—he said he had as much right to carry harness in Ely-place for sale, as in any other place.</p>

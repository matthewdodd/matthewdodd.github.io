Before we came into St. Ann's Court we saw a Jew with an old hat in his hand and a blue bag, we asked him if he would sell that hat; he said, yes, and ask'd two shillings for it: He said he had got two waistcoats in his bag, and took them out. We asked him if he had any thing else; he said nothing that would suit us. We ask'd him what they were, he pull'd them out, there were shifts and shirts; he asked ten shillings for the waistcoats, Graham offered him eight: Then we ask'd what he'd have for the linnen. We thought to make use of the shirts ourselves, and make presents of the other things, he ask'd seven shillings for them, that is seventeen shillings in the whole, we offered him fifteen, so as we were short of money, and I was going to be shaved, I got Mr. Chesham to pawn the waistcoats, and I intended to fetch them out again on Monday. We went to an alehouse in Clare-market and supp'd, I asked him to lie with me that night; I had put the other things in a handkerchief in my box.</p>

I had been stationed in Kennington near two years, I was ordered to go to Whitechapel. I met the prisoner at the Green man, in Westminster, being late in the evening he said he would conduct me there and get me a decent lodging. We had something to drink at the bar, I never saw the prisoner before, we proceeded from there to Charing-cross, but we agreed to have a pint of half and half at this said public house, he paid for the beer he represented to me that my knapsack was unbuckled, it was very full of things, I pulled my knapsack off, he pretended to buckle it he then hung the straps on his arm as being a friend to me as I thought. A young man spoke to me about our regiment, I turned myself round and talked with this young man, my back was to the prisoner and in about three or four minutes I missed the prisoner and my knapsack, my knapsack contained all the things mentioned in the indictment.

If he would have brought any things forward I would have had nothing more to do with it.</p>

            Another young woman and me were coming down the Strand, the prisoner is something like the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the man at the bar and say whether that is the man that you saw come down St. Martin's-lane - A. It was dark, I spoke to him but I did not look him full in the face he is like him; I said to him the serjeant is looking for you, he said, he was looking for the serjeant; he had a knapsack on his left arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at him again and tell the truth - A. He had his back towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined before the justice - A. Yes, I then said he was the man, so far as I now can say I believe he is the man I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>MARY FEARN. I am a servant at the Green man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner and the serjeant at your house - A. Yes; I brought him a pint of beer on Monday evening, the 26th of March between six and seven o'clock; I know the prisoner he uses our house constantly.</p>
               <p>EDWARD Mc'CARDEN. On the 28th of March I was in the house with the serjeant, he ordered me if the prisoner came in the place to take him. On the 31st, I was coming by the Green man, the girl told me he was there, the landlord told me he was the man that was with the serjeant, I fetched a constable and got him apprehended.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have a witness to come forward to prove that I am innocent of the charge who can prove every hour where I was that night.</p>
               <p>MARY CRIMNER. I live at 87, Jermyn-street, St. James's. I am a servant there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the prisoner lodges - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at the time we have been speaking of lodge in the same house with him - A. Yes; No. 38, Strutton ground, near the Broadway, Westminster, he drank tea with me the same evening, he came home to his tea about seven o'clock, he remained in the house till near eight, he went out then, I believe to take a little beer, I saw him again some minutes before nine he continued in my company till ten.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the time he came home to his tea was about seven - A. We had a clock just by, I believe he came in before the clock struck; I was going to my place on the next day, I always put it down when I go to a place, I put down the 27th.</p>

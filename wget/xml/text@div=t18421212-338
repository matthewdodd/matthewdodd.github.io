                  </hi>. I live at the Somerset Arms, Queen-street, Pimlico. My waistcoat was safe in a drawer in my room at three o'clock in the after-noon of the 5th of Dec. I missed it at half-past five—the prisoner had been lodging there six or seven weeks—this is the waistcoat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker. This waistcoat was pawned to the best of my belief by the prisoner, in the evening of the 5th of Dec.—I noticed him by his particular appearance.</p>

                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my company on Monday week from a quarter to seven till eight o'clock, at the George-inn, Chiswick—I am not related to him—we had appointed to meet that evening, as we are generally together—I am a cork-cutter—I do not carry on business now—I am an omnibus conductor—I have no omnibus at present—I have a little income from my wife's family—there were other persons at the George-inn—Thomas George was one—I know Hedley—he was not there—he was at his employer's. Mr. Burford's, a publican, at Chiswick—we met him there after we left the George, which was about eight o'clock—we staid there a very few minutes—I had nothing to drink at Burford's—we called there to see Fry's brother, a musician—he was playing the violin, and there was a dance there—I did not go up into the dancing-room—we both of us saw Fry's brother, and spoke to him—Hedley was not present then—I did not see him there—I saw him going out of the door—the prisoner spoke to Hedley—they had very few words together—I did not take notice—I am sure this was on a Monday—the 6th of Dec. was Monday—I am sure of that.</p>

I saw Fry on Monday night week, a few minutes before seven o'clock—I know it was before seven, because I had to go down stairs to wait on the club—Dennis was with him—I do not know what they had—they staid till twenty minutes before eight—they stood in the passage when I saw them—there was not room to sit down—there was a large club of persons employing themselves in paying money and drinking—they were doing nothing else that I know of—the prisoner's brother was in the tap-room playing the fiddle—I am sure of that—there was some dancing there.</p>

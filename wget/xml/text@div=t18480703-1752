                  </hi>. I am surgeon at Guy's Hospital. On 24th May, John. Winter was admitted as an in-door patient—there was a wound on his fore<lb></lb>head, partly healed—it was not dangerous of itself, but his face was covered with erysipelas—he continued in the hospital till he died, on the Sunday, at four o'clock—I saw him dead.</p>

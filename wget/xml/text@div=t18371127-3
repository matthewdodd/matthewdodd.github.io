                  </hi>. I am a botcher, and live in George-row, Dock-head On the afternoon of the 10th of November the prisoner came up to me at Dock-head, and said, "If you please, is that truck to let? "I said "Yes"—he said, "I have been living with Mr. Ward, of Deptford, I have left him, I want to fetch a butcher's block away, I shall want it two hours "—he offered to pay the money first—I said, "I dare say H is <hi rend="italic">all right,</hi> you can pay when you bring it back"—he took it, and I never saw him again—he said he had taken a little house in Edward-street, close by me—I went there, but he did not live there—I had no previous acquaintance with him—I was talking to him about a quarter of an hour—him at first, but he would not take no for an answer—he said, "Did not Mr. York keep this shop!" I said "Yes"—he had a butcher's frock on, and a white apron—I apprehended him in Smithfield with another truck—the truck was worth about 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I lent him a rope with it.</p>

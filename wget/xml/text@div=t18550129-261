                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 1, Bates-buildings, Hoxton. At Christmas last, I was minding the house of my niece, Miss Swift, that is called Middleton-lodge, Dalston—the prisoner was living there as servant—on 28th Dec., there was no one in the house but me and her—about 8 or 9 o'clock that evening, she complained to me of illness; she said she had got a very bad pain all round her—I gave her a little penny-royal and gin—she then went to bed—I had not perceived before, from her personal appearance, anything indicating that she was with child—at 1 o'clock in the morning I went to her room—she was in bed—she still complained of pains in her inside, and I gave her a little more of what I had given her before; she took it—she then said she felt a little more comfortable—I then left her, and went to my bed—I did not sleep in the same room—about 6 o'clock on the same morning I went to her again; I thought perhaps she might want something, as I heard a little noise—she was then in bed—I had a light with me—I saw a lot of blood on the carpet, from the door to the bed—on seeing that, I said to the prisoner, "My God! what has been the matter?"—she said, "Don't be frightened, I am all right now"—I did not remain a great while in the room on that occasion—I told her to lie down, and I would get her some breakfast—I went down stairs into the kitchen to get her some—I opened the shutters, and found some blood on the kitchen table—there was no cloth on the table—there was quite a puddle of blood on the table—I also saw some spots of blood on the floor near the table—I got a candle, and followed the spots of blood</p>

               <p>into the coal cellar—you go through a passage from the kitchen to the cellar—it is in front of the house in the area—I went into the coal cellar, and found a bloody cloth and a pair of stockings soaked in blood—I searched the cellar—I moved a box, and behind the box I saw the body of a dead c hild, with the head downwards; it was quite naked—the box was at the left-hand side of the cellar as you go in against the wall, and the body was between the box and the wall—there was a barrel under the box; the box was on the top of the barrel, and the child was stuffed between the barrel and the wall—the box was close against the wall a top of the barrel, and a top of that was the knife board, to heighten it to the prisoner's height to clean the knives, and that was flush against the wall; it touched the wall—I did not take up the body—I immediately sent for Mr. Herring, the surgeon, who has attended the family for years—it was about 10 o'clock when I found the body—it was at 8 o'clock that I went down to get her some breakfast, but I did not find the body till 10 o'clock—I saw the blood in the kitchen when I went down at 8 o'clock, but I did not perceive it immediately—I saw the spots of blood about 8 o'clock—I began to trace the marks directly, but I was a long while finding the child—I was about two hours in tracing the blood, before I found the child in the cellar—I could not find which way to turn, the passage was dark, and I went first to the right, and then to the left, till I could find it—I had no idea of this, but still I thought there was a something wrong—I saw a knife on the kitchen table at the same time I saw the blood; the handle of it was bloody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I afterwards gave it to the policeman—the handle was more bloody than it is now, and the blade was a little bloody on the edge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 6, Newmarket-place, Dalston. I was sent for on 29th Dec., between 11 and 12 o'clock, to the house of Miss Swift, at Dalston—I saw Mrs. Scott—she showed me a table in the kitchen, upon which was a large pool of blood, about the size of a dinner plate—it was wet—I saw a knife by the side of it, similar to the one produced—it was bloody, both on the handle and blade—the blood on the knife was nearly dry—I observed spots of blood on the floor—I traced them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290030"></xptr>
               <p>from the table towards the coal house door—I went into the coal cellar—Mrs. Scott pointed out a barrel to me there, standing at the edge of a heap of coals near to the wall—behind the barrel I found the body of a new born infant male child—it was half exposed, with the head downwards, resting on the coals—I took it up and placed it on a napkin on the barrel—I ex<lb></lb>amined the child, and found that its throat had been cut—it was a large wound, extending from underneath the left ear, across the throat, dividing the blood vessels on the left side and the windpipe—supposing that wound to have been inflicted when the child was alive, it would certainly have caused its death—this knife would have caused such a wound—I afterwards went to the prisoner's room with Mrs. Scott—I found the prisoner in bed—I said to her, "This is a very sad thing, Ann; how could you do so cruel an act?"—her reply was, "Do what, Sir?"—I said, "How could you destroy the poor little creature?"—she made no answer to that—I then said to her, "Did you destroy it to prevent its crying?"—she said, "It did not cry, Sir"—I said, "Where did you do it?"—she said, "Down stairs"—I asked her if she had made any provision for the child in the shape of clothing—she said she had not—I then asked her what had become of the afterbirth—she did not seem to know what I meant—she said she had got nothing more—I then examined her, and found that the afterbirth had not been removed—of course she must have been recently delivered, because the after<lb></lb>birth had not come—I compared the end of the navel string attached to the child, and the end attached to the afterbirth, and they agreed—I have no doubt that child must have been attached to that afterbirth—the umbi<lb></lb>lical cord was cut—I should say that would enable me to compare the end better than if it had been torn—the ends decidedly corresponded—I should say from five to six hours had elapsed between the delivery and my finding the body—next day I made a complete examination of the body of the child—I should say that it must certainly have been alive at the time the wound in the throat was inflicted—in wounds made upon a living subject, the edges are always red, everted, or turned out; and there are little spots of coagu<lb></lb>lated blood from the extremities of the vessels—that would be caused by the coagulation of the blood just before death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not those appearances equally occur after death whilst the circulation continued, as it will do for a short time afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not—my opinion is, that they would not occur as soon as vitality had ceased, it must be within a very few minutes after vitality has ceased for the appearances to be such—it might take place during life, or a very short time after death—my experience will not enable me to say that—it must take place during life, or some very short time afterwards—I should say a very few minutes would be sufficient to do away with the appearances that were presented here.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CAARTEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you open the body of the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; it was the body of a full grown, mature, healthy child—the lungs were fully inflated, and of a pale pink colour, which would not have been the case had not the child breathed for some little time; the heart was almost entirely emptied of blood—I placed the lungs in water—they were perfectly crepitant or crackling under the fingers when pressed between them, showing the presence of air—every portion of them floated in water when cut—I cut them, I think, into half a dozen separate portions, and each portion perfectly floated—the inference I draw from that is, that the child must have respired some minutes at least.</p>
               <p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290031"></xptr>
               <p>I gather from you, that those appearances would be presented if the cut had been made either during life, or within some few minutes after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps they might within a few minutes after death—the test to which I subjected the lungs is that which is ordinarily called the hydrostatic test—I have read authors upon medical jurisprudence—I recognise Beck and Taylor as high authorities upon that subject—whether the hydrostatic test proves merely that a child has breathed, or been born alive, is, I believe, a <hi rend="italic">questio vexati</hi>, but I cannot suppose it possible that the lungs can be filled with air unless it be a vital act; the lungs may be inflated with air before the body of the child comes into the world, but still the child is alive—I do not believe that when the head is in the world, and the body in the vagina, respiration may go on sufficiently to inflate the lungs, I mean not to such an extent as I saw—I do not dispute that a child may breathe before the body is completely born; I have known that in my own experience, but not to such a degree as these lungs appeared to me to be inflated—I made the examination about thirty-six hours after the supposed death—I do not think the value of the hydrostatic test is enhanced by its being applied im<lb></lb>mediately after death—as soon as I saw the wound in the child's throat, my impression was that it had been born alive—I was examined before the Magistrate—I formed the opinion which I have stated here to-day the next day, after I had made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and applied the hydro<lb></lb>static test, and I had formed the same opinion before, as soon as I saw it, and the appearance the wound presented; my opinion was confirmed by the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—this is the first case of alleged infanticide in which I have been professionally concerned—I have been in practice since 1828—I have examined the bodies of a great many children soon after death, who have been prematurely born, in which the lungs have been par<lb></lb>tially inflated—I do not know whether the hydrostatic test is, in the abstract, a means by which you can determine whether or not a child has been born alive—abstractedly, I do not think it is sufficient, because if the child has not breathed with some force, the whole of the lungs would not be fully inflated—in children that I have assisted to deliver that have died within a short time, say half an hour after delivery, the lungs of which I have examined, not knowing the cause of death, I have never found the lungs so fully inflated; there has always been some large portion that would sink in water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Acquainted as you are with the authorities upon medical jurispru<lb></lb>dence, will you tell me whether or not you subscribe to this doctrine of Professor Taylor, "The hydrostatic test is no more capable of showing that a child has been born alive or dead, than it is of proving whether it has been murdered or died from natural causes?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My own experience would not lead me to believe that—I have never before been engaged professionally in an inquiry of this nature—I cannot pretend to say that the opinion founded on Dr. Taylor's experience is incorrect; I am only bound to give you the result of my own experience—as far as my experience goes, I do dissent from the doctrine there laid down—I am aware that there are other tests made use of in matters of this kind by medical jurists—there is the static test, that of weighing the lungs—I did not make use of that—there is another test, called Pluca's test, but I have never tried it—the hydrostatic test is the only one I have ever applied—(<hi rend="italic">At the suggestion of the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT, MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">read to the witness the whole of the following passage, from p. 387 of Dr. Taylor's work</hi>: "From what has already been stated, as well as from the most simple reflection upon the circumstances accompanying the birth</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290032"></xptr>
               <p>of children, I think it must be evident that the hydrostatic test is no more capable of showing that a child has been born alive or dead, than it is of proving whether it has been murdered or died from natural causes. The majority of those who have made experiments upon this subject, have only pretended to show, by the use of this and other tests, whether or not a child has breathed. They merely serve to furnish, in many cases, good proof of life from the state of the lungs; and slight reflection will render it appa<lb></lb>rent, that in no case are they susceptible of doing more.")—I do not sub<lb></lb>scribe to that doctrine—the umbilical cord had been cut—there are certain presentations in which the umbilical cord is twisted round the neck of the child <hi rend="italic">in utero</hi>—there was no ligature round either extremity of the cord—the length of the cord from the <hi rend="italic">umbilicus</hi> of the child was six or eight inches, and that of the <hi rend="italic">placenta</hi> about the same—that is about the ordinary length—where delivery is unaided by professional assistance it is likely to be longer in duration than where professional assistance is at hand—I cannot say whether respiration is then more likely to take place in the vagina—it is barely possible that a child may be more likely to breathe in the vagina; but the majority of children, even in protracted labours, do not breathe until some minutes after they are born—where a delivery is long, the pos<lb></lb>sibility of breathing in the vagina is greater than where it is short.</p>

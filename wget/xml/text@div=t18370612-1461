On the 11th of June I saw the prisoner running up Bond-street into Henrietta-street, where he threw these prints away, and ran into Gray-street, where I overtook him without losing sight of him—he asked what, he bad done, and said he had done nothing—I asked him what goods those were he had thrown away in Henrietta-street—he said he had thrown nothing away—some persons said he had stolen some prints from the prosecutor's shop, and I took him there—I am quite sure he is the person who threw them down—I did not see them taken up—the person who took them up was not bound over, and is not here.</p>

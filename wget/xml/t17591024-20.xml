I have a drawer in the counting-house, which I keep the key of myself; on the 10th of October last my master was gone out upon some business, and left money with me put up in papers. I had chang'd a Bank note of 50 l. for a gentleman. The last time I looked in the drawer was between twelve and one that night; I went to it to get a handful of silver out of a bag that I have there, to give change to a gentleman up stairs. I put the silver in my pocket, and did not make an entry in the book, doing it in a hurry; I might leave the key in the drawer for what I know.</p>

               <p>Q. What money was in the drawer at that time?</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. There were two rollo's, fifty guineas each; twenty-nine guineas, part of a rollo; a 50 l. Bank note, and a draught upon somebody in Lombard-street for 22 l. odd; I went to bed, thinking every thing safe. When I got up, my master and I went to settle accounts, as we do once a week, to strike the balance; I felt for my key, and miss'd it; I look'd at the drawer, and that was lock'd; I enquir'd for it of every servant in the house, but could not find it; the prisoner at the bar was out all that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you leave up when you went to bed?</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. I left the prisoner at the bar and

             up, they were to sit up to wait that night; I was obliged to break open the drawer, there I miss'd the twenty-nine guineas, part of a rollo; the gold was all safe; the silver, being an uncertain sum, I cannot speak to that; my master advised me to search all the servants in the house, immediately; so I call'd them all up stairs, and searched them one after another, but found nothing; the prisoner was out at that time; he had had leave the day before to go out that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he gone out before you miss'd the money?</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. He was: there was also another servant out; I never had a very bad opinion of the prisoner; but upon his being extravagant I mistrusted him more particular; I ordered the other servants not to say a word<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175910240030"></xptr> what had happened, but to keep it a secret 'till I had a farther proof, for I thought I should find it out in two or three days, by his paying some debt; on the Friday morning, my master ask'd me if I had heard of my money; I said, no; said he, I have, the prisoner at the bar has got it; he said, he was told he had paid six guineas to Mrs Clark, and he did not know how he could get it; upon this, the prisoner was charged with taking it; upon being ask'd how he came to have money to pay that six guineas; he said, he had borrowed seven guineas of one Murphy, that keeps the sign of the Coach and Horses; I went to Murphy, and ask'd him if the prisoner had borrow'd any sum of money of him within these two days; he said, no; then I desired he would go home along with me; and before I got home the the prisoner had confess'd he took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with him before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. I was: and Murphy brought eleven guineas, which he said the prisoner had left with him, and tendered it down to him; the prisoner would not take it up, but push'd it to me, and said it was part of the twenty-nine guineas that he had taken out of the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he opened the drawer?</p>
               <p>Hutchinson. Before the Justice he said he found the key in the drawer, and he took the money out, and left the key in the drawer; the Justice ask'd him, if he had stolen the twenty-nine guineas out of the drawer; he said, yes; and he own'd that the money he had paid was part of it; that was six guineas to Mrs Clark and four to Murphy; upon the whole I understood he had squander'd the rest away, or paid debts with it.</p>

               <p>Clark.

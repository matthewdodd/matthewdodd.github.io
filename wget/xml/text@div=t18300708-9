Taylor, to be in his hand-writing - when he brought me the bill he asked me if I thought I could discount it for him; I said I could say nothing about it till the return of my husband, who was then at market - he returned, and I mentioned it to him; the prisoner was not present - I saw him afterwards, and told him my husband could not give him cash for it; but he was willing, as he was so much distressed, to endeavour to get it done for him - he had told me he was likely to lose his furniture for rent; he said he should be greatly obliged to my husband if he would get it done - I had kept it in my posession, he endorsed it when he gave it to me; this, which purports to be the acceptance of Taylor, was on it when he gave it to me - I took the bill to Mr. Barnes', who gave me ten sovereigns for it; I gave the prisoner eight sovereigns and a half, and some silver - the remainder, by his wife's request and his permission, I laid out for them in stockings and things; I did not hear what amount his rent was - I told him, next morning, that I had got the money from Mr. Barnes, and gave him Barnes' address.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. J. ALLEY. Q.Are you aware that this is a capital offence? A. Yes; I remember calling at the prisoner's lodgings in Dorset-street; his wife and an old gentleman, whom I do not know, were present - he endorsed the bill on that occasion, in my presence; it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080015"></xptr>was not brought down stairs by his wife and handed to me - I received it from his own hand.</p>
               <p>Q.Can you tell me any one occasion on which you saw the prisoner write? A. Yes; he once came to our shop, made out a bill of his own, and showed it to me - I did not wish to notice what he was writing, but he showed it to me; I had lent him the pen and ink - I was near him when he endorsed the bill; his wife called on me on the Saturday morning after he had received the money, but not before; she might also have called a few days before I got it cashed - she called to say her husband had received a bill from Taylor; Barnes did not deduct any discount - I handed the money to Mather; I never said I did not receive the bill from the prisoner, but from somebody else - I was examined at Marylebone Office.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he bring the bill to you in Homer-street? A. Yes, and left it with me to consult my husband - I took it to him in Dorset-street, and told him what my husband said, and he there endorsed it; he told me Taylor was a gentleman he had been in the habit of working for for the last two or three years - the prisoner is a painter and glazier; I do not know whether he told me where Taylor lived.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS TAYLOR. I live in South Moulton-street, and am a carpenter and builder. The prisoner has done work for me; (looking at the bill) this is not accepted by me- I never gave the prisoner authority to accept for me; I first knew of its existence on the morning it became due; it was presented for payment - I knew nothing of it till about an hour before it was presented; the prisoner then called on me, and said he had taken the liberty of putting my acceptance to a bill of 10l., which would become due that day, for which he was exceedingly sorry, but he would provide me with the cash if I would have the goodness to pay it in the course of an hour; he failed to bring the money - I was from home, but believe the bill was brought between ten and eleven o'clock; I did not take it up - I left word at home that if the money was not brought for it the servant was to say I was out; the prisoner told me it would be presented by some banker's in St. James'-street, I think - I called on him the next day or a day or two after, to point out the danger of his conduct in not attending to the bill; he assured me he was using every endeavour in his power to accomplish the object of getting the money for it - he told me the bill was in Mr. Barnes hands; I have seen the prisoner write occasionally, but not above two or three times, and I have had specifications for work from him; (looking at the bill) I believe this endorsement to be the prisoner's hand-writing - I think the acceptance is similar to his, but cannot swear it is; I think it is his writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to tell your servant to say you was not at home when the bill was brought? A. I always go out about half-past nine or ten o'clock on business.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not stay in the house to tell the person who brought it that it was forged? A. I had undertaken to pay it if he brought the money - I was very angry with him, and felt hurt at his forging my name; I should have liked to have kicked him across the street for doing it if it had not been for the law - I left orders with Mrs. Taylor about the bill, not with the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not stop at home to tell the person who came that it was forged? A. I could not tell it was forged till I saw it - I have known the prisoner three or four years; I am hard run for money at times - I have frequently paid people who did work for me with bills; I think I have given the prisoner three bills - I cannot swear I have not given him more; I never kept an account of them, except on slips of paper, as they were so small; the prisoner called on me about two months before this bill became due, and asked me as a favour if I would accommodate him with my acceptance to a 10l. bill - I told him I would not do any thing of the kind; I am a little deaf.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he bring a bill with him? A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. On your oath, (being deaf,) I ask you whether the prisoner did not propose to you, about seven months ago, to allow him to use your name, and you said,"Yes, you may if the amount is small?" A. No, he called and asked me to accept a bill, which I did, and paid it when due - I never said he might use my name if the bill was small, or any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. I should be glad to know if you did not say enough from which be might understand he had your leave to put your name to the bill as acceptor? A. No, I refused him flatly - he never made another application to me; the three bills I gave him were to serve him - when I gave him the first he had done about 2l. worth of work, and wanted to draw for a few pounds, and said it would be of service to him if he might draw; I said he might, and gave him my acceptance - I cannot swear exactly how much for; I have no recollection of his calling with another person, and asking me to allow him to use my name as acceptor to a bill - I have no recollection of any such thing; I know nothing of it - I deny it as far as it is possible - I think I can swear it never happened; I positively swear it was not done - I knew who discounted the bill after it became due; I did not know Mr. Barnes before it was due, nor did I know Mr. Collins.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that the prisoner has been sued on this bill as a debt? A. I did not know it till this took place - I now know he has been sued for it; I understand the Sheriff's officer was endeavouring to arrest him for it as a debt.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. He had applied to you to accommodate him with bills, but never to allow him to use your name as acceptor? A. Yes - I accepted the small bills, because he told me the persons who discounted them would hold them till they became due; I was not in his debt at any time before the bill became due - I think it was in November that we balanced accounts; I paid him the balance in November - he gave me a stamp receipt about the middle of November; I think it was 5l. or 6l. that I paid him - this bill is dated 12th of December; I never authorized him or anybody to accept that bill in my name; I never authorized anybody to accept any bill in my name; I have a very good memory generally - it is very good in this case.</p>
               <p>JAMES BARNES. I gave Mrs. Collins cash for this bill some time in December, but I took no memorandum of the time; I gave her the full amount, as Mr. Collins was a friend<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183007080016"></xptr>of mine - I would not take the discount; it was returned to me after it was dishonoured - I applied to Mr. Taylor about it; he refused to pay it - I afterwards applied to the prisoner; he said he would settle it in the course of the day - I left him, and he called on me at various times, but did not pay the money; I have had the bill in my possession ever since till I gave it to the Magistrate; (looking at it) this is my endorsement on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear Taylor swear he did not know you, nor where to find you? A. He did not know me at the time; he must have meant to say he did not know me before it became due - that is what I understood him to swear; I did not speak to him till after it was due, nor did I see the prisoner at all till after it was dishonoured - I never entered into an engagement with him to take the amount by instalments; he promised me he would bring the money - that was after I knew it was forged; I spoke to my attorney, who advised me to sue him, which I did, and got judgment against him, but could not find him to take him till the Police-constable took him- I did not then say if he would pay me I would discharge him; I never spoke to him - I never agreed to receive any thing from him by way of payment.</p>
               <p>RICHARD COLLINS. I am Mrs. Collins' husband. I heard this bill was not paid, the prisoner came to my house the night it was due, and asked us to be so good as to put the bill off till Saturday, and it should be paid.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH AINSWORTH. I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner into custody, and told him it was for a case of felony - he said it was nothing but a debt; I said, "We will see what it is."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not go quietly with you? A. Yes; he expressed no alarm.</p>
               <p>MRS. COLLINS. When he first produced the bill he asked if I could give him cash for it - I told him I would ask my husband when he returned, that I could do nothing till he returned; he left the bill in my hands.(Bill read, see indictment.)</p>
               <p>Three witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>
               <p>GUILTY (on the 2nd Count only) Aged 25.</p>

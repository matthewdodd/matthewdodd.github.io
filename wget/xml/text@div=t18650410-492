I live at 10, Stone-street, Borough-market, and am a fitter—on Sunday morning. 2d April, I was passing along Lower Marsh, and I was knocked down by the prisoners, and kicked several times while on the ground—there was a third man whom I cannot speak to—as I was rising from the ground I was robbed of two half-crowns and a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, by Donovan—I said to him, "You scoundrel, you are not contented with knocking me about and kicking me, but you have robbed me"—he said be had not—he passed the money to Mears and made off, down a bye-street—a crowd came up, and the prisoners ran away—I went to the police-station, and gave a description of them, a few minutes after, and on the evening of the same day I was sent for to the station—I then identified the two prisoners from seven others—I was sober.</p>

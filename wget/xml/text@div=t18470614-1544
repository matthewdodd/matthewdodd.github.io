On the 31st of May I went to my drawer for a gown-piece, and missed it—I asked her about it—she denied knowing any<lb></lb>thing about it—I had her taken into custody, and on the 1sy of June I missed a shawl—her mother, Johannah Flanagan, gave up the duplicate, and the shawl was found at Mr. Russell's, the pawnbrokers—Johannah Flanagan did not come to tomy house—she had noopportunity of taking the shawl—I went to Mr. Russell's, Which is about five minutes' walk from my house; and while I was there, I saw Johannah Flanagan pass—the officer ran and stopped</p>

I received charge of Margaret Flanagan on the 31st of May, at her master's; and I saw Johannah Flanagan near Mr. Russell's shop—I got from her a duplicate of a shawl—she said that Margaret Flanagan had told her her mistress would be in want of the green shawl which was then in pawn; and she told her to get something else to get it out—Margaret Flanagan said that her mother told her to bring things home, and she had taken this shawl home, and her mother had pawned it—this is the shawl—the duplicate was given up to the pawnbroker on account of his giving up the shawl, which the Magistrate ordered me to keep.</p>

I missed some books from my front parlour in April and May - I missed a great many on the 12th of May, and got under the stairs for the purpose of watching, and saw the prisoner, whom I knew, go to the book-case, and take a book out of it - she put it under her shawl, and went back to the street-door. I told her she had stolen a book; she made no answer.</p>

            . I am a dealer in marine stores. I recollect the prisoner coming to my shop, and offering several books for sale. She said her master had given her them to dispose of as occasion required. I told her I could only give waste paper price, (3 d. per lb.) for them. She came one day with two books - one was sermons, the other a geographical book. I said they were too good to sell to me, but she would not take them away, and I bought them of her. I kept them till Mr. Galloway came and searched my house, I gave them to him.</p>

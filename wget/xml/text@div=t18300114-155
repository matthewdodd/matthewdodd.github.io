            . On the 19th of December, at half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I had occasion to leave the street door open - I did not go out of the house, but to the end of the passage: I returned in a minute, and met the prisoner at the parlour door, with my master's coat under his arm, which had been in the parlour - she ran away, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140077"></xptr>could not stop her as I had something in my hand; I ran up the street after her - she threw the coat on the rails; she did not get out of my sight - she was taken in Arling-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you servant at the house? A. Yes; I saw the coat under her arm; it had been on the counter in the parlour - my master called me to let the dustmen in; the dustmen were two doors off taking the dust from another house.</p>

             LLOYD. I live two or three doors from the prosecutor's. I saw the witness running after the prisoner - the coat was on the railings, which the prisoner had run by.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you before the Magistrate? A. Yes; I did not say I saw the coat on the ground.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHARLES RAY. I saw the prisoner running, and stopped her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was that from the prosecutor's? A.About a quarter of a mile - there were about three turnings; the witness was behind her all the way - she could not be out of her sight.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going as far as the City-road, and this young woman came and accused me - they found nothing on me; they let me go - I got half way up the street, and the man came after me and said there was a coat missing - it was near an hour before the coat was produced; I was not near the house till the servant took me there.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

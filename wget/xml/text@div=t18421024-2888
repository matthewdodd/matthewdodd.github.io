                  </hi>. I live at Harmondsworth. About five o'clock on Wed<lb></lb>nesday evening, the 12th of October, I was in my barn—I had four bushels of oats safe in a sack then—they were black oats—they were threshed, but not cleaned—there were garlic-seeds and other seeds among them—I missed the oats and sack next morning—these are the oats.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant L</hi> 28.) I received information, and went to the prisoner's stable about twelve o'clock on Saturday night, the 22nd of October—he returned from London with his cart while I was there—he is a jockey-man—I asked him if he had heard of the prosecutor losing a quantity of oats—he said he had—I asked if he had any objection to my looking into his stable—he said he had not—I asked if he had got any oats—he said he had not—I searched some time, and he came and turned a truss of hay off this sack of oats—I asked what he had got in the sack—he said mixture for his horses—I put my band in, and took a sample out—I had got a sample at the prosecutor's, and they seemed to me to be the same—I asked where he got the oats—he said, between a peck and a half bushel he got from an ostler at the Chaise and Horses at Hounslow—I asked if they were black oats—he said yes—I asked where he got the remainder—he said he bought a sack at Mr. Warne's, a corn-chandler, at Brentford—I left him in charge, and went to the ostler, and then to Mr. Warne.</p>

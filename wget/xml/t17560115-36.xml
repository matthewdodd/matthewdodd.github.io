            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner came to my house on the 10th of Dec. about 8 o'clock in the morning, and wanted a pair of shoes which he had pawned before. I went up stairs to see for them, but could not find them. I came down and told him: He said they were certainly in the house, and desired I would search further. I went up again, and when I came down he was gone. There had been nobody in my shop that morning but him and myself, this being before any of the family were up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you m iss any thing then ?</p>
               <p>Mure. No, I did not. On the 22d of Dec. he came again, about the same time in the morning. I went up stairs for what he wanted, and when I came down he was gone again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing then?</p>
               <p>Mure. No, I did not. On the 26th of the same month he and his wife came both together, before 8-o'clock in the morning. I missed nothing till the 29th, when I found some gowns were missing. I enquired among the pawnbrokers, and found one gown pledged in the woman's name. I took out a warrant from justice Wright, and carried both the prisoners before him, where the woman said she found that gown with another in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose gown was that you found?</p>
               <p>Mure. It was the property of

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Littler. It was about 3 or 4 days before last Christmas. He said, brother soldier (for we are both soldiers) have you an uncle living any where this way?</p>
               <p>Q. What did he mean by that expression?</p>
               <p>Littler. He meant a pawnbroker. I told him I did not know of any thereabouts. He said, I thought you might, being quartered at Tower-hill. I met his wife with her lap full of something, but cannot say what; she followed him at a little distance.</p>

               <p>About six or seven weeks ago I had been at Drury-Lane to buy some leather, when I saw a man much in liquor without his hat. Going a little farther, by the corner of Queen-street, where Mr. Mure lives, I went to make water, and by the side of the stones I saw a bundle and a man's hat; I went to the sign of the Crown, and asked if a man had come in there without a hat: They said, No. I staid there, and had a dram. When I came home I opened the bundle, and found there were two gowns. I kept them six or seven days, and they not being advertised, I thought I had a right to sell them. I sent my wife to pawn one of them, which she did for four shillings, and the other for the same, to buy leather for me to work, and to buy things for my family. My wife never saw them till I carry'd them home to her. As to what Ratcliff Littler says, the things my wife had then in her lap was nothing more than a blanket.</p>

I have entrusted him with messages, and have sent him with things and money to carry for me, and to take receipts; I have also sent him to my country lodgings, and left him with the keys, where plate and things of value were, when he has been there alone, and I never missed any thing, not so much as a glass of wine.

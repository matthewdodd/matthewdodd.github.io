                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 229.) On the 9th of March, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was on duty in Hardin's-lane, Woolwich, which adjoins the works of the Gas Company—I was sent there to watch the premises—there is a wicket-gate which leads from the gas-works to Harding's-lane—I heard that gate unfastened from the inside—I saw the prisoner John open the gate—his wife (the female prisoner) immediately came out—she had something bulky about her person—I followed her up the lane, stopped her, and asked what she had—she said, "For heaven's sake, Griffin, take no notice: come into my place, and I will satisfy you; I will give you a sovereign"—I declined her offer, and she said she would give me two—I took her to the station—I found 32lbs. of coals on her.</p>

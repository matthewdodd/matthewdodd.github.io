                  </hi>. I live with my father, George Willatts, a butcher, at East Oakingham, Berkshire. On the 10th of June this gelding pony was missed from a field in Wiltshire—I came to town, and found it at the Cherry Tree, kept by Burgess—I know nothing about the prisoner—the pony belonged to me—it was put into the field at night—my father took it there—he is not here—I was in Berkshire when it was lost—the last time I saw it was about eight o'clock, on the 9th of June, when I was in Wilts myself—it was in the field then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ostler at the Cherry Tree, Kingsland-road. On the 10th of June, about eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought a pony there—Willatts has since claimed it—I was ordered to give it some hay, and I asked the prisoner where be brought him from—he said, "Just round here"—I said, "Where is that?"—he did not make any answer—it did not seem exhausted at all—I said, "What do you want for the pony, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—he did not make any answer, but went out of the yard almost directly—I gave information to the police, having suspicion, and an hour afterwards the prisoner came into the yard again, and the policeman took him.</p>

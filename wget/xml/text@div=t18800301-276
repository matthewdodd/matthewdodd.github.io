                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). On Wednesday, 21st January, I went to Broad Street, Reading—about a quarter to 11 a.m. I saw Garrett and another man about 500 or 600 yards from Messrs. Stephens's bank—I watched them—they stood at the comer of Cross Street, which leads from Broad Street, to opposite the railway station—they went hurriedly in the direction of Marketplace—Messrs. Stephens's bank looks on to the Market Place—it is a triangle, you can see two sides of the bank—Garrett stood on one side, the man not in custody on the other, so that they could both see into the bank—they remained about a, minute, when the man not in custody hurriedly left and went back into Broad Street, the way in which they had come—Garrett then went and took his position, which would enable him to look straight into the bank window—that was on the opposite side to the bank—he stood against Messes. Huntley and Palmer's biscuit shop</p>

Huntley and Palmer's window—he bent down—"Wordley passed close by Garrett in the direction of Zinzan Street, followed by Sergeant Outram—when Outram came out of the bank Garrett was still standing there—I spoke to Sergeant Outram, and he took Garrett into the bank—I then went into Broad Street and looked about all round the neighbourhood to find the man who had been with Garrett—I never saw him again—I hare been looking for him since—he is a man about 5ft 11in., fair, long, fair moustache, no whiskers, dressed in a long Ulster coat and a broad soft hat, haying very much the appearance of an American.</p>

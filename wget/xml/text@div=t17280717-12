He further said, That when he had them apprehended on Suspicion of having robb'd him, Peter Pemberton offer'd to make it up, and did actually deposit Three Guineas and a Note in the Constable's Hands for that End, but the Magistrate before whom they went, would not suffer them to compound a Felony.</p>

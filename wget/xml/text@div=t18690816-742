                  </hi>. I was formerly an inspector of police, and am now employed by the Treasury in seeking for offenders against the coin laws—on 30th June, I was in Judd Street with Inspector Brannan and other officers—I was concealed so that I had a view of the Skinner's Arms public-house—I gave instructions to Miller 148 <hi rend="italic">G,</hi> and saw him seize the prisoner—they both fell down—another man, who got away, struck Miller a violent blow—the prisoner and Miller then got up and fell the second time—I rushed with Brannan across to the assistance of Miller and found the constable Windsor there—close to where the man lay on the ground I picked up a paper packet, containing ten counterfeit shillings, and I saw the man who got away, pick up a paper parcel, which broke—there were several parcels on the ground—the shillings had paper lapped between them, to make them keep their new appearance—the crowd picked up several of the other packets, and got away with them—Brannan handed me another packet containing ten more counterfeit shillings—at that time Miller called me by name, "Here, Mr. Brannan," and handed me another packet—the prisoner kicked me on the ankle very violently, and struck at me right and left—I said, "Kelly, if you strike me, I will strike you; you are a cowardly fellow, why do you kick?"—I warded off his blow, and struck him in the mouth with my hand—I was laid up two days from the kick on the ankle—there was a large crowd there—every time we stooped down to pick up a packet we were pushed from behind, and almost thrown on our heads—after a great deal of resistance we got the prisoner to the station—a packet con<lb></lb>taining ten counterfeit half-crowns was picked up forty-two yards from where the struggle took place—I measured the distance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been connected with the Mint? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Thirty years—I struck the prisoner a violent blow in the mouth—I never use unnecessary violence—it bled freely—there were two policemen close by—they had not got hold of him at that time—Miller had him by the skirt of the coat—the prisoner struck me repeatedly—Miller seized him from behind—I ran across the road to them—the brown paper packet was</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">WILLIAM MILLER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 148). On 30th June I was in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner standing at the corner of Hastings Street and Judd Street, with another man—I seized him round the waist—he said, "What are you doing?"—I said, "I am a police constable, and am going to take you into custody for possessing counterfeit coin"—he put his left hand in his coat pocket—I got hold of his hand—the other man then hit me on the side of the head—the prisoner withdrew his hand from his pocket, and threw a brown paper parcel in the road—it broke—I had hold of the parcel when the other man hit me—the prisoner then knocked me down—I got up, and saw the other man pick up a parcel—I picked up another packet, and was then knocked down the second time by the prisoner—Brannan came up, and I gave the parcel to him—I said, "Here is what he has thrown away"—the prisoner said, "It was not me"—he kicked two or three times very violently at Mr. Brannan—Brannan picked up another parcel in my presence—it was part of the brown paper parcel—the prisoner was very violent, and Brannan struck him a blow.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know the Hunter Street Police Station? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I never heard of the prisoner complaining that he had had his chain stolen—he was not smoking when I laid hold of him—I found a pipe in his pocket—I got excited when the other man hit me on the side of the head—I saw him pick a parcel up and run away with it.</p>

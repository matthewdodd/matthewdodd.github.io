                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, and live at No. 9A, Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square. I have a partner. On the night of the 1st Sept., I went to bed about 12 o'clock—before I went to bed I put up the shutters myself, and the house was secure—there was a bar across the shutters—I was awakened about two hours afterwards—when I went down, I found the shutter bar had been forced, and the shutter slid down on one side—the bar was not taken from the wall, but merely sprung—the window was smashed, and I observed a number of cigars had been removed—I missed from fifteen to seventeen bundles, about ten pounds weight—they are of more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. value—they were safe in the window when I went to bed.</p>

               <p>on 15th Sept.—I told him he was charged with stealing seventeen bundles of cigars on the morning of 2nd Sept., from a shop is Mortimer Street—he said, "Oh!

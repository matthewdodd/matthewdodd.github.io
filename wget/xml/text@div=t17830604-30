I went home immediately, and found several people round the door, and one of the witnesses was standing on the door step with a bundle of plate in his hand, and a red box; a person amongst the people gave me this wine strainer and pepper-box, and asked me if I could swear to them. I then opened the street door, and went up into my pantry immediately, it was shut and not locked, turned with the key as I thought I left it; the door is a spring lock, and shuts after us, and only opens with the key; when I came up into the pantry, I found my plate drawer pulled wide open, and all the plate taken out; the drawer next to it, which contains the table-cloths, and those things, I likewise found pulled open, and one table-cloth and a green cloth which I lay under the table-cloth, was flung upon the ground, and two pieces of candle which I had stuck in one pair of candlesticks for night was taken out and flung into my tray, and the salt that was in the two salt-sellers ready for supper was likewise flung into the tray with the candles; I then went down into the kitchen, and missed the soup-ladle, which was in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>What plate did your mistress lose? - I can inform you, I have a list of them in my pocket.</p>
               <p>When did you make that memorandum? - Not till after the plate was stolen; I made it from my memory; Mr. Chetham has one, and I took this from it.</p>
               <p>Court. Read it from the original. - [Reads] Plate that was stolen out of the house on Sunday afternoon: two pair of silver salts, two pair of salt spoons, seven table spoons, twelve desert spoons, one soup spoon, two sauce spoons, one mustard spoon, four waiters, two pair of candlesticks, one small candlestick, two basons, (one was a sugar bason, the other a slop bason, both silver) two sauce boats, one cream pot, one pepper box, one lemon strainer, two bottle labels, one marrow spoon, one wine strainer, six tea spoons, one meat skewer, that was all; there were four silver cups in a red box in a cupboard in my pantry, underneath the drawer, and one breakfast cloth, and that tied up the plate in it; I am very sure that all the things were in the house when I went to church.</p>
               <p>Is your mistress here? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>How long have you lived in the family? - Almost five years; my master died the 23d of February last, it was Mr. Jacomb's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Mr. and Mrs. Jacomb were married before you came into the family? - Yes.</p>
               <p>ATCHESON MAXFIELD sworn.</p>
               <p>You live near Mrs. Jacomb? - Yes, opposite.</p>
               <p>Tell the Court what you perceived on Sunday afternoon. - On Sunday afternoon, the 25th of May, I was sitting in my dining-room window, directly opposite Mrs. Jacomb's great door, a few minutes after three I saw three men come up towards the door, two of them was dressed in light-coloured drab clothes, the fashionable colour,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040037"></xptr> very smart and clean; the third was in dark colour; after they stood there a few minutes, whether the prisoner Smith or Grant went in first to the house, I cannot swear; there was one of them that appeared to me to remain behind. I observed three men, that got in by the same way that Mrs. Jacomb's servant frequently gets in, which is, as I take it, by a key, without ringing the bell; I cannot say which went in first, the third man might stand twenty yards off; I did not measure the ground after.</p>
               <p>Did they walk in as if the door had been open, or did they make any halt as if they opened the door? - I did not see that; but I did not see any woman or man that opened it; after the two prisoners had been in ten or fifteen minutes, I saw the door open, and stand on the jar for, I suppose, a few minutes; I was very attentive, and I took notice.</p>
               <p>They shut the door, and locked it after them when they first went in? - Yes; after that the door remained on the jar, as I tell you; I took notice, and was very attentive; some good-looking people came down Duck's-foot-lane, some went along Green-lettuce-lane; the prisoner Grant came out first; one of them had a tablecloth with something in it, which he seemed to carry just as a person would carry any thing out of any house; Smith had a trunk under one arm; the third man got off. I ran down Lawrence Pountney-lane, and the three men came into Thames-street together. I had not so good an opportunity of observing the third man, but I am sure as to Smith and Grant.</p>
               <p>Court. Were these the same men you saw before? - There was no one in Duck's-foot lane but our three selves.</p>
               <p>As to the two prisoners, you have sworn that they were the same two men that went into the house? - Yes; as they went down Thames-street I was close to Mr. Smith; they were very well dressed; they crossed over, and went into a place called Coal-harbour; when Grant and Smith had got under this gate-way, the man in the reddish coat kept in Thames-street. I clapped Grant on the shoulder, and insisted on knowing what he had; on which Smith, without any answer or ill language, jumped from me, and he and Grant went down the lane; they ran very fast, and I ran as fast as them; when they had got a quarter down the lane, Smith let fall the trunk, which I picked up, and still continued to pursue them; the handle went away, and the trunk fell from me; I still continued to cry out; they turned to the right by Mr. Calvert's brew-house, towards Allhallows-lane; when I got to the bottom, I asked if they saw these people go by; they said, yes; they had so much the appearance of gentlemen, that we did not stop them.</p>
               <p>And there you lost them? - Going up Allhallows-lane, there was a lusty good-looking man; says he, I believe I have got what you are looking for; he had got the table-cloth, I do not know the man's name; I am very bad at remembering names, but my eye-sight is pretty good; I believe he was coming across. As we were walking, a brewer's man called after after us; says he, here is something that belongs to you; I turned about, and saw the man had a silver pepper-box, and a silver strainer; he gave them to me, and I gave them to the man that had the plate in the table-cloth, and we went into Thames-street to Mrs. Jacomb's door, and then left him there, and beckoned to the person to come and take charge of the plate; I went to the meeting-house at Salter's-hall, to tell the man who opens the door I wanted Mrs. Jacomb; he brought, I believe, Mrs. Jacomb's nephew to me; I told him, a little accident had happened, and I begged some person might come and take charge of the plate. Several gentlemen came up, some produced picklock keys, others other picklock keys, others some silver salts, or something of that kind. I begged they would go to the Poultry Compter with me, where they might see the men.</p>
               <p>Can you say they were the men that had been stopped? - Yes; I then went to the Poultry Compter; the turnkey told me the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040038"></xptr> prisoners were in a room, and he would fetch them, which he did; the two prisoners came out dressed just as I had seen them before.</p>
               <p>Did you know them directly? - Oh, Lord, aye, knew them directly! they were very remarkable!</p>
               <p>In the same dress? - Yes; I went to Alderman Hart's, Smith was in the same dress that he was before, but Grant had got on a very different coat, but his face was the same; I thought his having a different coat on was rather extraordinary, because I told the keeper not to let them change their cloaths.</p>
               <p>I only ask you one general question, Are you sure, upon your observation on the sight of the men, that these two are the two men? - I can safely swear they are the two men that came out with the plate and things, but I did not see them go in.</p>
               <p>Are you sure they are the two men that came out; - Yes, they were at the Poultry Compter, Alderman Hart was very a ngry with the keeper of the Poultry Compter, for suffering them to take off their cloaths.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You say on the Sunday afternoon, about three, you was sitting at your window, which is opposite? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Before the man came up you was not talking to any body? - No.</p>
               <p>You saw them enter without any pause or interruption? - They might stay a minute.</p>
               <p>You saw nothing like taking any thing out of their pockets? - He went close up to the door as the servant used to do.</p>
               <p>You saw no more? - No.</p>
               <p>They were out of your sight a considerable time? - From ten to fifteen minutes.</p>
               <p>Had you given the alarm of stop thief before they were out of your sight? - Yes, they were not so far from me as I am from you, when I cried out stop thief.</p>
               <p>They went down Ducks-foot-lane, they were out of sight then? - I did not know they were thieves till I put my hand on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>I only ask you a plain question, I do not mean to argue with you, you walked quietly down? - No, I run very fast down that lane.</p>
               <p>You met two men first? - They were in another lane.</p>
               <p>You spoke to Smith at the bottom of Alhallows-lane, one would have thought you must have been in some little doubt at that time, as you know every man is supposed to be innocent till he is found out? - I saw them all down the lane, which is a very long lane; after I lost sight of them, I saw them no more till I saw them in the compter.</p>
               <p>You then enquired of the keeper where the two men were that were in custody, they were brought out as the two men that were supposed to be the persons? - I cannot say whether there was any other fettered in the yard, there was a great many men in the yard that were not handcuffed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Grant. My Lord, I should be glad if Mr. Maxfield would answer why he did not swear to us before Alderman Hart? I swore before the Alderman, at least I said before the Alderman that I could not swear they were the men that went into the house, but I did not tell the Alderman that they were not the very men that came out of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Then it was put to you whether you would positively swear that they were the men that went into the house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the Alderman then that they were the men that came out of the house? - I did.</p>

             a dry-salter in Cornhill, I was at Coal-harbour-stairs on Sunday afternoon May the 25th, I heard the cry of stop thief, upon looking up Coal-harbour, I saw these two prisoners and Mr. Maxfield following them, crying out stop thief, Mr. Maxfield was stooping at the time to pick up that trunk, one of them had just dropped it, the other had a bundle, I cannot say which, I saw the trunk dropping to the ground, they turned towards Alhallows-lane, I followed them, and came very near<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040039"></xptr> up with the prisoner Grant, about the middle of Alhallows-lane, when he dropped these keys on the steps of a door, I saw him drop them; upon which one Mr. Bennet a blacksmith stood just by, and knowing them to be picklock keys, he followed me giving me his child, I gave it his wife who was close behind me; I picked up the keys and followed them, I lost sight of them at the top of Alhallows-lane, and gained sight of them again in Hand-court.</p>
               <p>Court. How long might they be out of your sight? - About the space of a minute, or not quite so much, they were about ten yards from me when I saw them again, they were the same men that I saw again in Hand-court, I am sure of it, they kept pretty close together; Hand-court leads into Chequer-yard, and Mr. Bennet laid hold of the prisoner Smith, while they turned out of Chequer-yard into Dowgate-hill, I lost sight of them again, I do not suppose it was half a minute or a quarter of a minute, Mr. Bennet had hold of the prisoner Smith, when I saw them again, he had got before me in the pursuit; Grant went a little higher, and I saw Mr. Maidment had hold of his collar, I did not see him stopped, I saw Bennet have hold of Smith, and Maidment hold of Grant.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Council. How far was Mr. Maxfield from you when you was alarmed? - About thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Were there any other people in the lane who were put into pursuit upon this alarm? - There were several, it is a common thoroughfare, and generally frequented by a great number of people, any person who had been passing that way might have joined in the pursuit, one of the prisoners dropped the bundle, and a young man, I cannot tell who it was, picked it up, and gave it to Hinton.</p>
               <p>Court to Henshaw. Whereabout did you see the bundle dropped? - I did not see it dropped.</p>
               <p>Did the trunk drop from Grant? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>You pursued a considerable distance, did not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Many other people joined in the cry? - Yes Sir, there were four or five round the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. This Coal-harbour is not a very great thoroughfare of a Sunday? - There is a great many people go to the stairs being pleasant.</p>
               <p>Court. You say you saw one of them drop the trunk which Mr. Maxfield picked up, and the other had a white bundle? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You never lost sight of them I think you said till they turned out of Alhallows-lane, and you got sight of them again in Hand-court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What became of the white bundle? - I have heard it was dropped at the bottom of Alhallows-lane, it was gone when I came up with Grant in Alhallows-lane, before I picked up the keys, and they were in the middle of Alhallows-lane.</p>
               <p>Then they never had been out of your sight at that time? - No, they had not.</p>

               <p>On Sunday the 25th of May, between three and four in the afternoon, I was walking up Thames-street, and just by the end of Coal-harbour-lane, I heard the cry of Stop thief; I turned about, and saw Mr. Maxfield holding his stick up for assistance; I ran back to the top of Coal-harbour-lane, and then Mr. Maxfield was down past the gateway with a box in his hand, and I saw the two prisoners at the bar running; I turned to the top of Alhallows-lane, and I thought it was impossible to overtake them the other way; I staid, and saw them run and turn the corner of Waterman's-hall; they came up the lane close together, and passed me; I was sure by their dress they were the same same men; they were dressed in light-coloured cloaths, like mine.</p>
               <p>Did you perceive either of them have any thing in their hands? - Nothing, but I head a great jingling in their pockets.</p>
               <p>Which way did they run? - From the top of Allhallow's-lane straight up into Chequer-yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040040"></xptr> through Hand-court, and down the gate-way; Smith have a butter-boat and a small taper candlestick out of his pocket; I picked them up; while I was picking them up, Bennet seized Smith, who was behind; I did not see him, but it was just then I held up the plate; as they were running, I halloo'd out, for God's sake stop thief, here is some of the plate; the people would not stop them; the other two proceeded on a little way, about 20 or 30 yards; I saw him stopped, and brought back immediately.</p>

               <p>On the 25th of May my wife and child and me were walking out after dinner; I was going down Allhallows-lane, and there was a cry of Stop thief, stop thief, do not stop one, but stop them both; that was the cry that I heard at the bottom of the lane. I immediately says, these two gentlemen cannot be them who are coming up, they were the prisoners at the bar; they were just upon the trot when they came to me, they rather walked by me; immediately as Grant walked by me he threw a bunch of picklock keys down; I am sure Grant is the man that threw them down; I immediately gave the child away to a young man that is in Court, that picked up the keys, and ran after them to Dowgate-hill to the gateway; as I got into the gateway Smith threw down a silver butter-boat and candlestick; I saw him do that, and laid hold of him immediately; I never lost sight of either of them, I ran as fast as possible, I took Smith under the gateway; the last witness picked up the boat and candlestick. In about ten minutes after, I heard Grant was stopped. I was going along with him after the other was taken, and a constable came behind, and laid hold of his coat, which pulled him very hard, and the prisoner said, do not pull me so hard, I can go with the man that took me.</p>

               <p>I was sitting in the tap-room in Coal-harbour on Sunday afternoon, between three and four, on the 25th of May; I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner, Grant pass by me with a white bundle, I am sure that is the man; he had the bundle under his right arm. I observed it, and ran after him directly. There was another man along with him, but I did not see his face; I cannot say any thing to him. There was a gentleman following them with a trunk in his hand, that cried out, Stop thief; I followed them till they were taken, but I was out of their sight twice; I first lost sight of them turning the corner from the brew-house into Alhallow's-lane; I did not lose sight of them for more than a minute; when I saw them again, I knew them to be the same men; one of them I can say to, that is Grant, but the other I cannot; they had lost their bundle, I was a distance from it; the bundle I passed by, and my master picked it up.

I questioned Mr. Maxfield very particularly whether he was quite clear that these were the men that went into the house; he said, he could not tell: I said, are you sure they are the men that came out of the house? he said, he believed they were, but he would not take upon him to say; their dress was both alike, and they were pursued; and he said, he thought they must be the men, but he would not take upon himself to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. There was a very singular thing happened about this lad; the lad would not take upon himself to swear, and I told you at the same time that you did not give us fair play; you said, very well. - The boy swore positively at once.</p>

            ? - Yes; I was standing down at the Coal-harbour wharf, smoaking my pipe, my face towards the Thames; I heard a cry of Stop thief, and there were two men, one of them with a bundle, which I cannot swear to; one of them had his back to me, running to Calvert's brew-house; I sent the boy after them, I said I could not run so fast; and a young man that picked up a bundle, he gave it me, There, Sir, says he, here is a bundle one of them has dropped; I did not see the bundle dropped; it contained silver spoons, and four waiters, it was tied up in a handkerchief, and then in a white table-cloth, then there was a speckled handkerchief thrown over it; I heard the man's name was one Allardson, who lives in Tower-street.</p>

               <p>I live on Dowgate-hill. On Sunday the 25th of last month, about half after three in the afternoon, as I was sitting at my father's, I heard the cry of stop thief at a distance, I made the best of my way down stairs, when I came into the street, I observed the prisoner Smith, in custody of Mr. Bennet, and some plate in his hand; I believe salt cellars; the prisoner Grant was then on the other side of the way running away; Mr. Bennet who had hold of Smith called to me, for God's sake to pursue Grant, I did so, and at the corner of Cloak-lane, I came up with him, and took him by the collar, I never lost sight of him from the time I first saw him till I took him; upon my taking him, he dropped these keys; I tried this key, which opened Mrs. Jacomb's-house with the greatest ease afterwards; I have had them in my possession ever since, I sealed up the others, and kept that separate.</p>
               <p>- ALLARDSON sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you see either of the prisoners drop a bundle in Alhallows-lane? - I believe the left hand man dropped a bundle, but I cannot say, I believe he was one of the men that dropped a bundle, I gave the bundle to a lusty man, he appeared to me a publican, I gave it to him, and I turned back; I was going over the water.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe the two men that were running before the rest? - I did, they were two smart fellows, I thought they were joking, they got up to me, I ran after them the distance from Coal-harbour-lane to Alhallow's-lane; I believe Grant to be one.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Grant's Defence. Yesterday was a fortnight, I had been in the city in the afternoon to meet my sister, I was standing at the bottom of Alhallows-lane, and all of a sudden there was a cry of stop thief; I went up along with them, and they ran across Thames-street, towards Dowgate-hill, and at the bottom of the gateway across Dowgate-hill, I picked up these keys.</p>

               <p>Were you there when the prisoners were brought into custody? - I was.</p>
               <p>Did Grant go up the next day in the same cloaths he was brought in? - They were both in light drab cloaths, I took as much care of them as I could, we have two turnkeys, one to attend each day, but one was ill, any body might put a coat through the door; and about an hour after they were examined, Grant had changed his coat, I told him, I would rather have given him a guinea than he should have changed his coat, I told him he was a rascal and a villain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Grant. I changed the coat because it was too good to wear in gaol.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith's Defence. I was coming up Alhallows-lane, and heard the cry of stop thief, I saw several persons running, and I saw a tall man throw away some plate, I picked it up, my foot slipped, and the butter boat-fell out of my hand, I delivered the property up directly.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040044"></xptr>Prisoner's Council. I beg leave to submit to your Lordship, whether you think this case is properly substantiated against the prisoners at the bar; I conceive the best evidence is not brought forward, for there cannot be the best proof without Mrs. Jacomb's coming here herself, and therefore it is fair for me to say, that these men went into the house by Mrs. Jacomb's consent, and that the goods were not taken away feloniously, for there cannot be a proof of felony, and of the goods stolen, being the property of Mrs. Jacomb, without her standing forward: I submit there cannot possibly be a proof under this indictment, without Mrs. Jacomb herself standing forward and saying, that these things were her property, and that they were taken away without her consent; and consequently taken away feloniously: It does not prove what is necessary to prove in the present instance, and I think, unless Mrs. Jacomb had been here, that you have not the best evidence that the nature of the case will admit of; and I submit, that if the best evidence is required in support of a common action, surely the best evidence is required upon a case of such importance as the present.</p>
               <p>Court. Have you any authority to shew that a person cannot be convicted for stealing goods, without the owner being present; I am clearly of opinion, that there is nothing at all in the objection, so clearly that it is not necessary for me to give you any reasons for that opinion. If you please I will leave it to the Jury, whether Mrs. Jacomb gave the prisoners consent to go into her house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. All presumptions are in favour of the parties accused.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not a necessary presumption of law, but the reverse; if you force me to give my opinion, I think the reverse; but if you think it to be left to the Jury, I have no objection.</p>

               <p>I appear for the short man that is in green, I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Court. Look round and see, if you can see him? - That is the man.</p>
               <p>Which man? - The man in green.</p>
               <p>That is Smith? - I do not know his name, I never saw the man before in my life, I never saw him till I saw him here.</p>
               <p>(This occasioning a loud laugh, which interrupted the Court.)</p>
               <p>Court. When prisoners are upon trial for a capital offence, and in a case where in all probability the verdict of the Jury will affect their lives, is there any man in an English Court of Justice so devoid of feeling and so brutish, as to break out into indecent exclamations, and disturb the attention of the Court; if I find any such man so behaving, I will teach him to behave better by committing him to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Court to witness. Do you know him? - Nothing about him, only I came to speak in his behalf, as I read in the news-papers, that he was to be on the trial to day; that gentleman, that man in green, I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>What was it in the news-paper, that a man dressed in green was to be tried to day? - I read that.</p>
               <p>You read that a man dressed in green was to be tried? - I saw him in the mob.</p>
               <p>You heard from the paper this man was to be tried, what man? - I heard there were two gentlemen to be tried on this robbery done at Upper Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Then these were not the two men? - I am sorry I should be mistaken, I think, I perfectly know the day, and every thing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Be careful what you say, and if you have any sense, just attend to my question, you say, you heard from the papers he was to be tried? - Yes, there is the thing, I was told in company that these gentlemen were to be tried day.</p>
               <p>A man in a green coat? - I know he had a green coat when I saw him pick up what was lost, I heard that they were to be tried to day.</p>
               <p>That who were to be tried to day? - I was at the gate, I sell mackarel; and all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040045"></xptr> those things in fish season; I happened to be there, and seeing the mob run, I saw a man hurl some things down, and they were picked up in the lane, I came to speak in the gentleman's behalf, I came just upon a walk, I came here by accident, I was asked to come in to speak the truth by two or three of his friends, what I saw.</p>
               <p>Court. For whom? - For the gentleman in green.</p>

               <p>What did they tell you? - Nothing particular, only as I saw the mob running, I saw some things thrown down.</p>
               <p>Who did you come here to be a witness for? - To be a witness to speak what I saw.</p>
               <p>On what business? - I came to be a witness upon no considerations.</p>
               <p>How did you know that there was any trial to day? - I was walking past to day, and I heard by accident, there was to be a trial here about a robbery done in Thames-street, I heard there were two to be tried for it, I did not ask their names, I only came to speak what I saw, I have not been in the Court above a quarter of an hour, my name is

               <p>Court. Why the truth? - I was walking out the Sunday, and I had been after some mackarel, I go every day and Sundays; I saw a mob running, and I saw a parcel of people in Alhallow's-lane, and I saw somebody hurl some things down, and I saw others pick them up; I saw a man in a white coat, I think a man in a green coat, pick something up and put it into his pocket, and he got a kind of a slip as he went along.</p>

               <p>Court. Who was that man in the green coat? - About the size of that gentleman, I do think that is the man, I do think it is the same man, I believe he had the same coat on to the best of my knowledge; I do not know, but I think that is the coat he had on, to the best of my knowledge; I never saw him before.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am come on account of recollecting a circumstance in an advertisement, that I saw in the news-paper, concerning the robbery that was committed on the 25th of May.</p>
               <p>Court. Mind, let me warn you a little? - I need no warning.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not know that, let me warn you that if you are detected in swearing falsly, I shall not suffer you to go out of Court, but shall certainly commit you to take your trial? - I am obliged to your Lordship for your caution, but I do not need it.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A letter case maker, I live at No. 12, in Cock-lane, I rent a room there, I have lodged there about eight weeks, I believe.</p>
               <p>Who is your landlord? - His name is Evans, I do not know his christian name, I follow my business there, there are my tools and materials.</p>
               <p>You talked of recollecting a circumstance that occured on Sunday the 25th of May? - I recollect walking down Dowgate-hill, I met some people more or less, and going down the gateway, I recollect a person was stooping and picking up something.</p>
               <p>Who was that somebody? - What brought me was to see whether it is either of the prisoners at the bar, on account of an advertisement that I read in a newspaper, that I have in my pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040046"></xptr>Court. Let me see the advertisement? - Nothing but humanity led me here, I shall tell nothing but what I know; I came here in consequence of this advertisement unknown to the prisoner intirely, I declare to God; I thought I could recollect the man again, he was dressed in a light coloured coat, it was under the gateway, he picked them up somewhere near upon the turn; I did not see any body taken afterwards; I went forwards about my business; there were some people coming seemingly in a hurry through the gateway.</p>
               <p>You had no curiosity to enquire what was the matter? - I asked what was the matter, they said, some thieves, and I went away directly, I think the man in black is the man.</p>
               <p>Had he the same cloaths on? - No, no, he had light cloaths on then, I took notice of his face, seeing him stop attracted my eye; I never saw him since till now, nor never before then.</p>
               <p>Council for Prosecution. Did not you send to him, to let him know that you would be a witness? - No, nor he to me, I made all the enquiry when the trial would come on, I thought it was time enough then; I thought the best way would be to come into Court; I waited on Saturday till they said, the London Jury was gone off, then I went away; and yesterday I never called on him.</p>

               <p>I am a fishman, I live the corner of Gravel-lane, the first house, No. 5, I rent a lower room, my landlord's name is Soper.</p>

               <p>Court. Have not you been here before? - Not as I know of, I have been here, Sir, about four or five years ago; I might be here since but I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to say that you have not? - I have been here before, but not before you that I know of, I have been here about two or three years ago.</p>
               <p>What trial was you witness upon? - I do not know, I have forgot the trial.</p>
               <p>How often have you been here? - Never but once.</p>
               <p>And yet you have forgot what that once was about? - I have forgot who it was for.</p>
               <p>What do you know about this matter? - I know nothing at all about it, I know nothing of the prisoner; only last Sunday fortnight coming from Billingsgate, I saw a great number of people crying out, Stop thief!</p>

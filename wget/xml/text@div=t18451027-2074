                  </hi>. I keep a public-house in Berner-street, Strand. The prisoner was in my employment—on the 4th of Oct. I gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to get silver for it at Mr. Warren's, the butcher, close by—he came back with only 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and said he did not know what was gone with the rest—I sent him back to see if he had left it on the counter—he was gone some time, and then came back and said a woman had met him and got him to go up Southampton-street, as she said she knew his mother, and she had got some beads for his sister—that he said he had got some money of his master's, and she took the bag that had the money, and, as he believed, she put the beads into it, and then put the money in, as he thought—he told me this that same evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Pheasant public-house, 35, Stangate Street, Lambeth—on 1st April I was called up by my barman, about 5.45 o'clock in the morning—I went into the bar parlour and found the cheffonier all opened, papers thrown about, and a little writing-desk wrenched open, and the papers thrown out of that—the window was broken—I had gone to bed about 12.30 the night before, and left all safe—I left 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper in the bar, and about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in copper money, done up in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packets, in the cheffonier—the opera-glasses were on the cheffonier—I found my property had been disturbed and moved—I saw the prisoner in the bar—he seemed stupid, as if he had just woke up—my bar<lb></lb>man</p>

I am barman to the last witness—on the 1st April I came down about 5.50 or 5.45 o'clock—I found the prisoner lying on the sofa in the bar parlour asleep—his necktie, collar, and boots were off—I woke him, and asked him how he came there—he said he did not know—I found the window had been opened, and the cheffonier and desk, the copper and silver, and the opera-glasses moved—I was sent for a constable.</p>

I was called to the Pheasant and found the prisoner there—I examined to see in what way the house had been entered—I found three distinct marks of footsteps up to the wall, and the brickwork was scraped—that is the wall which divides the yard from a pas-sage where the tramway horses draw up—the wall is about 6 feet high—the window, which had been opened, was on the ground floor, and could be easily got at—I took the prisoner to the station, and searched him—I found these packets of money, a bag of money, a cigar case, and the opera-glasses in his coat pocket—he said he did not know how he had got there—he went to Drury Lane Theatre the night before, and had gone to the Pheasant about 11.45, as near as he could remember—he seemed a little confused, and appeared as if he had been drinking.</p>

I was on duty in the Westminster Bridge Road on the night of 31st March and the morning of 1st April—I saw the prisoner about 12.10, inside the Crown public-house—he was assisting one of the barmen there with a man who was drunk and creating a dis-turbance—he came out with the man, and they had some words together—I told him to go inside, and I would get the man away—he went in, and the door was shut—I saw him again about 12.25, when he came out of the same public-house—he walked down the road, and I saw no more of him for a quarter of an hour, when I found him through some iron rails, attached to the Crown, sitting under a tree—I turned my light on him, and asked him how he got in there—he said John, the potman, put him there—I said "It is a queer place; why did he put you there?"—he said he did not know; he put him there out of the way, so that he would not be locked up—I said "You had better come out"—he got over the railing, and went down towards the Lambeth Road—I said "Are you not going in to-night? '—he said "No, I won't go in to-night; I have got some friends, and I will go to them"—he had been drinking, but he walked quite steady, and knew very well what he was about.</p>

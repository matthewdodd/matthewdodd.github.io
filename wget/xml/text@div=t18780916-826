I am a widow, and live at 30, Cross Street, Battersea—the deceased, Amy Judge, was my daughter—she was about 29 years of age—between 9 and 10 years ago she married a man of the name of Judge—she lived with him some time—he was convicted, and served a term of two years' imprisonment—I think that was two years after their marriage; it must be about six years ago—before his conviction she had two children by him, who are alive now—during the time Judge was in prison she formed the acquaintance of a man named Hunt—she lived with him as his wife, but. not till Judge came out of prison—when Judge did come out, they lived together again as man and wife—before that Hunt had left the country for New Zealand—she and Judge remained together for about five months, and he was then convicted again—during his second imprisonment my daughter formed the acquaintance of the prisoner, and she afterwards lived with him at 30, Cross Street, Battersea—I occupied a room in the house—Mr. and</p>

               <p>Mrs. Nansen were lodgers in the house, and my daughter's children also lived there—the prisoner was employed at Wood's Hotel, Furnival's Inn, as scullion—on Saturday, 20th July, he was away from work—in the afternoon my daughter went to the City to take her machine to be repaired, and the prisoner went to the boat-pier to meet her; they came home together with Hunt about 5 o'clock—Hunt stayed with them for about two hours—they had a glass of ale—my daughter said she had met Hunt in the City, and she had brought him home—when they came in together she said "Here is an old friend, mother"—that was the first time I had seen him since he had left for New Zealand—the prisoner did not appear to like his being there he seemed rather cross about it—he did not say anything then—my daughter said she should take her little girl as far as London Bridge with Hunt and Smithers, and they all left together about 7 o'clock—in about two hours and a half Smithers returned alone—I said "Have you not gone with them?"—he said "No, they did not want me"—I said "What nonsense, you ought to have gone with them"—he said "No other man shall ever have her, I will do for her; I will have my revenge"—he said he had left them on the platform, that they wanted to take a ticket for him, but he did not go with them, they went one way and he the other, he went to Ludgate Hill—he said that Amy had given him a two-shilling piece, I think it was—he said very little that evening—he said again that he would do for her, no other man should ever have her—he remained in during the remainder of the night—he was very restless, very; out of one room into the other—I said "She was waiting, you may depend, somewhere, and lost all conveyance home"—he said that she was with Hunt—I tried to persuade him that she was not, that she had got her child with her—at 2 o'clock I went to bed—next morning he was still in a restless state—he used the same words, that he would do for her, that he would have his revenge—I offered him the newspaper to pass away the time, saying "Not that there is anything cheering in it, there are so many murders"—he said a great many people brought it on themselves—about 11 o'clock my daughter came back with the child and Hunt—she said that she had stayed with Mr. Hunt's sister, and that she and her little girl had slept together, that they had company, and it was too late for any conveyance home, and there<lb></lb> fore they had slept there—the prisoner said "I don't believe it"—I said of course I thought it was quite right, she had her little girl with her and they slept together—I then left the room and went into the back parlour; I think the prisoner remained in the front parlour—Hunt only remained to have some ale together, he did not to stay dinner, he left at 2 o'clock—they sat conversing together one part of the time while I was there about New Zealand, but I was preparing dinner, and did not remain in the room long—Hunt and the prisoner talked together—after Hunt left we had dinner, and I then cleared the table and went into the back parlour, leaving Smithers and my daughter alone in the front parlour.—about 4 o'clock my daughter came into the room where I was, followed by the prisoner—to the best of my recollection he said "What do you intend to do. Amy?" she said "Oh, don't bother, mother wishes to go to sleep," or "don't want to be annoyed," or something to that effect—they then left the room together—about 10 minutes afterwards Smithers came into my room and said "Where is Amy?"—I said "Gone upstairs, I suppose"—he left the room—I did not hear him go up, but in less than 10</p>

               <p>minutes after that, it might be seven or eight minutes, I heard some dreadful screams coming from the bedroom above the room where I was—I went up and knocked at the door and tried to get in, but could not—I called for Mr. Nansen to come and burst the door open—I heard the door unlock, and my daughter fell into my arms, streaming with blood, and saying "He has killed me; he has killed me, mother"—I did not see the prisoner—I called to Mr. Nansen to assist me into her room with my daughter, and when we got a few steps further she said "He has murdered me, mother;" she never spoke after that; she died in about a quarter of an hour—when I found the dying state she was in I sent for the doctor and the police.</p>

I am the prisoner's mother—he is 31 years of age—he went to India, I believe, in 1863, and remained there about twelve months—when he came back he had four or five fits a day—he knocked himself about very much—I had to have four men to hold him—he fell and lay for a very long time afterwards unconscious—he would sleep a very long time afterwards—he remained at home about nine or ten months, because he was subject to these fits—he afterwards went to Russia about nine years ago—he stayed there about twelve months—he went as an upholsterer on board a steamer, to do the cushions.</p>

I am a coal merchant at Herne Bay—I know the prisoner—I knew him in 1869—he signed articles with me to go on a voyage to Calcutta in the steamship Hindostan—I signed as carpenter, and he as ordinary seaman—a man named Wallace Bell also signed—he is now at sea—the voyage lasted three months—during the voyage the prisoner was subject to fits—he had seven or eight during the passage—I have no idea what fits they were—his features were greatly distorted, and he was foaming at the mouth; his hands were clenched—when he had these fits we used to put cold water over him in buckets—it took three or four men to hold him—I saw him frequently after landing at Calcutta—he was living with me—he appeared to prefer solitude, giving way to lassitude—he was greatly affected by the climate—he used to wander about by himself—I have known him to be gone all day, and stay till night—at different times he stopped away more than a day—he had fits in Calcutta, the same sort as before—in 1870 I went to Russia with him in the same vessel from Hull to Cronstadt in the steamship Thomas Wilson—he had no fits during that voyage—I saw him in the same sort of fits three or four times while we were in Russia, but not quite so bad—he did not appear to be affected quite so much in the cold weather—I have lost sight of him for upwards of the last three years—I met him then in London quite casually.</p>

I live at Wood's hotel, Furnivals Inn, of which my father is the proprietor—I manage the business for him—the prisoner has been in our service as scullery man for two or three years past—he was always very sober and very temperate—he used to come by day and go home at night—he was at times exceedingly moody, although very obliging—he would at those times almost refuse to do his work—he seemed to be under the influence of something or other—on one occasion he asked my permission to leave—I said "I don't see anything the matter with you"—he said "I am perpetually being bothered by something"—I asked him what it was—he said that some spirit or other was annoying him—I told him it was ridiculous to suppose such things as that—he said he could not help it—on another occasion he asked leave to go and bury his mother, and I allowed him to go, and his mother is alive now—he also told the servants I had given him money in order to bury her—I never did so—I never took him to be thoroughly mad, but I thought him very very strange—he was a very good servant.</p>

His hours were from 7 o'clock in the morning till half past 8 o'clock at night—I did not know that he was living at Battersea—it was about 12 months ago that he said he was bothered by something—he said he was very much bothered by some spirit or other that seemed to be continually dodging him about—he did not say in what way, except by following him about, and he fancied it was always about him—the conversation about going to bury his mother was about six months ago—he was in my employ when this took place, but he had been absent for four days on account of indisposition; he did not come to work on the Wednesday before this happened; he wrote me a letter afterwards, saying he was not well—I have not got that letter, it simply said that he was not well, but he hoped to be able to resume work, shortly—he did not say what was the matter with him—I don't know on what day it was written, there was neither date or address on it; I think it was the day after he left, on the Thursday; I received it before the Saturday—his work was to clean the stewpans and such like, and he used to assist the vegetable maid at times if he liked; he was always a very handy man to assist in anything, he did his work pretty well.</p>

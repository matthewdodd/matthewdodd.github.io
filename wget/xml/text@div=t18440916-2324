                  </hi>. I reside at Stoke Newington. Rhodes was in my service as upper nurse, and had been for nearly five years—she left my service on the 27th of Aug.—on the following day she returned for her boxes—I afterwards went to where she was lodging with Gibson, in Norfolk-street, Lower-road, Islington—I found some knives and forks of mine in a box which was not locked, in the same room where Rhodes's boxes were—Gibson had been formerly in my service for a short time, at the instigation of Rhodes.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of the prosecutor—I know Rhodes. About a fortnight before she left I saw her partly pack a hamper—the lid of it was open—there was some tea, some gin, and a cake in it—the cake was made in the kitchen by Rhodes—she directed me to take it to No. 1, Norfolk-street, Islington—I saw Mrs. Maggs, who keeps the house, and delivered the hamper and the box to her—Gibson was frequently in the habit of coming to my master's to see Rhodes.</p>

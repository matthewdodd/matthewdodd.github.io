               <p>I am an officer belonging to the public office, Shadwell. In consequence of some information, I went to a house in <placeName id="t17950218-6-crimeloc24">Twister's-alley, Bunhill-row</placeName>

The prisoner Quigley he was sitting in a hole close to the press, the other two prisoners, Bates and Tipson, about two yards from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180013"></xptr>it, a picking up the blank halfpence, and there were a number that were stamped in a bag close by the press; and by the press I found the dies for stamping these halfpence, and likewise dies for farthings; but no farthings stamped, but a number of blanks, and a tool for smoothing the edge of these plain halfpence in the same place. In the two pair of stairs room I found a cutting tool for cutting the blanks one of the sheets of copper; here is some of the remains of the copper, and the seissle, this has been sheets of copper out of which the blanks have been cut of the size of halfpence; we then secured the three prisoners, and Mr. Aberloy went and searched for Cox.</p>
               <p>Q. What were their dress? - Quigley had a coat on, the other two were in jackets; Mr. Aberley went and brought the prisoner Cox down into the cellar, I asked Mr. Aberley, what have you got the landlord of the house with you? he said, yes; the prisoner was there at the time; Cox then asked if Mr. Aberley would let him go up into his room and let him shift his clothes? he was in a jacket himself, and was all black, and had a cap on; I think he had a jacket, I am not positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his hands? - He was very black all over; he appeared the same as the others that were then working, Mr. Aberley went up stairs with him, I remained in the cellar with the others.</p>
               <p>Jury. You did not see them at work, only sitting by the press? - I did not see them at the fly, because in coming down stairs they could very easily get from that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do the halfpence that you have there, and the die, correspond? - They do.</p>

               <p>Q. You apprehended Cox? - I did, at the public house adjoining; I took him into the cellar where the other prisoners were, I said, Mr. Cox, I understand that you are the proprietor of this house; he said that the house did belong to him; upon which I told him, I was in duty bound to take him along with the other prisoners; he asked me to let him go up and change his clothes, which I did; I went up along with him, and in the closet, where he changed his clothes, there I found two dies, one for halfpence and one for farthings, and in the same room I found these blanks for farthings.</p>
               <p>Q. All this money produced, the halfpence and farthings, are they counterfeit? - They are.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bates. I would wish to ask Mr. Cook or Mr. Aberley, what I was particularly doing?</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cox. I am a brass founder, and my shop lays at the back part of the house, and every body knows that brass founders are as dirty as chimney sweepers when they are at work. My wife dying last November, the last Christmas Tipson took the house, and was to pay me nine pounds a year out of fourteen pounds that I give for it, and I only kept the shop and was as a single man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bates. I went to this house. I am a cabinet maker by business; I was told that Mr. Tipson was below stairs in the kitchen, and I called in and Mr. Tipson desired me to come down stairs, I went down and I told him he owed me half a crown, and I was informed he could pay me; he said, he would pay me if I could take halfpence, and he gave me half a crown's worth of halfpence, and I told him they would be no use to me, such halfpence as them, and I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179502180014"></xptr>packing them up as the officers came down stairs.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Quigley. I have nothing further to say then that Mr. Tipson employed me.</p>

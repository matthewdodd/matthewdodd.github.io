Mr. Ward keeps the house. I went out on Sunday the 15th of December, about eleven o'clock, and returned on the Monday; I found the door broken open, and my place robbed. The prisoner is a carpenter, and had been at work for the landlady, and I had called him into my shop about a week before, to shew him some alterations which I wanted him to make. On the Sunday night my shop had been robbed of my bed and blankets, which made me sleep out on the Monday night. I went away a little after five o'clock, locked the door, and gave the watchman directions to look out.</p>

I am a watchman of St. Ann's parish; as I was going my rounds, about half-past twelve o'clock, I found Mr. Cormac's door unlocked, I put my stick through the hole, when the prisoner pushed it to from the inside; I called Preston, who is also a watchman, to my assistance; the prisoner opened the door, rushed out, and I stopped him-he threw a steel down; as I was taking him to the watch-house, he threw some matches and a candle away. The next morning I found a skeleton-key by the door. We searched him at the watch-house, and found a tinder-box, and four small, and one large, skeleton keys.

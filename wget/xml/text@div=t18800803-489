I am Superintendent of Records in the Bank<lb></lb>ruptcy Court—I produce the file of proceedings in Perry's bankruptcy—he signed and filed his petition on 29th November, 1879—it was filed about 1.15—he is described as a mantle manufacturer, of 32, Broad Street, living at 1, Augusta Road, Hammersmith—the statutory meeting of creditors was fixed for 19th December under the liquidation; and on 18th December I find that a petition in bankruptcy was presented against him by Mr. Feakes, a creditor; and on 3rd January he was adjudicated bankrupt on that peti<lb></lb>tion—on 21st January Mr. J. W. Close was appointed trustee—the act of bankruptcy was the liquidation petition—here is a statement of affairs filed by the bankrupt, showing liabilities 2,028<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and assets 515<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the furniture and fittings at the office at Broad Street are mentioned among the assets at 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the furniture at Augusta Road is estimated to produce nil, being covered by a bill of sale dated 24th November, 1879, and registered 29th November, 1879—I find that on 11th February there was a private sitting for the examination of the bankrupt and others—the transcript of the shorthand writer's notes is here—I also find an Order of Court of March 9 setting aside the bill of sale.</p>

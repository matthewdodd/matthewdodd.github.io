             sworn. - I am an artist.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way? - A. Drawing: On Monday evening, the 10th of this month, about half past seven in the evening, I was coming up the Minories from Tower-hill, when I was within twelve yards of Mr. Buttenshaw's house, I heard a great noise of breaking the glass, and in two minutes saw the prisoner meet a man in the middle of the crossing, and give him a piece of cloth; he came towards Mr. Carey and me, and upon seeing him give the cloth to the other man, I supposed he was the person that stole it; I went after him some short distance back, when Mr. Carey collared him; I took hold on the other side, and brought him back to Mr. Buttenshaw's.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the prisoner from where you heard the noise of breaking the glass? - A. I suppose five or ten yards, I did not take notice of the window.</p>
               <p>- BUTTON sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Buttenshaw: I was in the back part of the shop, on the 10th of February, in the evening; I heard a violent breaking of the glass; I immediately ran forward to the door, and when I opened the door, I saw a very tall man running on the other side, crossing the road, not the prisoner; he ran down the Minories, about two hundred yards; I immediately pursued him all the way, he crossed Rosemary-lane, into Queen-street, and when he found that I gained upon him, he threw away a piece of Irish cloth that he had under his arm, it was Mr. Buttenshaw's cloth; I brought it back, and gave it to the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. In what state was the pane of glass? - A. Hardly a bit of glass remaining in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Artillery Arms public-house in Rochester row. My house stands in two parishes—the part that was broken is in the parish of St. John the Evangelist, Westminster—I am not positive that it is not called St. John only—on the 31st of March I went to bed at a quarter before two o'clock, and I fastened up the house—I and my wife were the last persons up—we both went to bed at the same time—I had left about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in copper, and some silver, in the till, and there was some silver in a desk at the end of the counter—I was alarmed about four o'clock in the morning by the police—it was quite dark—I found the street door on the spring-lock—I had left it bolted—I assisted the police in searching the premises—I found a skylight in my wash-house broken open, and a clothes-prop had been down the hole, which propped up the skylight, that would enable a person to get in—it was shut to night before—after a person came in at the skylight, he would come to the bar—a pane of glass was taken out of the bar window, the fastening un<lb></lb>done inside, and the sash shoved aside, which would enable him to get into the bar—it was all fast over-night—I missed my till from the bar, and found it in the kitchen, and all the contents gone, and the silver from the desk—I had a crown-piece of Charles the Second, two old shillings, one old sixpence, and a silver medal, in my desk—the pri<lb></lb>soner was brought into the house shortly afterwards, and searched—all the silver and old coin, the crown-piece of Charles the Second, and the medal were found about his person, also a piece of paper which the old coin and medal had been wrapped in—it was a memorandum—I have not doubt of the medal and coins being what I lost.</p>

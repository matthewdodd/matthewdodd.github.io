            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 14th of February, I received information that some boots had been offered for sale at a public-house, Union-street, St. James's. I went with the first witness and asked the landlord if same boots had not been offered for sale there. I then went to a place where a man had offered a pair of boots; it turned out to be the prosecutors. That man is not here. I found they were a pair that were lost. I came back to the public-house; the landlord told me of the prisoner, Clark. I came back to the public-house; and took the the prisoner, Clark, in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What day was that - A. On the 14th of February, at ten o'clock at night. I challenged him about the boots; he said he sold them to this man, coachman to Lady Jersey. I told him he had other pairs of boots at home; he acknowledged he had, and told me to whom he had sold them. I searched his person; on him I found three watches. I took him to the watchhouse. I went and searched his lodging; there I found a fourth watch. One of the four watches has been owned; it was stolen from a coachman. I found also thirteen bad three-shilling tokens, and two padlock keys. I asked him of whom he had received the boots; he told me he had bought the boots of the witness Joseph. The next day I took Joseph into custody; in his bag I found two pair of boots. He is admitted an evidence. He then charged the two prisoners, Clements. I went with him and an officer of the name of Johnson to the house of

I searched his place, and in a drawer I found forty-three skeleton keys, an iron crow, a dark lanthorn, some phosphorus, and a wax taper.

I paid him ten pounds down, and two pounds ten shillings I paid him the next day.

            ' Defence. All the knowledge I had of Joseph was buying clothes of him for my own wear, and respecting the implements, the iron crow is said to be found in a place of mine; the place has never been proved to be mine; and respecting the keys, there has never been but one of them filed; my landlord gave it me. They are produced to prejudice the case, and to correspond with the Jew's evidence. However, finding implements in a man's possession is not proof of a burglary.</p>
               <p>Clark's Defence. I bought the boots of Joseph; he told me he bought them at a sale.</p>

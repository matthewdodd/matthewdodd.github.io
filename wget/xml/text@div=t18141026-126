            . I in company with Hutchins on the 4th of October. The prisoner came past us between eight and nine o'clock. We heard the cry of stop thief. We run up towards him; he dropped the coat. Hutchins picked up the coat; I got hold of the prisoner by the collar, and pushed him into a house; we both fell together. In his struggling he got away, He got up stairs into the house; he there got out of the garret window, and got on the top of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181410260066"></xptr>of the houses. A gentleman of the name of Rummer got out of his house, and brought him down. We secured him and took him before the magistrate; this is the coat.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. This is my coat.</p>
               <p>Mr. RUMMER. I live in Golden-lane. On the morning of the 4th of October, I heard there was a thief in the lane. I went to the door, the mob said he was on the top of the houses. I ascended out of the skylight of my own house; I ransacked the roof of four houses; I saw nothing of the the prisoner; there was an empty house next to these houses. I got into the garret window, and opened a closet, there I found the prisoner in the closet, with the door closed upon him. I brought him down, and delivered him to the officers; the prisoner told me he had a wife and four children. He has neither wife or children.</p>

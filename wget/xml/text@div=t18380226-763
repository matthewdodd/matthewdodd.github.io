                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Kirk, and live at No. 17, Gough-street, in the parish of St. Pancras. On Monday, the 5th of Febru<lb></lb>ary, I went to bed at half-past twelve o'clock—the parlour shutters were fastened, and the window—I got up the following morning, and went out at twenty minutes after seven o'clock, and found the shutters open—I had not been disturbed in the night-time—I found a pane of glass broken in the window, and a dozen umbrellas taken out—they had been safe the night before, within twelve inches of the broken glass—we rent the whole house, but have lodgers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the witness's son. On the morning of the 6th I examined the window shutters, and saw a mark near the bottom, as if it had been forced by a chisel—the umbrellas which were taken belong to me—(<hi rend="italic">looking at some</hi>)—these seven are all my property—I had seen them on the afternoon of the 5th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the 7th of February I went to the prisoner's premises, about eleven o'clock, and searched them—I found these seven umbrellas there, and no more—three of them were in the par<lb></lb>lour at the back of the shop; and four, including one with a white handle, up stairs, behind the bed in the front room—they were put into a corner, be<lb></lb>tween the washing-stand and the bed—it was a Waterloo bedstead, which was down—the other three, which were down stairs in the parlour, were between a chest of drawers and a cupboard, in a very narrow space, entirely out of sight till I looked into the nook—they were loose—I asked the prisoner where he got them from—he hesitated a long while, and then said he got them from a man in Petticoat-lane, in the way of trade—his wife said, in his presence, that they occupied but one more room up stairs, and that was an empty one—in about ten minutes the prisoner said there was a room up stairs, partly occupied by himself, and partly by his brother, named Young—he did not say when he got the umbrellas.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James White, of 43, Baker Street, Stepney—on 19th January, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, I was in the Mile End Road—the prisoner came up to me and said something about telling my fortune—I said "I wish to have nothing to say to you, you had better walk away"—she said "Well, you are a very flash lady; if you are not careful, I will have all you have got"—I said to a gentleman passing "Will you please to tell a constable?"—there was one on the other side of the way—she then struck me several times in the face and tore my chain off my neck—I resisted her getting my watch—she then stole my purse out of my hand—she twisted my hand round and I let go of it, it con<lb></lb>tained 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when the prisoner came up she had got my watch in her hands and I struggled with her and got my chain back—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my watch, it is worth 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical student—I live in Nicholls Street, Mile End Road—on the 19th January I was passing along, my attention was attracted by hearing the prisoner say "I will hare everything you have got, if you don't mind"—I turned round and saw her hit the prosecutor in the eye, and at the same time seize at her watch—I shouted for the police—I never laid hands on the prisoner—the police came up and I advised the prosecutrix to give her in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Then you did not interfere at all? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I stood by to see that she did not get away, but did not lay my hands upon her—when she saw the police come up she ran out into the road, but she came back again; I could not swear she was drunk, I thought afterwards that she pretended to be so—I was there all the time—I was walking by the prose<lb></lb>cutrix's side, not with her, I did not know her; I don't think I spoke to her; I can't remember—I had not been walking by her side five yards; I don't remember speaking to her—I won't swear I had not—I did not hear the first part of it about the fortune telling—I was Walking by the side of the prosecutrix when the police came up, within a yard or a yard and a half of her side.</p>

I live at Walworth Common—on the night of 18th January, I was with the prisoner and her husband in the Swan public-house, Mile End Road, until the house was closed and they would serve no more, the prisoner was tipsy and quarrelsome—I saw the prosecutrix in the Mile End Road, arm in arm with a young man, I could not say positively it was the witness, it was very much like him; the prisoner was tipsy and abused her; the said "Go home, young man, be advised by me; go home, you are in bad company"—the prosecutrix said "I will give you in charge"—I have known the prisoner ten years as a respectable woman—I was close to her when this occurred, her husband had gone on ahead—I did not see her attempt to take the prosecutrix's watch, or yet touch her.</p>

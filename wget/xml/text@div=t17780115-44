               <p>I am a porter to the prosecutors; the prisoner was sent to the warehouse to lower some cheeses, to prevent their cracking; when he came back, I went to the warehouse to examine the doors, to see if they were fast, and missed three cheeses; I suspected him; I thought he might have concealed some in the yard; I went there and saw three cheeses covered with a little straw, in the corner of the yard, close against the warehouse wall. I was set to watch who came to take them away; and about twenty minutes after, the shop was shut; I saw the prisoner come and take the cheeses, and Mr. Trapp laid hold of him and secured him with the cheese upon him. I ran to Mr. Trapp's assistance.</p>
               <p>[The cheeses were produced in court, and deposed to.]</p>

               <p>I was sent by Mr. Hicks to the warehouse to bring these cheese to the shop; the wind blew my candle out; I laid them down and forgot to go for them till after the shop was shut; and then I went to fetch them in, and my master laid hold of me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

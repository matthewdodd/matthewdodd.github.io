On the 2d of February, about one o'clock, I marked a piece of silk serge, which measured about forty yards, and left it in the drawer - I left the prisoner in the shop; I returned about half-past two, and found some of it cut off. In the evening I went to Snaith's shop, looked at some pieces of serge, and bought one yard and a quarter of him, which I knew to be mine by the mark. On the Thursday following I marked another piece, and missed some of it about the same time - I afterwards saw it in the officer's possession. I afterwards saw Thomas, he said he had not been to Snaith's for twelve months; at last he said he was there.</p>

            . I am the prosecutors' clerk. On 4th of February I went with Plank, and stationed myself at the corner of King-street - I had a view of Snaith's house, which is in King-street. In about ten minutes I saw Thomas cross the street, and go into Snaith's shop. We went round a little way, and then went into the shop, Plank told Snaith that a tailor in the neighbourhood had been robbed repeatedly, and he suspected the stolen goods were sold to him. I saw a piece of serge on the counter with our private mark on it, and told Plank that that was the piece which had been stolen that day. He said he could not tell who he bought it off, as so many people came to his shop it was impossible for him to say when he bought it. Plank said, "you must know, the person has not gone out above ten minutes." He said he did not think he should know the man again.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Dickens, and saw the prisoner, Thomas, came out of the prosecutors', and followed him to Snaith's. I went in myself in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181904210071"></xptr>about five minutes, he was then gone; I asked Snaith if he had bought any silk serge? he said he sometimes bought such things, but not very lately. I described the dress and height of the prisoner; he said no such person had been to his shop, and he did not know such a person. Dickens claimed the serge which was on the counter; Snaith said he did not know who he bought it of. He said it was impossible for him to know any body, and he had something else to do besides looking at their persons. I was desirous of fetching Thomas, but he said it was of no use. I took Snaith into custody. I afterwards took Thomas to the office - Snaith denied all knowledge of him. Thomas said he took the serge, and sold it to Snaith. Snaith made no answer.</p>

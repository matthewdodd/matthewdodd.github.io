                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Bradshaw, of 20, Han<lb></lb>cock Road, in the parish of Bromley—on 21st June between one and two in the night I was waiting for my husband, and was lying on my bed with my baby—I heard a noise and then heard a fall—I went down stairs and unlocked the parlour door, but could not get it open—I opened the street door, and then forced open the parlour door a little way and found some chairs were placed against it—the back parlour window was thrown up and a square of glass was broken, which gives light to the shop, it had been cracked previously—the padlock was wrenched off the door leading from the parlour into the shop, but it was not unlocked—I ran into the street and gave an alarm—I found the shop in great confusion, and missed a Dutch cheese, one pound of coffee, a bottle of sweetmeats, eight bottles of ginger beer, and other articles, valued 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I know all the prisoners, but</p>

               <p>have not seen much of Leary—Daniels tried to break into our shop once before, but I let him see me—Daniels and Turner had been there overnight—Daniels asked for one pennyworth of bread, and a half-pennyworth of Dutch cheese—about eleven o'clock next day Turner came in and I said "You are just the boy I want"—he said "Why do you want me, I did not break into your shop, and I told them they ought to be ashamed of themselves for doing so"—he did not say who "them" meant—I said "If you did not do it, you know who did, and you are as bad, very likely, as them," and gave him in custody—the constable showed me the label of a sweetmeat bottle, but I could not swear to it.</p>

I examined the prosecutor's house, and found that the back parlour window catch had been forced back—there was the mark of a knife on the window pane—I know Daniels and Turner—I saw them together the night previous at 8.30 or 8.45—I found Turner in the shop, detained by Mrs. Bradshaw—after he had been at the station a short time, he said, "I will tell you the truth—all about it; after I saw you, I went home and did not see anything of them till next morning, it was Leary and Thoroughgood who broke into the shop"—I went to a dust yard frequented by these boys—and found several pieces of cheese and part of a quartern loaf.</p>

From information I received, I went to the dust yard about noon, and saw Daniels about thirty yards from the yard—I told him I wanted him far being concerned with other boys in breaking into Mr. Bradshaw's shop—he said that he did not break in, but he went down to the dust yard about half-past five and helped to eat the things that the other boys had stolen from Mrs. Brad<lb></lb>shaw's.</p>

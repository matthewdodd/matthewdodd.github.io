                  </hi>. I am acting inspector of letter carriers at the Southern District Post-office, Westminster-road—the prisoner was an auxiliary letter carrier in that office—he had also to sort letters—on 14th January he was employed there from a quarter past 5 till he had completed his 8 o'clock delivery, which would be about a quarter before 9—it was always very light on his walk—on the evening of the 14th he was engaged in sorting letters—I observed him clearing his own letters; taking them from the sorting-boxes to his own table, which we do not allow—I stopped him, and told him to let the regular man do it—I watched an opportunity, looked at the letters in his box, and found two thick letters which were not in his delivery, but which he had sorted to himself—he arranges the letters</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270084"></xptr>
               <p>for his delivery himself—there are thirteen men who sort the letters into the different walks, and he sorts together with the others into the sorting-boxes, and two men are employed to collect them to their own tables—the prisoner would sort letters to any walk, or all the walks—each carrier then goes to his sent or table and arranges the letters for delivery—the prisoner was not one of those two men who had any right to collect for his own table—there are three roads for the country letters; the Norwood, the Croydon, and the Carshalton—there was one thick letter for Clapham, and a letter for Mr. Morgan, of the Waterloo-road walk, which he sorted to his own walk, the Vauxhall walk—I put those letters back into the sorting-box, and allowed the regular man to collect them and take them round to his walk—they ought not to have been in the prisoner's walk—that excited my suspicion, and about twenty minutes after that I called him to take a Croydon bag to the cart downstairs, and in the mean time I went to his letters, because I thought perhaps he might have missorted them, but these two thick letters were still among his, at his seat—I took no notice of it, and each man tied his letters up and went out on delivery, and just before the prisoner went downstairs I called him, and said, "I want to examine your letters"—he took them from under his great coat, and I found these two thick ones, and five or six others which belonged to other men's walks, among his own—I told him that he ought to be ashamed of himself, and I should not allow him to go out on delivery—I sent some one else out with the letters, and then said, "Have you any more letters in your possession?"—I think he said, "Mr. Shooter, you are very hard; very severe," and he took out of his pocket nineteen letters, and handed them to me—I have some of the envelopes here, the letters have been delivered—they were not on his walk—some were for Croydon, and some for Carshalton—they bear the post-office mark of that day—they ought to have gone out at that time—the dispatch to the country was at a quarter before 8—some of them were Brixton, Streatham, Merton, and South Lambeth—I do not think any of them bore two stamps—these are they (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—when he produced them I said, "I have sent for a police-constable"—I asked him if he had any more, and he took out this packet, addressed to "Sim, Esq., Nonsuch-park, Cheam," containing a silver breast-pin—that also ought to have gone by the same delivery—it bears the Epsom post-mark of that day and the London poet-mark also, showing that it had been posted at Epsom, and had come through our office—an officer came and I gave the prisoner in custody and followed him to the station—Dawson searched him in my presence, and took from him a letter addressed to Mrs. Bullen—it was open—it seemed to have been the contents of another letter—there was no envelope—it contained a money order for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Dawson also produced an envelope addressed to some one at Hastings—I do not know the name—among the nineteen letters found in his pocket was one to "R. Titman, Croydon barracks," in which I found the halves of four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—there was another letter addressed to Mrs. Detman of Lambeth—I delivered that to her and saw it opened—it contained a sixpence—I took the packet contain<lb></lb>ing the pin to Mr. Sim, who opened it in my presence—when I told the prisoner he ought to be ashamed of himself—he said, "I can't think what I have been about."</p>

In the summer I went to France, and left the-prisoner and his wife in care of my house and furniture, which I kept an inventory of. I returned about the latter end of October, and missed the articles stated in the indictment. I went to the prisoner's lodgings and found them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was absent five weeks.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280063"></xptr>Q.Was any demand made by him for wages-A. Yes; He summoned me, before he left, for wages. When he left he asked me to search his boxes.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH DAVIS. I am char-woman to the prosecutor. The prisoner and his wife were left in care of the house. Before the prosecutor left, they cut off a piece of baize which laid over the carpet, as it was too large. The same piece was found in his trunk.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he say anything to you about any furniture - A.Before the prosecutor left, he came into the kitchen when the prisoner's children were there, and asked whose children they were; the prisoner's wife said they were mine. Next morning I asked her, in the prisoner's presence, how she could say so; she said if I would take an empty room, she would furnish it, and supply me with coals and candles, if I would keep her children out of the prosecutor's sight, which I refused.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the prisoner before that night - A. No. The next morning he made the proposition to me.</p>

             to come into the cabbin. I have the account of three inches dry, and some five, some six. There were six casks spiled.</p>
               <p>Court. Could they get at so many on opening the forecastle door? - Yes, a great many more, forty or fifty, I believe; they had all over the ship when they got into the door, both fore and aft.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Might not some of this brandy have leaked? - The officers might have been there, for what I know; they were the men who informed me of the door being open.</p>
               <p>These men behaved well while they were on board your ship? - Very well, indeed: I never saw any thing amiss of them.</p>
               <p>If you expose liquors these men will get at them? - They had plenty of liquors of their own to drink, I believe.</p>

               <p>I was a seaman on board the Nymph, the day that we arrived on Monday the 13th of this month, towards the evening, the prisoner and me together sent on shore two half anchors of brandy, it was drawn out of large casks in different parts of the hold; when we came up to the Hermitage on the 17th, I went into the hold by myself first, I spiled a cask, and found afterwards I could not get the bottle to the cask, I put in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290168"></xptr> spite to the head;

             came in to me and asked me what I was doing, he said you had better have a light, I said no, he said he would have one, and, to the best of my knowledge, it was Colvin that gave it him in a dark lanthorn; that day we took out about three gallons, hardly so much; on the 18th, the night after I came out, Davis and Colvin went in again with a half anchor, they did not fill it quite, I went with Sutherland on shore to Mr. Tate's house, with a bladder containing about three quarts, and he had another; Mrs. Tate's sister received it.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any money for it? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you receive at any time any money? - Yes, on the Tuesday I received about half a guinea for the brandy, and two shillings son the tobacco.</p>
               <p>What did you with the money you received? - I kept it, laid it out, and spent it; on the 18th Davis and Sutherland went on shore, and brought as much money as came to eighteen shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>What quantity of liquor might you send on shore while you lay in the river? - Eight gallons at first, and about three gallons that I drew off, and three gallons and a half that Colvin and Davis drew off; the money was divided down in the forecastle.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. You say when you was about this business at first Davis asked you what you was about, you told him, and he told you, you had better have a light, and Colvin brought you one? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you say you spent all the money? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Davis. I do not chuse to speak before the prosecutor and the witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court. You are too late now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. These liquors we are accused with, we bought at Ostend out of an outlandish vessel, ten gallons of brandy, which we stowed in the hold, and we could not get at it without breaking this forecastle door, we were going to stow a tier of brandies where this liquor that we had stowed in the forecastle was, we were not allowed to bring any liquors in the ship; when we came to Cuckold's Point, we put it on shore and sold it, I went and took the money and came on board with it, and then from thence we went to the moorings, the officers came on board to search the ship, and asked for the keys of our chests, and what trifle of liquors we had, and this tobacco was brought upon deck; Mr. Sebre saw it, and there was so little of it, he said it was not worth while to take it from us, as we was poor fellows; on Sunday evening we were on shore, and Dighton went down into the forecastle, and saw the door, he called this man into the forecastle, and offered him two guineas and a half, and made him almost drunk, if he would say we took liquors out of the cargo, then he sent for Tilbury, he went to the captain's house, then they took him to the Justice's, and he was sworn, he was locked up till we were fetched by the runners, and when we went into the place where Tilbury was, he was crying, and said he was distracted: deny it if you can!</p>
               <p>Tilbury. I do deny it with a safe conscience.</p>
               <p>Davis. And while you was in Clerkenwell, the Captain was there with you, and gave you a guinea, and told you to keep your heart up, for them villains would hang you if they could, but to stand to your integrity; it is nothing but bribery, and a malicious information.</p>

               <p>After we moored the vessel we had two half anchors of brandy, which I bought with my money; they were to have a share, Davis went on shore and received the money, afterwards, the mate he spoke to the man, then Sebree came on board to inspect, and they would not let us go below, then they went and overhauled our little property, he ordered every thing upon deck, and seeing it was so trifling, he said you may take it back; after Sebree went away the mate came and abused every one of us, says he, you rascals you want to have the vessel seized; says I, take care of yourself, I must be a bad man to go and swear that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178310290169"></xptr> was the ship's cargo; this man seeing us run things that were our own, he wants to make the Caption believe that they belonged to our cargo; if the Captain and the Mate could take away our lives to clear themselves, they would; I never spiled any cask, nor took one drop of brandy but my own, I have sailed with Captain

               <p>Court to Dighton. How many does your crew consist of? - There was no other man on board but this Heburge, who was a passenger, there was Tilbury and these three men that were before the mast, two boys, the captain and myself.</p>
               <p>Was there any danger of the ship being seized for any thing? - There was danger by these half anchors that these people brought; if Sebree had found them, I do not doubt but they might have seized the ship, they said they should catch me and the Captain some time or other; and if they did, we might depend upon it that they would seize the ship; I never gave Heburge any liquors.</p>

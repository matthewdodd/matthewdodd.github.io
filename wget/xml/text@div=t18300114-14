            . I am the prosecutor's son. On the 4th of January I followed the prisoner's father to No. 40, Berwick-street; I saw the prisoner came out of the house, followed him till a Police-officer come by, and then gave him in charge - we had been looking for him ever since he left, but could not find him; he made the statement to my father in my presence - no threat or promise was used; he said he had sold the watch to a sailor for 30s.</p>
               <p>JOHN TREVY. I am a Police-officer. The prisoner was given into my charge, in Well-street, on the 4th of January; he said, "I am done for - I have robbed the best of master's; he has been a father and a master to me."</p>

On the 24th of August, a little after eight in the morning, I left my watch in the privy, and in less than half an hour I recollected I had left my watch there, I went to the privy, it was gone. The privy is in the yard; there are two gates that open to the road. The prisoner was in the public house that day. I missed my watch about eight o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner. - A. He is a <rs id="t18070916-77-deflabel402" type="occupation">carpenter</rs>

I asked the prisoner if he had seen any thing of my watch, he said he had not, if he had he would give it me; immediately he left the house. In consequence of information, I pursued the prisoner, brought him back; he was searched, and the watch was found upon him. I have known this man eight years, I never heard any thing against him before.</p>

               <p>The watch produced and identified.</p>

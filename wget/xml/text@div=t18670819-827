                  </hi> I am a furnaceman, and live at 14, Wellington Street, Greenwich—on Saturday night, 27th July, about ten o'clock, I was in Trafalgar Road with my wife, going home—I had four two-shilling pieces in my right hand—the prisoner touched me on the shoulder and asked if I wanted any tobacco—I said no, and walked on—he walked by my side about 150 yards—he said he had several canisters of tobacco to sell—I said I did not require any—he then made a dead stop and said, "Here is a ring I can sell you cheap, it is worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and I can sell it to you for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said I did not want it—he said, "Here, look at it"—he placed it in my right hand, snatched the four two-shilling pieces, and ran away—I and my wife ran after him, but lost sight of him—in about a quarter of an hour I saw him again in company with another iu Bear Lane, about 200 yards from where I had seen him—he saw me and ran away down East Lane towards the waterside—I ran after him and came up to him, and asked him for my money—he said he had spent the b—money, and took several oaths that if we followed him he would chuck us overboard—this is the ring he put into my hand—I am sure he is the man.</p>

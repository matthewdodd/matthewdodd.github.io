            . I am an officer. On Saturday last, between twelve and one o'clock, the prosecutor with one watchman brought the prisoner into the watchhouse; the prosecutor produced this two pound note, stating that this was one of the notes among others that the prisoner had robbed him of; he gave charge of her for a street robbery. I have kept the note.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I have traced this two pound note to Mr. Ireland; he said he changed notes frequently for the prisoner, she was a good customer to the shop, he thought her a suspicious character; he could not say whether he changed the note for her or not.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Ireland. Did all this conversation pass - A. I do not know from whom I took it; the prisoner was a customer, consequently I could not say otherwise. He described a person to me which turned out not to be the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not true. Do you deal generally with suspicious characters - A. No. He described her as a handsome woman; I leave it to your lordship to say whether she is a handsome woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, I am perfectly innocent; that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181201150035"></xptr>man has taken me for another woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Mare-street, Hackney, and am agent to Mr. Moore, the owner of the house, 18, Ann's-terrace. The prisoner Walker called on me on 25th June, to ask about the house I had to let—the rent was 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum—I asked for references, and agreed to let him the house, subject to the references being satisfactory—he referred me to Mr. Palmer, 15, Milman-street, Bedford-square, and to Mr. Stevens, 18, Penton-street, Pentonville—I went to 18, Penton-street, next day—Mr. Stevens was not at home—I saw the prisoner Buckle—she told me her name was Mrs. Stevens, that Mr. Stevens was out, but perhaps she could do as well—I told her I came to inquire the character of a man named Walker—she said he had lived in a house of theirs in the Wandsworth-road for twelve years, they had always found him a very good tenant, and I should do the same—I do not recollect whether there was any name up at the house in Penton-street—I went to Milman-street, where I saw the prisoner Stainbridge—he came into the room—I said, "Mr. Palmer?"—he said, "Yes"—I said I was referred to him by a Mr. Walker, who was about to take a house of me—he said I should find him a very good tenant; he had known him many years, and he was stopping in his house till he could get into this house of mine—he said he had come from the country, and he brought him into the room afterwards—in consequence of this I took Walker as a tenant—he took possession, I think, on 28th or 29th of June—I was told by the police that the house was empty on 30th Sept.—Walker had called on me a few days previously to ask if the landlord would sell the house—he said his wife would give 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I</p>

Josiah Viney—I am agent for other houses—I generally send my clerk to inquire about the references, but in this case I went myself—I think the house in Milman-street was a ten-roomed house—it had a plate on the door, with the name "Palmer" on it, very much rubbed—I saw Stainbridge, and thought him a respectable man—I never saw him before—I am able to speak to his being the man—I recollected him when I saw him at the police-station—I said, "That is Walker"—I then saw Palmer or Stainbridge—I had not seen him before that I know of—when he was at the station he was dressed as he is now—when I saw him at the house he was dressed very genteely, like a gentleman—it was a week before quarter-day that Walker called on me to ask if the landlord would sell the house—I referred him at once to a Mr. Newby; he holds the ground-rent; he let it to the Rev. Josiah Viney, and he let it again to Mr. Moore—the key of the house was sent to me by the parcels' Delivery Company three or four days after they left—it was directed to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 100, Wood Street, Cheapside, and am a silk buyer—on 29th November, 1866, I was married to Louisa Maude Owen, at St. Saviour's Church, Haverstock Hill—in February, 1867, we were residing at 6, Durnford Villas, Wandsworth, and continued to do so till the following November—in the month of August, in company with my wife and Mr. Searle, I rowed up the river to Oxford—I left my wife's cousin, Fanny Searle, and the servant in charge of my house—at that time I was under the impression that my wife was with child—we were at Oxford on Saturday, 17th August—my wife had been unwell for a day or two prior to that, and on the Saturday she left me to return to town; I saw her off by the train—Mr. Searle and I remained behind to bring the boat back—by the following Wednesday we had rowed as far as Windsor—from there I sent a telegram to my wife and received one—I arrived home on Wednesday the 21st, and found my wife in bed—Mrs. Skeplehorn was with her and a baby—I, of course, congratulated my wife upon her safe delivery—the child was shown to me, and Mrs. Skeplehorn congratulated me on my wife's being confined; she presented the child to me, and said it was very much like me—I first saw William Skeplehorn a day or two afterwards in my kitchen—he congratulated me on the birth of the child, and made a similar remark to that his wife had done; he also told me he was out of work, and could I give him some old clothes, or be of some assistance to him—I gave money for the nurse; it was arranged to be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—I paid the first part of the money to my wife, in the presence of Mrs. Skeplehorn; it was about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I certainly regarded the child as my own—it lived with me about six months, till February, 1868—I continued to support it till last November—in consequence of something I heard I went to 78, York Road, Lambeth, where the prisoners lived; that was about February or March, 1868; I went twice that day; I saw the wife on the first occasion in the afternoon; in consequence of what she said, I returned in the evening and then saw both the prisoners together—I insisted upon their telling me the truth of the transaction that had happened, that I was informed it was a false confinement, and the child was not mine, and that they were privy to it—Skeplehorn said that be should tell me nothing about it himself, that the proper person to apply</p>

               <p>I to was the midwife—I pressed him to tell me the name and address of the midwife—he refused to do so, stating that he did not know the address or the name—I told him that I felt certain he did, and the expression that his wife had made use of in the course of the afternoon confirmed me in that opinion—we had words—I pressed him very much—I was accom<lb></lb>panied by Mr. Searle—I went for a policeman—the inspector thought it was a case in which a policeman should not interfere, and I returned to the house again; I pressed Skeplehorn again, and he refused point blank to tell me anything at all—I told him it was a serious offence, and I should use my utmost efforts to make him tell the truth, and he said I might do my best or my worst—in November, 1869, I called again with Mr. Lewis, my solicitor—he tells me it was on 19th October—I saw them both together, the wife first, and the husband afterwards; they were both together at the end of the interview, and each heard what the other said—I pressed them again to acknowledge the truth of this; from the circumstances that had taken place I felt more certain now than before that it was a false con<lb></lb>finement, and they were perfectly cognisant of the facts—they said they would tell me nothing; they repeated the statement about finding the midwife—I threatened them several times with punishment, and they said when I brought them up it would be time enough to speak' the truth, and they did not care if they did get five years.</p>

I am head nurse at the Newington Workhouse—on Tuesday, 21st August, Mrs. Ironside called on me at the workhouse—the interview I had with her was alone; but I believe she was accompanied—in consequence of what passed between us I met her at the Waterloo Station, about 6 o'clock that evening (I had, to the best of my recollection, delivered a girl named Fanny Wood, at the workhouse, of a female child, on 29th July) we got out at Clapham Junction, and proceeded in a cab to her house, 6, Durnford Villas, Wandsworth—we called on our way at A butcher's shop, and purchased a sheep's pluck—at the house I found Mrs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a domestic servant, living at the Duchess of Clarence public-house, 141, Vauxhall Bridge Road, Pimlico—I am a single woman—on 28th or 29th July, 1867, I was delivered of a girl, in the Newington Workhouse, by Miss Medhurst—on Tuesday, 20th August, I was at the Lying-in Hospital, York Road, to be retained as a wet nurse—I saw Mrs. Ironside there and Mrs. Skeplehorn—Mrs. Ironside said she did not want a wet nurse; but she wanted to adopt a baby—she said she wanted a very fair child, and it must be a female—I was asked to give up my child—in consequence of this conversation, I took the child to 78, York Road, where the prisoners lived—I got there between 1 and 2 o'clock—I believe Mrs. Skeplehorn purchased some things for the child—she went out, and brought some things back—Mrs. Ironside was there—the child was dressed in the clothes that were brought in—Mrs. Skeplehorn dressed it—they were better clothes than the child had been wearing—I went with Mrs. Ironside to the Newington Workhouse, and came back again with her to 78, York Road—she left between 5 and 6 o'clock, leaving me and my child there—I saw Mr. Skeplehorn that night, in the kitchen, at his own house—he did not speak to me about the child—nothing particular—I left the child with Mrs. Skeplehorn, Mr. Skeplehorn being there—about three or four days afterwards, I went to 78, York Road again, to inquire about the child—I saw Mr. Skeplehorn, and asked if he knew how the baby was, and he said it was doing very nicely—six weeks afterwards I saw my child again, at 78, York Road, with Mrs. Ironside and Mrs. Skeplehorn—Mrs. Skeplehorn had the child, nursing it—Mrs. Ironside asked was I still in the same mind to give up the child—this is the child—(<hi rend="italic">The witness had it with her</hi>)—I received it this morning from Mrs. Ironside—I have not seen it since I saw it at 78, York Road, in Mrs. Skeplehorn's lap, until this morning—I am told it is the child; but, of course, I cannot tell—I believe it to be my child—I have been quite willing to take it back.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 3, Tenby Villas, Walthamstow—I accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Ironside to Oxford—in February or March, 1868, I called with Mr. Ironside at 78, York Road—we first saw the female prisoner, and in consequence of what she said we returned in the evening, and saw both prisoners—Mr. Ironside had a conversation with the male prisoner; he urged him to tell him the truth about this mock confinement, telling him it would be much better for him to do it eventually.</p>

                  </hi>. I am solicitor for the prosecution—last October I accompanied Mr. Ironside to 78, York Road, and 'saw the prisoners—Mr. Ironside said he had come to know the truth about the child—they were both very abusive, and said, "You had better go to the midwife"—I then said it was a very serious matter, and the truth must come out—I said, "It would be better for you to confess as it is a criminal offence."</p>

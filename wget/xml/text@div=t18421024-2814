                  </hi>. At the time of this transaction, I resided in Southwick Terrace, Paddington—I came there about October or November last year—I have been for some time separated from Lady Frankfort—I first saw the prisoner on the 26th of May, when she came to my house in company with a Miss Mitchell, about ten o'clock at night—I had six or seven minutes conversation with Miss Mitchell, partly in the first-floor hall, and partly in the drawing-room and the hall—the lights in the drawing-room had been put out, and I was up stairs about retiring to bed—the prisoner and Miss Mitchell both went away together—I said nothing to the prisoner on that occasion, nor she to me—I did not expect Miss Mitchell or the prisoner that evening—I next saw the prisoner on the 28th—it might be about twenty minutes past ten o'clock at night—she came to the house in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> alone—she ran up to the first-floor hall, just where I saw her before, and in about five minutes I came down—I was on the second-floor—I came down and found her just in the drawing-room, by the door—there was a light on the landing—I asked her what she had come for—she said she had come to see me and to stop—I at first said it was better for her not to stop—I said, "You may have friends at home who don't know where you may be"—she said she did not care, and she would stop—I kept the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> waiting till about one o'clock, and when she seemed resolved to stop, I went and sent the cab away, and she remained, and staid there till the night of the 22nd of July, passing the nights in the same room with me—I had not then the slightest reason to expect she was going—there was no quarrel or difference whatever between us—when she was with me I had in my possession two miniatures, one cost me 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—three china snuff-boxes, which I have always been told were matchless, no value could be set on them—I believe my solicitor has ascertained they would fetch 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each at a pawnbroker's—they were bought with other things, also a toothpick case—I can set no value on it—I always bought these things in a large mass—I bought about 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; worth at a time—I sent over to France and collected them—the toothpick case was worth more than 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was a gold snuff-box worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a gold enammelled watch-hook, worth 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think I gave 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—an opal-box worth more than 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a paper and penknife, worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a gold smelling-bottle worth 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., two etui cases, one worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the other 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I also missed other property—I never gave either of the articles I have named to the prisoner, nor permission to pawn or dispose of them in any way—they were kept in a wardrobe, where I kept my clothes, in the room in which I slept—she had access to them, as the drawer was open while I was m the room—it was not locked till I went out of the room—then I always locked it—I gave her a great number of things while with me—she brought no stock of clothes when she came—I had her supplied with articles of dress—she did not leave my house while with me, till she left finally.</p>

Q.</hi> Did Miss Mitchell come <hi rend="italic">to</hi> your house much while the prisoner was there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She might have come twice—I have no im<lb></lb>pression that she came more than twice—the prisoner offered her in my presence a small etui case—she had then lived with me about three days—I forbid her—I would not Jet her—it was not in a case, it was lying on the table—I said I would not allow any person to give that away—I have been in the army, and left when I became of age, in 1837—I was in the 10th Hussars, under Colonel Wyndham—Lord Londonderry is Colonel of the regiment.</p>

On the 22d of November I left the shop about half an hour after eight at night, and left my apprentice in it. There were a quantity of silver and metal watches in the window, and a glass case full of watches and cases: in the front there were about 44 or 45 watches in the front and window; in one case are 81 hooks, and in another 36, all full of watches and cases. What I have said in the indictment I am able to swear to: a gold watch, a watch with the inside metal, covered with shagreen, a watch with a gold dial plate, the inside and outside cases metal, and cover'd with tortoishel, 60 silver watches; there were more lost, I believe; and about 60 watch-cases. They had the maker's name upon some of them,

            15 pair of them were found upon the prisoner, some of which weighed two ounces and five pennyweights; they are marked upon the edge the same as the watches strap were out at the workmen's; and we have the movements to answer. I left all these things that I have mentioned in the shop, and my apprentice in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was there first in the morning?</p>
               <p>Turner. My apprentice; he went between seven and eight, and came again immediately to me, and told me the shop was broke open, and all the watches were gone. I immediately went to the shop and found it so. I thought most likely they might be heard of in Duke's-place. I went there to Mr. Howard, who keeps a coffee-house, and told him the case; and told him if he found any such things offered with which names and numbers, he should be obliged to him if he would let me know. Then I went to Sir

I went that night to goldsmith's hall, and got hand-bills sent out, and employed some of Sir John's men, but did not find any thing. My shop I found broke on the Thursday morning, and on the Friday, the day after, I had word from Mr. Howard to come to him. I went. He said, Mr. Turner, Have you lost any cases as well as watches? I said, a great many; said he, are any of them very heavy? I said, Yes, very remarkably so. Soon came in Mr. Keys the Constable. Mr. Howard said to him, where are them cases? He pulled them out tied up in a handkerchief; there seemed to be a large quantity of them; he put them on the table. I said these are all mine, I can swear to them. How came you by them? He said one

               <p>Q. How much might you lose?</p>
               <p>Turner. I think upwards of an hundred watches besides the cases. I cannot tell exactly my loss; it is above what I have put it in the indictment.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way do you think they got into your shop?</p>
               <p>Turner. The glass-case I found had been forced open with a chissel, which chissel they had left behind them. (Produced in court.). It fitted to the impressions made on the wood. I apprehend they must come in by a picklock or false key.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor, and am almost out of my time. On Wednesday the 22d of November, I left my master's shop about nine or a little after. I think the clock had struck before I came away. I left it safe.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of watches might there be in it?</p>
               <p>Wansler. I apprehend there might be about eighty watches of all sorts.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of cases?</p>
               <p>Wansler. There were some silver watch-cases that hung up along with these watches; we had intermixed them; there were a number of them; we generally hang them up so as soon as they come from the workman, who had them for springing and lining. There were some my master put in hand that night; I apprehend there might be fifty or sixty silver-cases. The cases were numbered on the edge, and the weight wrote on the inside.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you fasten the shop up before you left it?</p>
               <p>Wansler. I made it fast as I always do. I put all the pins and bars in, and double locked the door; for a farther proof the gentleman at the tavern was standing over the way; he observed I was more particular that night to double lock it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find it the next morning?</p>
               <p>Wansler. I went the next morning about eight o'clock. I put the key in. I could not think what was the matter; at last, turning and turning I gave a push and it opened. I expected to have found it double locked, and it was only single locked. When I went into the shop I found it was stripped; there were but three watches left in the window. I could hardly believe my eyes. I went over the way and told a young man that my master's shop had been robbed, and desired to know what I had best do; he advised me to open the shop, and lock the door, and go home and let my master know of it; which I did. I found a chissel on a nest of drawers which was put under the glass-case. My master came, and I was left to take care of the shop while he inquired about.</p>

             the prisoner came to me yesterday fortnight, between ten and eleven in the day; and asked me if I would buy any watches. I asked him where he got them; he told me he had not got them; upon that I insisted upon having them. He told me there was a man had some watches to sell; and my heart was so heavy, having lost<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060057"></xptr> two hundred pounds worth of watches, and I had taken a man up, and he was cleared before my lord-mayor. I thought these were my watches. He said he did not know who had got the watches. I said, be so good as to inquire after the man, and if they are mine I'll give you ten guineas reward; he went away, and so did I. At night between six and seven he came to my house, and told me there were two men in Petticoat-lane, at the Bull-head, with a parcel of goods, he could not tell what they were, and if I would go there I should have assistance with me to stop them. I went directly and desired my brother to go and stop them, and I would go and get assistance; he went away and left me. I went to Mr. Keys, and desired him to go with me. We desired him to stop at the corner of the court, and, when he heard me call, to come in at the door. I went in and saw a man just at the entry of the door at Henry Lazrous's house. I went in; there was Mr. Lazrous sitting, and two women making an apple-pye. Mr. Lazrous said, Look about, there are some goods placed there. I looked as he directed, and saw upon the dresser some watches. I took hold o f them, and said, these are my own goods that I have been robbed of. I called the officer. I saw a man run out. I and the officer followed him; we were not able to seize him. I went into the house again, and took the watches, and put them into my pocket. I then said to Keys, may be there may be more in the house; we went up stairs, but nothing was to be found; then we took the prisoner, and in carrying him to the Poultry Compter, we went in at a public house near the Mansion-house. I took the watches out and laid them on the table, and looked them over; then I said to Mr. Keys, I do not know what I must do, these are not my watches; so I delivered Mr. Lazrous over to the officer, and I went home: that is all I have got to say.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you not recollect more that passed between the prisoner and you concerning these watches?</p>
               <p>Levi. I cannot; I was in such a flurry, I was quite raving mad. I shall never forget my goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no conversation with the prisoner about a bargain which he had to sell?</p>
               <p>Levi. No, Sir, he did not know where they belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say to you there was no danger in buying them?</p>
               <p>Levi. No, he said nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing the watches brought down stairs in a hat?</p>
               <p>Levi. No, Sir; I can remember nothing about it, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell my lord-mayor about seeing a hat brought down full of cases?</p>
               <p>Levi. I can remember nothing about it, Sir, I was mad as could be. I thought I should have killed a woman in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the price the prisoner asked?</p>
               <p>Levi. He never asked a price for any thing.</p>
               <p>Hen. Keys. Last Thursday night, about seven or eight o'clock, the last evidence came to my house, and told me Lazrous Jacob had informed him there were two persons had a parcel of watches and watch-cases to sell. Levi desired my assistance. I went with a cutlass, and was very resolute to take them. Levi went in at the Bull-head. I was a little behind him; I heard him call out; there rushed out a man and ran away; I ran, but I fell down, or I should certainly have had him. I went in; there were some cases lying on the dresser. Mr. Lazrous said, God d - n you, if you had not made a noise, you might have taken the person. We went up stairs, and in the cellar to see if any others were secreted; we found nothing. Levi gave me charge of Lazrous, and said, may be he will give an account who brought them here. I brought him to the Compter. We went in at an alehouse: there Levi looked at the watches, and said, Lord, have mercy upon me, these are not my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say that Lazrous Jacob had offered some watches, and watch-cases to Levi to sell?</p>
               <p>Keys No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did, or did not Lazrous go up stairs, and bring down a hat full of watch-cases?</p>
               <p>Keys. I saw none, because I was not in the house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by, at that time?</p>
               <p>Keys. I was not in the house at first. When Levi had looked at them at the public house, and clapped his hands together, and said they were none of his; he gave them to me. There were fifteen double-cases and six boxes; the next morning I went to Mr. Howard's to look in the papers, if they were advertised, that the right owner might have them, and Mr. Howard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060058"></xptr> told me they belonged to Mr. Turner. He said Mr. Turner would be there presently. I went to Fenchurch-street, and when I returned Mr. Turner was come; he claimed them.</p>

               <p>Q. Do not you know of a treaty about selling these watches?</p>
               <p>Keys. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know who had them in their custody?</p>
               <p>Keys. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you very ill used?</p>
               <p>Keys. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you beaten by some-body?</p>
               <p>Keys. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The most material evidence I have is Mr. Morgan, my lord-mayor's clerk; he took the account in writing these two evidences gave there; they wanted to go back from their evidence, and Mr. Morgan said you have swore it, and how can you now deny it? Mr. Morgan is not here.</p>
               <p>Keys. My lord-mayor asked me if I saw these cases in the possession of the prisoner. I said, no; for there were two or three of them that I saw lying on the dresser.</p>

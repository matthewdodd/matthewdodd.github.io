               <p>Q. Was the door fast? - A. Yes; it was opened by a pick-lock or false key; I heard them come in and shut the door after them; I was sitting in my shop, and one of the officers with me; they might be some space of time in the passage; and then one of them says to the other, where are the matches and tinder.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear them say that? - A. Yes; and then they began to strike a light; I heard the flint strike against the steel; Mr. Hudson, the officer, that I had to guard me, gave me a shove, and I shoved the bolt, so that no man could come out of the house, and none could come in; it was a bolt I had fixed on purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that secure the door at which they had come in? - A. Yes; as soon as I had done it, Hudson knocked one of them down, or both, before the other officer came out of the other room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go into the passage? - A. Yes; and I went with him.</p>
               <p>Q.Who was the other officer? - A. One Austin.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had got into the passage, who did these two men turn out to be? - A. Those two gentlemen, (pointing to the prisoners); the other officer was concealed in a back room; and he came out with a lighted candle in one hand, and a pistol in the other, which was not discharged; and they were secured and handcuffed in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it dark? - A. The quarters had gone half past six some time before they came into the house; it was not seven, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. How light was it? - A. It was very dark out of doors.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it too dark to see their faces out of doors? - A. Yes; unless they stood against a lamp or a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. But you could not distinguish them by the light of the heavens? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What shop do you keep? - A. A chandler's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you could not see a man's face, if you were as near him as I am? - A. Not to know any man.</p>
               <p>Q. But could you see any man's face? - A. I could not, to see what face he had, or any thing about him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had two officers in your house, you know; you knew, perhaps, that upon the conviction of these persons, there would be two forty pounds reward? - A. I knew nothing at all of that; if you please, I will tell you why I had the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not want to know that; did you not know that there was a 40l. reward for the conviction of persons who break into houses? - A. I did not know any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear it? - A. I never had such a thing happen to me before; I have heard that there have been such things; but I don't know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know there is a reward given by the parish of Islington, for the convictions of those men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much is that? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it 30l.? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You have heard of a parliamentary reward of 40l. each, and the parish reward of 30l.; and you, you know, will be entitled to a share of it; now, upon your oath, will you take upon yourself to swear, that it was so dark you could not distinguish the person of a man? - A. It was so dark that I could not distinguish the feature; it was very cloudy.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my Lord just now, that you had fastened the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this had you fastened the door? - A. All the evening I kept it fast.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it fastened? - A. With a lock.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons live in your house? - A. Only my wife and myself; my wife was gone out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170022"></xptr>to chapel; she did not come home till after this happened.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had fastened the door, did you go out to chapel? - A. I let her out, and fastened the door after her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody else go out after that? - A. No; nor come in.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you fasten it? - A. With a lock.</p>
               <p>Q. After that did nobody else go out? - A. Not till after these gentlemen came in.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any woman, or any body else lived in your house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did nobody go to chapel with your wife? - A. Yes; there was a man went with her, he drank tea with us, and went out at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only security to the door all the night; do you fasten it any other way than pushing it to; was it bolted? - A. No; it was upon the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not fasten it more than at any other time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Then how do you know that it caught at that particular time, more than at any other time? - A. I am sure it was fast.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you never found, upon the shutting the door, that it has missed the catch? - A. Never; I always try it.</p>
               <p>Q. This door was never opened at all after you had so fastened it? - A. No; not till they broke in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never open this door any time at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not for above ten minutes now? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath it never was? - A. No; it never was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you said so before,at the Justice's, that after you had fastened it, it was open for above ten minutes before the prisoners were in your house? - A. Never; because it was never open from the time I fastened it after my wife, till the time the prisoners broke it open.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You heard them put the key into the door, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: I was at Mr. Are's on the 7th of February; as soon as ever Mrs. Are went out to chapel, the door was fastened; I tried it myself, and it was fast; she had got but a very little way from the house before somebody came and knocked at the door, very hard, and kicked with their feet, several times; then I heard somebody say, at the door, damn them, I suppose they don't serve of a Sunday; then a woman came by, I could hear her walk in pattens; the door is quite close to the edge of the pavement; in the course of a few minutes, somebody came and put pick-lock keys into the lock of the door; the door opened, and somebody came in; then they shut it; I heard one of the people that came in, ask the other for some tinder; I heard some paper rustle, and then they began to strike with the flint against the steel; the sparks began to fly very near my face; I was close to the door, close to the prisoners; there is no passage to the house, it is only a slight partition, put up of a Sunday, to separate the passage into the house from the shop; I made a motion to Mr. Are to shove a bolt that he, had contrived to keep the door from opening above five or six inches; he did not shove it the first time, and then I moved him again, he shoved it; and then I immediately began laying on with this staff upon the prisoners; one of them, in the scuffle, struck me with something, I believe a crow, that was found upon the ground afterwards; and then I struck against something very hard, like iron; and here is a dent in the truncheon that was not in it before. Austin, the other officer, was in the parlour, he came out with the light, and then we secured the prisoners; I secured Tait; I handcuffed him; and in searching him, I found this knife, it is a very dangerous knife, (produces it).</p>
               <p>Court. There is no particularity in the knife, excepting that it has a very strong spring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. What time in the evening was it? - A. Between half past six and seven.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been here before? - A. Not as an officer; I have been here, but not as an officer till now.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, of course, there is a 40l. reward? - A. I don't know any thing of it; this is the first year I have been an officer; I have heard it, but I don't know that this has any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. But you have heard of it? - A. Yes; I have heard that there is a 40l. reward for people breaking open houses.</p>
               <p>Q.But they did not break into this house, did they? - A. Yes, they did; but we did not find any property upon them.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you may have heard there is a reward given by the parish, as well as 40l. upon each of these men's heads? - A. I have heard of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is it? - A. Twenty or thirty pounds, I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was this? - A. A wetnight; it had been raining all the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Day-light of course was gone? - A. It was very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. As dark as at twelve o'clock at night? - A. It could not be much darker; it was a very wet night, and a very dull night.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure it was quite dark? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I was at Mr. Are's; on the 7th of February, between six and seven o'clock, somebody came and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179602170023"></xptr>knocked at the door ready to split the door almost, it seemed to be with their feet; and then somebody came and put a pick-lock key in the door; I heard it twice; I was in a back room in the house; directly afterwards I heard somebody in the passage striking a light; then a scuffle ensued with somebody; I judged it to be Mr. Hudson; and then I came out, and saw the two prisoners on the ground; I brought out a light with me.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Are you a constable? - A. Yes; I immediately secured Tabor, put the handcuffs on him, and searched him; I found in his pocket a dark lanthorn, and some tinder in a paper, and some tinder upon the ground; some matches, and a flint; and an iron crow lay between the two prisoners; these pick-lock keys, and a knife, I found in Tabor's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this? - A. Before they began to pick the lock, the half after six was gone; but they knocked at the door rather before that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark? - A. It had been dark an hour; the candles were lighted at half past five; the watch was hanging just by me.</p>
               <p>Tabor's defence. We were taking a walk round Islington fields, and went into a public-house to smoke a pipe together, and we went into this shop for some tobacco; we had no sooner touched the door than it opened; and then we were knocked down and secured; they found nothing upon me but my pocket knife, till they came to the watch-house, and there they found upon me these pick-lock keys, which I have no doubt they put into my pocket; for they make their brags, in public-houses about that neighbourhood, that they should get two forty and two thirty pounds reward, if we were convicted.</p>
               <p>Tait's defence; We went to take a walk in Islington fields, and we went into this chandler's-shop to buy some tobacco, the door came open immediately, and there was a man knocked us both down, and said we came with intent to rob the house; he found nothing upon me but two bad shillings.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Austin.) Where did you take these things from him? - A. I took the lanthorn from him in the passage; I rubbed him down the things; and when I came to the watch-house, I saw the pocket was made to hang quite behind, where the picklock keys were.</p>

On the 26th of September while I was going from London to Worcester the prisoner got into the waggon at about six miles from High Wycombe to go there; she afterwards got out, and said waggoner, I am going to do what nobody can do for me, and she went through the gap of an hedge into a field; she staid longer than I expected; when I had got some distance from the place I went to the tail of my waggon and saw a deal box broke open, and the things taken out; I went back in search of the prisoner, and took her with the things upon her; I charged a constable with her.</p>
               <p>(The things were produced in court by the constable, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner in her defence called several witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

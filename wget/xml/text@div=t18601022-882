On 30th September, about 2 o'clock in the morning, I was called to 36, Southampton-buildings—I searched the house, and saw some marks of whitewash on the window cill of the second-floor landing—I found the prisoner in a coal hole next door—his clothes were marked with whitewash—he said that he came there to sleep—I searched him, and found on him a quantity of matches (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they resemble those which I saw found in the house—they are common blue matches—the whitewash had come from the walls of No. 38 and 39.</p>

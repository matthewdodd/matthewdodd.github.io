               <p>Between twelve and one, I went in consequence of an information, to <placeName id="t17850406-54-crimeloc264">Craven-hill, near Bayswater</placeName>

               <p>Court. Did you examine the farthings with the dies? - No, I did not; round the press were a great quantity of farthings, and in the cutting press was a great quantity of cecil in blanks, here are some of the blanks: in the place was a hat hung up, which the prisoner Cheshire owned; the prisoners were very dirtily dressed, and their hands were very dirty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brown, Prisoner's Council. Was not this a kind of double house? - It is all under one roof.</p>
               <p>Are they not two distinct habitations? - They communicate with each other, by a door which opens into the garden.</p>
               <p>- BOWYER sworn.</p>
               <p>I went into this house, I remained with the two prisoners, while the rest went into the other house; I was present when Cheshire owned the hat, which was in the place where the press was, he put it on his head: I was told a woman had been at the house, I went to a public house, and there found her, she had these farthings upon her.</p>
               <p>- TRING sworn.</p>
               <p>I searched the prisoner Leach, and in his breeches pocket, I found these two half-pence and farthings.</p>

               <p>I went to this house, there were two presses fixed, one with blanks and cecil, the other with a pair of dies; one was to cut the blanks, the other to give the impression: these farthings were taken out of Leach's pocket, that is all I know about that part of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body that can tell that these presses had been for a certain time worked.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. There is no doubt, from the appearance of what lay round the presses, there was a candle hung under the man's hat, and there were droppings of candle grease under the hat; they had the appearance of just coming from dirty work.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>This house at Bayswater belonged to me, I was present there when the officers came, there are two houses which are separate one from the other; the small apartment consisting of six rooms; I let them to one tenant: on the 3d of February, I went into the house and not seeing any body there I went into the back apartment of the two rooms where the hole was dug, and I saw these presses then standing: the day the officers came, I heard thumping and noise, about half past eleven, then they left off: Cheshire had been there ever since before Christmas; Leach and the woman I never saw till the Saturday before they were taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Franklyn, one of the moniers of the mint, proved the farthings to be counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Court to Cheshire. How came your hat in that hole? - I lent my hat to a man that was in the place, he said, he would bring it again in two minutes; I am a smith.</p>

               <p>Court. How has your business been in general these last three months? - Very dead; I had seven or eight men at a time, I have scarcely enough for two now.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you know Cheshire about Christmas? - I was in Worcestershire then.</p>
               <p>Have you heard where he was in December? - I have not, I do not know.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Cheshire called two witnesses to his character; one of whom said, he heard he was in trouble, on a suspicion of making half-pence.</p>

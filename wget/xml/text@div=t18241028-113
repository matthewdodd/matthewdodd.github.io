            . I am a weaver. I live near Taylor, who lives at Bethnal-green. Nichols lives in George-street; I have known them ten years - I met Taylor by my own gate about eleven o'clock one morning last year - I cannot tell the month. - he said Nichols was coming with a seal, and they were going to Masters with it to sell. Nichols came up and produced a seal - they went together to Masters, who is a weaver, and called him out - I went with them; the seal had some letters on it; but I cannot tell what they were - I believe it was a gold seal - I believe they asked 25 s. for it. Masters said to me,</p>
               <p>"Do you think it worth the money" - I said</p>
               <p>"If it is a good one it is" - he did not buy it, and they went towards Brick-lane, to pawn it. I do not know whether they did or no. I was with Taylor about a week after in Bethnal-green road - a gentleman passed by, and Taylor said, that was the person they had flimped the other night; he did not say of what.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Have you had any quarrel with Nichols lately, and had him apprehended - A. Yes, about three weeks ago, for an assault - this conversation took place last year; I mentioned it at the office when he was taken up for the assault - I had mentioned it to Mr. Simmond the clerk, at the Thames Police-office, at the time of the robbery. I have myself been charged with a highway-robbery, in 1819, and acquitted.</p>

            . I am a weaver, and live in Bethnal-green. Taylor lived in the neighbourhood for two or three years, I was sitting one day last year at the end of my master's garden, eating my dinner - he came to me at the back of the pales, and said;</p>
               <p>"Charles, do you want to buy a seal" I said why - he said, he had one to dispose of for a man in distress - he did not shew it to me; nor did I buy it. I went out after I had done my work, and Clayton came to me and said -</p>
               <p>"What a fool you was not to buy that seal." Clayton has since told me that these men were innocent, and wanted me to swear false - he said he was sorry for what he had done, and wished me to agree in the same story to save himself.</p>

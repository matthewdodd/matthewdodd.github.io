                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of 424, Mile End Read—on 11th Au<lb></lb>gust, near 6 o'clock, I served Pake with a half-crown's worth of postage stamps—she gave me two shillings and a sixpence, and left—I threw them into the till where I keep stamp money—there was only a lot of sixpences, and four threepenny pieces there—Mr. Mead came in, not two minutes after wards, and from something he said, I took out the box, and there was only these two shillings, and the sixpences, and four threepenny pieces—I found one of the shillings was bad, and gave it to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, of 542, Mile End Road—on 11th August, about 5 o'clock, I served Pake with a twopenny cake of soap—she gave me a bad shilling—I broke it in three pieces, and threw it on the counter—I did not see what became of the pieces—I did not see them after she left—I told her it was bad—she said she was very sorry, and offered me a florin—I said I did not like the look of that—she said, "Here is another"—I sent it out to be changed, and it was good—I gave her the change, and followed her up the road—she joined Emery—they crossed the road twice, and then I saw Pake go to Noble's shop—as she came out, I went in and spoke to Noble—he examined his till, and there were only two shillings</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186909200024"></xptr>
               <p>there, one good and one bad—I followed, and saw the prisoners join against, and go up the road—I said to Pake, "A gentleman wants to speak to you"—she said "Oh, indeed"—I said "Yes, where you bought the stamps"—the went back with me, and Emery west away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did you break the first shilling in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the side of a desk—it broke immediately—I refused to take one florin, I did not like the look of it—Pake offered her purse—there was a lot of money in it, and she took out another florin, which I sent out to be changed—I will not swear I did not give her a shilling in change—there were shillings in my till, but I took the change which was brought back, kept 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and gave her the rest—I cannot tell, now, whether there were three six peaces, or a shilling and sixpence and copper.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 384).

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was the case remanded, to make inquiries about her character? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and I found nothing against her—her husband has kept the Prince of Wales public-house, Humbert Street, Commercial Road, but did not then.</p>

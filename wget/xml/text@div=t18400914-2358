                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Dickinson—he lives in John-street, Workhouse-lane, Stepney. I know the prisoner by my hus<lb></lb>band bringing him home, and feeding him when he was out of employ<lb></lb>ment—on the 3rd of September, the watch hung over the mantel-piece—I was going out, and met the prisoner coming in at the street-door—my little brother missed the watch, and fetched me from where I was at work—it is lost altogether—the prisoner got his living by making combs.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Potter's-court, Bow-common-lane. My sister, Eliza Dickinson, brought up the prisoner, and he sat down in a chair in her room, where I was—the watch was over the mantel-shelf—my sister went out, and in about two minutes the prisoner asked me for a light—I got him one, and met him about half-way across the room—he smoked his pipe for about three minutes—he then shook up his pocket, and said, "Let me see if I have got any change"—he pulled out of his pocket a band which goes round a hat—he said, "Is this any use?"—I said, "Yes, a little"—my little brother had it, and tied it round his head—the pri<lb></lb>soner then said, "Do you like apples?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "I will go and buy you some"—he then went down, and did not return—I missed the watch directly he was gone, and when my brother came home, I sent him to my sister—no one but the prisoner had been in the room.</p>

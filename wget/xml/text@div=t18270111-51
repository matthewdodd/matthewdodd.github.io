Between six and seven o'clock in the morning of the 1st of January, I was awoke by my servant - day-light had not appeared - I got up went down-stairs, and found my house had been entered at the scullery window, next the fields, by taking down a bar of the window; several pieces had been cut out of the kitchen-door by a centre-bit - the bell had been then taken down, and the bolts undone. I proceeded to the butler's pantry, where the plate in common use was kept, and missed fourteen silver tea-spoons, and a plated coffee-biggin; six of the spoons were worth 14s. each. I went to the library, which was open, and missed two guns, three great coats, and three hats - one of the hats belonged to Mr. Curtis: I missed five snuff-boxes and a flute from the drawing-room.</p>

I found the pantry had been rifled; both the closet locks were picked open, several things taken out and put on the pantry table, and several things of my own were taken - I found the dining-room closet had been entered by holes being bored through, and all the drawers in the sideboard were opened; the kitchen door had two holes bored through the pannel, a hand could then be put through to undo the bolt and lock - several things were taken from the drawing-room, and put in the scullery - some work-boxes had been opened and rifled, and left in the scullery. I missed fourteen tea-spoons, a great coat, a waistcoat, a pair of breeches, a hat, two pairs of gloves, a handkerchief, and a coffee biggin; and several snuff-boxes, two guns, a great coat, and other property, were taken from the library.</p>

            . I am high-constable of Isleworth. On Wednesday, the 3d of January, about noon, in consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's house, and saw him there - he lives at Witham, about four miles from Feltham; I told him I had a warrant to search his house, but should first search his person, for goods stolen from Mr. Burnell's - Hill, in my presence, found on him a very large bunch of keys, most of them skeleton-keys; I found another key, which Mr. Burnell claims as belonging to his dairy; and a small bunch of keys, which Mr. Burnell's servant claims - I found two centre-bits on his person, which I have compared with the holes in the pannel of the kitchen-door; they correspond exactly - I have brought the pannel here. I searched his house, and found this snuff-box, either on the mantel-shelf, or a shelf by the side of the fire - we also found several other things, which Mr. Burnell does not claim. I had searched the house before, and know that he lived there with his wife; I do not know of his having any lodgers - it is a cottage with only two rooms and a loft.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Pray what does the family consist of? A. I think I saw two or three children there - I believe he is a labourer when he has work - I have been a carpenter myself; I believe there are about twenty-five centre-bits in a set; there may be a hundred the same size as this.</p>

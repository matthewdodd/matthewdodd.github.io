I have a house, No. 15, in the same street, which was unoccupied - I was there on the Saturday, and on Tuesday morning the 11th of March, in consequence of information, I went there and found the gas fittings of the shop torn away from the shop first-floor, and a copper from the kitchen, which was fitted in brick-work. I found the prisoner in custody with them on the Tuesday; the door must have been opened with a false key.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. I took the prisoner on the 11th of March, about a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, in Russel-court, Drury-lane, with a copper on his head, tied up in a green baize; it appeared fresh from the brick-work. I asked where he got it, - he said, he was going to take it to Shoe-lane. I said,</p>
               <p>"That is no answer to my question" - He then said, a man<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182304090073"></xptr>gave it him to carry in Covent-garden-market. I detained him, and found the rest of the property in the copper. He said, he did not know what was in it. I found two keys and a brass cock upon him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do jobs about; and in Covent-garden, a man asked me to carry this to Shoe-lane. This man stopped me - I thought he asked me where I was going, instead of where I came from.</p>

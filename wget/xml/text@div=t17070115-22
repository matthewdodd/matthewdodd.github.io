The Prosecutor deposed, that enquiring of the Prisoner for the Gelding, the Prisoner said he could help him to it, for he had one in his Custody, that agreed to his Description, but could not let him have it then, but in two days he would help him to it. The Evidence further deposed, that when that time was elaps'd, the Prisoner said the Gelding was own'd, and he could not have a sight of it, which made him suspect the Prisoner had stoln it. The Prisoner, in his defence said, he took up a black Horse as a stray in Enfield Chace, which he thought was the Prosecutor's; but afterwards he was owned by another, which convinced him of his Mistake. He produced divers to his Reputation, who all said he was a simple honest Fellow. The Jury <rs id="t17070115-22-verdict107" type="verdictDescription">

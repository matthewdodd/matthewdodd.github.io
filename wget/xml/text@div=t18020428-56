             sworn. - I am an officer; On Monday last, about two o'clock, I took this handkerchief from the prisoner (produces it.) I was sent for by Mr. Lawrence, a salesman in the Minories, who suspected the prisoner had stolen something; I did not search him upon this charge; I asked him what he had got about him; he said he had got nothing; I told him I must search him, and in his left side great-coat pocket I found this handkerchief; I asked him where he got it; he told me he had bought it on Tower-hill on Saturday; I told him he must go with me and shew me the shop: he said he would; he took me to a shop on Tower-hill; the gentleman of the shop said he had no recollection of him; I then shewed him the handkerchief, and asked him if he had sold that; he said no, he had never sold that handkerchief: I received information that the prisoner had been at Mr. Buttenshaw's, I took him to Mr. Buttenshaw's, and the young lady claimed it; I have had it ever since.(The property was identified by Miss Hill.)</p>

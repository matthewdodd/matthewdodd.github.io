               <p>Court. Did they hurt your mouth? - Just in my mouth, I held my lips together; my pocket was cut the first, my cloak was next, and then my gown; and they cut off my apron from the very strings; they took nothing else off: I cried murder in a dreadful manner.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - It was between dark and light.</p>

               <p>How soon after you was robbed? - In about half an hour after, I heard of it almost immediately; I went to Justice Sherwood; I made up to the Green Dragon and cried for assistance, I stopped there, and the gentleman that met them with my property took it from them, and told me had taken the man that had robbed me; there were two men in custody at the Justice's, the last was off; the two men were Thompson and West; I know West in particular, because he was pitted with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160036"></xptr> small-pok, and I hanged round his neck, and begged he would not kill me.</p>
               <p>That do you say as to the prisoner Thompson? - He really was the man that received my cordinal when the other stripped it of and I believe he was the man that had the knife.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On Saturday evening about eight o'clock, going between the Ship in Sun Tavern fields and Brick-street, there is a vacant space, I heard in Stepney Fields, a melancholy cry of murder, murder, oh do not kill me! I stopped a few moments to consider what to do; I looked for some person to go with me; I ran down the lane by myself, but considering it would be dangerous to go alone, I turned back and ran into the Ship for assistance; I said, I believe there is a gentlewoman murdering in the fields, there was nobody in the tap-room, I heard voices in another room, there were three men there that were smoaking their pipes, they laid them down directly, and went with me: here I must observe, that when we came out of the door the cry of murder was over, and the three men heard nothing of it; when we got half way down the lane, one said, let us go back, it will all come to nothing; I said, I will go first, and I ran before them: in this situation, near the bottom of the lane, I met West and the prisoner Thompson.</p>
               <p>Court. How far was the place where you heard the cry of murder, to the Sun Tavern? - Three or four hundred yards. Thompson and West attempted to shun me, by going close to the bank, I immediately suspected them and collared Thompson with my right hand, and with my left I pushed West against the bank; in this situation the people behind came up, I asked Thompson what they were, Thompson trembled, and made no answer; West said, damn you Sir, what is that to you, we are going about our business: when the people behind came up, I observed a bundle under West's right arm, I put my hand to it and some of the rest did the same; it was a woman's gown; a man that stood behind me and Thompson at this instant, said Sir, I have picked up a cloak that Thompson has dropped from under his arm.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Thompson hear that man say that the cloak had dropped from him? - He made no answer to it that I can recollect; he went very quietly, the other tried to escape, but was prevented; after they were properly secured, I went with three or four men to search for the woman; we called out, no person made any answer, and we found her at the Green Dragon; we brought her to Justice Sherwood's, and took her over to the public house where the two prisoners were; immediately,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178210160037"></xptr> as soon as she saw them, she said these are the men; she pointed to West, this is the man that was going to kill me, and this poor fellow saved my life, pointing to Thompson.</p>
               <p>Court. What condition was the woman in? - She was much flurried, she was in her petticoats and shift.</p>
               <p>Court. Had she the appearance of a person who had been robbed? - Yes, Sir, robbed and ill used.</p>
               <p>Court. You, Mr. Lundin, acted a very spirited and a very honourable part; and the public are very much indebted to you, very much, indeed!</p>

               <p>I was at one Mr. Clayton's, at supper, and heard the cry of murder; I ran down Vinegar-lane to the bottom; I said, where are the thieves? somebody said, here is one, that was West; I took him to the ship till he was properly secured; I saw a white handkerchief taken out of his hand by a young man.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see any thing under his coat? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>- WEST sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of last month I was at the Turpentine warehouse, I heard the alarm of murder, and ran down the lane; I saw West with this gown under his arm, and the white handkerchief I took out of his hand; the other people had stopped him; I immediately collared him; coming into the ship he said, Damn my eyes I will mark you; I up with my fist, and I hit him; at the same time Thompson being in company with West was brought into the Ship.</p>
               <p>- COLE sworn.</p>
               <p>About nine o'clock a man ran over to the house where I was drinking, and said you must come immediately, two men have murdered a woman; I went to the Ship, and there I saw two men standing with twenty people; I asked them who was the prisoners, they shewed me the two men, I immediately went to handcuff West and this man together; West behaved very bad, Thompson behaved very well.</p>
               <p>Court. Had you the things put in your care? - Yes, my Lord, this handkerchief and this gown, this cloak, and this apron, and this knife.</p>
               <p>Court to Lundin. Do you know how the apron came there? - I took notice of nothing when they were apprehended but the gown and cloak.</p>
               <p>- Cole. A little boy brought in the apron and the knife, and said he found them in the fields just where the robbery was done.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Court to Lundin. The person that took up the cloak is not here? - No, Sir, nor none of the three men that helped me to stop them.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am very innocent; I was coming from my daily labour, I went home to my wife, she was gone out, I went to the Britannia, near Limehouse church, there I had a pint of beer; I met West coming over the fields, says I Jem, what have you got here? he said, they are some things that I picked up: I said, I wish I could get out of your way, and this gentleman came up and took me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner brought thirteen witnesses, who had most of them known him from his infancy, and all gave him a very good character.</p>

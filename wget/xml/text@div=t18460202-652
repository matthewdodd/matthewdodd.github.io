I saw the prisoner in a marine<lb></lb>store dealer's shop, in Union-street, on the 16th of Dec., with a blue bag in his hand, and a riding-whip in his right hand—he placed the bag on the counter, and took from it a brown paper, containing these rings and this brass-work—I went to him, told him I was an officer, and asked if they were his—he said, "Yes"—I asked where he worked—he declined telling me—he said he lived in May-fair—I said, "I must take possession of this, and take you, except you can tell me where you have been at work to-day"—on the road to the station, he said if I would go to No. 100, High-street, there was a person named Hammond, in possession under the Bankruptcy Court, and he would make it all right, for he gave him the brass, and told him to sell it to buy some porter for to-morrow—as we were going to the station, I missed the whip—I said, "Where is your whip?"—he said, "I have dropped it, but that is of no consequence"—I took him to the station, and was ordered to search him—he said I need not, he had nothing about him—I found this strap, this brass box, and these other things in his coat pocket—I said, "You said you had nothing"—he said, "Mr. Hammond gave me these; It is of no consequence."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a harness-maker, and live at No. 100, High-street, Borough. I have lately become bankrupt—Hammond was in possession of my premises—the prisoner was employed to assist in lotting the goods—I no<lb></lb>ticed his bringing a blue bag—he seemed to have his victuals in it, and two or three bottles—I saw him leave with his bag—on the following day I found a quantity of brass-work and other things in possession of the constable—I have every reason to believe they formed part of my stock—they were such as I used, and had in my premises—I do not recollect this strap, but I had a box like this, and this brush has my name on it—I know this brass gas-joint—I put it under the shop counter, that it might be sold for old metal—I know it because it has a hole through which the gas escaped—I did not give the prisoner permission to take any of these things from the premises—I gave him a pair of old gaiters just before he left—Mr. Hammond did not give him any of them—I had no reason to suppose he had anything but the remains of his food—this box is like the one I had, and which I had missed from my</p>

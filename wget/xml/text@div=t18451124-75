I was on duty on the night of the 22nd of Nov., at the corner of Earl-street, Blackfriars—I saw the prisoner come from St. Ann's wharf about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, with a sack of corn on his back—Mr. Clowes's stables are in that yard—Idid not see him come out of the stables—I followed him over the bridge and jdown Cross-street to a stable of his own—I then asked what he had got there—he said a sack of mixed corn, beans, and oats, that he had bought at a corn<lb></lb>chandler's over the water—I asked who, and he refused to tell me—I said he Iroust go with me in custody—I got him outside the gate; and he said, "You Iknow me, what had I better do?"—I said to speak the truth—he said, I"You know where it came from"—I said, "I suppose it was from Mr. Poynder's—he said, "No, it was Mr. Clowes's"—I went to Mr. Clowes's principal, and produced the sack to him—this is it.</p>

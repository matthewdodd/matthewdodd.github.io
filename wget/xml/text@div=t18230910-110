Wyman took it into the yard; they did not see me; I was on Mr. Hunter's premises. The moment Osborne delivered the hay he drove on, without stopping to drink; the house was not open. Smith then gave Wyman a truss of hay from his team - he came out again, and Smith gave him a sack from under the cart, which contained about two bushels of something. I watched the teams away; then went home and wrote a letter to Mr. Byng, to inform him. I apprehended all three men by a warrant. Osborne and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182309100059"></xptr>Wyman denied the charge. Wyman denied knowing the men at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Waggons often call at this house - A. Yes, it is a public-house; I did not seize them, not seeing any money pass, and not knowing whether Mr. Byng had ordered it to be left there. I wrote to Mr. Byng the same day - he lives fourteen miles off.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not men often borrow hay on the road, and pay it when they come again - A. I cannot say; I watched the teams back in the afternoon; the horses fed out of the usual crate as others, and I saw them put their own hay into the crate for the horses.</p>

            . I am a tailor. I was with Conway on the morning of the 26th of January, and saw two carts come to the Archway public-house. Osborne delivered a whole truss of hay from his cart to Wyman, who put it into a crate, which stood to receive it. Osborne drove on, and the next cart came up, driven by Smith; he left a truss of hay, and something else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a constable - A. No, Conway employed me to go with him. I was about six yards from the house; we watched for another opportunity to take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to be an informer - A. I have not laid many informations. I have been before Dr. Owen, as a witness, when informations were laid by Conway. I will not swear that I have not laid a dozen informations.</p>

            . I was in the service of Mr. Byng, and was at the Archway public-house, with Osborne; we had no business there. On the 26th of June, between five and six o'clock in the morning, I drove one team, and

             the other. Wyman was hostler at the stable. I have known him about six months. Our carts were loaded with hay. Osborne left one truss with Wyman to make some money of it; he took it into the yard. Mr. Byng did not deal with him. I was taken up for what I did, and allowed to be a witness, and have come from prison now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lived with Mr. Byng - A. Two years; my team was behind Osborne's.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know that he did not borrow hay, and this was to repay him - A. No, I never borrowed any. Conway took me up, but I had no conversation with him. Osborne has been fourteen or fifteen years with Mr. Byng. When I saw my master, I told him the truth. I had thirty-eight trusses in the waggon, one for the horses, and one to leave with the hostler.</p>

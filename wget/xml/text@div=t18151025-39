            . I put up three two-pound notes and twenty one-pound notes in a parcel, at Chichester; I directed it to Mr. Philips, High Holborn, took it to the coach office myself, and booked it. Before I put them up, I took notice of the names that were on the backs of them.</p>

On the 16th, I marked the parcels off that came by the Chichester coach. I saw one directed for Mr. Philips, High Holborn. The next morning the porter told me he had gone to Mr. Philips's, and when he came there, he missed the parcel. The prisoner has no business in the office where the parcels lie; he is a <rs id="t18151025-39-deflabel224" type="occupation">horse-keeper</rs>

Then I thought it necessary to search the stables, which the prisoner had the care of. Whilst the officers were searching the stable, he went to one of the coaches in the yard, and stood on the step for between two or three minutes. When he came down, the officer said, now, let me get up; he then got in, and brought out thirteen one-pound notes.</p>

            . I am the person whose business it is to deliver the parcels. I received a parcel directed to Mr. Philips; it was a small brown paper parcel. On the morning of Tuesday, I asked the prisoner to help me up with the parcels into the cart. The man who usually assisted me in this, was busy about something else. The small parcels remained in the office until the last. The prisoner assisted me in putting them in. I never missed this parcel until I came to the place of delivery; I can't say that he gave it up to me into the cart, I do not remember.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was applied to on this occasion. I went on the Saturday, and searched the stable; whilst I was searching the stable, the prisoner got up on the steps of one of the coaches, and remained there two or three minutes. It was the Reading coach. When he came down, I got up, and found these thirteen one-pound notes, (producing them,) under the carpet, on the bottom of the coach.</p>
               <p>Lewis Abrahams. I can swear to three of these notes; but not positively to the rest.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q.To Gray. When would the Reading coach go out that day - A. At one o'clock, and it was near one then; they were getting the horses ready for it.</p>

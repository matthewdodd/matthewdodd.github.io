               <p>On the 31st of December, between seven and eight, I was coming by Bishopsgate Church, I saw the prisoner with this under his arm, wrapped in a hammer cloth, I asked him what he had there, he said it was no matter to me; I said I should stop him, for I supposed it was a coach glass, and I found it was so; he said it was, and he was going to Long-acre; I took him up, the next day we advertised it, and the coachman came and owned it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was with the last witness when he stopped the man, these things were found upon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120005"></xptr> him, they have been at Mr. Wilmot's Office ever since, locked up; I did not hear what the prisoner said at first.</p>
               <p>(The hammer cloth deposed to by the prosecutor, by the lacing.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There never is two hammer cloths alike, the glass has a string to match it, that was cut off; I am sure it is the glass almost, I will not swear to it; I know it also by the colour of the cloth, and the make, I have looked at it before; I serve a lady with a job, it is her coach and her hammer cloth, it is not my property, nor the coach glass neither; the carriage was standing at a coach-house, at the Two Swans, which belongs to me, the things were taken from thence, I am answerable for every thing that is lost.</p>
               <p>How so? - I paid for a carpet that was lost out of the coach once before; she says she has nothing to do with it; I always understood it as my property, it is in my care always; I hire the coach-house and stable.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. This latter explanation of the property being in the possession of this witness, and his considering himself answerable for it, goes a good way towards the property being his, because, in the case of a carrier, it is always so held; but I will send to ask three of the Judges, who are up stairs, and we will go on in the mean time.</p>

               <p>I drive this lady's coach, her name is Barrow, in Bury-street, St. Mary-axe, No. 13, I put in about half after four, or a little before, she is a Jew lady, and they never ride on Friday evening; I went down to <placeName id="t17850112-3-crimeloc12">Hackney</placeName>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was coming from Kingsland-road that evening, and a man asked me to carry it for him, and he would give me a shilling, he then gave me a groat, and they took me.</p>
               <p>Court to Armstrong. Did he tell the same story? - He did; there was a man at the back of him, but he did not say so while he was in sight, the man did not run, but he turned down the church-yard; the man was perfectly out of sight before he said that to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, all the Judges concur in opinion with me, that it is sufficient in point of property to support the charge of the indictment.</p>

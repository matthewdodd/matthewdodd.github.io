On the afternoon of the 11th of December, about half-past three o'clock, I was on duty in Dalston, between Hackney and Kingsland-green—I met the prisoner with this bundle of clothes—he appeared in a confused state—he was walking down behind a lamp-lighter—I stopped him and asked him what the bundle contained—he said a blue jacket, waistcoat and trowsers, and he was going as cook on board a vessel bound for Sidney—I looked in it, found the trowsers, and gown, a waistcoat, and a black coat—I asked him where he brought them from—he said from his lodgings, the Angel at Islington—in going to the station he tried to make his escape—I succeeded in taking him again, and took him to the station at last—he said he found them in a field behind a hedge—on the Sunday following I found the owner of the property.</p>

These are my husband's things, and the gown is mine—I saw them safe about half-past nine o'clock on the 11th of December—I laid them up stairs in a box—it was not locked—my house is half a mile from Dalston—I did not miss them till the 17th, (the Sunday following,) not having occasion to go to the box—the prisoner had no business with any of them—I never saw him before—they are worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman in the service of Messrs. Taylor and Bell, of Bermondsey. On the 27th of September I was in St. Kathe<lb></lb>rine's Dock, passing through the lock with a barge a little after eight o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner in a ship's boat under the head of a vessel, very unnecessarily in my way—I said to him, "Old <hi rend="italic">Buffey</hi>, shove round the other side of the barge, will you?"—I did not know him before—<hi rend="italic">"Buffey"</hi> is a word we use, and does not mean anything offensive, just the same as "Old fellow"—he told me to take a b----y carrot—I said, "You are a nice man, to be sure"—he said, "So are you a b----y nice man"—I said, "It would not do for you to be a fellow-servant of mine"—he said, "No, so help me God, it would not"—I said, "Well, there is as good a bit of flesh here as there is there, I know"—he then</p>

               <p>said, "I will come and drown you, you b——r"—he came out of the ship's long-boat over my barge cabin-top—I was halfway across the boat—he took hold of me and threw me overboard in a moment, headforemost—I did not expect he was going to do it, or I should have laid down in the boat—I can swim, and came up nearly where I went down, and saw the prisoner a foot or two from where he had been, still in my barge—there was a long staff in my barge, right alongside of him, at his feet—if he had put that out, it would have assisted me in recovering from the water—I went down headforemost, with my mouth wide open—it was very low tide when the fresh water could not come in, and the water is stagoated by the copper bottoms of the vessels—it was very nauseous—I got a good deal of it, and was struggling a great deal for breath when I came up—a number of people called out, "Pick the man up—the man will be drowned—there is the staff"—the prisoner did not give me any assistance at that time—I made off to the boat which he had come out of—a gentleman had got into it, and he rendered me assistance—I got into that boat—when I had got out of danger I had my hand on the boat's gunwale—another witness got hold of me, and I was pulled into the boat—the prisoner had then got into his own boat, and put his hand down to assist me; and said, "Why don't you take hold here?"—I said, "I have had enough of your hand"—he offered his hand again afterward, and I did take hold of it—he helped me into the boat—I did not know the prisoner before, and never had any quarrel with him—he was sober—he is a labourer, and may have seen me often and I not see him—the water was about six fathoms deep.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and was in St. Katherine's Dock, taking a barge round the pier-head—I saw the passage was blocked—I could not get along—I stopped my barge within about twenty yards, and saw the prisoner jump off his own boat on to the deck of the prosecu<lb></lb>tor's barge, and throw the prosecutor over between the lighter and my barge—I was not near enough to hear what passed—after he came up to the surface of the water, the prisoner went on board his own boat, and assisted to pull him up by the left hand—I could not render assistance from my barge, as it was loaded—I cannot recollect whether there was a long staff on the prosecutor's barge—I had got on the prisoner's boat, and assisted the prosecutor out of the water—I directly went to my own barge and did not hear any conversation—I heard the prisoner say it was as much the prosecutor's fault as his—I did not hear Lunt answer, as I turned to my own barge—I saw no struggling before he was thrown over—it was done momentarily—he went down head first.</p>

               <p>he dragged him into the boat; a custom-house officer on board my boat made a remark to him, which I could not hear—his answer was, "I would serve you the same."</p>

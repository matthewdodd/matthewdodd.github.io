                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, H</hi> 212). About 9 o'clock on the morning of 21st April I saw the prisoners in the Commercial Road, together—Pokes was carrying a bundle and Wheeler a coat—I saw Wheeler go into a pawn<lb></lb>broker's shop; Pokes stayed outside—I waited till Wheeler came to the door, and then I asked him what he went there for—he said, "A coat"—I went in with him, and the pawnbroker gave me the coat, and Wheeler gave him back the money—I took him into custody—I asked him where he got it from; he said that it was his brother's—I said that was not satisfactory, and then he said that a man had given it to him, that he had changed boots with him—another constable then took Wheeler—afterwards I made inquiries, and went to Messrs. Wagoner's, the sugar refiners, in Wellclose Square—I examined the front doors outside, they were folding doors—the wood work had been cut away, making a place large enough to admit a man's hand, so that he could open the door—I was let in, and in the sugar warehouse I found a box, broken open—the lock had been forced—Mr. Bonta came in afterwards.</p>

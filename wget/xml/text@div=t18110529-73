            . About the beginning of May the prisoner called upon me, he said he had got some metal he had brought from Ireland, would I buy it; I informed Mr. Saunders, he sent for an officer; going to Bow-street the prisoner confessed the whole of it, upon which me and the officer went to his lodging and found the metal. We promised him before, that if he would confess there should no harm come to him.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I cannot swear that metal is my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am in the habit of using this sort of metal; this kind of metal is sold in the three united kingdoms, as well as at Mr. Saunders's shop, and it is my property.</p>

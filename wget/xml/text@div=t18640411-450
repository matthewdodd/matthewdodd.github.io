                  </hi>. I am a draper and clothier of 36, Hill-street, Knights<lb></lb>bridge—I know the prisoner—he came to me several times, and wished me to become a subscriber to Stubb's Mercantile Institute—the last time he came was on 24th July—he said he was an agent and canvasser for Stubbs, and it would be very much to my advantage to become a subscriber—the two first times he came, I refused to become a subscriber, but the last time he came he presented the institution in such a form that I thought it would be to my advantage—he said for the accommodation which I could receive there, my annual subscription would be two guineas—he then said, "I can take the subscription"—I said, "No; I should prefer to pay it to Mr. Stubbs's per<lb></lb>sonally, I must connect you with that institute"—he said, "Will you pay me the commission?"—I said, "Stubbs's people will, no doubt, pay you your commission"—he then said, "I shall take your name into the office, and in the course of a day or two, a collector will call from the office, no doubt, and receive the money"—he then went away—on the Thursday following the Friday that he called, a person came <hi rend="italic">;</hi> my brother was at home, but I was not—he called again the next day—I was at home, and he said, "I have come for the subscription to Stubbs's, according to your agreement, which you promised last week"—he presented me with this receipt—that person is not here—I paid him two guineas—he said that the papers would follow in the course of a day or two—the papers did not come in three weeks, and I then went to Stubb's Institute to inquire how it was they were not forth<lb></lb>coming, and on presenting them with the receipt, they said it was a forgery—I heard nothing more of the affair, till I saw the prisoner in the street about 26th or 27th February last—he was in a house and I was in the street—I called to him and mentioned the matter to him—I said, "You are</p>

               <p>Stubbs's agent, are you not?"—he said, "Oh, no; I do not know anything at all of Stubbs"—I said, "Don't you remember calling on a person named Black, at 36, Hill-street, Knights bridge?"—he said, "No, I don't remember it at all"—I said, "I know you perfectly well, and you must come along with me to the police-station"—he said, "Where is the police-station?"—I pointed to where it was, and he said, "I am just going in the very opposite di<lb></lb>rection "—I caught him by the hand, and said, "I shall go with you wherever you go"—after walking a little way we met a policeman, and I gave him in charge upon a warrant, which I had received from Mr. Dayman, the Ham<lb></lb>mersmith police Magistrate, for obtaining money under false pretences.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 12, Gresham-street, and am manager of the canvasser's department at Stubb's—the prisoner was in our employ in 1861 and 1862, as an agent—I know him by the name of Maguire—the last time we paid him money for services rendered was in June, 1862—I don't remember seeing him after that till I saw him at the police-court—in the position he held, he was not authorized to receive moneys, or give receipts—his duty was to obtain the signatures of the parties upon whom he called, to an order, and to bring them to the office, and then he received his commission when the money was paid—in August, 1863, he had no authority to receive moneys for the Society—this receipt is not one of our forms—the name Charles E. Stubbs is not Mr. Stubb's writing—he was dead then, and there was no other C. E. Stubbs in the office—we never received the two guineas from Mr. Black.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Had you ever any reason to complain of my conduct when I was with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I believe all the other orders you brought in were satisfactory and <hi rend="italic">bonafide.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The prosecutor has mistaken the party altogether. I have never seen Mr. Black or his brother before, nor do I even know the locality where they represent themselves to live. As regards the receipt I never received the money for it; he paid another person the money. If I had wanted to receive the money I should have given him a bonafide order to fill up from Mosers. Stubb's, and he says he never had that. I ran away from the policeman, as I stated before, to get bail. I was under the impression that if I was taken to the station I should not be able to do so.</p>

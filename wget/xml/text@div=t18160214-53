I supposed that he was on some part of my premises, and on going to the shop door, saw him come out of my dwelling-house; he said he had been to get a drop to drink. I asked him what, and he said rum. I told him I had been robbed often, and I feared he had robbed me again; he said he had not. I told him I was not satisfied with that, and I called one of my journey-men, and searched him, and found in his pocket a three-shilling bank token, which by a particular mark, I knew to be mine. I sent for an officer, and had him taken into custody. I told he had been in my bed-room, and had opened my drawer where there were nineteen three-shilling pieces; he said he had not, and that it was his own three-shilling piece. I have a wife, but no children. I know it by a small w near the figure 3.</p>

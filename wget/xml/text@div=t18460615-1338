On the 12th of June, about ten o'clock at night, I was in a shop at the corner of Cock-alley, and heard screams—that was five or six doors from the Phœnix public-house—I rushed out of the shop, and saw a few people round the door of the Phœnix—the prisoners we're there—I had no sooner got up, than Monsco drew a knife out, and plunged it into my arm-they then both ran away together—they were pursued, and taken by a policeman—the prisoners might be a couple of yards from each other when I was stabbed.</p>

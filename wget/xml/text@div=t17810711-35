               <p>A public-house? - No. I met the three prisoners towards Vauxhall. I asked them to give me a lodging. They said they could. I went with them to the house. I paid the woman 1 s. for my bed, and likewise for the girls.</p>

               <p>Was you ever in that house before? - Never before. I gave Lapper 1 s. I gave nothing to the others. I went to bed with Lapper. The other two were visitors, I believe. I went to bed about one o'clock. Lapper got up, and asked if I would have any beer. I said, Yes. She said she would fetch some gin. When she went out, I suspected she had robbed me. I looked, and missed three half-crowns. I asked her if she had got them. She said, she knew nothing of them. The other two women came in when I waked. I went to sleep again. When I waked, after that, I missed the rest of the money. Lapper owned, before the justice, that she had taken the three half-crowns.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178107110128"></xptr>Was that taken down in writing? - I believe it was: I do not know. After I waked again, I missed two guineas and about 8 s. 6 d.</p>

               <p>What became of the prisoners, when you had had the beer? - They went away. When I waked, about three o'clock, I missed the rest of the money. They lest me only 3 s.</p>

               <p>SYLVANUS PRICE sworn.</p>

               <p>Last Sunday morning, I was sent for by another person, who had been robbed. This person said they had robbed him, and wished I would take them up on his account. I went to the round-house, and took up the prisoners. I took them before the justice. There they confessed, one had one guinea, and the other another.</p>

               <p>Was that taken down in writing? - I do not know whether it was wrote down at all, or not.</p>

               <p>Do you know any thing but what passed before the justice? - No.</p>

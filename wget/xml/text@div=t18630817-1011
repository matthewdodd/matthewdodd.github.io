               <p>money—when money was to be collected instructions were given to the accountant's office to collect it—there are regular collectors employed—the prisoner had no right to deal with money at all—if goods were brought up from Birmingham, and the money not collected at the time, he would have nothing to do with that, it would only come into his department if there was a correspondence—Postle was a clerk in the office, and also a lad named Demetrius—when money had to be collected from the English line and the Irish line also, the collector would collect it and pay it into the cashier's office; a reference to the book is then obtained from the cashier's office, on which the clerk who has it in charge authorizes the Irish Company to re<lb></lb>charge the amount to the debit of the North Western Railway Company at Camden-town station, that settles the account—in this letter of advice there ought to be a letter of reference to the cash-book; the Irish Company would then send an invoice for the amount, which would go to the general corre<lb></lb>spondence office, first to the person who opens the letters; he would look at the reference on it, and distribute it into the accountant's office if it had the cash reference on it—the invoice is treated as a voucher between the two companies, and in our clearing he would use it as a voucher for the money—it would be brought into the correspondence office to see where the money was to be obtained—it ought to be in such a shape as to be distributed from the letter opener into the correspondence office, and not be returned—this letter is in the prisoner's writing: "If you have not yet charged this Com<lb></lb>pany with the above amount be good enough to do so, inclosing me an invoice giving reference to this letter; let this be done at once"—that is not a regular or proper letter, because, in the first place, it should give the cash reference; and next it says, "enclose <hi rend="italic">me</hi> an invoice," which he ought not to have done—with the name Stephenson signed here, and the initials under<lb></lb>neath, it would necessarily go into the correspondence office, and the proper authority would say, "You may re-charge this amount," giving reference to the cash folio—it would have gone all right to the accountant's office if unaccompanied by this letter, but being accompanied by this letter, it came to the correspondence office—it bears the reference which would take it to that office.</p>

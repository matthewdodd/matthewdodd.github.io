I turned myself about, and saw the prisoner at the bar putting my handkerchief as fast as he could between the bib of his apron and his waistcoat. I accused him with taking my handkerchief. He said he had no handkerchief about him; but, upon my taking hold of it, he said he found it upon the ground, and had asked many people if it was theirs, but no body owned it, and he then thought it his own property. [The handkerchief produced in cou rt, and deposed to.]</p>
               <p>Q. How near was the prisoner to you?</p>
               <p>Rogers. He was close to me.</p>

               <p>As I was going into the hall there lay a handkerchief by that gentleman. I took it up, and asked two or three gentlemen, who were walking hand in hand together, whether they owned the handkerchief. They said, no, my lad. Then, said I, it is my own; and putting it into my apron, having never a pocket in my coat, he said it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176112090009"></xptr> his. Then I took it out of my bib, and gave it him.</p>

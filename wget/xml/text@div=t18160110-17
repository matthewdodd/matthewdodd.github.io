The two prisoners at the bar came and knocked at the door, on Sunday morning, when I was cleaning my shoes. When I opened the door, I stood in the way; they shoved me back and came in; they had not asked to come in, nor anything before that. They then took up a book which was on a board, and began to read; then Wiltshire put his hand behind him, at the same time he shewed me a coat, and said was it to sell; he put the cloth in question under the coat, and said, there my boy, here is the coat. The cloth was about two yards, and was lying on the counter behind him, and I saw him put it under the coat. Then he wrapped the coat up in a bundle, and said they could not stop any longer. They then went out together; and I called my brother; I saw them go to the next door, my brother went after them. I never saw the cloth again.</p>

            . There were two yards of mixed narrow cloth on the counter; I went to the next door in consequence of what my brother had told me, and got some information there. The next shop, is of the same description as mine. When I came to the top of Church-row, I saw a young man running, and I followed him into a wine vaults, to which there were two doors, and he went out at the other as I came in. In consequence of informatio I received I went to Bedford Bury; my brother had described Sherlock, as blind of an eye; I knew them both before by sight. Coming from Vine-street, I met both the prisoners together, I seized them both by the neck-handkerchiefs; Sherlock said I hurt his neck I brought them to the constable's door, but he was not at home. They said if I would let them loose, they would stay until the constable came; I did so, and then Wiltshire ran off immediately, and Sherlock struck me several times; I called for assistance, and a gentleman came who and helped me to take him to St. Martin's watch-house. On the following day the constable apprehended Wiltshire.</p>

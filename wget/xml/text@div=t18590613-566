I am assistant to Mr. Jackson, a licensed victualler of Whitefriars-street—about half-past 6 o'clock on 13th May I was attend<lb></lb>ing to business, and the prisoner came in for twopenny-worth of gin—I served him—he gave me half-a-crown—I put it in the till—there was no other half-crown there—I gave him change—in about twenty minutes after my attention was called to the half-crown—Mrs. Jackson went to the till—there were then two half-crowns there—another half-crown had been taken, and one of them was bad.</p>

               <p>before the Magistrate—I suppose he was in the house about ten minutes—it was not dark—I knew him by his features and by his velvet cap—I saw him again the day afterwards in the cell with about five others.</p>

From information I received on 13th June last, I went with Jarvis to Mr. Savage's, a pawnbroker in White<lb></lb>chapel-road—I went into the shop, and found Mr. Savage and the prisoner—I told Mr. Savage, in the prisoner's presence, that we had come to make some inquiry about some gold that had been stolen, which he had purchased—he said, "Not me, my man," pointing to the prisoner—I then asked the prisoner who he got it from, and—when he said, "I bought it after business hours on Thursday night"—I said, "Who did you buy it of?"—he said, "Of a man; I never saw him before, and I don't know who he is"—I said, "Is that all you know about it?"—he said, "I asked him his name and address; he looked like a working man; I thought he was in the trade"—I said, "Will you show me the entry?"—he looked about the shop for a book some little time—Mr. Savage said it was upstairs in the drawing-room—a book was fetched down, and the entry was shown—it was the last entry in the book—there appeared to be some sand on the writing—Jarvis, who was with me, said, "This has been altered from the 11th to the 12th"—the prisoner then said, it being an affair that had occurred after business hours, it would not go into that day's account—Mr. Savage said that he always sent all his old gold and silver to Messrs. Johnson and Walker, the refiners, in Aldersgate-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gold-flatter, in Hop-gardens, St. Martin's-lane—Mr. Summers occasionally sends gold to us to flat—on 11th June some gold was brought to my place—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I flatted it—I remember young Mr. Summers being at my place—he brought the gold, and called again for it—he got it about 5 o'clock in the evening—there was about nine ounces, full—I saw that gold again next day—the prisoner brought it about 3 in the afternoon—he wanted it melted for an assay—when he produced it I recognised it, and said there was some suspicion</p>

               <p>attaching to it, we had rather not melt it—he was quite agreeable not to have it melted if that was the case—he said he was recommended to our house to get it melted, and mentioned some name, which I forget—he said that he had bought it, and he had come from the firm of Savage, of Whitechapel—my father said, "We must detain this," after looking at it a second time—the prisoner said, "You must give me a receipt for it, and I will give you my address"—my brother proposed to go to Mr. Summers to ascertain whether it was really their gold or no—the prisoner said he could not spare the time, he should be wanted at home; if we would write to him that would answer the same purpose—the market value of the gold is about 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You are not an assayer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; we have to melt gold, but we do not style ourselves gold melters, because we do not melt for the trade; we are gold-beaters, and manufacturers of gold and silver leaf—it is not alloyed before it comes to us to be beaten; we alloy it—there is a variation of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per oz.; the highest price is 86<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the lowest 85<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we alloy the gold according to the purpose it is intended for—it can be alloyed down to almost a little above the value of silver—in order to produce a very extraordinary colour, we have reduced it to one-half in value—some notion of the value of gold may be formed by the use of a stone and aqua-fortis—I should think a person, without having it assayed, might be able to tell the value within a few shillings.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a jeweller and dealer in gold in Edgeware-road—with respect to gold above the value of 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it is difficult to arrive at the precise value without an assay—I never buy gold if more than 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce is wanted without first sending it to Mr. Johnson to assay.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SAVAGE</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>) I had not given the prisoner any special instructions as to purchasing after 7 o'clock; we take it for granted that they know the Act, but unfortunately ten out of every twenty young men do not know whether or not they have a right to purchase after 7 o'clock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, and live at Lillingstone, in Kent; but since I have been in London I have been lodging at 116, York-road, Lam<lb></lb>beth—on Thursday evening, about 6 o'clock, I was at the top of Gibson-street, Waterloo-road, and met the prisoner Johnson—he told me that he was a police-sergeant and asked me to go with him—I did so—he said that he was out after a party to take them, pick-pockets, rogues, thieves—he said, "You know what I mean"—he asked me to go and help take them; and I went—when we got to the bottom of the street, he wanted me to go and see if I could see them—he told me not to go away, but to stop there—I said that I would—he said that he would go to the station and see if his men were all right; and then he came back, and we went to a public-house—I do not know where it was—he asked me whether I would have some ale; I said, "No; I will have a pint of half-and-half;" because I thought if I had ale he could shift something into it; but if I had half-and-half I should share as he did—then he wanted to toss; and presently Miller and a man who is not present, came in, and they all three got tossing, and wanted me to toss—I said that I was out of work, and had no money—they wanted me to lay my watch down against one of their notes—I said, "No"—they wanted me to go and pawn it—I said, "No"—the subject of my pawning was discussed between the three of them; and I left with the one who has run away, leaving the prisoners in the public-house—I went with the other one into the Waterloo-road—I stepped back to get a man to get a policeman, and he ran away—I then went across the road, saw a constable, went to the public-house, and just as we went in at the side door the prisoners went out at the front—the constable took Johnson, and I followed the prisoner Miller into a public-house—Johnson had a bag of sovereigns in the public-house—he pulled it out, and said, "This will show you that I am a man of property"—Miller had some notes and sovereigns too.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 108). The prosecutor spoke to me, and I went with him to the Fountain public-house—as we went in at one door the prisoners were going out at another—I took Johnson, and took him to the station—I afterwards took Miller, and then told them both that the charge was trying to defraud the prosecutor of a watch—they said nothing—as I took Johnson to the station, I said that I believed it was for felony; but I could not say, as the prosecutor had gone after the other man—he said, "Nonsense; take three halfpence and get a glass of beer—I have not been in the force long"—while I was conveying Johnson to the station we met several other men at the corner of the London-road, and his hand went towards another man; but whether he received anything I do not know; but one said, "Well, Jack," and another said, "Well, George, what is the matter?"—Johnson said, "Nothing much; I do not know what is the matter"—they then said, "Oh, let him go"—a pair of gloves, two hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs, and 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. were found on Johnson; but no notes or sovereigns—Miller was searched in my presence, and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and copper, and a watch, and handkerchief were found on him, but no notes or gold.</p>

               <p>evening I was spending in the Elephant and Castle, a person said something to me about two men in a public-house—I followed, and when the prosecutor went in at one door, Johnson and Miller went out at the other—I followed, and saw Miller drop something in a piece of white paper, in the mud, and try to tread on it, but he could not; and I picked it up and took it home to my my grandfather—this is it.

About two o'clock in the morning of the 3d of November I was returning home from Bishopsgate-street, where I had been at a public-house, with a friend. I was quite sober. As I passed <placeName id="t18181202-60-crimeloc334">Baker's-row, opposite the London Hospital</placeName>

I had heard nobody near me; the place was very dark. They must have come out of some concealed place.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the effect of the blow - A. It knocked me down. I immediately tried to raise myself up, and a person took my hat off with both hands, as I was getting up; I immediately caught hold of the coat of the person who took my hat off. I am sure it was the same person. I then saw another person standing by his side. I called out and they tried to escape. I kept hold of the coat, and the man dragged me along the pavement for six or seven yards, as I held the coat. He then got away, leaving part of his coat in my hands. I saw him and the other man turn down Baker's-row, and down two other turnings. I followed them all the way, calling</p>
               <p>"Stop thief! Watch!" and</p>
               <p>"Murder!" My handkerchief was in my hat. I still kept them in sight, except while they turned the corner. I ran against a post, which disabled me from following them so fast. They had got back into Whitechapel-road again. I thought I saw one of them run across, and I followed him across, and still pursued. He ran down a street close to the hospital. I thought they both ran down there. When I got about five yards down the street the watchman brought Lewis to me, and asked if that was the man I was pursuing? He was much out of breath. I had no opportunity of observing his features, but by his stature I judged him to be one of them. The watchman said he was running when he was stopped, and I gave him in charge. I entirely lost the other man. I went with Lewis and the watchman to Whitechapel watch-house, while he was being searched a watchman came in, and said there was a prisoner at Mile End watch-house, with his coat torn. I had kept the part of the coat in my hand all the time, and went to Mile End, New-town, watch-house, and found Baldock there. I did not know his face; his person corresponded in shape and size with the man; his coat was torn; it was the same colour as the piece. I did not compare it, as he acknowledged it was part of his coat. It was torn in the same place. I have the coat and piece here. He was taken to Whitechapel watch-house. My hat was found the next day, by Stephens. The blow did not hurt me much. They did not strike me afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Was you quite sober - A. Quite. It was a dark night. I lost sight of them. I think they are the men by their stature. I felt both the man's hands on my head.</p>

               <p>"Stop thief!" I ran to the end of Mount-street, but saw nothing; as I returned I saw the prisoner, Lewis, turn the corner of Mount-street very quick. He was running.

The prosecutor was about thirty yards off, in Turner-street; he came up in less than two minutes, and said, from the prisoner's height and appearance, he believed he was one of them, but he could not swear to his features. He gave him in charge. The prisoner was very much out of breath, as if he had ran a great deal. The prosecutor was without his hat. We took the prisoner to Whitechapel watch-house.</p>

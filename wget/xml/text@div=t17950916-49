            , of Gray's Inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him any thing else? - Four five guinea bills, either payable there, or at the town where they were drawn, or at Sir James Esdaile's; three Blandford notes and one Cobham, all payable at Messrs. Esdailes. He was to take the money and go to Mr. Potter's at Chelsea, and sell a cow that was left at Mr. Potter's, and he went and sold that cow for ten pounds, and kept that money and notes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to do with this draft? - He was to take the money, and to bring it to me in the country where I live, that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him in what way he was to get change for these notes? - I did not. I live at Bush, near Watford, in Hertfordshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come that evening? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him before he was apprehended? No, not from that day he went off till he was brought into custody, the 6th of July. I have travelled four hundred miles after him, at last I advertised him, and I had him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Had you been in the habit of employing the prisoner at the bar to make purchases for you? - Yes, he has bought and sold for me different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he had large sums of money at times in his possession of your's? - Yes, sometimes he may have had three or four hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he lately come to any balance of his accounts with you? - No, not for a fortnight before; that was for road charges. As for sums of money I sometimes gave him a hundred, sometimes two hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the account unsettled with him for charges, or for sums of money received? - Only for charges.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have settled with him for money that you have given him in the course of your business to make purchases? - Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had employed him for about two years? - Somewhere thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not desire you to give him the drafts, it was your desire of him? - I gave him the drafts to go for the money according to my order.</p>
               <p>Q. My learned friend has stated to the jury that you never heard any thing of this man from the time that he went off with the money till he was taken up? - Yes, I never see him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179509160134"></xptr>Q. Have you never heard by letters from him, saying, that he had lost the money, and was exceeding sorry? - Yes, I had letters from him about a month or six weeks before he was taken; I don't know that I had ever another.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, have not you received many letters from him, acknowledging that he had lost the money, and wishing very much to come to an account some how or other, to give him time, as he wished, to work it out? - He seat me a letter that if I would meet him a hundred miles off he would give me some trifle that he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he never given directions to any one person to apply to you to settle this business, for you to give him his time? - Nobody made any proposals to me. A man came to me once, and said that he had but twenty nine shillings left.</p>
               <p>Court. Did he or did he not in the letter say, that he had lost the money? - Yes, he said he had lost the money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. This draft and notes that you gave him, he was to get cash for them? - No, he was to go and get the money for them, cash or notes; I did not order him to take cash or money; but a man that wanted to take that quantity into the country, I should have thought would not take cash, he would have taken bank notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are sure that you delivered him this, not at his requisition, but by your own desire, and for your own voluntary purpose? - To be sure I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The notes, in fact, were changed at Messrs. Coutts and Co. and at Messrs. Esdaile's and Co.? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you delivered to him the notes and the check; and he received the money on the notes and check? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Then all you mean to say is, that you gave him this check and notes, and you never see the value of them? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How many months had elapsed, and how many times had this money been advertised before the letter came that he had lost the money? - I advertised him several times.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was it before he told you this story of his having lost the money; and was it after he had been advertised, or not? - Four or five months, I dare say. I advertised a guinea reward, several times for taking him, and nobody would take him; he was in Lincolnshire, and then in London, and backward and forward several times. I never see him. but I was told so; but when I advertised five guineas reward, then in the course of a month, I had him brought out of Rutlandshire.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did you see Mr. Dennett write that draught himself? - The prisoner received the draft himself of Mr. Dennett.</p>
               <p>Court. Were you present? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did the prisoner bring to you a draft drawn by Mr. Dennett on Messrs. Coutts for seventy-eight pounds? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which you delivered to him again? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any body here to prove the sale of the cow? - Yes, Mr. James Potter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Potter was called and did not answer.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp submitted to the court that there was not evidence sufficient to go to a jury.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys contended there was, because Mr. Knapp had proved by his own cross examination of the prosecutor, that the prisoner had acknowledged to receiving the money, because he had written that he had lost it.</p>
               <p>Court. The prisoner must be acquitted, because that letter is not produced, which is an acknowledgment of receiving the money; and the clerk who paid the money does not prove that he paid it to the prisoner.</p>

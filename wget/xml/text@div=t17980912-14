               <p>Court. Q. Describe what this Boarded-entry is? - A. It is a passage into New Gravel-lane; I was coming through it, and just as I was coming up, I heard the voice of some men just before me, and I came up to them; when I got before them, I saw one man lay hold of the man's breast that was murdered,

            , and the other man took out a knife and stabbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who seized hold of him? - A. The shortest of those two, Middlemas.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the man that stabbed him? - A. There he is, the tallest, Sampson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any person present but those three men? - A. Not one; I came up at the time, and seeing him stab the man, I cried out that he had murdered the man; the man that held him then let him go, and ran down the Boarded-entry into New Gravel-lane; the tall man then said he would serve me the same if I did not go away; then I came up a little further, and the man that was killed got up, and went, I dare say, fifteen yards, and then he fell down against a door, and I cried out for the watch, I cried out murder; the watchman was the first person that came in, says he, who is this; says I,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179809120014"></xptr>it is Joe; says he, is it Joe, at No. 17, that I used to call up every morning; and I said, yes; I told him to take care of him while I went and got assistance at his lodgings; I went to his lodgings, and the landlady and another lodger came out first, and then a great many of the neighbours came out afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the tallest man after he had said, he would serve you the same? - A. He went down a lane to Green Dragon-alley, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What had become of the other? - A. He had run away directly, through the Boarded-entry.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you coming from? - A. I was coming from my uncle's house to my own lodgings, after eating my supper there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he live after that? - A. He died before they got him into his own lodgings; I can take my oath that it was not above seven or eight minutes from the time he was stabbed till he died; he died in the watchman's arms, at the door where he fell down.; I do not know the person's name.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was the deceased? - A. A coal heaver.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lodge in the same house with the deceased, yourself? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. How many coal-heavers lodge in the house? - A. Six of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come out of the house immediately, upon your arrival at the door of the house? - A. I cannot say that they all did, for I did not stay at the door; I only said, Joe was murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. How many women might come out? - A. That I cannot say; there was ne'er a woman in the house, I believe, except the landlady; the first man that came out was

               <p>Q. Had you not an opportunity of following the men? - A. No; he said he would serve me the same.</p>
               <p>Q. The first man did not say so? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When the watchman came up immediately, did you know he was stabbed? - A. I saw the man stabbed with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you therefore rush immediately upon him at that moment? - A. I saw the man take the knife out of his pocket, and stab him.</p>


               <p>Q. And you did not rush upon him? - A. No</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not attempt to seize either one or other of them? - A. No; I supposed I should be served the same myself if I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, notwithstanding you knew the voice of your friend in this situation, and notwithstanding you saw the act of the man taking out the knife, you did not attempt to prevent the mischief? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor called out? - A. I called out murder, and called but watch at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. And then when the watchman came, you told him what you have told us? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So you stood still, and did not make the least attempt to assist him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you saw nothing of what happened before that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What space of time was occupied in stabbing the man - was it a minute? - A. It was done very quick.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Const. I am a watchman; I was on duty near this place; I was called to the spot by Canty; I was on duty from ten o'clock at night till four in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing particular happen that night? - A. When I went round at eleven o'clock every thing was quiet and still, and about half past eleven, or twenty minutes before twelve, I was coming back to my box again; my box is at Mr. Phillips's brewhouse, about 400 yards from where the corpse laid, as nigh as I can judge; when I came up to where the deceased laid, his nephew was supporting him against his knees, and when I came up to him, he was feeling about the temples and round his head to feel for any wound or blows that he had received, but he could find none.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean Canty? - A. Yes; and he desired me to support him till he went to his lodgings to get more assistance; he was gone about a minute and a half, or two minutes, and there came eight or ten people, men and women, to our assistance, and while the nephew was gone, a man dragged him up to a higher part of the ground, and he exclaimed three times, he is stabbed, he is stabbed, he is stabbed; then I sprung my rattle; I went a little further and sprung it again; and then I went to Spring-street and sprung it again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. So soon as you had discovered that the man was stabbed, you very properly sprung your rattle? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had discovered that before, you would have sprung your rattle before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The nephew was feeling over the temples for the wounds? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it if you had seen the man stabbed, you would have known where to look for the wounds? - A. Yes, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Your box was about 400 yards from the place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The moment the nephew returned, there came several people, eight or ten? - A. Yes,</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When these people came, and you supported the corpse, did these people come out before him, or did he come first? - A.They followed him to where the deceased was.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. The people clustered round the corpse, I take it for granted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he with them when they were dragging him to a higher part of the ground? - A. He was present then, and assisted in getting him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he stripped then? - A. No further than to see the wound in his left breast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear of any riot or fighting in the course of that night? - A. No, every thing was quiet when I went round at eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a night was it? - A. A moonlight, clear night, and a fine evening.</p>

Sampson said, nothing was the matter; we had not gone two minutes further, before a voice called us back to have some beer, in an Irish tone; and in about two minutes after that there came a stone, and took me on the side of the head; I called out to Sampson, by the help of God clear yourself if you can, and I saw no more of Sampson till I came on board; before I went on board, I went to a woman and told her of it; then I went back to the Boarded entry, and called my shipmate, but could not get an answer, and then I went to the waterman, and told my story, and he told me some expressions that Sampson had told him, and I said, I hoped it was not so; I am innocent of it.</p>
               <p>Sampson's defence. I was coming with Middlemas from Mr. M'Carty's, about eleven o'clock; we laid hold of each other's arm, and proceeded to go on board; we met a woman in the passage; I said to my mess-mate, let us give her the wall; accordingly he said, certainly; she had not passed us but a little distance, when we met a man; he asked us what was the matter? I answered, nothing; my shipmate asked if there was any offence? to which he replied, none; we bid him good night, and walked on; a voice then called after us to have some beer, in broad Irish language; I said, we had had quite sufficient; then we went on but a very little distance, when we were assaulted with stones; one of the stones hit me on the side of my head; he immediately flew from my arm, and cried out, by the held of God, carpenter, clear yourself if you can: I turned round, and the stones were flying very hot; thinking my life in great danger, and thinking every moment that my brains would be knocked out, I pulled out my knife; a man immediately seized hold of me, and we both fell down, and I suppose in the fall the wound might happen; I ran away with the loss of my hat, expecting a second attack; I then went to a woman and told her of it, and she said, it was most prudent to make the best of my way aboard, and she conducted me to Wapping-wall, and then I knew where I was; I went to Shadwell, and told the waterman we had been attacked in a furious manner, and had lost my hat, and he put me off on board, and when I found the mate was not there, I was very much afraid; but I had not been many minutes on board, before he came on board; there was a boy on board that knew the place better than me, and we went on shore to look for the hat, and when we got to the stairs, the runners laid hold of us.</p>

               <p>Court. This is merely the conjectures of the people.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. The stones that you speak of, that made you think somebody was pulling the house down, made a very violent noise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was this in a place called Spruce's-island? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Const. Q. The night was very still before you heard this noise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that noise was very violent? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Such as to be heard at a great distance? - A. It might be heard by the neighbours about.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. I live in New Gravel lane; I know the place where this unhappy accident took place, I was standing at the door when Middlemas came to my door in great haste, it might be about half past eleven o'clock, he told me he had run for his life, and was almost murdered; he lifted his hat, and ordered me to feel his head; his head was in a great flutter, and his pulse beat very high; I was afraid I should put my hand upon some wound, and I did not put my hand any further; he said it was down that alley, that he had been almost murdered; and he said, he had a partner, that he had lost his partner, and did not know whether he was murdered or not; he went from the door to the Boarded-entry to look for his mate, and he called upon his name three times, Joe, and there was no answer made, and I saw no more of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the night when this unfortunate accident happened? - A. Yes, the 25th of August; I went home when it wanted about a quarter of twelve, or not so much; I was alarmed by the throwing of one stone only, as I thought then, but the next morning there was no appearance of stones, but there was as many pieces of bricks as would half sink a pail; after I went into my house I heard a scuffling, and a number of more bricks thrown.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. Do you remember the night of this unhappy accident? - A.Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Between eleven and twelve o'clock did you happen to be looking out at you window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from the Boarded-entry? - A. A very short way from where the accident happened; I heard a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that there were any stones or bricks thrown? - A. A vast quantity indeed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At what time of night? - A. I think it might be near the hour of twelve I heard the quarrel; at the first of it between eleven and twelve; most of the language was Irish, which gave me little concern, because it is a usual, thing that I am accustomed to in that same track; I threw my window up, I heard a man that ran call out, with a loud voice, clear yourself, carpenter, if you can; instead of the carpenter getting clear, he went into a strong bustle, which continued about the space of two minutes, as if they had hold of each other, while the brick-bats were going very fast; then I heard them go to the ground, but in what manner I do not know; then one with a loud, and a hard voice, called out, oh Lord! Lord! Lord!</p>
               <p>Q. At this time were there any other brick-bats thrown? - A. I then heard different feet run; I saw the carpenter run past my door; I heard the deceased and the carpenter both upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You could not know that? - A. I heard them fall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. This took a considerable time then? - A. Yes; from the time the carpenter run it might be the course of five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think the whole transaction might take? - A.From the time I paid attention it might be between six and seven minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. And, from the noise of the brick-bats, there was quite a riot? - A.A perfect riot.</p>
               <p>Q. The night was still till this commenced? - A Yes; I heard a voice say, it is you, you bl-y b-r, that has done it, and I will have you hanged without Judge or Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know who it was said so? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. A great many other people were by at this time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first state what you have now stated? - A. I told it to several of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you hear the rattles go? - A. Yes; but that was after this had happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Lockett, who keeps a lace and ribbon shop, at No. 58, St. Paul's-churchyard—last Saturday week, between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, the female prisoner came in and asked for some brown ribbon; she bought one yard, value 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and one yard of other ribbon, value 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>—I showed her a number of boxes of ribbon, but she went away without buying any more—in putting the boxes away a minute or two afterwards, I saw that there was a space in one of the boxes which I had shown to her, and missed a piece of ribbon—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I received it from the policeman—here is the private mark on it—here are six or seven yards of it—there was also an empty space in one of the other boxes, but I cannot swear to this other piece of ribbon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as there is no mark on it.</p>

On this Saturday night, at 7 o'clock, I was on duty in Ludgate-street with Brett, and saw the male prisoner opposite Mr. Willey's shop, on the other side of the road, looking towards the shop—I looked in and saw the female prisoner coming out; she went up the street towards St. Paul's-churchyard, where they joined, and walked arm-in-arm together along the north side of the churchyard—I walked then as far as Mr. Lookett's shop; the female prisoner went in and sat down at the counter—the male prisoner walked up and down outside, and occasionally peeped in at the window—I watched for about ten minutes; the female prisoner came out, passed the male prisoner without speaking, and went on to Cheapside, he following her, and I following him, having first communicated with the young woman in the shop—they went into a public house in Aldersgate together—I and Brett went in, and they immediately left without having anything—I followed them up Goswell-street, where I said to the female, "I belong to the police, you have been in a lace and ribbon shop in St. Paul's-churchyard this evening"; she said, "No, I have not, Sir"—I said, "I know you have, and if you deny it, I suspect you have stolen something"—I took her into custody, and put</p>

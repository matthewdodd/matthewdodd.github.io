            . I saw this Gentleman and another walk up Snow-hill Side by Side, and saw the Prisoner pull a Handkerchief out of his Pocket as he passed by him. - I did not see him put his Hand into his Pocket, but I saw him draw it out, and wrap it up close in his Hand; said I to the Prosecutor, That Man has taken your Handkerchief, and showed him the Prisoner; I went, after the Gentleman had taken him, to the Parrot Alehouse in Green-Arbor Court , and the Handkerchief was then produced, this is such an one as he took out of his Pocket; I cannot swear to the Handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask the Gentleman whether he can swear to the Handkerchief? there are several Handkerchiefs in a Piece of the same Sort.</p>

            . I was at the Parrot in Green Arbor-Court , and asked the Prisoner how he came by the Handkerchief; he begg'd and pray'd, and said he never did any such thing before, and desired they would let him go: He had two more Handkerchiefs . I asked him whose those were? and he said, he did not know. Going along, my Beadle saw him offer to drop one or two; he had no Handkerchief about his Neck then that I saw. - The Prisoner jump'd down a sleep Pair of Stairs , that goes towards the Fleet Market, they are commonly call'd Break-Neck-Stairs, and there he was taken.</p>

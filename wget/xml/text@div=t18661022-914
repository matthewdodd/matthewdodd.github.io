I heard a violent screaming, ran to the prosecutor's house, and found the prisoner in the custody of Mr. Eatenton and his son-in-law—he said that he had made a mistake in the house, and it was all right—I searched him and found this large stone, this box of matches, and these other stones tied up in a handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the bolt of the street door had been forced, and the catch forced away—I asked him who he was—he said a charcoal burner—he refused to give his name and address, but afterwards told the inspector—he afterwards told me he was a tallow-candle maker—he was quite sober.</p>

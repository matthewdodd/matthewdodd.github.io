                  </hi>. I live at Peckham—in January, 1877, I entered the defendant's service at his warehouse, 11, Goldsmith Street Wood Street, City—ho was agent for the house of Alfred Crepon and Co., of Lyons, French manufacturers—I saw Mr. Santos, one of the partners, on one occasion—between January and November I sometimes went to the Credit Lyonnaise and obtained orders of credit on Lyons—I got the drafts in favour of Crepon and Co., of Lyons—I saw Mr. Santos at the warehouse about the time that cheque was written—he came on Monday 22th November—I was present when he was in conversation with Mr. Hopkin<lb></lb>son</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100079"></xptr>
               <p>—they spoke in French, which I do not understand—some goods were removed in cases from the warehouse on the occasion of Mr. Santos' it—they went away to Lyons, I believe—Mr. Santos' interpreter, who spoke English, directed their removal—the cheque was written before the goods were dispatched—Mr. Hopkinson wrote it and gave it me with this memorandum, marked C, to go to the Credit Lyonnaise—it was in the morning I left the memorandum and brought away the cheque with me—the manager was not there to sign the drafts on Lyons—I returned them after some interval, and received a draft and left a cheque and memorandum—I gave the draft to Mr. Santos, having been told to do so <hi rend="italic">by Mr.</hi> Hopkinson—I believe this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the colour and form of the draft.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was agent for A. Crepon and Co., and I believe for several other people—I know he bought and sold goods on account—I have no knowledge of the value of the goods on the premises belonging to A. Crepon and Co.—there were other goods besides these—some belonged to Mr. Abrahams, these were silk fringes which the prisoner had bought of Mr. Abrahams himself—I did not see all the goods taken away that went to Crepon and Co., they were there two or three days, and Mr. Santos was there frequently in communication with the prisoner for two or three days after the 13th November I <hi rend="italic">believe</hi>—on 14th November, the day after I had exchanged the cheque, I went again, by the prisoner's directions, to the office of the Credit Lyonnaise, and saw that gentleman (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Mr. Oxley</hi>), the same person I saw on the 13th, into whose custody I gave the draft—the prisoner directed me to go there, and ask them to hold the draft over, or something to that effect—I did so, and Mr. Oxley in reply told me that he had already telegraphed to Lyons to Stop the payment of the draft—he also said that the money must be paid that afternoon or he could do nothing—I brought that message back to the prisoner—I remember something about a bill in October of Crepon and Co. for 611<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was accepted by the prisoner, and the Credit Lyonnaise discounted it—I went in October to the Credit Lyonnaise in London, and asked them to hold over that bill because the prisoner had not the actual funds to meet it, and they consented to do so—I cannot say for eleven days or for how long—it was paid eventually by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It was a bill drawn by Crepon and Co. on the prisoner, which ho had accepted—I believe it was for money which he had to account to them for—the bill was endorsed by the Credit Lyonnaise, at Lyons, and then the Credit Lyonnaise in London took it up for the credit of their house, and the prisoner paid a portion of the money, and paid the rest 11 days after—he asked for time and got it.</p>

I live at Hornsey Rise, and for about. six weeks was employed by the prisoner as a clerk in his warehouse—I speak and understand French—I remember Mr. Santos coming to the place of business—about the time of his coming Mr. Hopkinson told me that he was in difficulties—on the Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday after Santos coming, the goods which were on the premises belonging to him went away; the greater part went back to Lyons, the others were removed to a Mr. Crumner's, of Mitre Court—I don't know whether he was the now agent or not—a portion of Mr. Abraham's goods were also taken away—I remained about a fortnight or three weeks after Mr. Santos' arrival—I was in am out—I did not stop in the office Any time—the last time I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100080"></xptr>
               <p>Saw Mr. Santos was towards the end of that week—lie remained in London till after the final removal of his goods—I saw him after that—do business that I know of was done for Messrs. Crepon and Co. after Mr. Cantos' arrival—I think a bill did come in which was dishonoured—I don't know for what amount—I never looked at it—I don't know anything about a liquidation petition being presented by Mr. Hopkinson—the receiver came and took possession—I did not do any work after<lb></lb>wards, but went every day to see if there were any letters for me—I remember a distress for rent being put in—I don't know what the debt was—I think it was after Mr. Santos left.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I believe the prisoner was agent for several other firms—he had goods of other people and also bought and sold on his own account—only a part of the goods which have been spoken of as belonging to Mr. Abrahams went back—there were a quantity of other goods on the premises besides these that went back to Crepon and Co.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the service of the Credit Lyonnaise Banking Company, carrying on business at 39, Lombard Street, City—that is the London agency, the chief office is at Lyons—we have been in the habit of giving the prisoner drafts on our London house in exchange for his cheques—on 12th November Hughes brought this cheque and memorandum, and in consequence of what he said I got a draft drawn out for the amount in French money, and had it signed by the manager about an hour afterwards—that is one of our ordinary forms—I then gave it to Hughes—that was about 2.30—at that time I believed that the open cheque of the Consolidated Bank was good, and that there were funds to meet it—I found that the cheque was dishonoured and telegraphed to our Lyons house to stop payment of the draft—we are now being sued for the amount—after the cheque was dishonoured I Saw Mr. Hughes, but did not speak to him—we took up a bill of 3rd October, which our house had endorsed at Lyons, and we looked to the prisoner for payment of it—he paid us 530<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the next day, and we gave I him time to pay the rest—he ultimately took up the bill—we had given him change for a cheque in August last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We used to change foreign drafts for the prisoner for large amounts, and his cheques up to that time have always been paid—there have been about a dozen drafts varying in amount from 630<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not speak to Mr. Hughes on the 14th, it may be that he saw some one else on that day—I knew that an application had been made to hold the draft over—we held the prisoner's acceptance over for 11 days, and he met it—we are now being sued on that draft in Lyods, and are I believe defending the action—at all events we have not paid; Mr. Abrahams has the writ—the defence is that the holder of the bill is affected by the fraud.</p>

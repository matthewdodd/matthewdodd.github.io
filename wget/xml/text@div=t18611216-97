                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, James Innes, carrying on business at 210, High Street, Wapping, as warehouse-keepers—on the 1st November I went into the warehouse in Cinnamon-street, Wapping—I found that a window on the first floor, about sixteen feet from the ground, had been opened—I found marks on the window-sill as if ropes had cut into it—there was the mark of a rope clearly as if something had been lowered—I also found ropes on the floor with running nooses in them—I found an empty hogshead on the floor which had previously been filled with sugar—I cannot say how shortly before I had seen it—I do not examine all the packages, they are so numerous—it ought to have contained sugar—I found the wrappers of three bales of canvas on the top floor—I missed six bales of canvas—nearly all the ropes which had bound the bales were left on the floor—the ropes that were made into the nooses were a portion of them—with those ropes they could lower those bales out of the window into a court below quite easily, they were just the length to reach to the ground—the weight of the canvas I missed was about six tons, and the sugar about fifteen cwt.—the value of the canvas was I believe from 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the sugar about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I drew the attention of the police to this matter—I have since seen the canvas produced to me by Stimson, and this is a part of it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are all marked, and correspond exactly with the way in which my canvas was marked—it does not belong to us—we are merely warehouse-keepers—it corresponds exactly in every respect with the canvas I missed—the sugar has not been found—I have had between five and six bales of canvas produced to me—some of it has been made up into bags—reckoning what is made up into bags, there is more than five and less than six bales—this roll does not represent a whole bale, only about a twenty-fourth part of one—there are twenty-four of these in each bale—ninety-six rolls have been discovered in their original state—there are a certain number which have had the mark cut off—we have discovered ninety-six of these rolls, and I think twenty-four of these other rolls; they have just been cut open—that is all—I think the canvas came from the manufacturers at Dundee, and the mark that I speak of is their mark, and comes up on the canvas—it is the length and breadth of the canvas.</p>

               <p>in my stable—I was in my stable doing up my horse—he asked me whether I could do a job for him—I said, "Yes," and I went with him to do the job—he said I was to be at the firm at 6 o'clock—I said I could be there at that time—he jumped into the van and rode with me—he said it was to move some canvas—he did not say why he wanted to move it—I went with him with the van to the firm—I did not know what firm he meant—I did not know which way to go to it without he went with me—he took me to a wood wharf—I backed into a side place, Clement-street, I think—I did not know the name of the place—he went with me to show me—I am now speaking of the place where I subsequently took the canvas from—I have been there since with Sergeant Stimson—I know now whose warehouse it is—they tell me it is this gentleman's (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Innes</hi>)—it is in innamon-street—Stewart jumped out there, and a man came out who I thought was the foreman—he said he was the foreman—he said, "You are all behind"—I said, "No, I am here at 6 o'clock"—he then showed me where to back the van in—I stood at my horses's head—there was not room for me to get either one side or the other when my van was backed in—they were about five minutes loading it—we packed it in the wood yard, not in the warehouse; it was alongside of it—they loaded me up in about five minutes with this canvas; it was in the shape of these—I had one horse—I should think there was a ton of canvas; nothing else besides canvas—I should know the man who said he was the foreman if I were to see him—I have not seen him since—I then drew the van outside and saw Stewart—he said, "It is going all in your road home, go on"—I went as far as my own house—I did not see Stewart, so I put the nose-bag on my horse and left it in the road, and had my breakfast; and then, not seeing Stewart, I drew it for safety into my brother's yard, and left my little boy to mind it, and took my horse out and went to brick carting—the van stood there one day and a half with the load on it—Stewart came and sent my little boy home, the same morning—I was not there then—I saw no one at all during that day and a half about it—I was told something by the little boy at the end of the day and a half, and I called and saw Stewart, and told him I must have the van—I saw him at my own house; be came—I told him I wanted the van—he said he had not got room at home the place was so full, and asked whether I knew of a shed where he could take it to work up into sacks—I sent him to my brother's who has a blacksmith's shop, and he told him it would take nearly a week or a fortnight to clear it out, or he would let it to him—I did not go with him to my brother then—he asked me if I would allow him to put it on my pig-sties—it was put there by Stewart and the foreman the same morning—Stewart said he had an order for so many sacks; that was the reason he wanted some place to make it up—it remained there that afternoon, andhe took an empty room that I had, and he brought it in and cut it up into bags, and the women came to work the next day for him, and worked it up—the day it was put into the shed was a day and a half after the day I took it from the ware-house—it stood over at my brother's a day and a half, and at 2 o'clock on that day they unloaded it in front of my shed, in the road, and on the same evening put it from the shed into the room—Stewart and his man did that, and on 31st the women began to work it up into bags—there, was also a little man there; I do not know who he was—I have never seen him since—I do not see him now—I saw ne'er a one of these men there besides Stewart—I have seen Hart at my place at work with the bags, folding them up—I first saw him there the next day, I think; at the some time the women came; I mean the day after it was put into the room—he came with the</p>

               <p>women, and he came that same night to help carry them out of the shed into my room with Mr. Stewart—he used to come now and then, according as Stewart ordered him to do anything—I was not always at home, and cannot say how often he was there—I think this went on about a week before the police came—I dare say Hart might have been there four or five or six times during that week—I saw Stewart there pretty well every day.</p>

               <p>they thought they were two officers come for them—they were not two officers—I did not think they were, but I think Stewart did; and when he came back again at night I asked him if the stuff was all right, and then it was he said, "Yes; and I have got a bill in my pocket to prove I bought and paid for it"—he pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket, whether it was a bill or not I cannot say—I did not ask to look at it—I cannot read or write—I was satisfied about the bill, and that was the reason I did not give information then—the policemen came on the Saturday, and I gave them all the information that I could, on the Monday; I did not see them on the Saturday—I gave the information to Stimson—I saw him at my own house at 8 in the morning—I stopped at home on purpose, as my wife bad told him I would meet him there.</p>

I live at 145, Rotherhithe-street, and am a labourer in the employment of Mr. Mullens of Old Gravel-lane—I recollect the 28th October—it was my birthday—I saw my brother, the prisoner, on that day—he came to tea and supper with me—he came just before 6—it might have been 6—I have been in the habit of celebrating that anniversary—I keep that day not every year, but sometimes—I did it on this occasion—my cousin, Rayuham Stewart, came with him, and remained till about half-past 11—my cousin left—the prisoner did not leave, he remained till about 9 in the morning—he had had a little drop to drink the same as we had—I proposed he should sleep there, and made him up a bed and he slept there—I saw him go to bed—I got up next morning about 6 or a little before; it might be a quarter to 6—he slept in the next room to me—I saw him before he left—I went into his room and had some conversation with him—I saw him in bed, and left him in bed—I returned to my breakfast at 8 o'clock, and he was there then—he breakfasted with me—I do not know when he left—I left him there at half-past 8 o'clock.</p>

"What did he have to say?"—I said, "Nothing much."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I said, "Yes"—he said, "What did he have to say?" I said, "Nothing much"—that was all, and then I walked inside again—it was the same evening that I told the consatab'e that I had not seen my brother or spoken to him for several months—it was not exactly at the same time—it was a few minutes afterwards—I came into the shop again, and had a second conversation with him—my mother got talking about one thing, and I said to him, "I have not spoken to my brother for weeks and for months"—I know it was not true that I had not spoken to my brother for months.</p>

I live at 5, Clarence-street, Waterloo-town, Bethnal<lb></lb>green—I am a traveller, in the employ of Higley and Co., bottle merchants—I remember the 28th October—it was the birthday of my cousin, the last witness, William Stewart—I was invited to go to his house—the prisoner John Stewart, accompanied me—we got there about 6, and left about half-past, 11, and I left the prisoner behind me—I did not bear any conversation about his sleeping there—I went straight home from there—I saw him again the next day, Tuesday, the 29th, about half-past 10 o'clock, at his mother's house, 95, Broad-street, Ratcliflf—I know the witness John Looker—I was in the parlour that day and saw a person—I did not know his name but I could recognise him—I was afterwards told his name—his name was John Looker (<hi rend="italic">looking at him</hi>), that is the person—he came in and asked my cousin to go and look at some canvas—my cousin said, "I will see, and I will let you know"—and he came in to me and said, "I must leave you"—he went away with Looker—I remained till he came back—he told me to do so—he was away about an hour, and they came back together—I heard</p>

I know the prisoner, John Stewart—I recollect going to his house some time in October—I suppose it was five or six weeks ago—I went to look for some work—it was on a Friday—he told me he had none at present; but he knew where I could get a week or two's work—I thanked him, and he said, "If you go anywhere near Bow-common, ask for Mr. Looker's place, and you may get a week or two's work there"—I went the following morning, about half-past 6 o'clock, and got employment there—there were some bags in the room—I saw Mr. Looker's eldest boy, and after some time I saw Mr. Looker himself, and they set me and the other young women to cut bags according to a pattern sack that was there—some time after Mr. Stewart and Mr. Looker both came into the room—Stewart said he thought the bags were not saleable—Looker went down and brought in a rule and measured the bags, and said, "Will they do?"—Stewart said, "I don't know"—I said, "If they are to be made like that we must hem the tops"—we made the bags according to that, and then Stewart said, "If there were some of the small ones we might get a sale of them better than the large ones," so we made some small and some large; but I have not got paid for either—it was Mr. Looker's son who opened the door when I went there, and pointed where I was to go—nothing was said to me about how the sacks came there—Mr. Looker told us to make them as exact as we we could—on the Monday he came in with a small piece, which he gave a young woman next to me—it was on the Saturday that I went there—I worked there all day Saturday—it was not on the Saturday that I saw Stewart and Looker there; it was on the Monday—oh, yes, it was on the Saturday, I made a mistake—there was a piece of canvas put in the window where there was a broken pane, and Looker said, "Take that piece of stuff away," and the girl went and brought a piece of cotton bed-curtain, and fastened it up with a fork at each end—he said he did not want the stuff to be seen—we were supplied with twine to work the sacks—Looker was in and out while we were at work, and his wife and daughter too—he gave us some oil and candle to work with at night—we worked till 9 o'clock—the girl brought in the light.</p>

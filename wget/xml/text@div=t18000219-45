               <p>Hare. I asked him where he was going, and he said, to the mason's; I told him to stop a bit; I sent the boy for an officer, and while the boy was gone for an officer, Mr. Pardon came up and put his hand to the prisoner's pocket, and said, what have you got here, my lad; and immediately pulled out two pint pots.</p>

               <p>William Dean, the constable, produced the pots, which were deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had had two pints of beer from Mr. Seares's, at Cripplegate, and I promised to take the pots back again; and I sat them down while I wheeled some stones, and the girl took them away; and when I went back again, I took up these pots, thinking they were the same.</p>

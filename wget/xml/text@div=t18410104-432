After the prisoner was taken to prison on the former charge on the Monday, I went back to the prosecutor's house and searched her bed-room, and found in the bottom of her box some bone-handled knives and forks, new, and wrapped up in paper just as a cutler would fold them—in a drawer in her bed-room I found three brushes, a plated fish-slice, a butcher's steel, a paste stamp, a pair of snuf<lb></lb>fers and tray, all enclosed in a piece of carpet, a black-handled knife and fork—under the bed there was a footman wrapped up in paper, just as it would be for sale—there was a private mark on it—I found in a cupboard a tin tea-pot papered up, and a private mark on it, and in another cupboard some ivory-handled knives and forks, as if for sale.</p>

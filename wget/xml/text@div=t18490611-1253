                  </hi>. I keep the George, in St. John-street, Clerken<lb></lb>well. I was at Mr. Goosey's house on 16th May, about three'o'clock in the afternoon—in consequence of what passed between us, I asked the prisoner, who was his barman, bow much money he had when he came into Mr. Goosey's service—he said he did not know exactly, it might be between 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked if he had laid any money out—he said no—I then told him of various things which I knew he had bought, and that I believed he bad been laying out some of Mr. Goosey's money—he said he had not, and all that he had was his own—I said I believed he had one shilling of Mr. Goosey's, and asked him to turn his pockets out, which he did—I told him to let Mr. Goosey go up stairs and search his boxes, which he did, and from a box which was locked, of which the prisoner produced the key, Mr. Goosey took a purse, and turned out its contents on the table, and amongst it was one shilling, which he claimed—the prisoner said there was about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. belonging to him, but he could not account how the other money came there.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Merlin's Cave, in Upper Rosomon-street—the prisoner was my barman. On 15th May I made an arrangement with Mr. Sams to ascertain the prisoner's honesty—it was his duty to get up at five o'clock in the morning, open the house, and to attend to the business till I came down at nine or a quarter-past nine—I examined the till, and found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—I took it all out—Mr. Sams had marked two half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence; they were put into the till—I looked in the next day, and missed one of the marked shillings—Mr. Edwards came at three that afternoon, and he told the prisoner he had got a shilling of mine, and to turn his pockets out—he did so, but the missing shilling was not there—we went up stairs, and 1 told the prisoner to unlock his box, which he did—I turned his coat over, and took his purse out, and in the purse I found the marked shilling—we told him that was the shilling we missed—he said all the money that was there was his own, and he could not account for it—this is the shilling.</p>

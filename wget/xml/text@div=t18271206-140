            . I am a horse-patrol. On the 24th of November a watchman gave me information; I saw the prisoner in Well-street, Hackney, at night; when I got within one hundred yards of him, he called Watch! and when I got up to him I said, "Who called Watch?" he said, "I did;" I said, "Why?" he said, "Because some one called me." The watchman came up, and said, "This is the man I saw carrying the board;" he said he knew nothing about it. I went and searched his house, which is just by, and in his bed-room I found this piece of mahogany.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had he any thing in his hand? A. Not when I saw him - I knew him before - he has a large family.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner passed me about half-past twelve o'clock at night, with a piece of coloured wood under his arm - a bay was at his side with a saw. I said, "Ketteridge, you should not carry such things at this time of night; if you pass me, and the next watchman stops you, I shall get into disgrace:" he said, "Oh, I have passed a watchman and patrol - it is all right;" the horse-patrol came up soon afterwards, and I told him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

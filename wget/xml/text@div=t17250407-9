             thus depos'd: The Prisoner and his Wife (the Deceased ) had been my Lodgers in Smithfield about two or three Weeks. On Sunday Morning he went out, and some time afterwards his Wife went to see for him, and at her Return told me that she found him in Company with some ill Women at Roper's, a lewd Alehouse in Pye-Corner, He came back at Night, and calling to me from the Stairs-foot, Is my Bitch above? Says he. If she is, send her down with a Candle. She beg'd me to go down with her, for fear he should abuse her. I went; He beat her, damn'd her for a Bitch, and swore he'd murder her. She ran out, and he after her; but she got out of his Sight, and came back again without any further Hurt. Pray, Landlady, says she, if he comes again, tell him that I am not here; for if he finds me, he'll certainly be way Death. I hid her behind my Bed. He came; I deny'd her; he swore, and went to Bed. When his wife thought he was asleep, she went into his Room to see how much he had spent of the Seven Shillings he took with him in the Morning. She came up, and said, I have found but Three-Halfpence; I am afraid he'll murder me, for he has found his Knife that I hid in my Box; it lies by his Bed-side with a Bull's Pizzle. Next Morning I went into his Room, and took the Bull's Pizzle out of the Chair. He jump'd out of Bed, snatch'd it from me, and swore that he valu'd his Pizzle as he valu'd his life, and he'd as soon lose an Inch of one as t'other; for he kept it on purpose to pizzle the Bitch his Wife. I left him; he dress'd himself, came out of the Chamber, lock'd the Door, and went away. His Wife between 6 and 7 in the Evening persuaded me to go with her to see for him at the Alehouse in Py-Corner: We went, found him there, and he was as good as his Word in exercising his Bull's Pizzle upon her. I left her, and she follow'd me in a quarter of an Hour. I blamed her, as her Life was in Danger, for not securing him, as he had been secured before in New-prison for abusing her. He came home soon after, and said I will make you, know, you Bitch that you shall follow me any more, for I am marry'd to little Jenny. Well, Davis, said she, if it is so, I can't help it; but neverthless, let us drink together and be Friends, for there's none in Heaven, or Earth beneath, that I love better than you; and therefore be married to who you will there's nobody shall enjoy you has myself. He took a Piece of Mutton in his Hand, and went to <placeName id="t17250407-9-crimeloc50">Starkey's at the White Horse</placeName>

She went; but it was not long before she came back with her Hand bloody, told me that he had cut her Fingers, and beg'd me to leave my Chamber Door open, that if he came home and offer'd to abuse her, she might run in there and save her Life. He came before I was gone to Bed, and in his usual Language call'd to his Wife to bring him a Candle. She went to him, and I went to Bed. I heard him swearing at her upon the Stairs, she at the same time begging him to be reconciled, and be Friends with her. At last she ran up into my Room, and he after her, with his Butcher's Knife in his Hand; and there, without any Provocation given him, I saw him slab her into the Breast. I jump'd out of Bed; she ran down Stairs; he after her, and I after him: He miss'd her, and I found her at a Neighbour's House, where she died about 12 o'Clock, which was about half an Hour after the received the Wound.</p>

             this depos'd: I live at the Tobacco-Roll, next door to Mrs. Tindall, (the last Evidence;) there's only a thin Partition betwixt their Stair-Case and mine. I was going to Bed between 11 and 12 o'Clock, when I heard a Disturbance in her Room, and a Noise of two or three People running down Stairs. I ran down too, and open'd my Door, to see what was the Matter. The Moon shone on one side of the Way, but the other was shaded by the Houses. The Deceased came to my Door, which was in the Shade, crying she was stab'd, and beg'd me to let her in, when Immediately I saw a Man run from the shady side into the Moon-light, with a naked Knife in his Hand, which I then thought appear'd bloody. I took the Deceased in; she sat down upon some Leaf Tobacco, and show'd me her Wound; but I could not bear to look on it. Mrs. Tindall and some other Neighbours came in. The Deceased cry'd, He has killed me; for God's Sake, call somebody to seize him, and don't let my Blood lie at your Doors. He runs about (says one of the Neighbours) with a Knife in his Hand, and swears, that he'll kill the first Man that touches him. He was brought in soon after by the Comfortable and Watch, and looking upon his Wife, Ha! says he, she is not dead yet. - Betty! speak to me! I am afraid, says I, you'll find to your Sorrow that she will not live much longer: The Lord give you a Heart to repent. Well, says he, I know I shall be hang'd, and I had as live be hang'd for her as for any body. A Surgeon was called, but to no purpose, for she died in about half an Hour. Gill the constable depos'd, that the Prisoner said, as he was going to New-Prison, I have kill'd the best Wife that ever Man lay by; I know I shall be hang'd; but, for God'd Sake, don't let me be Anatomized. Kilpatrick the Surgeon depos'd, that he searched the Wound, and believed it be the Cause of her Death. The Jury brought in their Verdict <rs id="t17250407-9-verdict51" type="verdictDescription">

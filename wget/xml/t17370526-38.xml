               <p>Mr. Uthar. I spent two or three Weeks enquiring after the Prisoner Dunnick, and in the Course of my Enquiry, I found that Smith and his Wife had pawned some of the Pieces so they were committed on Suspicion. The Woman is Dunnick's own Sister; he liv'd with them at that Time, and she conceal'd him. Some of the Silver they had pawn'd to Mrs. Gordon, and some to Mr. Wild, who are both in Court. These are the Piece.s</p>
               <p>Mr. Wild. I live in White-Cross Street: Elizabeth Smith brought two of the Pieces to me, and borrow'd six Shillings upon them the 29th of March. Afterwards on the 31st, she and

               <p>Mr. Wild. These are the very Pieces brought the 29th and 31st of March by the Woman Prisoner; here are the Tickets I pinn'd upon them when I lent the Money.</p>
               <p>Mr. Utbar. Smith and his Wife both deny'd that they ever had any Pieces of Eight; and his Wife knew that I was in Pursuit of Dunnick, yet she told me that she harbour'd him and concealed him. Her Husband sent me a Message, that he desired me to give him a Meeting on the 31st of March, and I reproached him with concealing his Brother; this was the very Day upon which he pawn'd some of the Pieces to Mrs. Gordon Mrs. Smith owned she had the Pieces from her Sister Dunnick.</p>
               <p>Thomas Smith I never had any of the Pieces from Dunnick. I <rs id="t17370526-38-deflabel168" type="occupation">deal in Needles</rs>

               <p>Mrs. Gordon. When he pledg'd them with me, he said he had them of a Sailor at Wapping, and truck'd Needles for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Utbar. She deny'd her having pawn'd any at all; and afterwards she said, she had them of Dunnick.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wild. She did deny she, ever pawn'd any. Her Sister was with her when she pawn'd them,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173705260017"></xptr> and she said her Husband desired her to pawn them.</p>

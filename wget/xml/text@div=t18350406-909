                  </hi>. I am a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Mary</hi>, of Harwich. On the 3rd of March, my ship laid at St. Katherine's-docks—I went into the King William, New Gravel-lane, with two friends—I met the prisoner Elliott, there—I asked her to dance with me, and she did, once—I after<lb></lb>wards asked her to take a glass of gin, which she did—after that, went out, intending to go on board my ship—Elliott asked me to go into the Shakespeare's Head with her, which I did—we had two half-pints of gin, to the best of my knowledge, and nothing else—after that we went out—Elliott took hold of my arm, and one of my shipmates and another friend walked with Collier, who had been in the last public-house—I was walk<lb></lb>ing along the street—Elliott asked me if I was going to sleep on shore—I said no, but I would recommend her to my friend, which I did—after that, one of my shipmates asked me to take his watch on board—I put it into my jacket pocket, and bid him good night—I wished Elliott good night—she put her arm round my neck, and I felt her draw the watch out of my pocket—I saw her step back and put it into Collier's hand—Collier then ran away—I took hold of Elliott and detained her—I was quite sober—Collier was taken up in about ten minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I heard the alarm, and I went up—the prosecutor had hold of Elliott by the arm—there was a number of persons close by—I believe Elliott said, "This man accuses us of steal<lb></lb>ing his watch"—he said, "This woman has stolen my watch, and the</p>

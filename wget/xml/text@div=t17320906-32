You have been doing Work and getting Money, says he, and we must have it. So you shall, says I, if you can get it. And with that he struck at me. I held up my Hand to defend myself, and struck at him with my Adz, upon which he fell back, and the other two came up and knock'd me down, and laid me quiet. I saw all their Faces so fully that I subscribed [described] them the next Day to two Men, and they and I saw the Prisoners at Tottenham-Court-Fair, and dog'd them as far as Snow-hill, and there they parted. Henly and Mills were follow'd by my Friends to White-Chapel, and there they were lost, and I follow'd Sharp to Smithfield, and took him.</p>

            . I live at Marybon Half way-House. About a Fortnight ago the Prosecutor had been at work for me, and then he went farther. He came back about 8 at Night; I was then standing at my Door. He told me he had been robb'd of 2 s. 2 d. Half-penny, and very much abused, and so indeed he was, for he could hardly go, and he describ'd the Men to me.</p>
               <p>James Townsend. On Thursday the 17th of August, about 10 at Night, I had Word brought me, that a Constable was wanted to take a Street-Robber. It being my Watch-Night I took a Watchman with me, and went to the Bullhead Alehouse by Smithfield, and there I found the Prisoner Sharp and the Prosecutor. The Prosecutor told me, that he had been robb'd, that Sharp knock'd him down; that he recovered himself, and thought he should have made his Part good with them, but they knock'd him down again, and that some of them (but he knew not which) took 2 s. 2 d. Halfpenny from him. I desir'd Sharp to confess if he was guilty, but he said he was innocent, and that he was Servant to Capt. Thorold, and could give an Account of himself. Next Day, being Friday, he was committed to Newgate. The Prosecutor got a Warrant for the other two; one he said was a Piper, and the other (whose Name he said was Henly) was a Dancer at Tottenham-Court-Fair. I went to the Fair, and waited for them; Mills was taken that Night, and Henly on the Sunday Morning following. When the 3 Prisoners were examined, they contradicted one another a little about their Acquaintance.</p>
               <p>I examin'd into the Prosecutor's Character; he said he serv'd his Time with Mr. Hopkins a Cooper in Thame-street, who had been dead 20 Years; but I met with Mrs. Hopkin's Son, who said, he knew the Prosecutor, and had employ'd him. I enquir'd of several other Coopers in and about Thames-street, who said, he was a very honest Fellow, and a good Workman, but that he lov'd a Pot.</p>
               <p>- Evans. I live in Neals-Yard in St. Giles's, near the Prosecutor. On Thursday Morning he came to me, and shew'd me that his Hand was lame; he said, that he had been robb'd over Night in Marybon-fields ; that the last Place he was at in Marybon was Mrs. Taylor's House, where he had earned 1 s. I told him of a House of ill Fame in Marybon; we went thither to look for the Prisoners, but not finding them, we went from thence to Tottenham-Court-Fair, where we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173209060022"></xptr> found them all 3. We follow'd them (and 2 Oysterwomen with them) to Holborn-bridge, and there they parted, and Mills and Henly, with the 2 Women went up Snow-hill.</p>
               <p>The Defence of the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>Sharp. When the Prosecutor took me up at the Bull-head in Smithfield, he said, he believ'd I was the Man, but could not swear it. Upon which I told him, I'd make him pay for false Imprisonment. Nay then, says he, right or wrong I'd swear it.</p>

I entrusted him with all my Stores, to take Money and give Receipts in my Name. He goes to School a Days, and lies a-Board a Nights.

            . I was drinking at the Bull Head, when the Prosecutor brought Sharp in with him, and said, Won't you sit down? What do you want with me? says Sharp, Why, says the Prosecutor, (looking hard at him) I believe you are one of the young Men that robb'd me. What do you mean you Villian you? says Sharp. But, says the Prosecutor, I can swear it was you, or the Devil in your Cloaths. Can you, says Sharp, why then if you don't, I'll charge a Constable with you for charging me with a Robbery. Sharp sent for a Constable, the Prosecutor said, If you are not the Mare, you may go about your Business. The Prosecutor was going out, Sharp stopt him, and said, he would make him pay for scandalizing him. Nay then, says the Prosecutor, Since you are saucy, I'll swear it by God, right or wrong.</p>

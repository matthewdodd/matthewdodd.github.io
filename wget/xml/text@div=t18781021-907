I am the landlord of Duchy Chambers, 137A, Strand—in June last both the defendants applied to me for an office which I had to let—it is a sort of a toss<lb></lb>up which came first; I think Wraxall came fast; they used to come a minute or two after one another, they came a great many times—they both agreed to take the office, at a rental of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, a moiety to be paid by each of them fortnightly—Wraxall said that was most con<lb></lb>venient to him, as he settled on the Stock Exchange fortnightly—he said he was a member of the Stock Exchange, which I knew was a respectable calling—I demanded a good reference, and he gave me the Merchants' Joint Stock Bank, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury; that was after a number of interviews—he told me that he had the placing of the whole of the shares of that bank on the Stock Exchange—Crowley said he was agent for the South African Company; he said very little in the matter, Wraxall did all the talking—he said distinctly that he did not know anything about Crowley; he told me that half a dozen times, but I think he did know all about him—on 4th July they signed the agreement and came into occupation legally on the following Monday—I never got paid a penny—Wraxall gave me the name of Harry Horatio Wraxall, but in all the papers in was Henry William; he did not say he was a baronet, if he had I would not have taken him, I should have made further inquiries about him—I saw both defendants frequently at the office after 4th July; they both sat at the table and appeared to be very busy there; an immense number of letters were received there, the table was always crowded with letters—at Wraxalls direction I had painted on the door "Wraxall and Co.," and then "South African Trading Company," and underneath G. R Crowley, manager <hi rend="italic">rat</hi>—on one occasion when I went for my rent I caught them both looking at the names on the door, and they both approved of it—Wraxall said "Sir Harry Wraxall is the head of my firm"—I did not even ask him for the rent upon that, as he was such a very important person—I went and made inquiry at the Merchants' Bank; I saw Mr. Lake, the manager, and I saw the defendants there, standing at the private door—in consequence of what Mr. Lake told me I was perfectly satisfied—on a Friday before Wraxall was taken into custody he absented himself from the office; the police could not catch him, and I said I would, so I wrote a letter to the bank stating that I had three registered letters addressed to Wraxall, and I did not know his address, and on the Saturday afternoon, the 24th, Wraxall rushed into the office and the policeman put his hand upon him and took him off—I saw him at the Bow Street station about half an hour afterwards—I asked him about the rent, and he said "If you give me those three registered letters with the money in, I will break them open and pay you the rent out of the money"—I asked him if he had authority to break them open—he said "Yes, I have"—those three letters only existed in imagination, it was done to catch the fellow.</p>

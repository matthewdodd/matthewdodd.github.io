On the 3rd of October, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me, and asked what time they opened the coal shed next door; I said exactly at seven o'clock - she said by husband lodged there, and asked if she might sit down at my place till it was open; I let her come into my room - I went out for a short time: when I returned I missed a shirt and two combs - I taxed her with having them; she utterly denied it, with many oaths and imprecations, and called me all the old husseys she could; I offered to search her, but she pushed me away - I sent for the officer, and he took her to the station; a door or two before we got there she dropped the shirt from under her petticonts - this is it; I had not known her before.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. The prosecutrix sent for me, and I found the prisoner there, accused of stealing a shirt and two combs - she denied it; I took her to the station-house, and as we were going along I saw her put her hand into her pocket-hole, and I directed the prosecutrix to keep watch - I saw her drop this shirt, and when she had been a short time at the station I found these two combs behind her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The property is my husband's, and the prosecutrix washes for him; the people at the next house are the means of keeping me from him - he ill-uses me, and says if he cannot transport me he will get some other person to do it.</p>
               <p>ELEANOR DEATON. I do not wash for her husband - this shirt belongs to a man named John Johnson, a navigator.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I asked her to go to my husband, and ask him for a trifle; he has kept me in prison two months; I did not take it to steal it - I asked the Policeman who first came to search me, but he would not take me; he fetched this man because he knows my husband.</p>

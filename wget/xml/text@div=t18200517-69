On the 25th of April I left my house about twelve o'clock - my wife was out; I have no family, and left nobody in the house. I locked the outer door, put the key into my pocket, and left all the property safe; I left all the articles stated in the indictment there. I returned in about half an hour, and found the door half open and half shut. My wife was at work next door, I went to her. I found nobody in my house, they had entered it by a false key; it had not been forced - I am certain I locked it before I left. I found two boxes broken open, the gowns and money taken out; my clothes which hung up, and the pillows on the bed were taken. There is only a front and a back room, no upper room. The coat, waistcoat, and breeches were in a bundle - they had been left at my house by a drover. I found nobody about the premises. I had seen the prisoner before, he lived in Cato-street, within about ten yards of my house; he used to frequent my master's, the Bayswater tea-gardens, which joins my house. I found the property next day at Bow-street, where the prisoner was in custody. They were worth 54 s., and I lost 20 s. in money. I found a screwdriver on the box, which corresponds with the marks on them, it was not mine. They must have entered at the door, the windows were all fast.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 25th of April, about one o'clock in the day, a person called on me, and said there were two persons in the fields near Bayswater. I went out, and saw two men in John-street, Edgeware-road. I went to the end of John-street, and saw one man with a bag, and the other apparently looking round to observe if they were watched. I have no doubt of their being in company together. I went down John-street and followed them, but before I got to the end of Cato-street the man with the bag turned into Cato-street - the prisoner looked about, turned himself round, and followed him. I followed them into Cato-street as fast as I could, and the man with the bag went into a passage a little way, so that the bag remained partly outside the door. The prisoner turned round again, and saw me coming after him - he was then very near the man with the bag.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time you first saw them they kept close together - A. Yes, seeing me coming after them the prisoner passed very quickly by the house where the man with the bag was, and before I could get up the man rebounded backwards from the passage, threw the bag down, and ran off. I called out Stop thief! I could not run myself having slippers on; not being on duty I was at work as a shoemaker. The man with the bag escaped through a house in Mitcham-street, five or six hundred yards from Cato-street - the prisoner went out at the Queen-street end; I was then informed he lived in the house where the man was going in with the bag. I took the bag to my house, which was just by, then returned to the same house in Cato-street, in the passage of which I had seen the other man. The landlady of the house unlocked the door of the front room on the first floor. The first things I saw were two centre-bits, one larger than the other, two pistol flints, and a powder-can, but no powder in it. I tried to open the table drawer, but it was locked; I afterwards opened it, and found eight or nine picklock keys, two common keys, a phosphorus bottle, two duplicates, and a pair of spurs.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you next see the prisoner - A. On the Saturday week after, at Bow-street - the 25th of April was Tuesday. I have no doubt of his being the person who was in company with the other man. The bag contained the articles stated in the indictment, except the money.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Cato-street, Edgeware-road; the prisoner lived at my house six weeks. I remember Woodberry coming to the house - the prisoner had lived with me six weeks on the Saturday before the bag was dropped, which was on Tuesday; it was dropped in my passage about one o'clock in the day. I shewed Woodberry the prisoner's room, and unlocked the door for him. He came to me as a married man, and brought a woman as his wife - she only stopped a week. He lived alone in the room for five weeks before the officer came. I saw Woodberry find the skeleton keys - the account he has given is correct. The prisoner did not return to his lodgings afterwards. He had not intimated any intention to leave, but said he was very comfortable and should stop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not tell you I was going into the country that day to live, and say I expected two men to call - A. No; he said he was going out a little while, but should be back at half-past twelve o'clock. He went out between ten and eleven o'clock, and a woman called and enquired for him. I told her he would be home by half-past twelve o'clock. I did not show her into the room. When the room was taken, two young women came and engaged it, subject to his approval. One of them spoke as his wife, and said, if her husband liked it she would take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not persons frequently call on me - A. Not to my knowledge. I gave him the key of the front door, and did not trouble myself about it. He never left the key of the room with me before, and then he expected his brother to call to breakfast. I offered several times to make his bed, but he said he could do it himself. I do not think there was any key to the table-drawer. I cleaned the room out before he took it, and moved the table about; and if the keys had been there, I must have heard them rattle. I cleared the room out for him once, and I believe he once<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182005170041"></xptr>left it open for my son to go in and clean his boots. I have a lodger in the back room on the same floor. The keys of the rooms are different; I do not know whether one opens the other.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 5th of May I was apprehended. I hope you will take my case into your serious consideration, and not find me guilty, as I can positively assert I know nothing of the affair.</p>

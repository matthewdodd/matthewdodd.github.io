             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of December, I received information of a sack with some things gone into a house in Bell Lane; I ran down and called upon another officer, and went into the house, there were three sitting by the fire, in a back room, Norgate, Cadey, and one Pearce, I told them my business, and the prisoner Cadey told me there was no such thing, I looked about, and saw some lead lay in the floor, and Cadey said a man had just brought it in, and threw it down and run away, I asked Norgate and Pearce what they did there, and they said, they came to see Cadey, and they were weavers; I took hold of the hands of Pearce and Norgate, and they were all mortar, I said, you do not look like weavers, I have a notion you have stolen this lead; they said, they had been up in a pigeon trap at the top of a house, and that made their hands so dirty: we took them into custody; and on Monday before the Justice, Pearce turned evidence: I and another of our officers went up to the top of the house, where the lead was stolen from, and we brought a piece of lead away from the top of the house, to match with that which was stolen; it was taken off the gutter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott, Prisoner's Council. Whereabouts was this lead laying in Cadey's house? - In the back room on the ground.</p>
               <p>But that contained sundry other things? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140121"></xptr>Was this lead laying? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the hands of Cadey? I did not, I had no suspicion at that time that he had stolen it.</p>
               <p>- POWELL sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fleming came to Mr. Burner's, where I work, and desired somebody to go to the office to look at some lead which had been laid on the building.</p>
               <p>Who did the building belong to? - I should suppose to Fleming, he paid us, that was in the year 1782.</p>
               <p>Has Mr. Fleming any partners? - I know nothing at all about him; I went to the place where they said the lead was stolen from; this gutter was laid in two lengths; the upper length was gone, and the lower length remained, which corresponded, they had joined; it was cut strait down and not indented.</p>
               <p>Court. In laying the different lengths of a gutter, do not you lay the one over the other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you nail them down at the joining? - Not at the bottom but against the rafters, on the sides where the lead turns up, and sometimes at the drip.</p>
               <p>You did not sit that piece to the place? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you clearly satisfied as a workman, that that lead was taken away from that place? - I have no reason to doubt it, yet at the same time I cannot swear it, there is a great deal of lead of that length; it was not a very usual length.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there any body here belonging to the house it was taken from?</p>
               <p>Shakeshaft. My Lord, I went to Mr. Sykes, one of the executors, and he told me he had had a great deal of trouble with the houses, and would have no more.</p>
               <p>Powell. I believe they were uninhabited houses; I did not think to examine the nail house; I cannot swear with precision.</p>

               <p>I am an accomplice in this business, and have been admitted an evidence; Norgate and I was at the Duke's Head, in Winford Street, drinking a pint or two of beer, and agreed to go to Carey's house to got some chissels to go to this house: Carey had no chissels to lead us and Carey returned back with a bit of iron bar; then we went to the house, and got over a wall and went up two pair of stairs and broke through the ceiling; I went to the top of the house and got the lead off, we brought it down into the yard, and went to Carey's house and told him; then Carey took up a bag, and went with us and put it in, and carried it back to his own house.</p>
               <p>Court. Carey was not with you when you ripped it from the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you but Norgate? - No, it was seven weeks last Saturday, about six or seven in the evening, about half an hour before we were found.</p>
               <p>Court to Shakeshaft. Did you perceive how they got up? - Yes, they broke through the cieling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott. My Lord, I submit that the felony was compleat before Carey was employed, and therefore he is a receiver.</p>
               <p>Court. I am of the same opinion, because it is not laid generally, but as fixed to the dwelling house, and there is also no other circumstance against him except as a receiver, but the evidence of the accomplice.</p>

               <p>The Prisoner called five witnesses, who all gave him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearce. What were you to have for this lead? - I believe ten shillings and four-pence.</p>
               <p>Court to Powell. What was it worth? - It is worth at the rate of sixteen shillings a hundred.</p>
               <p>Court. Why then ten shillings and four-pence was as much as it was worth? - Yes.</p>

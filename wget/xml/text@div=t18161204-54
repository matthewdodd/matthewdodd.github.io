The carpet was placed about a yard within the shop, on the 8th of November; in consequence of information which I received, I ran up the road after the prisoner; I saw him with the carpet; I lost sight of him; I did not come up to him until he was taken; I saw the carpet on his back. I took him myself, afterwards; I brought him back to the shop; he said he was not the man. I am sure I saw him with the carpet. I have seen him lurking about the shop several times before.</p>

            . I am also shopman to Mr. Wilson. A woman came in and asked me if I had lost a carpet; I looked, and found it was gone; I ran up the road; I saw the prisoner at the top of the road; I laid hold of him; he dropped the carpet, and his hat also; he was running across the road with the carpet on his back. I stooped for the carpet, and he got away. I called out stop thief! and he was taken by the last witness; when he got from me he ran down a street and I lost sight of him. I am sure he is the man that I stopped with the carpet; the carpet laid on another, and might be taken away without a noise. I did not see him take it; it was worth 35s.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clothier, and live in Bermondsey Street. On Thursday night, 24th Dec., I was in Leadenhall Market, at the lower end of the poultry market, about 7 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there; it was rather in a dark place between the stalls—I was going to purchase an article, and did not like to pull out my money before the stall, and went a little further on—there was a great crowd—I stopped, and the prisoner came right in front of me, and put his fingers working away at my waistcoat—I looked down and saw his hand drop from my watch guard—I saw my guard hanging without the watch—I said to the prisoner, "You have taken my watch"—he said, "What, me?"—I said, "Yes"—I took him by the collar, held him that he could not run away, called a policeman, and gave him in custody—hestood pretty quiet when I had got him by the collar—I have seen my watch since—it is here now—it came to me by the parcels delivery—this is my watch—it is in the same state in which I received it—the chain is broken—therewere a great many people about, but no person on my right hand—Istood and let the people pass—the prisoner would not go by me—I saw him drop my chain from his left hand—I had had my watch not half a minute before I had left the stall—I merely went there, not a yard off.</p>

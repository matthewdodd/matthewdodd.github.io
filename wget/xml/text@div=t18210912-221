            . I was in the Red Lion, public-house, Nightingale-lane, I saw the prisoner there, he followed me and the prosecutor out, and by the London-docks he turned back; I saw him push the prosecutor down and snatch his watch - I followed and secured him, and with assistance, took the watch from him. Two or three came up and said, "Knock him down." I was obliged to let him go - he was taken next day. I am sure he is the man, he was quite sober.</p>

            . I live with Mess. Colvil and Blackburn in Milk-street. On the 9th of February last we sold twenty-three dozen of linen handkerchiefs; they were laid on the counter ready to send to the person that bought them; when we went to pack them up there were four dozen and eleven missing; the Wednesday following the prisoner was brought to our house; I was not in the way; I know nothing more.</p>

            . I am a constable; Mr. Foreshall's young man came for me; I went there, and the black and the woman were detained in Foreshall's shop; the black acknowledged he stole them, and brought me to the house of Mess. Colvill and Blackbourn; he said he saw Mr. Blackbourn in the back room; that he went in and took the handkerchiefs off the counter; there were seven handkerchiefs stopt at Mr. Foreshall's. I went to the house of the prisoner and found twelve more in the bed (producing them.)</p>

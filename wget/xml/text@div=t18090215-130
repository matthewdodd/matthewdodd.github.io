               <p>Q. What was it that led you to charge her with this - A. I lost several more things while she was in my service. On the 17th of January she went away without her box being searched; she came to me for a character; I told her I had missed several articles; I mentioned the cap, I did not know any thing of the habit shirt; I missed the baby's cup, it was worth more than a guinea; I told her if she would tell me of it I would be as favourable as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. After that I must not hear whether she said any thing about it or not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see that cap - A. On the 27th my husband and the servant who now lives with me went to her lodgings and brought her box; she was with them herself; she said she could not tell about the baby's cap; she believed the habit shirt was in her box by mistake; upon looking at them I knew them to be mine.</p>

            . When I apprehended the prisoner I asked her if she had any box; she said yes; she shewed me her box; I found the cap in one of her boxes and the habit shirt in another; the prisoner said they came into her boxes through a mistake.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is my mistress's shirt and cap; I cannot give any account how it came in the box; I left Mrs. Whites' house; I brought one box away, and left another behind me; I had no lock on the box; I think somebody must have put them in; I washed them and if I put them in, I did not intend to take them away; I went to Mrs. White's and asked her to give me a character; she told me she had lost spoons and a variety of articles; I told her if there was any thing in my box I would return them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

I am in the service of Mr. Calvert—on 14th June I went to bed about 11.30—I went to sleep, and was awoke about 12.30, by my bedroom door opening—I could reach the door from my bed—I pushed but could not shut it—I closed it about half an hour afterwards—I tried it three times, but it resisted—I waited about twenty minutes, and heard whistling outside—I then tried the door again, and shut it—I went and called my master—he went down stairs, and I went back to the door, and found a man lying under a child's cot—I touched him with my foot, and he got up—I asked him what he wanted, and he said to get out—I tried to open the door and could not—I then opened the nursery door, he went in and I locked him in—I then called Major Calvert up—I had fastened up the house—the window that he came in at had been left open—I can't say whether it was wide enough for a person to get in.</p>

               <p>again into the nursery, and found the prisoner behind the door, and took him in custody—I asked him what he was doing there, and he said he was hungry and came to get some bread—he had no shoes, stockings, or coat on—he had got through a window of a small room outside the night nursery, which had been left open on account of the hot weather—I did not see how far the window had been left open.</p>

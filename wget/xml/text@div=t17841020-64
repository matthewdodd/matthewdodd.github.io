I called my father to serve the prisoner, while I attended the other; my father turned his back, and I saw the prisoner put his hand to his breast, I did not see him take any thing; the little man offered less than the stockings cost, he went out, and the prisoner followed him; I told my father that I had a very great suspicion of them, I followed them two or three hundred yards, I saw the little man go up to another hosier's shop, and the prisoner went up to speak to a woman in a bath cloak, who seemed to be waiting for him; whilst he was talking to the woman, I spoke to a neighbour, and observing his side pocket bulged a little, I spoke to the prisoner, and there was a pair of silk stockings in his pocket; these stockings are my father's own property, I took them from the breast of his coat myself.</p>
               <p>When he put his hand to his breast, did you see him have anything? - I did not: the stockings are spun silk, they stood us in seven shillings and eight-pence a pair, but I have laid them only at six shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He acknowledged before Sir Sampson Wright, that he saw me put them into my pocket? - I said no such thing.</p>

               <p>I was going to my agent, he lives by Golden-square, one Mr. Green, for some prize money for the Don frigate; going along Holborn, I met a little man in a brown coat that stuck up pictures, I understood his name was Jones; says he, Hughes, will you give me a dram, says he I have got a pair of stockings to sell, and if you will buy them I shall be glad, I bought them, and gave him five shillings and sixpence, and a quartern of gin; we drank the gin, and I have a witness that saw me give him the money.</p>
               <p>A WITNESS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant, I live at Shoreditch with my mother at present, I am out of place.</p>
               <p>Court. What is your mother? - She is an engine-windster by trade.</p>

               <p>Have you any father living? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is he? - He is a weaver.</p>
               <p>How long have you known this man? - He and his wife lived in the house where I lived servant, I have known his wife many years, and I have known the man since he has been home, about six or seven months, he is a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Williamson. This is the same woman that met the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She was along with me, and drank the dram, and saw me give the money.</p>
               <p>Witness. I met the prisoner coming from Bloomsbury-square, he asked me how I did, he was speaking to another man; and the man said, my dear, you may as well have a dram of something to drink; he was giving something to the man, but what it was I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Court. Your meeting was quite accidental I suppose? - Yes.</p>

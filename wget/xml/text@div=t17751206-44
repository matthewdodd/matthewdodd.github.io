               <p>"that was all;" I said yes, I had been shooting in the country, and could not be supposed to have much money: then he demanded my watch, and bid me make haste: I told him I had no watch, he replied, "you have;" I told him I had not, and if he would not be satisfied, he must come in and search; he then said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your blood, if I find more money or</p>
               <p>"a watch, I will blow your brains out," and cocked his pistol; upon this Mr. Cummings said, don't be violent, take away your pistol, here is my money, and gave him his purse; I believe, before that, the prisoner did not see Mr. Cummings, as I sat pretty forward in the chaise, wrapped up in my great coat: he then said,</p>

               <p>As Mr. Cuddin and I were returning to town, a little this side Gunnersbury-lane, a person on horseback rode up to the chaise, and demanded our money; I believe Mr. Cuddin was asleep at the time, but he was alarmed, and gave him his money: the man was not satisfied with what Mr. Cuddin gave him, but said he must have some more; Mr. Cuddin told him he had no more; he said you have more, and I must have it; give me your watch, he said he had no watch, and he might come in and search; he said,</p>
               <p>"D - n your</p>
               <p>"eyes, if I find more money or a watch, I will</p>
               <p>"blow your brains out:" I then leaned forward, and said, don't use us ill, the gentleman has no more money nor watch:</p>
               <p>"O! said he, your</p>
               <p>"money then;" I gave him my purse: he then said again,</p>
               <p>"If he searched us and found</p>
               <p>"any more money or a watch, he would blow</p>
               <p>"our brains out. While he was robbing Mr. Cuddin, the prisoner not seeing me, I had time to lighten my purse, and leave in it what I thought proper, and had an opportunity to take notice of his person: I can positively swear the prisoner is the same man, he had the same coat on he has now. There was a circumstance Mr. Cuddin forgot when he was robbing us, he called out,</p>
               <p>"Matt, you need</p>

               <p>I keep the Union Arms, Piccadilly. I have seen the prisoner several times; he came into my house on Monday se'nnight, and desired somebody to take care of his horse: he wanted some punch, but being in liquor I would not make him any: I did not go out to see the horse, he staid but a few minutes.</p>
               <p>What hour did he come to your house? - I cannot say particularly, I believe it was after ten o'clock; he pulled out some money to let me see he had money, and dropp'd some; I picked up a thirty-six shilling piece.</p>

               <p>I leave myself to the mercy of the Court: I was taken so lately, I have not had time to send for my friends; I think it hard I should be tried so soon.</p>

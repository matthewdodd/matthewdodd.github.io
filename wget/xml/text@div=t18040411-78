               <p>Q. Is your's an open shop? - A. My shop has a large glass bow window.</p>
               <p>Q. How does your door shut? - A. With a latch; I was not up stairs five minutes; when I returned again, I found my street-door open; I asked my sister who had been in the shop, she said nobody.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your sister here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you staid up stairs long enough to put your child to bed? - A. Yes; I had sent my sister up before.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is she? - A. My little girl is seven years old; I went to my fore-door immediately; I saw a little boy, I received some information; I run over the way to the sign of the Blue Anchor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your husband there? - A. Yes, he was spending the evening; he had just gone; I opened the parlour-door, and said, Dunant, the till; I could say no more my fright was so great.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home you looked for the till? - A. I went into the shop and looked for the till, it was gone; I did not know what the amount of the money was then exactly; I knew it was near three or four pounds in copper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the persons of these two men? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Your sister is not here? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you take the candle away when you went up stairs? - A. I took the candle away where I sat, my shop is first, and my parlour is second, and the kitchen is behind all, on a floor.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can they see from the kitchen into the shop? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the door was latched? - A. Yes, I am sure the door was latched; I had a customer in the shop; I went after them and latched the door, as I always do; I am positive I latched the door.</p>

             sworn. - I am used to go out to service; I have been very ill, and now I go out a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110078"></xptr>cleaning; I had been over to Stepney, and returning home, on Friday, the 23d of March, between eight and nine o'clock, I met Briggs; he had at his right side something like a till.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. I never saw him before that I know of; I met him in Brook-street, just by Shakespeare's Rope-walk; he had a till by his right side, and with the flap of his coat over it; I perceived both penny-pieces and half-pence in the till; the moon was very bright; I said to him I wished they were mine as I passed him; he made no answer; he had another with him; but as to say I should know the other, I should not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is Briggs? - A. That man in the yellow waistcoat.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure? - A. I am positive they went towards the Commercial Road, and I saw them no more till after they were brought back into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon were they brought back? - A. I believe it might be half an hour, not more; Briggs was brought back first, to the sign of the King's-head, in Brook-street.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought back, were you sure he was the man you saw with the till? - A. I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the till when he was brought back? - A. No, he had nothing then; I knew him by his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You had never seen Briggs before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I am a servant.</p>
               <p>Q. You are out of place? - A. No, I go out to cleaning and washing sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. You know there is a forty pounds reward if you convict this man? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know; has not Turnbull the officer talked about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any conversation with him about it? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a moon-light night? - A. Yes, I am sure of that.</p>

               <p>Q. I observed that at first you said it was something like a till? - A. Yes, and about the breadth of my hand was uncovered.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, as it was under his coat, how could you see they were penny-pieces? - A. They were just enough uncovered to see that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Briggs tell you, that if you did not come forward, he would take you to the House of Correction? - A. No, he did not say a word about that.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always sworn to the tallest of the two? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you read or write? - A. I can read a little, but not write.</p>
               <p>Q. Who told you it was the 23d of March? - A. It was my birth-day on the 7th.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state it to the Jury that you knew it by your birth-day, that it was the 23d of March? - A. No, I heard it when he was brought back; I did not know he was taken till he was brought back into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you take notice of the tallest? - A. I did not notice the little one.</p>
               <p>Q. You liked the tallest best? - A. I did not like either of them; I took notice of him, because he had the money.</p>
               <p>Q. It is the money only? Do you mean to swear positively to his person? - A. Yes.</p>

Going along the Commercial-road on the 23d of March, between the half-way house at Stepney-Causeway, these two prisoners and a boy along with them, seeing me come along, they turned out of the road directly, they seemed to have something under their coat, and they carried it along-side of them, with the flap of the coat over it; I think it was on the right side, I was about ten yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see what it was? - A. I could not see particularly what it was, because he had it under his coat; I had suspicions, by their turning out of the road, they had been doing something they should not; I turned back, and looked which way they went, they stopped about forty yards from me; I went on about twenty or thirty yards further, and

Yes, before he went up the passage we saw him with it; then Edward Passey and I took him; he seemed obstreperous, and said we should not take him; we told him we would take him, and we took him near the half-way house; we had only one then, Briggs.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take the other? - A. Passey thought Briggs would be too many for him, so we got hold of him, each on one side; when we got him nearer the half way house, he seemed stronger than we thought he was; then Turnbull came up, he took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other one? - A. Dunant took him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that Taylor was the other person that was walking on the other side? - A. I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a moon-light night? - A. Yes; they were taken to Turnbull's office, and from there to the Thames Police; we found the till in a gravel-pit, I was the first that saw it in a gravel-pit in the Commercial-road, nearly opposite where I saw them first.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw it, was it like a till or like a bundle? - A. I cannot say; I was ten yards off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were ten yards off, you fairly said you did not know what it was? - A. I only know it was something very heavy under his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Afterwards you said you saw a sack? - A. No, an apron; the till we found some time after they were taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. How long? - A. About an hour and a half.</p>

             sworn. - I am a cornchandler: On Friday night, the 23d of March, I went as usual to spend my evening at the Blue Anchor; Mrs. Dunant came over, and said she had lost her till, upon which I and several others pursued the prisoners; I overtook them about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house; I met the witness Bromage, he said he met two men; I went after them with him, he went on a few paces, and crossed the road, and called to the watchman, and desired him to follow us as fast as he could; I went up to the prisoners, and asked them if they had seen two men go along the road; they made answer they had not; I told them there had been two men ringing the changes with a butcher of a seven-shilling piece; they then said, they had seen two men in the fields, pointing towards Stepney church; I then perceived Briggs to have something across his shoulder; I left them then, and went to the witness Bromage; I told him I suspected they were the thieves, we crossed the road, then we met

            , an officer; I told him of the person who had been robbed, he is a near neighbour of his; he told me he would follow me in a few minutes; I then crossed the road again, and looked at the prisoners both full in the face, to see if they were the people I first met; when I came into the road again, I looked to see if the watchman was coming, or near at hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw them again, were you sure they were the men? - A. I was; they were the persons I first saw, I had lost sight of them only when the moon was in the clouds, that was only a short time; I then went across the road, and saw the prisoner Taylor standing by himself; I collared him, I did not see the other at that time; after I collared Taylor, I saw Briggs come out of an alley; he had not the bundle on his shoulder then which I at first saw him with; I then collared Briggs, I asked him what he had done with the bundle he had on his shoulder; I told him I thought he was the person I was looking after; he said, he had no bundle; I told him that Mr. Dunant had been robbed of his till, and I thought that was the bundle he had on his back when I saw him first; I told him he must go along with me; he said, he would not go along with me; in the mean time the witness, Bromage, had Taylor; he found that Briggs could not be managed by me alone; I had given up Taylor to Bromage at the first taking of Briggs; he let him go, and took hold of Briggs; I then called the watchman, and I found the money in the lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The moon did not shine all the night? - A. No, it shone at those times I took the opportunity of seeing what they had, and seeing their persons.</p>

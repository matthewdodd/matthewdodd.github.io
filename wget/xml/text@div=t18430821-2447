The prisoner came and asked if I would buy some things—he said he had got several ironmongery things, and they were not right—(I thought he meant that they were stolen)—I asked where he lived—he told me, and I said I would go there that night or the next morning—I went the next day, and saw them—I went again with the policeman, and he took him and the things—he asked 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them the first time I saw them, and said they were his own.</p>

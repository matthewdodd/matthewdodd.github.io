            . On the 26th of February, being Saturday Night, I had been at a Publick-House and came from thence between nine and ten o'Clock, (as I always keep good Hours) and between eleven and twelve I locked the Door, and went up to Bed; and between that and the Hour of Six in the Morning this was done. - I am a Lodger, and work in the House; I have worked for Mr Reynolds some Years. - The Door that was broke open is an outward Door upon a Public Stair-Case; there are a great many Tenements in the House, but the Street-Door was not locked. - I did not hear any Thing broke open, for I had drank a Pint of Beer more than ordinary, and might be heavy to sleep; but I am sure I locked the Door before I went to Bed. One of these Pickers is mine, this Shuttle and this Picker is Jeffery Rushton's.</p>

               <p>Rushton. Either the Staple was pushed back, or the Lock was picked, the Staple was half bent, there was nothing broke; just at duskish, I went to Bed, and then I saw the Door was locked, I was sick that Night. - The Prisoner lodged in the same House.</p>

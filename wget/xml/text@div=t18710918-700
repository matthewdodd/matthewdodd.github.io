I am the wife of David Chapman, of 4, Alpha Cottages—I was with Mr. Chapman on this night—we went out to fetch some beer—Mr. Brown asked us to give him a drop, and he was in the act of putting it to his mouth when Pearman and Cox came behind us—Pearman said "There goes a b——Irish lot of false witnesses"—Brown turned round and said "Who do you mean, do you mean me or my wife? If you do, we are not Irish"—Pearman said "The b——lot of you, and the b——Irish w—there," meaning me—I said "Oh, Mr. Brown, do you hear what that mail says to me"—Brown said "Yes, I do"—Pearman said "What did you say?" catching Brown by the collar of his coat—Brown said "Never mind what I say, keep your hands off of me, I don't want to have anything to say to you, nor to do with you; if you don't, I will spend a pound upon you"—Pearman said "I can spend 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon you, and as for that dirty muck there, I could spend more upon her"—I never made any answer—he kept shoving us down the street and abusing us; when we came to the bottom of the street, he collared me by the neck—I screamed, and my screams brought my husband out from Mrs. Chadwick's, without his shoes—Pearman said "Here comes the b——man," and when he came up he faced my husband, and threw him over a heap of dirt, and as soon as he rose on his legs, I saw Mrs. Pearman put her hand in her</p>

The Pearmans have sometimes been very aggravating to me—we have not been on bad terms, for I have not spoken to them till lately—Mr. Pearman has been the worst, he always began it—I did not quarrel with him much, I always shut my door up—I took out a summons against them for abusive language, and he took one out against me afterwards—this occurred a fortnight after that—Mrs. Chadwick and I went out to get a half-gallon of beer for supper—we had only had a pot between five of us, above 9 o'clock—I think they brought that from a beer-shop, but I was not there when it came—Brown was not a friend of mine, I don't suppose I ever spoke half-a-dizen words to him—he asked for a drop of the beer, and we did not refuse, he only met us coming down the street—he had nothing to do with us—I did not come out and spit in Mr. or Mrs. Pearman's face—my husband did not run out and strike Mrs. Pearman on the nose, or knock Mr. Pearman down—I did not see any blood on Pearman's face; the only blood I saw on Pearman was the blood on his clothes, from my husband, where he laid on him—I did not see that he had received a severe injury on his face—I did not go to Mrs. Pearman and pull her hat off—I did not pull her ear; I never touched her ear—I did not pull her back hair down—I caught her by the head, and pulled her off my husband, and shoved her back—I don't know that a piece of an earning was found at the spot—I saw it in the Court, at Wandsworth—I don't know that it belonged to Mrs. Pearman—I did not pull it off—on my dying oath, I never touched it—I swear that I saw her put her hand in the right hand pocket of her frock, take out a knife, and hand it to her husband—I should not know the knife if I saw it—the policeman has told me that he found a knife; I have seen that, I could not say that was the knife—the first stab I saw was when Pearman stabbed my husband towards the breast; I could not say what part of the breast it was—I have seen a girl named Graham up here—I did not see her on this occasion—I did not see her about an hour afterwards and say to her "Will you go up to the Court and say that you saw Mr. Pearman stab Mr. Chapman?"—she did not reply that she would not go up, nor did I say, if she would, I would give her sixpence; I can be on my dying oath that I never spoke to the girl—I did not send her for a doctor, it was an elderly woman, living in Henley Street, that fetched him—I don't know Martha Wills (<hi rend="italic">Wills was called in</hi>) I know that woman by sight, but I never spoke to her—I did not shortly after this occurrence come into the garden with that woman</p>

I was with Mr. Lumsden—heard screams, and we ran down to the bottom of the street—I saw three or four persons engaged in a struggle—I heard a little girl say "They have killed my father"—there was a man on the ground, and a man on the top of him, and two women—one woman was trying to pull the other one off the man who was on the ground—Mrs. Pearman was the woman on the top of man, who I have since discovered was Mr. Chapman—one man was on the top, and, as far as I can remember of it, that man was at the man's head, which was lying towards the lamp-post, and his feet toward the palings—Mrs. Chapman's back was towards the lamp-post—I have since discovered that Pearman was the man at Chapman's head—Mr. Lamsden pulled him off, and I pulled Mrs. Chapman on one side—she was pulling at Mrs. Pearman—Pearman was placed against the fence; and he said "You know me very well"—I said "Yes"—I knew him by sight, and have spoken to him several times—I said "Whatever have you been doing? you have killed this man"—he said "I have not done it; I have been waylaid by take persons"—I</p>

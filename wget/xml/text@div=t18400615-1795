                  </hi>. I am a Manchester warehouseman, and live in Camberwell New-road. The prisoner was my servant for about thirteen months—I missed a sovereign on the 17th of May, and got an officer to search her box in my presence—it was not locked—it was in her bed<lb></lb> room—the articles stated in the indictment were found in her box—these are the articles now produced—these rings had been taken out of Mrs. Hatfield's casket, where the sovereign was lost from—the prisoner was present when her box was searched, and said she had found the rings, and the other articles she meant to return before she left the situation—the officer is ill, and not able to attend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. My mistress asked me to lend her a basket to put these things in; not having one, I offered her the loan of my box; she made no answer; I thought she did not object to it, and I put the articles there with intent to bring them safe when we removed to Camberwell New-road. The reason of my box being searched was, Mrs. Hatfield said she had lost money which she found she had not, and having had no time to unpack after we moved, these things remained there; the smallest of these rings I found in the high road five months ago; I did not know my mistress had lost one; the other ring I found under the drawers in her bed-room; I intended to give it her, but she did not come home till late, and I forgot it; the silver thimble she told me to work with, and take care of it.</p>

About two years ago the roof was fresh tiled and leaded—I have been on the roof, and found the lead cut away—I have exa<lb></lb>mined the lead produced with the lead of the roof—it fits it—I have no doubt of its being the lead.</p>

               <p>of the 1st of July, the two prisoners and another man came to the house, and brought something contained in a basket and a leather apron—it was heavy—about eleven o'clock at night I saw the same basket where they had been sitting—they were gone then—I examined it, and it con<lb></lb>tained this lead—I gave it to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law-stationer, and live in Charles-street, Mid<lb></lb>dlesex-hospital. About the 20th of May last I had a house to let in Mortimer-street, Cavendish-square—the prisoner called on me about eleven o'clock one day, but I do not know when—I should say it was in May—he stated he came from Mr. Shaw, in Mortimer-street, that he heard I had a house to let, and he could find me a very good tenant—I said I had a tenant in treaty for it, but he was an artist, I did not like artists, and if he could produce me an undeniable tenant, I should have no objection to let him let it, and to deal fairly with him if he let the house—here is an agreement for letting the house, signed by me and Mr. Shaw, and attested</p>

               <p>by Thomas Wick, the prisoner—the house was so let by my consent, and this bill (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) was delivered to me shortly subsequent to the 24th of June—I do not know who delivered it, but this is the bill that was left—in July the prisoner called on me one Saturday, and said Mr. Shaw was on the Continent, that he was short of money to pay the men, and he should be obliged if I would pay that account—I said, "Oh no, it was agreed that he was to have 2 1/2 per cent.," and he has charged me 5 per cent., but I said, "If three guineas will meet the case, and you are authorised to sign the receipt, I will pay you"—he said he was—he drew up a receipt for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave it him—I said, "If I hear no more of this when Mr. Shaw returns, I will give you half a guinea for yourself"—this is the receipt be wrote—I have no doubt that I paid him the money on the day this bears date, the 27th of July.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house-agent, and live in Mortimer-street. The prisoner was in my service, and led me on the 6th of July—after that time he had no authority to receive money on my behalf—this bill and his receipt are both his handwriting, one written with a quill pen, and the other with a steel pen—I first became acquainted with his having re<lb></lb>ceived this money, when I applied for it in December, and Mr. Wilson produced this receipt.</p>

Q.</hi> When did he come into your service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In July, 1843—I have had his acceptance in two or three ways when he has had money of me—I have not availed myself of his name for the purposes of my business—I received acceptances of his to the best of my belief not more than twice, but I will not swear that—one was for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was the amount of the settlement—I never had but one besides that—that was not for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was for something odd—he did not owe me that money at that time—he once borrowed 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of me—I did not borrow his name—he seduced me into some speculations that I found were false representa<lb></lb>tions, a perfect take in—I have not desired him to borrow money of his friends—he said he could borrow money to any amount—he never pro<lb></lb>cured me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from his friends, or from any one—he was my confidential clerk, and knew all my affairs—I had a great sum of money due to me—he said he was related to some bill-brokers, and he would take my bill, and could get money to any amount, but they said they would have nothing to do with it, they did not know me, and would not take his ac<lb></lb>ceptance, and the bill was brought back to me—I have not negotiated his acceptance, to my knowledge—I paid that bill away to a respectable house of business in the City, where my name is well known, instead of having another bill, as it was not worth while to throw the stamp away—he was not to be paid by commission from me—he never made any demand of commission till he had obtained money, and then he alleged that I pro<lb></lb>mised to give him a commission on all business that he procured—I was</p>

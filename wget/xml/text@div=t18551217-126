                  </hi>. I am a ropemaker, of Homerton. On 26th Nov., about 3 o'clock, I saw the prisoner riding on a gelding, close to the White Lion at Hackney Wick, going towards Bethnal-green—he had no saddle, only a halter—I am sure he is the man—I knew him by sight, but did not know his name.</p>

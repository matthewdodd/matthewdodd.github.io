            . I am wife of the last witness. The beginning of October being our holiday-time, my mother brought down a quantity of her best spoons; after tea I told the prisoner to be careful and wash them, and bring them up with the tea-things - I thought she brought them all up, but did not count them. A day or two afterwards we missed two common ones - one was engraved, that was my husband's; I could not find it, told the prisoner I had missed them, and asked what she had done with them? she said,</p>
               <p>"I hope you don't think I have taken them" - I said they must be in the house, she immediately ran out of the house. I put on my bonnet, ran out, and overtook her near her own house, which is on Dock-hill - she only chaired for us. I told her it was plain she had taken them, and asked her what she had done with them? She took me to Fleming's, where I found my father's spoon, but not ours.</p>

            . I am a watch-maker and jeweller. On the 4th of October, about nine o'clock in the morning the prisoner came and asked me if I bought old silver, as her mother had some to sell? In the course of the day the brought me an old shilling; next day I bought a spoon of her. On the Thursday following, which was the 7th of October, she brought another; I gave her 1 s. 3 d. for each of them. Mrs. Levi and the prisoner came afterwards, and I shewed her one. I had sent the first off with other old silver. I do not know whether it was engraved with a cypher, it was engraved round the edges.</p>

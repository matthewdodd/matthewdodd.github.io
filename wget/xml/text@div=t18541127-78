On Sunday, 5th Nov., between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in Holywell-lane, Shoreditch—I saw the prisoners, Edney and Mayhew, standing outside the prosecutor's shop window—I have known Edney for two years—I am quite sure he was one of the men—I saw him as plainly as I see you now—it was a bright moonlight morning—I am sure of the three prisoners—I went and stood in a doorway opposite the King John public house—it was a dark place—I could see them very plainly but they could not see me—I saw Prior standing in a court six or eight yards from the prosecutor's shop—I had not known her before—I have no doubt she was the person—she was standing, looking out, at the end of the court, but she could not see me—I then heard some glass break, and I ran towards the men—when I ran towards them, they ran up the court, where Prior was standing—I could not discern whether they had anything with them, as I was running—I followed them into the court, and I heard a door slam just as I entered the court—I did not see where the female went—I ran down the court, and pulled the door—it is a side door—there is no number to it—it is about eight or nine yards down the court, from the lane—I had lost sight of all the prisoners before I heard the door slam—I pulled the door, and it appeared as if there was some one inside holding the door—I could not pull it open—I directly turned back out of the court, and sprang my rattle, and G 20 came to my assistance—we both went to the house, and G 20 went in first—I followed him in, and we found Edney and Mayhew in the same room—Mayhew was standing behind the door, he was dressed—Edney was undressed, and was in bed with a female—I took Mayhew down stairs, and gave him into custody to another officer, who was outside—I went in and searched a little further, and found the prisoner, Prior, on a dust heap, under some steps—she was concealed, and had a shawl covered over her—I took her out, and took her out of the door, along the passage into the lane, and left her with another policeman—I then went up stairs, and the sergeant and I made Edney put his clothes on, and took him down—there was no other man in the same room—there were lodgers, who lodge in the house—we took the three pri<lb></lb>soners to the station at one time—we then went back to the prosecutor's shop; we had seen that the glass was broken, when we went by with the prisoners—we found one of the shutters was slipped down—the glass was broken, and we could see where the boots had been taken out of the window—I could not see how the shutters were, when I first saw the prisoners in front of the shop, because they were before the shutters.</p>

               <p>coming down I saw the last witness go in the yard and take Prior from the dust place—I took Edney to the prosecutor's window, and found the glass had been broken, and there was a space where boots were missing—the prosecutor came up to the window, and when the other prisoners came up he said he had lost four or five pairs of boots, and then he came out again and said he had lost seven pairs.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was returning from the watch-house at a quarter-past three o'clock, and met the prisoner with these tools in his hand; I asked where he got them - he said from his lodging, No. 14, Peter-street; I said I would go there - I went on with him till I found he had passed the door - I then said, "You shall go before the officer of the night;" he threw them down and ran away - I retook him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I unfortunately met with a person familiar to me, who I considered to be a carpenter, he requested me to go to the watch-house with him, as he was giving another man in charge for an assault - having given the man in charge we came out of the watch-house, when he asked if I should have any objection to let him put a few things into my lodgings, as his landlord would put a padlock on his room door in the morning, which I agreed to do; he then told me to wait there while he went to No. 4, or 14, Peter-street; being inebriated I cannot possibly remember which; after waiting a few minutes he returned with the things found upon me, which he strongly desired me to put in my apron or handkerchief, but I, not being conscious of anything wrong, carried them in my open hands - he then told me to walk slowly on, and he would overtake me with some more; a watchman passing at the time inquired where I got them from; I told him from No. 4, or 14, Peter-street, which was the place I was told they came from; having just before been at the watch-house with the same man, and being fearful of being taken up, I attempted to run away; I had not been in the watch-house long before the person I had the things of came and said that there was no charge against me, as the things belonged to him: when the watch-house-keeper thought he ought to be detained likewise, but the nightconstable would not detain him.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Do you remember any person applying at the watch-house? A. Yes - there was a person called and said they were his tools; we sent him away - the Magistrate directed me to look for that man, but I could not find him: the prisoner said he brought the tools from his lodging, and was going to a job - I asked where he lodged - he said No. 14, Peter-street, and as he passed by there I detained him: he had been taken in a row before that, and after he had been in the watch-house this must have been committed.</p>

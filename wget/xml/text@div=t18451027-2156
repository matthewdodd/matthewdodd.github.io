                  </hi>. I was a City police-constable, and lived at the police-tation, Great Tower-street; I live there now. On the night of the 14th of Oct. I was at the Surrey theatre, and left about a quarter after twelve—Esworthy was with me—we left the theatre together, and went to a cigar shop two or three doors from the theatre—we afterwards went into the Bridge-house public-house in our way home, between the theatre and the Queen's bench prison—I went to the bar and saw both the prisoners in front of the bar, not standing together at first—there might be nearly twenty persons in the house altogether—there were two or three women, and the rest men—I afterwards observed the prisoners standing together—the first thing that occurred to me was, I was struck a severe blow on the left cheek by the prisoner Lyons—I had not spoken to either of them—I turned my head round to my left, where Lyons was, and said, "What is that for?"—I thought something might have occurred, and that it was an accidental blow—Esworthy tried to come to my assistance, but was prevented by Hodnott, who struck him a blow which knocked him back towards the corner—I did not see other persons prevent him—I then received another blow from Lyons, which knocked off my hat, and from that a silk hand<lb></lb>kerchief vanished—I was then struck another blow on the breast, and knocked on one side near the tap of the bar—Lyons then turned round, and, with his left hand, snatched my stock and pin—I had a watch in my left pocket, with a silver guard round my neck—I lost that, but do not know who took it—it went at the first blow I was struck—Lyons turned to the left, and escaped by the side door—I followed him as quick at I could out at the side door; but before I could get quite to the door, it was closed against me for about a minute—I got out, saw a constable outside, and gave him information—I saw Lyons running when I got out at the door, but lost sight of him—he was apprehended about twenty minutes or half an hour after—I have not seen my watch or handkerchief since—I have seen my stock and a portion of the pin in the hands of the constable—it was a union pin—the chain is gone from it, except three or four links—I have no doubt whatever of the prisoners being the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, at present out of a situation; I lodge at No. 68, Lower Thames-street. I have known Dolby three years—I was in his company on the evening of the 14th of Oct. at the Surrey theatre—we left at about a quarter past twelve o'clock—we went into a cigar shop, and afterwards into the Bridge-house public-house, Borough-road, in our way home—there were fifteen or twenty persons standing at the bar—a girl spoke to us—I did not treat her—she drank out of the half-and-half which we had—while standing at the bar, Hodnott and one who is not in custody came up to me, and asked if I knew a young man named George, who, the person not in custody told me, was in the detec<lb></lb>tive force, and he went on telling me he would give any money to find him—I asked him what his other name was—he said Townsend, and I told him I did not know the name (he said he himself belonged to the detec<lb></lb>tive force, and was under the Forresters, and said he was stationed round the Bank) I then heard Dolby say, "What is that for?" and I saw him and Lyons scuffling together—as I was going to Dolby's assistance I received a severe blow from Hodnott, and fell down—on getting up Hodnott knocked me down again—I got up, and saw Lyons rush out of the house, and Dolby after him—there was one man at the door, who prevented Dolby going out—others surrounded and struck me—I got up, and put my hands up to my eyes to save them from being blackened, but I had a black eye the next morning—after receiving several severe blows for five or six minutes, I managed to get out of the house, and on going up the street I saw Dolby and the policeman talking together—I afterwards saw Lyons in custody (about one o'clock, or ten minutes after)—Hodnott remained behind—I saw him taken about one o'clock the same morning—I afterwards saw Dolby's pin, without the chain, found on the</p>

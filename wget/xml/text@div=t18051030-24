             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. I am an ostler; I was standing at my master's door, and saw the tree shake; I went and found the prisoner in the tree; there was a bag at the bottom of the tree, which contained pears; this man was in the tree, he had not taken any thing away; I called out, and he was taken.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen, in this case, you must find the prisoner not guilty: a felony may be committed by stealing pears, supposing the man who had separated them from the tree, after having separated them, had gone away with them, or removed them from the place; but this is merely a civil injury, and a subject of action for a trespass; it would have been otherwise if the owner had put them in a basket, and he had stolen them away; or if the man in two distinct acts, first of all separating them from the tree, had put them in a basket, and at another distinct time had come and stole them away, it would then have been a felony; but in this case it is one continued act, in which case it is a trespass, for which he is liable to an action civilly, but not criminally.</p>

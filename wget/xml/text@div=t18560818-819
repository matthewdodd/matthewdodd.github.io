                  </hi>. I was mate of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Tar</hi> fishing smack. On 11th July last we were off the coast of Holland, fishing—there were nine hands on board; the prisoner was one, and Francis Toombs another—there were four men and five apprentices—the captain had left the smack the day previous, to go on board another vessel, to get provisions—in the course of the afternoon, I and the prisoner, and Toombs, went on board a Dutch vessel—we stopped on board some time, and had some Hollands there, and we brought some with us on board our own boat when we returned, which was I think between 6 and 7 o'clock, but I cannot say for an hour or so—I think we brought one bottle of gin on board; I did not know it was in the boat until we got on board our vessel; I did not bring it—I was down in the cabin that night; there was the boy Hamilton, Dunning, Toombs, and myself; Toombs was lying on the settle, Dunning came down afterwards, as nigh as I can say between 12 and 1 o'clock—I think Toombs was awake when Dunning came down—I saw Dunning take a bottle of naphtha which stood in the middle of the hatches, and pour it over Toombs—it was not full—I do not know how much there was in it—he came down into the cabin, took up the bottle, and sprinkled it over Toombs—I do not recollect his saying anything before he did it—in about two or three minutes Toombs was on fire—Dunning was then down in the cabin—when Toombs was on fire we went out of the cabin—I was the last one down in the cabin, and I got burnt—Dunning was close to Toombs when I first saw that he was on fire—I did not see how it was that he got on fire; after he was on fire, he got up, flew to me, and laid hold of me while he was in flames; that was how I got my arm burnt—I shoved him away—he went out of the cabin on deck, and I believe the apprentice threw buckets of water over him, but I did not see that—I saw him afterwards on deck he was very much burnt</p>

               <p>—he was sent home to Barking next day in a fishing smack—I came home the next day, and saw him several times after, at his own house before his death—we had all been drinking a good deal that day—Toombs was drunk, and Dunning also, I think he was the worst of the two—I was almost as bad—the eldest apprentice was sober—the youngest apprentice had had a little, I do not think he was drunk—he was in the cabin alongside of me—there had been no quarrelling that day between any of us, we were the same as brothers, the whole three of us.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an apprentice on board the <hi rend="italic">Royal Tar.</hi> I went with the eldest apprentice to fetch the men from the Dutch boat—I was not one of the first party—I do not know what time it was when they left the smack; it was after dinner—they came back with me, and the eldest apprentice—they were all tipsy—they brought three bottles of liquor on board with them—they had had some gin before they went on board the Dutchman—they did not drink anything after they returned, they went down into the cabin—I was in the same cabin—I was there when Toombs was burnt—I was neither awake nor asleep; I was half asleep and half awake—I was roused up by a light, and then saw that Toombs was on fire—Dun<lb></lb>ning was the nearest person to him at that time—Charles Turner was in the cabin, and a youth named George Carlisle was asleep in the bed cabin—he did not wake up during the whole of it—William Whittick was also asleep in the stern—the only persons there awake were myself, Dunning, Toombs, and Turner—Toombs laid still on the settle after he was on fire—I went out and called the eldest apprentice—he came down, but he was no sooner down than he woke the man up, and was out again—Toombs then came on deck, ran along the lee scupper, and fell down against the fore hawse—the eldest apprentice took two buckets of water and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> over him, and the fire was put out—Dunning was sitting on the hatches when I saw Toombs on fire—he remained in the cabin—I did not see any light there in anybody's hands—by "the hatches," I mean the cabin floor—there was a light in the sconce in the fore part of the cabin—that was an oil lamp, it had no glass round it—it was in a socket; not hung up—it was not above two or three feet from Toombs—I could stand under the lamp—my head used to touch it when I did—a bottle of naphtha was kept in a corner there, and was used for the signal lights—there had been no quarrelling at all that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the eldest apprentice on board the <hi rend="italic">Royal Tar</hi> fishing smack. I recollect some of the men going on board the Dutchman on the afternoon in question—I went with the other lad to fetch them off, that was between 11 and 12 o'clock—they brought three bottles of hollands</p>

               <p>back with them—I do not know that they drank after they returned—I remained on deck and they went down into the cabin—I was sober—about half an hour after they returned, Hamilton came up and called me down into the cabin—I went down and saw Toombs lying on the settle on fire, and Dunning lying on the hatches in the corner with his head almost against Toombs—Turner was sitting on the settle—I do not know whether they were awake or asleep, they did not seem to move or stir until I went and moved Toombs—I roused him and they all three got to the cabin door and Turner's arm got burnt—they did not seem to be aware of what was going on—Toombs came up on deck on fire—he got as far as the fore hawse and then fell, and I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> two buckets of water over him and put the fire out—he was so black, I could not see his wounds—he was sent home on the Saturday morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I was the master of this fishing smack. When I returned on board, I found Toombs in the bed cabin undressed and very much injured—Dunning came to fetch me from the other vessel—he said, it was a bad job, that they had been skylarking, that they had been playing with the turps and Toombs had been burnt—the naphtha was called turps on board.</p>

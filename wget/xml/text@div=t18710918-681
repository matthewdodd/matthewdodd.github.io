I am head housemaid at Earl Manfield's, Caen Wood, Hampstead—on Monday, 21st August, I missed some articles from the breakfast-room—this silver inkstand has Lord Mansfield's crest on it—I placed it on the table on the morning of the 19th—it then had glasses with silver tips—these glasses are not the same.</p>

I would have lent it to him—I had no idea whatever that he was going to pay 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the inkstand—I should not mind lending him 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as well as 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I have known him so long, and never saw anything wrong in him.</p>

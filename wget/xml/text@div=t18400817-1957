                  </hi>. I am the wife of Japheth Frederick Noah, a tobacconist, of No. 8, Upper St. Martin's-lane. On Wednesday morning, the 4th of August, the prisoner came into the shop about eleven o'clock, and asked for half-an-ounce of tobacco, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and laid me down a coun<lb></lb>terfeit shilling—I discovered it to be bad, and told him so—he left the shop—about half-past one o'clock he came again, asked for half-an-ounce of to<lb></lb>bacco, which came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I served him—he gave me a half-crown—I no<lb></lb>ticed it was good, and was very much worn down—I noticed two marks on the side—I gave him a shilling, two sixpences, and four penny pieces—I laid it down on the counter—he took it up, and then said, "I want the 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. tobacco"—I said, "I have not got any"—he said, "I must have, it, or return me my money"—I gave him the half-crown back, he laid down the change, and I noticed there was a counterfeit shilling among it as he was going out of the door—I called to him, "You villain, you have given me a bad shilling in the change"—he took no notice, but ran away—I pur<lb></lb>sued him—I am quite certain it was not the shilling I gave him, as I had but one shilling in my pocket, which I took out with the two sixpences out of the drawer—I noticed the shilling I gave him had a lion and a crown on it—when I got outside he was walking very quick, and looked over his, shoulder—he saw me, and took to his heels—I ran as hard as I could, and called "Stop thief"—he ran into Lascelles-court—I saw a policeman there, and informed him—I took the change that was on the counter in my hand, marked it, and gave it to the policeman—I saw the prisoner in cus<lb></lb>tody that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in Earl-street, Seven Dials, about half-past one o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner running at the head of a mob—I ran after him into Lascelles-court, and in consequence of what I heard, went to a house in Salutation-court, which leads out of that court, and found the prisoner in a loft at the top of a house—I told him he was the man I wanted—he said nothing, but put half-a-crown into his mouth, which I took out, and produce—I searched him at the station-house, and found nothing—I afterwards saw Mrs. Noah at the station-house—she gave me a counterfeit shilling, which I produce—she identified the half-crown, as being very much worn, and having two marks at the side, before she saw it.</p>

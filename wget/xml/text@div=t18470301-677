                  </hi>. The prisoner was my shopman. I gave him in charge on Wednesday, the 3rd of Feb., on suspicion of stealing other money—I had missed money previously—the shilling produced I can swear to, by a mark on the edge—I marked it on the edge on the 26th of Jan.—I put it into a bag, and put the bag into my desk—there was other marked money in the bag—I</p>

               <p>put it into the bag after marking it—I put the money into the till from the bag—in about ten minutes afterwards I missed this and two ther marked shil<lb></lb>ling also—on marking the money I took a memorandum of the dates and reigns of the shillings, and this shilling corresponds with one lost on the 26th of Jan.</p>

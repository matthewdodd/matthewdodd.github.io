            . I went into Mrs. Yorke's shop on Saturday afternoon between four and five o'clock; the two prisoners were in Mrs. Yorke's shop; the tallest of the two prisoners took a ball of blue ribbon out of the first drawer that shopwoman shewed her, she said there was none in that drawer that would not; the shopwoman shewed her another drawer of ribbons; and she took out another ball of ribbons; I asked the shopwoman if she had another person that could serve; she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180901110005"></xptr>directed me to go to the parlour; I went to the parlour and called Mrs. Yorke.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see either of the prisoners take the ribbons - A. I saw Ann Green take two balls, one out of the first drawer and the other out of the second drawer. She concealed them under her great coat; a gentleman in the house stopped them; he picked up the balls of ribbon.</p>
               <p>MR. WHEATLEY. I was at Mrs. Yorke's in the parlour; she said there were two women in the shop that she suspected of taking something; I came out and charged Ann Green with having taken something; she endeavoured to give it to the other; I endeavoured to take it from her, she dropped it on the floor. I picked it up and gave it to the officer when he came.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure you saw Ann Green drop it - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am shopwoman to Mrs. Yorke. On Saturday last, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the two prisoners came in the shop together; they asked to look at some ribbons.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them asked - A I do not know which, they both spoke together; I shewed them a drawer of ribbons; I suspected the motion of Ann Green's hands, I did not see them take any thing; they both put their hands in the drawer and took the ribbons to look at them together; I called Mrs. Yorke; Ann Green was charged with having the ribbon; I had spoke to the witness Fisher; she said she had seen her take it. When I charged Green with having the ribbon, she let it drop.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Green's Defence. I met with this young woman, I asked her where she was going, she said she was going to buy two yards of ribbon for her head; we saw some ribbon in the window, we went in the shop and asked what the price of it was: the shopwoman said she had some in the drawer that came to eight pence; she took two pieces of ribbon to take two yards off; it rolled off the counter; the gentleman came round and said I dropped it.</p>
               <p>Cox's Defence. I went into the shop to buy a couple of yards of ribbon with this young woman; the gentleman came round and said this young woman had some ribbon; he turned round and knocked the ribbon down with his elbow; I never put my hand in the box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter, and live at Mortlake. About nine o'clock on Sunday evening, the 16th of Nov., I gave the prisoner two rings and a gold pin to put into the top drawer of the bureau for safety—she was in my house to take care of my family—I have missed the articles since—the pawnbroker has them—these are them—I never saw them after I gave them to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 26, Whitecross-place, Finsbury—on 30th December I went to Poplar—I took a return-ticket—I can't say what time it was when I returned—I missed the last train, and walked up—the prisoners overtook me near Bishopsgate-street—I believe they first passed me—they said it was a cold night, and then Rogers commenced crying, and saying that her husband had been fourteen days in the water, and could not be discovered; that she was very cold, and if she could, get anything to partake of, it would so relieve her—I said if she could tell me where to get anything I would pay for a cup of tea or coffee—they showed me a coffee-house, and I paid for some tea for them—I paid for it out of some money in my purse—I had from eight to twelve shillings—I also had the half of my railway-ticket in the purse—the prisoners might possibly see that I had a purse—Wilson sat opposite me when I paid for the tea—when we got out of the coffee-house, I had scarcely shut the door when Rogers blinded me with her two hands—she gave me a very severe blow, so that I was quite blinded, and then I felt some one's hands in my pocket—I called for assistance, and I was struck violently on the side of the head, and by that time the police arrived—when I went to move, my purse laid empty at my feet—I picked it up; it was empty; it did not contain either the money or the railway-ticket—I gave the prisoners into custody—there were several men about at the time, but I did not take much notice of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Rogers. Q.</hi> Was it not twenty minutes past 1 when this happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I really don't know the hour—the train I had intended to catch was the half-past 10 train; I was too late for that, and I had to walk all the way to London.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Wilson. Q.</hi> Did not you meet us in Houndsditch, and ask if we would have anything to drink? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; one of you asked me—when I pulled out sixpence to pay for the tea, I did not pull out the railway-ticket, and tell you how I had been delayed, and missed the train—I did not leave it on the table, nor did you take it up and say it was no good to me, it would do for you to show as an excuse for being out so late—I was not in liquor—after leaving the coffee-shop I did not walk to the corner of Petticoat-lane and have a lot of Jew boys about me—I was struck the instant the coffee-house door was shut—I did not walk some distance before I called the police—I never moved after it occurred—the policeman came on the spot.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a searcher of female prisoners at Bishopsgate-street Station—the prisoners were brought there on 30th December—I searched them, and found in Wilson's pocket a shilling and threepence, and this ticket—I said to her, "What does this mean?"—she said, "Oh! it is merely a ticket I have been to the play with;" and she tore it out of my</p>

               <p>hand, and tore it in two pieces—I picked the pieces up—I found a key on Rogers—she asked me if I had found the ticket on the other—I said, "It appears so"—she said, "Oh! it is nothing—it is only what she went to the play with the night before"—it is part of a return-ticket from Poplar.</p>

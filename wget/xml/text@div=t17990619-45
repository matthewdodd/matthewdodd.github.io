             sworn. - I am a publican, and, in consequence of directions from Mr. Rogers, I went to the house of the prisoner at the bar, on the 4th of May, and found him there; I asked him if he would go and take a glass with me; he told me he had no stockings on, that his washerwoman had not brought them, and it was not convenient to go; I then asked him if he would let me have a few pieces; he told me he had none by him, but if I would come the next day, he would procure me some, which was on Sunday, and said, that as I had got into the public line, I might pass a great quantity, enough to pay my rent; I made answer, I must pass a great quantity indeed if I did, for my house was 50l. a year rent, besides taxes; he asked me what sort of pieces I would have; I told him, shillings; he asked me how many; I told him, half-a-guinea's worth; I had no conversation with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190043"></xptr>him about the half-guinea till I bought it, which was on the 16th of May. On the 15th I received a letter from Mr. Rogers; there was a warrant issued against the prisoner, and, on the 16th, I went to see if he was at home; I was going past the Gun and Star, in Petticoat-lane, when he came out and called after me; I went up to the Gun and Star with him, and he went backwards into the yard; we had some conversation respecting the country: he told me he had been down with some goods, and if he had not taken a few queer half beans and a few whites, he should not have had money to have brought him home: he shewed me a pair of shoes he had upon his feet, which appeared to be new, and those shoes, he said, he had passed a queer half bean for as he came from Gravesend; that he had passed one other queer half bean beside that for shoes when he was in the country, and had but one left, if I would take it, I should have it for three shillings; I gave him three good shillings for it; I have got the queer half bean; I went immediately to Shadwell, to let the officers know that Solomons was at home. I sent from the George, just by the church, for Rogers, and told him what passed, and shewed him the half-guinea; then we went to Elby and Riley, at Whitechapel, at a public-house near Red-lion-street; I went down to Solomon's house, he was gone out; I went down present when he was apprehended; the Gun and Star is within twenty yards nearly opposite Solomon's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know whether the Gun and Star happens to be in the City of London, or County of Middlesex? - A. I am informed it is in the City of London.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you had the conversation with Solomons, there was a warrant against him? - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he acquainted of it? - A. I don't know that he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there to induce him to sell the pieces, which you charged him afterwards with having sold the half-guinea? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. By which he would be prosecuted? - A. Yes, I hoped so, because I should be a sufferer.</p>
               <p>Q. You went merely for the public good? - A. And my own good too; I went by order of Rogers the first time; I never was promised to be paid any thing; I meant to ask his Lordship for my expences; I did not know whether I was to be paid by the Mint or the Court; there is no doubt but I expected to be paid for my time.</p>
               <p>Q. These gentlemen do not know you quite so well as I do; I think you were examined here yesterday, and the prisoner was acquitted on your evidence? - A. He was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in this line of an informer, for the public good? - A. I never was an informer before, I have given evidence in Court.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what occasion? - A. Naval stores, and other things, and stealing sugar from the lighters.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been a Trinity-officer? - A. No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. That is not what I ask-Are you not dismissed from being a Trinity-officer? - A. I was what they call set aside for a while.</p>
               <p>Q. I will help you to your own term, suspended? - A. There were a good many at the same time; I never asked for my situation again.</p>
               <p>Q. What line are you in now? - A. I keep a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Besides being employed by the Mint? - A. I am not employed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your house? - A. The corner of Warwick-street, Golden-square; I have been in it eleven weeks to-day, in the parish of St. James; I kept a public house, the Durham-arms, Hackney-road, and was there seven or eight months; before that I was working in the India-house, as a labourer; I have belonged there nine years.</p>
               <p>Q.Then you are a publican, and labourer in the India-house? - A. Yes, when I like to go.</p>
               <p>Q. And give informations? - A. I never gave them information.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you keep a public-house, and are a labourer in the East-India warehouses? - A. I have sworn it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to stick by it? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard that the India Company never employ publicans? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to swear that? - Yes; I mean to swear that there are a great many keep public-houses as well as myself in the India-house; I knew the prisoner before this for three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Rogers sent you? - A. Yes; he asked me to go, and said, he did a good deal of business, and asked me whether I could get any of them; I said, I would try; I don't know that the prisoner knew there was a warrant against him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about selling a bell that was in the Public-office, and whose it was? - A. One morning, about three o'clock, I brought some things there, and they let it fall on my foot; I advertised the bell, and it was not owned; the bell laid in the office a considerable time, and Mr. Staples says, Hill, what are you going to do with this bell; I said, I would get some person to buy it; I said, I could get a guinea and a half for it; he said, I am satisfied if you get a guinea and a half; I cannot tell just now how much I sold it for, I believe it was upwards of three pounds; I did not put it all in my own pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190044"></xptr>Q. Who did you divide it with? - A. I gave part at the office, to the treasurer, Mr. Skeene, the man who takes the money for all warrants, he put it in the book; I knew Mr. Kirk, I sold him the bell for three pounds and up wards, I cannot say how much above, it is a good while ago; it might be three pounds five shillings, eight, or ten; I swear to the best of my recollection it was not more; it may be a year and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate? - A. No, I did not, or any body at that time; I told them when I paid the money; I know I paid the Magistrate half the money I had for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell them the truth, that you sold it for three pound eight, or three pound ten? - A. I don't know that I told them; I did not know I should be asked such a question.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell them you sold it for a guinea and a half? - A. The Magistrate sent for me, and said, you have sold the bell, for a couple of officers have been down to know; I gave half the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after? - A. I believe next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you tell them you had sold it only for a guinea and a half, though you had sold it for three pounds fifteen shillings? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not say so? - A. I don't recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you actually sell it to Mr. Kirk for three pounds eight shillings, or thereabouts? - A. I sold it for thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, to some person in the office, you sold it for a guinea and a half? - A. I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Staples send for you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not ask you to swear to the fact, that you had sold it for a guinea and a half? - A. He never asked me about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you offer to swear it? - A. I never did, or ever said I would.</p>
               <p>EDWARD ROGERS sworn. - I am one of the Police-officers at Shadwell: I applied to the witness, Hill, to use his endeavours to get one of the false coin, and the Magistrates were informed of it; I proposed it to him, and in consequence of what he told me, I apprehended Solomons on the 17th of May last, at the Gun and Star, in Petticoat-lane, which I believe to be in the city; I am sure of it, because the landlord told me so, and shewed me his licence; he was in the passage with three or four other men, and I desired him to come back into the back parlour; he went with me, I closed the door, and told him I had a warrant against him for felony.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you tell him what fort of felony? - A. No; he instantly put his hand into his left-hand waistcoat-pocket and pulled out this paper, and dropped it at his feet, containing four counterfeit shillings, which I picked up, and put in my pocket; I told him he should go with me before the Lord-Mayor, as I was in the city; he said, he would rather go to Shadwell-office; when I was taking him out, a City officer came and told me I had no right in the City; he was taken before the Lord-Mayor, who sent him down to Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he dropped the shillings were they in a state to pass? - A. Yes; and unless a person was a very good judge, they would take them; I have kept them in my pocket which has rubbed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. After you, and the last witness, were examined yesterday, the Jury acquitted the prisoner? - A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us all you recollect about it? - A. I don't recollect any thing farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it occur to you to make any search of the prisoner? - A. The other officer, Mr. Elby, searched him, he found six shillings and sixpence, and a half-guinea, which I returned back.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that Riley was present, and searched him? - A. No, he was not; Elby made the search in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect stating, yesterday, that no body was present? - A. I stated that when I went first into the room nobody was present; Riley followed me in; I called to him to go over and apprehend Barnett's wife; and I desired Elby, as soon as he came in, to search him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state that? - A. I left it to Elby to state it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. There was nothing found except the four had shillings-were they mixed with the good ones, or separate? - A. No; he put his hand into his pocket and pulled the paper out, and the pocket turned inside out, it was not in the same pocket; they were kept separate from the other.</p>
               <p>Q. The bad money he attempted to get rid of, but not the good? - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>(Mr. William Parker proved the pieces to be counterfeit).</p>
               <p>(James Parrott proved the Gun and Star to be in the City of London).</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am totally innocent, I never saw the man before; on the 17th they apprehended me, they all came together, and never was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember buying a bell of Hill? - A. Yes; I believe it is a year and a half ago, it was a good sizeable bell; I am a ship-chandler, and I believe I paid him three pounds odd for it, I am sure it was three pounds; I know no more.</p>
               <p>EDWARD CUMBER sworn. - A. I am office-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179906190045"></xptr>keeper at Shadwell: I remember a bell being sold by Hill to Kirk; I am not positive whether it was sold by the order or consent of the Magistrates; he did not say what he sold it for at that time, I was sent by Mr. Staples to know what he had done with the bell; I went to Hill's house, and he came up, it was the next day, or day but one; I think he said he sold it for thirty shillings; he said it was to a captain of a ship, and I went along with him; I did not observe Mr. Staples make use of any expression; I went with Hill to King James's Stairs, and he told me he had sold it to a captain of a ship, but I could not find out the captain, he did not say any thing about the price; I returned to the office, and went from the office down to Mr. Kirk's; Hill was not by then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that thirty shillings was the price? - A. I understood as such; I don't remember any thing taking place between Mr. Staples and Hill about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mr. Staples putting any question to Hill relative to what he could swear to be the sum? - A. There was something of the kind, but I cannot say; I was just coming out of the parlour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. You don't know what passed? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you think he said he sold it for thirty shillings? - A. I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you have all been guilty of the crime of purchasing bad money for the purpose of bringing people to justice? - A. I certainly have, and I thought it my duty so to do; I did last Sessions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you know the reason of Hill's being dismissed from the Trinity-house? - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>JAMES-CHARLES SANSUM sworn. - I was present at the apprehension of the prisoner: I saw some searching, but they might search him when I was not there; I saw no bad money, but I saw some good, I believe there were sixteen or seventeen shillings; I went into the room immediately after them; I don't pretend to have seen all that passed.</p>

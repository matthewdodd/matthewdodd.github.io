            . On the 31st of October, about two in the night, I was coming out of my Lord Vane's house, which is in Argyll-buildings. I met a watchman in <placeName id="t17691206-20-crimeloc121">Argyll-street</placeName>

            's house. I saw the last man come out. I ran up to the door, and found it open; that last man was the prisoner. I pursued and called, Stop thief! We pursued into Carnaby-street. The watchman in that street hearing me call, he met us. The prisoner fell down, and I fell upon him. The watchman laid hold of him on one side, and I the other. We got him up, and on conducting him back to the end of Argyll-street, turning round into the street, he pulled out something from his pocket and threw it away, and dropped something on the stones which jingled, then he drew out a clasp-knife, (producing a sharp-pointed clasp-knife about ten or eleven inches long) and opened it; this is it. I saw him make a stab at me. I clasped my hand against my side, and received the point in my arm. I cried out, Watchman, knock him down, I am stabbed. The prisoner kept playing away at me, stabbing at me with his knife. I received one cut in my right finger, and a cut across my coat at my left hip, and several cuts in my hat. In one cut the knife went through my hat and cut a slant cut on the left side my head, which made the blood run to my ear. I received a small scratch with the end of the knife on my forehead on my right temple. (he showed the marks of the cuts in his flesh and on his cloaths) I called to him several times to drop his knife. He said, he would not. The watchman hit him several blows, and at last knocked him down; he still said he would not drop his knife. Then we got him up, and he said he would go wherever we pleased. We carried him to Mrs. Winford's house, and sent to Mr. Spinnage's. The clerk came down and searched the prisoner. He found a bag upon him and a bunch of matches. After that he was carried to the watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the house you came out of to Mrs. Winford's house?</p>
               <p>Gascoyne. There are but about four or five feet between our doors. Her house was locked up for a season while she went out of town. There was no body in the house when we took the prisoner; he had no shoes on. We went into Mrs. Winford's house. We could see by marks of their making water against the wainscot,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176912060016"></xptr> and their nastiness, that there had been three of them in the house.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was going round as usual with my lanthorn: Coming past this door, I stopped to speak to the gentleman four or five minutes. In the mean time, three men came out of Mrs. Winford's house. I said, here are three men come out of this house. Said he, they must be thieves. We found the door was open. He pursued. Before he got the prisoner up, I was up at him. The prisoner began stabbing, and he stabbed me through my watch-coat in two places. (he shewed the cuts) We carried him back to the house. After which, I was left in charge of the house, while they took him to the Round-house till the morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Carnaby-Street. Upon hearing the cry of, Stop thief, I directly made that way, when I met the prisoner, and was going to strike at him; but he immediately dropped down; and the other running so fast after him, he tumbled upon him, and in carrying him back, he pulled out some things, and dropped them down. I imagine it was these two keys (producing two small stocklock keys) which were found in the same spot afterwards. He after that pulled out a clasp-knife, opened it, and fell to stabbing away as fast as he could. Mr. Gascoyne cried out he was stabbed. They were so close together, I could not knock him down, without hurting one of the others. He turned his hand back, with intent to stick the knife into my throat; then I knocked him down immediately. We secured him, and took him to Mrs. Winford's house, where we further secured him.</p>

            . About two that morning, I heard a prodigious knocking at Mr. Spinnage's door, I am clerk there. I got up. There was Mr. Gascoyne there and a watchman. They told me a house had been broke open. I went with them to Mrs. Winford's house. I asked him how he came there; he said, he did not know. He said the watchman had knocked him down, and robbed him of his shoes. I examined his pocket, and found this bag, a bunch of matches, and a cord in his pocket. (Produced in Court.) We tied his hands with the cord, and took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Marlborough street, and as I was coming up the street I heard the call of, Stop thief. Before I got to the place the prisoner was taken, and they were carrying him back to Mrs. Winford's house. I thought there were enough to take care of him. I stopped at the end of Marlborough street. He made a scuffle to get away, but I came up and laid hold of the back of the collar of his coat. Mr. Gascoyne said he was cut all to pieces. We took him to the house, and from thence to the watch-house, and coming up to Marlborough-street again, I found a pair of shoes upon a bench belonging to a cheesemonger; there were buckles in them.</p>

            . The keys of Mrs. Winford's house were left at Mr. Higden's house by her. There came an order from her to send some furniture from that house down to her. I went into the house for it; when I came out I locked the door, and put my hand to it, and know it was fast. This was some few days before the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Mr. Higden. When Mrs. Winford went out she left the key of her door with me; and, by virtue of a letter which she sent the 12th of September, wherein she desired I would let this last witness go and fetch the things she ordered: she went, and brought the key again in about two hours after; and it has never been out of my custody since.</p>

               <p>I am a poor man, and deal in old cloaths; I did work in gardens. I happened to get up to Hyde-Park-Corner, and got in liquor, and then was making the best of my way home. What these gentlemen here swear to, I know no more of than the child unborn. They took my shoes off; I asked for them when I was in the watch-house; they brought me a pair of shoes, not mine: mine had a pair of silver buckles in them; they would have persuaded me they were mine. They searched me, and took a bag from me and a bunch of matches; which latter I had from a woman who was selling a paper of something in regard to Wilkes, but, instead of that, sold the matches, and gave the paper in, and I gave her a halfpenny. How I came to put the matches in my pocket I know not. When I came to ask for my shoes they used me worse and worse.</p>

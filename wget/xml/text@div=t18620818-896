                  </hi>. I lodge at the White Swan public-house, in Bream's-buildings, Chancery-lane—on Monday, 18th August, about 6 in the after<lb></lb>noon, I went into the yard at the back of Swan-court, and as I stood there talking with Mrs. Smithies, in the yard of No. 2, Mrs. Chappel came out of one of her tenant's houses and said to me, "Come into this yard, and I will double you up"—I said, "You can't hurt"—she again said, "Come in the yard, and I will double you up, and rip your b—y guts out"—I replied, "Mrs. Chappel, I have too much love to offer to lift a hand against a woman; it may be if you were a man and struck me, I might turn in my own defence"—a few minutes afterwards, a man named Sullivan came out of one of Mrs. Chappel's tenant's house, and offered to fight me—I said, "My good friend, I will have nothing to do with you; I am no fighter; I never did fight in my life"—as soon as that had passed, he and the prisoner rushed into the yard—I was standing with my hands in my pocket, and a short pipe, and Sullivan came up and struck me on the breast—as soon as he struck me, the prisoner came and caught me by my beard—Sullivan then tried to get hold of my hands to fling me back—they dragged me down into the passage of No. 5, Swan-court, and then the prisoner called out for a pair of scissors and said, "Let's murder the b—y b—r"—Sullivan had hold of my neck-tie behind—I was standing then, and the</p>

                  </hi>. I was assistant house-surgeon at King's College Hospital when Leak was brought there on the 18th, between 6 and 7 o'clock—I examined him and found a slight punctured wound on the right eye-brow—I washed it and found there was a very small opening—the upper eyelid was much swollen—had it been half an inch lower it might have caused very severe injury.</p>

I was on the step of my house, when a message was brought to me, that Leak was at the back doing a great deal of damage. I went to the back and he made his way into my yard; I then asked him how he came to commit the depredations he had on my premises; he told me that he came thinking my b—y husband would come out to fight him; I told him Mr. Chappel was not at home, and I wished for no quarrelling; he then said, "Bring any other man;" Mr. Sullivan then came round and said, "Why do you want to quarrel with her?" Leak then said, "Will you fight me?" Sullivan said, "Yes;" and they took</p>

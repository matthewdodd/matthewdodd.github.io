                  </hi>. I am a cooper of 41, Wellington-street, Bethnal<lb></lb>green—On Saturday night, 2d June, I was at the Bricklayers Arms in Gloucester-street, Commercial-road, Whitechapel—just before 12 o'clock, before they closed the house, I came down stairs from the club room—I saw Breden standing in front of the bar—his brother came down after I had been down there, and Samuel Hilder—the prisoner came from the tap-room, or from the back of the house somewhere—he and Breden, the deceased, talked together—they were having a few words together—I could not understand the purport of the words—it appeared as if they were quarelling, and I heard the prisoner say, "I will not fight you now you are drunk, but when you are sober"—I did not hear the deceased say anything about hitting—I heard him say "Very well, I will fight when I am sober"—I saw them go outside the house—we all went out at one time, as the house was closed—after they got outside they had a few more words—they seemed to be wrangliug outside again, and Rawlins the constable came up and said to the deceased, "Serve you right if he hit you"—the deceased said, "Hit away"—a very short time after that McGrath struck him in the mouth, and the man fell down on his back on the pavement—his head struck the pavement—I and Mr. Hilder picked him up, and called the assistance of his brother to lend a hand to help him up—I felt to Bee what sort of injury he had received from the fall, and I felt a lump about the size of a Spanish nut—I called to the witness to come and examine it, and he felt the same as I did—the deceased never spoke but once or twice after that; all he said was "Oh, my head"—he did not speak while he was on the ground, it waswhen we had walked with him some distance; when we got as far as the back of the London Hospital—we took him there with the assistance of Mr. Hilder, and left him with his brother to take him home.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Stepney-green—I attended the deceased on Sunday morning, 3d June, at his own house—he died about a quarter to 9 at night; the cause of death was a fracture at the back of the skull—that would be caused by a fall.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe you did not make a post-mortem exami<lb></lb>nation of any of the organs except the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; because I found sufficient cause of death there—I found that the skull had actually been fractured and there was effusion of blood on the brain—it is possible although a man may receive an injury that would prove fatal, he might happen to die from some other cause—I found quite sufficient cause of death—it very seldom happens that a person recovers from a severe fracture of the skull—I have heard that the deceased was a person of intemperate habits—such persons frequently have a diseased state of the vessels of the heart.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would a blow of that kind prevent a person speaking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Before the effusion came on they might speak; he was perfectly insensible while I saw him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this a simple or a compound fracture? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A simple fracture—it was not a communated fracture; it simply divided the bone—it would be popularly described as a mere crack—I found the effusion under the parietal bone on the dura mater, between the cranium and the dura mater—I am not a fellow of the College of Surgeons, I am a member of the Apothecary's Company, and a doctor of medicine of the University of Giessen.</p>

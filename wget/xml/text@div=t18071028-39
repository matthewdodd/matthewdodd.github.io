The last thing that we do is to take the account of the paid letters, and to sign the account, which is the last thing we do; that makes me to say it was done, and they were made up in the usual manner on the 5th of August, and dispatched to the post office. I sealed it and delivered it to the messenger that comes from the post office.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the habit of taking out all the letters from the box and putting them in with your own hands. A. No, I have assistance to do that.</p>

We received ninety-three pound in various notes; these notes were paid with others, to the amount of three thousand, in the bank of England.

             the sum of six pound, due on Michaelmas day.</p>
               <p>Q. It does not state the day on the receipt - this was paid how long before Mr. Parkin came. - A. I really do not recollect how long.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of Mr. Palmer paying you before the time came. - A. I do not know his reasons, but I believe he was going to move.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you demand payment of the money. - A. No, he sent word by my wife that he would wish to pay it; I carried up the receipt and received the money on the day stated in my book.</p>
               <p>MR. PARKIN. - Mr. Garrow. We all know you are the solicitor of the Post-office, when was the day you went to this house in Tooke's-court. - A. Saturday the 5th of Sepetmber; that was the first day I went to Mr. Paris's house. I either saw this receipt on that day, or a few days after. I went there on several occasions.</p>

            . Q. You are a police officer. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go on the 5th of September to the prisoner's lodgings at Paris's house. - A. Yes; I found there a piece of fine black cloth, a piece of worsted cord, and another kerseymere for breeches, and three pieces of quilting for waistcoats; I saw this or similar. I did not take them at that time. I afterwards took them away from his brother at a grocer's in Holborn, on the 15th. They have been in my possession ever since. I believe them to be the same I saw in his lodgings; the size, quality, and the colour are the same.</p>
               <p>- PALMER. Q. Those things that Anthony took away from you, whom did you receive then things from. - A. From my brother.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Coleman). Look at these articles, are any of these the goods that were purchased by the prisoner and ordered to Paris's. - A. The black superfine cloth, the white quilting, appear to be the same.</p>

            . Q. You produce the bill of exchange that is drawn upon your house. - A. At the time it was drawn, it was drawn at our house; we have dissolved partnership.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took that up. - A. I cannot say whether I took it up myself or my servant. I had a check of ninety six pound odd.</p>
               <p>Q Did you go to Messrs. Newnham yourself. - A. I did not go myself, I sent my servant or a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send the means for paying with it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said before, you took that money in your shop. - A. I took money from my brother in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was either the money took in the shop or money that you received from other means. - A. Yes I might take every farthing in the trade I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at any of these articles and tell me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180710280038"></xptr>whether you know any of them. - A. These printed quiltings are the patterns that I sold to the prisoner. I believe them to be the pieces, they correspond in pattern and size; the cord I cannot say. The first time he came to my shop he purchased a piece of drab woollen cord, that corresponds in size. but there are various colours in drab.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Now Mr. Wells, for the purpose of taking up that ninety six pound check, you sent your servant or friend. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether that friend paid in the identical money you do not know, you did not go with him. - A. I did not go with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Parkin. When you went on the 5th of September to the prisoner's lodgings at Paris's, did you see a man of the name of Inman. - A. I saw a man whose name I did not know; I saw the same man a few days afterwards he said his name was Inman, he said I had seen him there on the 5th of September; I asked him whether his name was Inman, he said yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You questioned the prisoner on the 5th of September. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that the prisoner remained at large from the 5th to the 12th. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He did not avail himself of the means of absconding. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 10th he was sent for by an officer, and there he was, he attended. - A. Yes.</p>

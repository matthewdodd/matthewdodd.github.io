            . The prisoner lodged with me - she came on the 10th of June, and on the 15th I went out at two o'clock in the afternoon; I left her and my daughter Charlotte Reed, in the one pair back room: the prisoner was to wait for me to go with her. I returned about ten minutes before three o'clock, and missed her, and the articles stated in the indictment. I afterwards went to Knightsbridge, but did not see her till the 17th of July, when I met her in the Park, and asked her to give me my things, and I would not hurt her; she said she did not know what I meant. I then asked her to walk with me to Piccadilly; she made some objections, and then ran away - I overtook her, and she walked with me a little way; I took her to the Curd and Whey house, and waited for an officer. I asked her if she would give me the things or the duplicates - she said she did not know what I meant - I told her the things were worth 4 l.; she said she had not a quarter of that money; she had laid them in the drawer shortly before I went out, and pretended to lock the drawer, and gave me the key, but I found the bottom drawer was not locked. I took my gloves out, and then locked them - when I came back they had been wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICH. Q. Where had the prisoner lodged before she came to you - A. With Mr. Shedding. I did not request her to come and lodge at my house - there was no application made by my daughter to her - my daughter did not ask me if she might come. I went out about two o'clock, and when I returned I was to go with her to meet some gentleman in Regent-street; I do not know his name; it was not Mr. Withnal. I came home about ten minutes before three o'clock. I found the drawer shut, but unlocked. I went to Knightsbridge, and saw Mr. Withnal, and told him to tell her to return my things, and that I would have some hand-bills printed if I could afford it, to have her taken up. I did not want her to give me 4 l., but I said the value of them was 4 l. I did not say at Marlborough-street, nor in the Park, that if she would give me 4 l. I would say no more about it.</p>

               <p>"Had you not better go home and see about the child;" she said so several times, and seemed confused, and at last I went - she said,</p>
               <p>"I will lock myself in while you are gone;" I said,</p>
               <p>"There is no occasion for that." When I went the key was outside the door, and when I returned it was inside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did you go - A. About 20 minutes after two o'clock; I was fetched back by my mother. I knew the prisoner had an appointment, but she was to wait for my mother to return to go.</p>

            . I am in the Life Guards. The prisoner was in my company about three o'clock in the afternoon, by appointment, and in the evening I saw Mrs. Clarke, and she made some communication to me. I was to meet the prisoner in the evening and told her - the prisoner knew by that time that Mrs. Clarke had said she would take her up; she had nothing with her but what I had seen her wear for months before that.</p>

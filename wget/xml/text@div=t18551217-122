                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and am in partnership with my brother, in Southampton-buildings. On 4th Dec., about 2 o'clock in the day, I was in Cheap side, waiting to see the King of Sardinia pass—a great number of persons were there—I felt a pressure on me, and a pluck at my watch chain, and immediately I found my watch was gone, and the chain hanging down—the prisoner was pressing upon me—he was quite close to me, in front of me—there was another man close to him—they were actually in collision with each other; and there was another man, and two women—I took hold of the prisoner, and said, "You have stolen my watch; you have taken my watch"—he said, "No, I have not; I-am the wrong man; I have not taken it"—I do not think he pointed to any one—I then seized the other man—I afterwards let the second man go, and took the prisoner again, and gave him into custody—I saw the handle of a watch was lying at the prisoner's feet, on the ground—my watch was worth more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never seen it since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am between fourteen and fifteen years old; I live with my mother, and work at a card board manufacture. I was out to see the King of Sardinia coming—I saw Mr. Edwards—I saw the prisoner put his hand to his pocket, and move his hand about, and take a gold watch out, and hand it to one of the other persons—there were four other persons there altogether—I know it was a watch, because I saw it in the prisoner's hand—I saw Mr. Edwards seize the prisoner not half a minute after he had the watch—the prisoner said, "It is not me," and he let him go, and seized hold of the man that had the watch, the man that the watch was handed to—Mr. Edwards then seized the prisoner again—I saw the ring of the watch drop from the prisoner's hand, and Mr. Edwards picked it up—the prisoner was standing just in front of Mr. Edwards.</p>

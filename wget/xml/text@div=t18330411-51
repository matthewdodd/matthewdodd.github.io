I fell in with the prisoner between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on the 23rd of March, in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles' - I think I spoke to her first; I was not tipsy - I went with her to a house opposite, to a public-house in which I had been - we were shown into a room; I was not with her more than half an hour - I had nothing to do with her; I had not given her any thing, nor promised her any thing - I had treated her with some ale about an hour before; I then missed three sovereigns and some silver, which I had felt safe when I was going up the stairs to the room; she had been sitting close to me on my right-hand side - I can swear to one of the sovereigns; I had had it some time - I went to the station, and gave information.</p>

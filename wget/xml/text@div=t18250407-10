I went to collar him, and he made a blow at my head with a bottle; I stooped to avoid it, and he ran across the way; I called to Scott, who knocked his hat off with his stick: he fell: we seized him, and as he arose wine ran from his waistcoat. I took two bottles of wine from him, and Scott another; he struck me several blows, and ran off, as I had the bottles I could not hold him; we at last secured him. I picked up the broken pieces of five bottles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. How could you tell how many broken bottles there were? A. I found the necks of four. I thought him drunk at first, but am now convinced that he was shamming - he might be half and half.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. John Malins, wine merchant, of Newgate-street. The prisoner came there between ten and eleven o'clock, with Terry; they each had a glass of wine. I fell asleep, and do not know when they left; we retail wine. After he was in custody I missed a 5 s. piece from the till, and found wine had been drawn from the casks below; I did not see them after eleven o'clock. Nobody but myself was at home; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182504070010"></xptr>asleep in the counting-house from eleven to three o'clock, and when I awoke he was gone. I missed some bottles from different bins; I know them by the corks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you not very drunk that night? A. No. Terry was in the warehouse when I awoke - he was once in Mr. Malins's service, and as the prisoner came with him I received him.</p>

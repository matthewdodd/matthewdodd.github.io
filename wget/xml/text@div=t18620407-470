Secondly, that at the time of the marriage he was a minor, and did not openly live with his wife, but cohabited with her at Billingsgate, and that she had no issue. Thirdly, that about January, 1839, his wife left the house at Billingsgate, where she had been living as a domestic servant, without communicating with him, and that he was unable to discover her residence. Fourthly, that in consequence of her absconding he went abroad in April, 1840, and did not return till 1841. Fifthly, that on his return about November, 1841, he discovered that his wife was living in adultery with Robert Kemp Foxall. Sixthly, that she had since that continued to live with Foxall, and had had several illegitimate children by him. Seventhly, that no collusion existed between the defendant and his wife.

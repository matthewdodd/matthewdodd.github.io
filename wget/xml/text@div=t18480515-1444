                  </hi> I am assistant to Mr. Loden, a watch and clock maker, in Blackfriars-road. A little before Christmas, 1846, I pawned two pairs of trowsers at different times, at Mr. Cockburn's; one pair for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the other for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—about Christmas, 1847, I sent 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to redeem them, by a post-office order, payable to the prisoner—my trowers were sent by the Parcel's Delivery Company in three or four days afterwards—some time afterwards I met the prisoner in London; I asked him what money there was deficient—he said 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I paid it him—he had written to me about the post office order, and said it was 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. deficient, and when I met him I paid it—he said he received the order; it was all right—I sent the duplicates with the order—I made the order payable to the prisoner because I had been in Mr. Cockburn's service, and did not wish him to know I pawned the things with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> The prisoner was in my service—the book in which this money should have been entered as paid in 1846 is destroyed—I have examined my books—it is not entered as received at Christmas, 1847—I have not received the Post-office order—if these trowsers were desired by the witness to he sent home by the Parcels Delivery Company, it would have been the prisoner's duty to have entered them in this parcel-delivery book—here are my entries, Mrs. Cockburn's, and the prisoner's, in it—here is no entry of this parcel being sent—it would be the prisoner's duty to enter the parcel, for my protection—if it had been lost I should have been exonerated, because I sent it by the party that they had mentioned—I am sure the pri<lb></lb>soner never accounted to me for this.</p>

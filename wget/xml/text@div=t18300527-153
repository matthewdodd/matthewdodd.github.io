On Saturday, the 8th of May, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, these boots were within the door-way of my shop; I had just gone in to supper, and in five minutes was called out, and informed they were gone; I found the prisoner at the watch-house with them, and was certain of them.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Pike. I was in the shop, saw the prisoner come to the door, and take a pair of boots off the floor inside the shop; I ran out, and saw him run up Stationer's-court with them - I never lost sight of him; I saw the watchman in Amencorner, and told him - he stopped the prisoner; I saw him drop the boots, and picked them up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Are there any turnings in the court? A. One to the right - you were ten or twelve yards before me; you ran up the archway, and turned towards Warwick-lane - I never lost sight of you except for a moment, while you turned, but saw you again directly; nobody was near him - he then threw them away into a passage, which has no thoroughfare.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I stopped the prisoner at the bottom of Oxford Arms-passage, Warwick-lane; I did not see him drop the boots - they were brought to the watch-house by Salvin; the prisoner said he was accused wrongfully.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going home, and had occasion to turn down this passage for a certain purpose, when the watchman came to me and said, "I want you;" I said, "What for?" he said, "You are accused of stealing a pair of boots;" the lad came up with them, and said I had stolen them - I said it was false, and went with them without resistance.</p>

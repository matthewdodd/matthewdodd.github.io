                  </hi>. I keep a public-house in Essex-street, White<lb></lb>chapel. On Sunday afternoon, the 19th of June, about three o'clock, I was fetched from up stairs into my yard—I saw the remainder of this lead there which had been left behind, by the side of the wall—it had been taken out of the gutter previously—I had some lead stolen before, and this was what the other thieves had left a fortnight previous—I had had it taken down, and zinc put up—the remainder was left in the yard, and I found about 30lbs. weight of this stolen—it is lead which might be wrap<lb></lb>ped round a person's body—the prisoners were in the habit of coming to my house—they were customers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's servant. I saw the prisoners in the tap-room about church-time on the 19th—I saw them go into the yard—Daley was in the stable adjoining the water-closet—the lead was opposite the water-closet—the prisoners were backwards and forwards, and as soon as they went, I found the lead was gone, and the rest was in the stable where I had seen Crawley—there was the mark on the water-closet where they had cut it—nobody went into the place but the prisoners—I told my master.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a labourer, and keeps the house, No. 5 1/2, Flower and Dean-street, about ten minutes' walk from the prose<lb></lb>cutor's. The prisoners lodged with us nearly five years—they came home on Sunday afternoon, the 19th of June, about twenty minutes after three, I think—I can declare it did not exceed half an hour—I taw them come in—I saw nothing bulky about them—I received Crawley's dirty shirt at Lambeth-street, last Monday week, when I took him a clean one—I washed it—I did not observe any more marks on it than usual—I have known Daley twenty-four years.</p>

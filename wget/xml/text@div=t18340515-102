             (police-constable C 106). I was sent for, and found the prisoner there with a lady, who was questioning her about the things she had lost - I went into the loft and found this property - I did not see the lace found.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

The lace fell out of the drawer, and he picked it up off the floor - I heard him say, "If she won't confess where the things are, I will attempt to transport her somehow."(Mrs. Webster, of Poland-street, the prisoner's former mistress, gave her a good character.)</p>

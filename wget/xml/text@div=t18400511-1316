                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was passing the Coach and Horses public-house, at Heston, near Hounslow, on Monday morning, the 56th of April, about six o'clock, and saw the prisoner on a wagon, loaded with straw and clover hay—I saw him put off a truss of clover hay, and two trusses of straw—I followed him with the second truss towards the stable—he came out of the stable, and shut the door after him—he looked confused at seeing me—I opened the stable-door, and said, "What are you going to do with this hay and straw?"—he said, "We will have no <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about it; the straw is all wrong, I will put it on the wagon again"—there was a ladder standing against the wagon, I got up, and found the cords all loose</p>

               <p>—he followed me with a truss of straw, to put on the load again—I would not allow it, and asked him what quantity of hay his master allowed him for his horses—he said, "Two trusses of hay, besides a feed of corn"—when I went into the stable I found three trusses of hay—I said, "Here are three trusses; this last I saw you bring in does not resemble the other two"—he said, "Yes, they are all the same, it all came out of the rick"—I pointed to one particular truss, and said, "This is the truss I saw you bring in, and these two trusses of straw, and I suspect there is some more to come off the load"—I took him into custody, and a constable went to see the straw and hay unloaded.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty at Hounslow on the 20th of April, about a quarter before six o'clock in the morning, and saw the wagon near the stable-door, and the prisoner on the top—he put off two trusses of hay, then took up two trusses of straw, and looked round him each way—he saw Griffin, I think, come out of the station-house, and he put down the trusses again, and got off the load—about six o'clock, or soon after, he got on the wagon again, and put off a truss of clover hay and two more trusses of straw—he got off the load, and I went to the stable and took him—I found the two trusses of straw in the manger, and three trusses of hay by the corn-bin—I asked what straw that was—he said that had no business there, and he would put it on the load again—I asked what hay that was—he said it was his, that his master allowed him two trusses, and one of the three was wrong, and had no business there—we took the hay and straw to the station-house, and took the prisoner into custody—I followed the wagon to Chancellor's, at Kensington, and found thirty-nine trusses of straw and fifty-seven of hay still on the wagon.</p>

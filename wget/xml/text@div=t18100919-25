I lost the property out of the dining room closet; I never missed it until I saw it in the prisoner's possession; I searched her box, and then I searched her person, in the presence of the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you find about her - A. The purse that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190015"></xptr>contained the money and the broaches, two one pound bank notes, four dollars, two halfcrowns, eighteen shillings, and five sixpences. In her box I found two pair of gloves, two handkerchiefs, a pair of stays, and half a yard of lace.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your purse contain the last time you saw it - A. I know there were two bank notes, but I cannot say they are the same. The cupboard was locked, I had lost the key for a fortnight. On the morning that she was going away, I told her she must know where the key was; this key was with the other keys; she brought them to me from the book case.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, called one witness, who gave her a good character.</p>

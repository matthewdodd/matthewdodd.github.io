               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. I cannot exactly tell; I agreed to give her two shillings; we slept together till between five and six in the morning; I had my breeches under my head, and in them a purse, containing five guineas; when I waked in the morning, between five and six, I searched, and found my money safe; I got up to evacuate, and while I was doing that, she got the money from me; I saw her take the money out of my breeches; I then laid hold of her, and had a struggle with her, to get the money back again, and she cried out, and a man came into the room with a knife in his hand, and swore, if I did not stand back, he would run the knife into my heart; I still kept in contention with her, and then a woman, that he called his wife, came up with a pair of tongs, and hit me with the tongs on my back; I took the tongs from her, and then the man said, if I did not lay down the tongs, he would surely run the knife through my heart; I was afraid of being murdered, and I put on my breeches, my waistcoat, and my jacket, and there came a black man behind me, he struck me upon my back, and I made resistance till I got out into the street; then the people gathered about, and they threw my shoes and stockings out at window, and I put them on; I then went to Lambeth-street, and got an officer.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Lambeth-street, Whitechapel: On Tuesday, the 20th of October, the prosecutor came to me, and said, he was robbed of five guineas; that he had been used very ill, and asked me to go with him to apprehend the man that had robbed him; he said, he saw the girl with the money in her hand; I went, and apprehended her; I searched her, and found upon her one shilling, and some halfpence; she said, she knew nothing about it, she had no other money; he told me, there was an old man drew a knife upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is that man? - A. It turned out to be a man of the name of Stinson; he saw him in the House of Correction; he told me exactly the same story before I apprehended the girl, that he has now told your Lordship.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose he was quite sober at that time? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Stinson not to be committed? - A. Before the girl had her last examination, he was taken in execution, and sent to the House of Correction.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The man came into the room to my assistance, with his breakfast in his hand.</p>

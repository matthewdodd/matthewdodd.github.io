On Monday, 18th Sept., a few minutes after twelve o'clock at night, I was on duty in Beaomont-street, which leads out of the New-road, close by High-street, Marylebone—I heard a small piece of glass fall—I got into the middle of the road, listened some time, and then heard a second piece fall—I then looked down the area, and saw the prisoner inside the window—I asked what he was doing there——he slipped out of the window, and got under the area steps—I got over, went down, and on looking behind him, I found a chisel, and a great quantity of silent lights—I found a square of glass had been cut large enough to admit his hand and unfasten the window and get in, and in unfastening the window he had cut his hand, and there was the print of his hand inside the house, three or four feet inside the window, on a stone sill—I saw that his hand was bleeding, and I saw the mark of the blood on the glass where it had cut it—I saw a constable, and called him; he came up—I caught hold of the prisoner, and pulled him out—he said, "I will be quiet, don't hit me, it is no use</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Gardiner. I had charge of the house, 43, Beaumont-street, and lived in it with my children—the house belongs to Mr. James Groves, of 25, Charles-street, Bedford-square—it is in the parish of St. Marylebone—on the night of 18th Sept., I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock—I fastened the kitchen window perfectly safe—the catch was quite fast—I was the last person up—when I came down in the morning I found the window broken, and thrown up—the goods and things in the house belong to my husband.</p>

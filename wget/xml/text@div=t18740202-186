ROSS</hi> is the superintendent there—I am landlord of the Pyrotechnic Arms beer-house, at Nunhead—I live there with my family, among them was the prisoner's wife, her name is Ellen Caroline—I had no other children living there at that time; there was another daughter, but she has since gone to a situation—the prisoner's wife has two children by him, the eldest will be seven on the 13th of this month, and the younger four next birthday—in November, 1872, my daughter ceased to live with the prisoner—she commenced to reside with me from that time—there was a regular judicial separation, I think that was in April or May, 1873—this letter is in the prisoner's handwriting, it is dated 24th September, 1873—it was brought by a messenger to my public-house. (<hi rend="italic">This and three other letters, dated respectively 4th and 5th October, were put in and read, they were ouched in most offensive terms, and accused the witness of keeping a disreput able table house, and of encouraging his daughter in prostitution</hi>).—I also received this letter of the 5th of December at the docks—this letter of 31st December is in the prisoner's handwriting, but I never saw that until it was handed to me by my attorney—this one of the same date, addressed to Mr. Ross, is in the prisoner's writing—Mr. Ross handed it to me—this letter of</p>

               <p>1st January, 1874, is addressed to myself, but I never saw it until it was handed to me by my attorney—the letter of 5th January is also in the prisoner's writing—I have never used the beer-house of which I have a licence, as a brothel—it is certainly not a fact that my daughter is a prostitute, or have I ever had prostitutes at my house—the whole of those imputations are entirely and totally false.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Upper Whitecross-street, and am a boot and shoemaker. The prisoner has been in the habit of coming to our shop for seven or eight years, and sometimes stopped an hour or two, or three hours—when out of work he would come and work for me for two or three hours—I cannot say whether he was at my house on the 5th of October, as he was so frequently there—I have lost boots and shoes daily when he has come, and I gave orders for him not to come again, but he did come—I went to a pawnbroker's from information, and there found this pair of boots, which I can identify as mine—I have missed such, and the prisoner had an opportunity of taking these.</p>

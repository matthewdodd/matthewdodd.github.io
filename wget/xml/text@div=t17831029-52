               <p>I was fourteen the 29th of last May. I took this box on the 21st of October to the George and Blue Boar, Holborn; I saw a man standing under the gateway, and I asked him where the book-keeper was; he said he was gone home, but he would shew me where he lived: I went along with him to Red-lion-street, to a street on the right, and there was a man standing by a lamp, and he said that he was the bookkeeper; I gave him the parcel, and told him to book it, and he took a little book out of his pocket, and a black lead pencil or a pen, I could not see which, and booked it; then he gave it to the man that went with me, which is the prisoner. I cannot be sure whether he is the man or no.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. The prisoner is not the man you gave the parcel to? - No, I gave it to a tall man, and he gave it to another man.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 21st of this month, about nine o'clock, coming up Holborn, just by Gray's Inn gate, I met the prisoner, and a tall man with him; the prisoner had this box under his arm. The moment I stopped him, the other man ran away. I asked the prisoner where he got this box; he said a man had given it to him to carry; I told him he must go with me; he said with all his heart. I took him to Sir Sampson Wright's, and broke open the box, and we found the bill of parcels, and where the prosecutor lived. I sent for the prosecutor, and he said it was his box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Did you enquire what business the prisoner was? - A fellowship porter.</p>
               <p>Jury. What made you stop the man in the street? - If it is thought a question proper to be answered, I will resolve it.</p>
               <p>Jury. I think it is? - I knew the man at the bar.</p>
               <p>(The things deposed to.)</p>

               <p>My Lord, I went up as far as Bloomsbury market, and returning back, just by the White Hart, a man asked me to take that box down Holborn; he was along-side of me: Jealous met the man and me together; I told him I had a box belonging to that gentleman, and I pointed to the gentleman, and I went along with Jealous, and the gentleman ran away; I thought he had been by the side of me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

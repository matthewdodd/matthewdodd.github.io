I was em<lb></lb>ployed by the prosecutors to watch the prisoner, who was their carman—I watched him from their warehouse to Fleet-street—he delivered goods at two places—he afterwards got to Stanhope-street, Clare-market—he stopped at the end of Stanhope-street—he untied a parcel of tobacco, took some out, and placed it at the bottom of the cart—he tied the parcel up again, and went and de<lb></lb>livered some in Clare-street—I followed him to King William-street, Strand; he stopped there, and took some more out of a parcel, and placed it at the bottom of the cart—he went to Great Newport-street; he there untied a parcel, and took some more out; he at last got to Great Warner-street, Clerkenwell, he stopped the cart opposite a public-house, and went over to 29 1/2, which is a chandler's-shop, taking nothing with him; he stopped a few minutes, and then came out and took this bundle from about the same place, in the bottom of his cart where I had seen him put some tobacco—he crossed over to the chandler's-shop and took the bundle in—he was coming out again, and I stopped him, and asked him what he had put on a shelf there (I had seen him put the bundle on a shelf)—he made no answer—I asked him again, and I went and took the bundle down—he said it was to<lb></lb>bacco; he had bought it, and he had left it there for some friends in the country—I told him I should take him into custody—he said, "For God's sake don't do that; if you lock me up I shall get discharged, and perhaps get six months for it"—I took him to the station—this is the bundle I saw him put on the shelf in the shop—I saw him deliver some parcels of tobacco, it Rider's-court, Leicester-square, that was directly after he had taken some tobacco out in Great Newport-street.</p>

                  </hi> I am a tobacconist, and live at No. 21, Rider's-court, Leicester-square. On the 25th of Oct. the prisoner delivered some tobacco at my place—it is generally brought in one large bag, with smaller bags inside, which I generally order on Saturday—I took the small bags from the large one on the 25th, and put them by, as I had plenty of stock from the last week—on Thursday, the 29th, Mr. Rippon came and weighted the bags—one bag of shag was nine ounces and a half short of weight, and another which was bird's-eye, wanted two ounces—the other bags were full, and as usual, overweight.</p>

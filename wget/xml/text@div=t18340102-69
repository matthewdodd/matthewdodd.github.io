               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q.Was it not in May, 1832, she came into your service? A. I will not say the date particularly, it was in the early part of the year - I left her with three children - she had the care of the family and the room where the property was kept - when I went into the country I left her a sovereign to begin with, and I was in the habit of coming to town - I cannot say how soon I came to town again - my children were ill with the fever, and the prisoner said she had been ill with it - she was very kind to my children - I gave her some money when I came to town again - I cannot say how much - she did not say she had been obliged to part with anything to get money - I do not know when she pawned these things - I cannot say that she had not expended the money on my family - she sent the duplicates to her brother about six months ago, and he sent them to me - I did say to her sister, (in hopes of finding her,) that if she sent me the duplicates I would not hurt her - she never told me she had expended the money she got for these things on my family, but she said she had intended to save money and get them again.</p>

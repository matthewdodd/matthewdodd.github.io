I saw him on board yesterday; he came and asked for work; he was not engaged, but he lent a hand to shake out the chains and weigh anchor, and had a drop of grog and a piece of biscuit, which the mate told me to give him; he afterwards fell into the hold - the mate then told me to look after him - I did so; but he took an opportunity of getting away when I did not see him - when he came on board he had a frock under his arm; this was about ten o'clock. About half-past eleven the officer brought him on board, with my trousers and other things in a bag. I had sean him with a bag, but did not much notice it - my trousers were safe about ten o'clock, when he came on board, in the captain's state-room.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner with this bag, containing two pairs of trousers and a handkerchief. I took him on board the vessel, and they were claimed; the prisoner said when I stopped him, that all the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130155"></xptr>articles were his own, and that he had been a voyage in the vessel - but when he got on board he said some lumper man had given them to him.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>How long might they be with you; - Not above a minute and a half at most, I made no resistance, I had not so much as a stick; in the City Road I saw the watchman in his watch box, and I gave him information, and a description, soon after that, some of Sir Sampson's Officers Bow-street came after me, I was then going with the patrol in the City-road, they asked me if I was the person that had been robbed, I told them yes, and what I lost, I gave a description of the persons of the robbers, the officers said they would let me know; the next evening I was informed that a person was taken into custody; near the same spot where I was robbed; I went to Bow-street on the Monday after, when I came to the office there were five people at the bar, and Sir Sampson asked me to look at the five, and see if I knew any of them, I saw the prisoner who was one of the five.</p>
               <p>Did you pitch upon him immediately? - I did; I knew him very well before this transaction, I have known him from a child, I am sorry to say it, he is one of our own parishioners.</p>
               <p>Did you know him by sight only? - I knew him by sight, I knew the whole family; I was not confident at the time I was robbed that it was this person, but when I saw him at the office, it struck into my mind directly that he was the person that stopped me, I was clearly convinced he was the person that stopped me.</p>
               <p>Was not you flurried at the time? - I was very much flurried at the time, one run after me very hard, and laid hold of my collar, but I had opportunity enough to observe them afterwards; and it came into my recollection before I went to Bow-street, that it was this lad which I knew.</p>
               <p>Are you clear now that that was the man? - I have not a doubt in my own mind about it, I believe he is not the person that took the money from me.</p>
               <p>What was this lad? - I do not know what business they were, but the family had lived in a street near me for years.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say at the office when you first pitched on him? - He did not say thing then.</p>

I said, "You should not drive a blind mare too fast down hill" - he had taken his hand out of my breeches at that time and put it into my left waistcoat pocket; in a moment or two he tried to clasp hold of my legs and I whipt my legs under the seat of the cart; he caught hold of them, and chucked me right out of the cart on my head; and no more did I see Coupe after that; I had five half-crowns in this left hand waistcoat-pocket; I know I had them safe when I paid the ostler; I gave him 6d. and 3d.; no one had been with me but the prisoner, and my money was gone out of my pocket; I saw no more of him after he chucked me out on my head - there was a person went to the place the next morning to look for my money, and he could not find it - I got up as soon as I could and went to the Coach and Horses which is the nearest house; I could not make any body hear, and I got into the road again and got home as well as I could, with my blind mare; Mr. Clark the magistrate, and Mr. Edghill, came to me the next day; the patrole followed the prisoner and took him, but I cannot say when, as I was ill in bed, in consequence of my fall, and the cut on my head.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Now I warn you, I have twelve witnesses here; at what rate were you going with this blind mare before you were chucked out? A. Eight or nine miles an hour - I might tell the magistrate that the wheel went over my head.</p>
               <p>Q. But did you tell him so? A. No, I could not tell him that, so as I was hurt; I might say that when the magistrate first came to me; I dare say I was sworn - I did not state to him that the wheel went over my head; I was not asked the question - I did not tell the magistrate at the first examination, that the wheel went over my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you said read over to you? A. Yes - I put no mark; I think I did not put any mark; I don't think they asked me; I shall not swear whether I did or no - I think I told the magsistrate I had five half-crowns and a shilling in my pocket; I could not tell them at the first examination; I was too ill; I was all but a dead man - I should think I was a mile and a quarter from home, when I was chucked out; I did not go to any public-house; I walked home, and led my mare home; I could not get into the cart; I got up as soon as I could, and cried "Wohey" to my mare; I was as sensible as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say when you got home, that you had left 75l. in the hands of Mr. Wells? A. If I did say so, my pain was so great I did not know what I did say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your pain so great on the third examination, that you did not know what you said? A. Yes, at times; but the magistrate came up-stairs, and did not ask me whether I was well or unwell; I did not give them long answers, to the extent of two or three pages - it was on Uxbridge fair-day I was chucked out of my cart - I might he examined on the 18th of October, I cannot say - I might be examined on the 28th; I was examined three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found the prisoner's hand in your left breeches-pocket, what did you say to him? A. I said,"Coupe, what are you at, ar'nt you a fool?" and then he clasped hold of my legs, and threw me out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the magistrate that you felt Coupe's hand all over your pockets, and in all your pockets? A. Yes; I had papers in all my pockets, and they were taken out; I did not tell the magistrate so on the first examination - he put his hand in my left breeches pocket, and then in my left waistcoat-pocket; he then crossed his hand and put it into my right breeches-pocket, and then in my right coat-pocket; probably he might put his hand into my other coat-pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. What were you doing all this time? A. I did not study nor think he meant to rob me; I knew the young fellow well, and I thought he was only on his larks, but I lost my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear in the outset, that after he had put his hand in your breeches, and in your waistcoat-pockets, that he then chucked you out; what do you mean by now swearing that he put his hand in your other pockets? A. He had rifled all of them before - I told the magistrate the wheel went over my head - I told you the cart was going eight or nine miles an hour, and so it was; the wheel went gently over my head.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the cart and horse before you when you cried, "Wohey?" A. Why I was along with it; the mare stopped when I was chucked out, and I clambered hold of the cart, and that set the mare going; no doubt of that - I had been to more than one or two public-houses looking after my business - I know Richard Green of the King's-arms; I don't know that I was there at all that day; if I was there, I paid for what I drank - I was at the Falcon; I took money and paid money all the morning- I had some mild beer at the Falcon, that was all - I was at the George, I drank some beer there and had a good dinner and some wine - I was at the Sun; I drank a small glass of gin there, but no rum: I don't know what I paid, it was the regular charge - I went to Mr. Smith's beer-shop; I found a man there, and had a deal with him; I was not drunk all day; I had no fight with a man named Brill - I mentioned two or three words to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner requested to interfere, and take you away from the crowd? A. No; I remember going to the George-inn, and the landlady said, "Bill, I think you had better not have any more beer;" I did not make any answer - I don't know that I said before the magistrate, that I did not touch a drop of spirits during the whole of that day; the magistrate did not ask me - I did not dance with the prisoner or anybody that night; I might stand outside the dancers and see them dance - I don't remember standing in the middle and the prisoner dancing round me - Ann Langford might be at the dance, but I did not notice her; I cannot resolve how many people were at the dance, nor what time it was; it was not a great while before I went home - I did say that I left 75l. in the hand of Harry<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183311280079"></xptr>Wells, but I did not know what I did say - I walked home more than a mile after I was chucked out; I missed my money the next morning - I have not been drinking this morning; I have only had a cup of coffee, some toast, some beef, and a glass of beer.</p>

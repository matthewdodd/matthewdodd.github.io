I have looked at an entry in the delivery order-book of 7th June, 1862, and at the cart-note and counterfoils—the cart-note is torn out—I find no such transaction in the delivery-book as 1,800 lbs of sugar, to Ivermee—there is no reference to it in the cart-note-book—I find no entry in the delivery-order-book of a transaction on 12th July of 100 loaves of sugar—there is a blank counterfoil with the commencement of Mr. Coles name—the date before and after the blank is 12th July—there is no entry</p>

               <p>in the book of Ivermee or Coles—Phillips was there on 7th June, and 12th July, 1862—there is no entry in the returns made by Phillips on either of those days, of either of these transactions, to Ivermee—in the aggregate the delivery orders would correspond with the entries in the delivery order-book—I believe this "Coles" to be Green's writing—the person delivering would copy the delivery-orders into the delivery-order-book—the book would be open at the warehouse, accessible to Phillips—he was head fore<lb></lb>man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did other persons make out these cart-notes besides Green? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes—they were made out by him in July, I 1862—I would not say that be made out all the cart-notes then, the majority of them—"J. F." is Foley, I suppose—if the goods were going by rail, the cart-notes would be made out to the carriers, to Chaplins, not to Coles—his was home trade—we assume they go to the caariers whose names appear, that is all we have—if two loaves were taken from one parcel, and three from another, they would not be missed—it would be impossible to miss them.</p>

               <p>delivery orders were brought to the warehouse, and proper entries made in the books—they ought to deliver 100 loaves of sugar in a quarter of an hour—of course it would depend a good deal upon how the sugar laid, how near it was to the loophole—it would be carried to the scale, weighed, and then handed down to the van.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you seen them before? - A. Yes; she has lived in the neighbourhood a long while; immediately upon my asking of her if she would have any gin, she hit me in the face, and took away my bundle, which I had in my gown.</p>

               <p>Q. By this time there were a great number of people in the street? - A. I don't know whether there were or not, for I went to my acquaintance and went to bed; my home was in the country.</p>
               <p>Q.How far was this from your acquaintance's? - A. About eleven yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she afterwards come to you to your acquaintance's house? - A. No, I went to her, and saw her again; I asked her for the things, and told her, if she would let me have the duplicates, I would be glad; she told me I might be d - d, and the duplicates too; then I went and found the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q.What is his name? - A.Callahan; he went to look for her, and it was late at night before he could find her; 2 about twelve o'clock at night he found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180212010022"></xptr>her in the same room that she ran up to; the watchman brought her up stairs to where I was in bed; she brought an old coloured apron and two clouts and asked me if they were mine; she then went upon her knees, and asked for mercy; I said, if she had done nothing to me, what did she want with mercy from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things which she brought your's? - A. The clouts were mine, but the apron I never saw before.</p>
               <p>Q.They were a part of your bundle? - A. Yes, they were in the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and the prisoner, and the aunt, been talking before? - A. No; I went down the street, and saw her aunt and her at the door, and I asked them to have some gin.</p>
               <p>Q.What is the name of this place? - A. It used to be called Lewkner's-lane.</p>

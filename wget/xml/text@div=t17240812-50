            , an Apothecary's Apprentice depos'd, That he was present while Mr. Small the Surgeon dress'd the Deceased, that when he came in, the Deceased was sitting in a Chair, that Major Harrison ask'd the Captain, if he himself (the Captain) was not the Aggressor, and he answered he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stone depos'd, that he being Beedle, was all'd, and when he went, the Deceased was laid on the Table, and the Major said to him, Sir, it was your own seeking, and I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carter the Constable said, he also being call'd, went, and the Captain was lying on the Table, and after some time stirred his Hand, and raised himself, and sat up, and the Major said to him, Sir, you have already said it to the Drawer, say before the Constable, did you not draw your 8 word upon me, and Capt. Agnew reply'd, I did draw my Sword first. This was the third time he had owned it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172408120007"></xptr> at that time said, is there no Body to attend me, no Body to help me, and the Apothecary's Man wiped the Spittle from his Mouth, he being too weak and saint to discharge it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Small the Surgeon depos'd, he dressed the Deceased, that the Wound was half an Inch broad, and an Inch and a half backwards near the right Pap, and that Major Harrison desired him to take Care of him, and also ask'd the Deceased, if himself had not been the Cause of this, and he answered, ay, ay.</p>
               <p>The Major in his Defence pleaded, that this unfortunate Accident had brought upon him a great deal of Grief and Concern, that the Deceased and himself were Brother Officers in the Garrison of Dunkirk, in the Year 1710. and both of them having an Inclination for Books, it had occasioned their contracting an intimate Acquaintance, which had been continued with the strictest Friendship ever since, that the Day the Accident happened, they had been together, and walking in Lincolns Inn, they bespoke a Rabbet, &amp;c. for Supper, and having supped, were together till about 11 a-Clock, and going thro' Covent Garden heard there was a Fire, and not being willing to go home till they were satisfied how and where it was, they went to the Lubeck's Head, as had been before depos'd, that at the latter end of the first Flask, being in Discourse, the Deceased was drawing Parallels between the Roman and English Government, which he thinking carry'd in them Reflections on the latter, it gave him Occasion to oppase him in his Argument. Which put the Deceased out of Temper, but he giving him soft Language, had brought him to Temper again, as he thought, and they were very friendly; but after the bringing in of the second Bottle, the Captain return'd to his ill Temper, and wish'd there was a Case of Pistols in the Room, to which he reply'd, for what, he hoped not for them to use, to which he answered, since there was not, they should decide it another way, by the Sword, and drew it, he begged of him for God's sake to sorbear, but he grew violent, and push'd at him, whereupon he retreated as far as he could for the Wall, and having drawn his Sword, put himself into a Posture of Defence, and the Captain made a very violent push at him, which he happily put by, and believes at the same Time he ran upon his Sword, and received the Wound, for he did not know that he was wounded till he told him that he was, and that having disarm'd him, he immediately called for help, and took what care of him he could, sending for a Surgeon, and assisting him as well as he could.</p>
               <p>Colonel Sinclare, and a great many Persons of Character appear'd to his Reputation, who gave him the Character of a peaceable, affable, inoffensive Gentleman; and some others, among which was a certain noble Lord, gave the Deceased the Character of a Person who was so apt to be tenacious of his Argument, when in Discourse, as to be impatient of Contradiction. Upon a full hearing of the Matter, the Jury acquitted him of all three Indictments, bringing in their Verdict, <rs id="t17240812-50-verdict271" type="verdictDescription">

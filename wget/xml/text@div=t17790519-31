               <p>What office are you in? - I am mate of the Censor hulk.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the prisoner being brought to your custody? - Yes; I believe he came about the 1st of November, 1776. He was on board about three quarters of an hour, or an hour at the farthest. He went on board one of the lighters to heave ballast up out of the river, with eight more. They called a purl-boat to give them some twopenny to drink. It was a cold morning. There were three keepers on board with them. When they had got the purl they seised the arms from the keeper.</p>
               <p>Did you see all that? - No; the next time I saw him was at Sir

               <p>Was he a soldier when you delivered him on board? - He was in the militia.</p>

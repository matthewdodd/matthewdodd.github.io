In about three minutes after, he came up to me, and, without saying a word, hit me a blow with it on the head, and struck me up against the side of a house: I turned about and collared him, and called out. Mr. Crawford came to my assistance, I never let my hold go till the watch came; he pretended to say I was going to rob him.</p>

            . I was in my own house, I heard murder cried; I went out and found the prisoner and prosecutor had each other by the collar: the prosecutor said, the villain had knocked him down; the prisoner said, the other attempted to rob him. I took hold of each, and said, they should neither of them stir, till I called the watch: when the watch came, I desired them to take charge of the two men; I went with them to the Watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any appearance of a blow upon either of them?</p>
               <p>Crawford. The prosecutor had received a blow on one side of his head, there was a cut: the stick was taken from the ground, and brought into the Watch-house.</p>

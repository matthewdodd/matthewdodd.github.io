I was on duty in the Plumstead Road on the morning of 4th January last—I saw three men jump out of the second-floor window of Mr. Bickerstaff's house—I caught the prisoner as he came out of the window—he jumped out first—my attention had been called to the prisoners about half-past two by a light, before I saw the men—I knocked at the door, and obtained no answer—Mr. Bicker<lb></lb>staff gave the prisoner into custody for breaking and entering his house—he made no reply—I searched him, and found a shilling, three sixpences, and thirteen-pence in copper.</p>

Afterwards a policeman came to the door and knocked, and I ran up stairs and jumped out of the window. I did not go into the house to steal, and did not take anything. I went quietly with the police<lb></lb>man. I make my living by hard work, not by burglary.</p>

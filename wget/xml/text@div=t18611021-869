From information I received, I went on the night of 29th September with Fawke, another officer, to the house of Mr. Ewer, Moor-lane, at about 12 o'clock—we concealed ourselves in the shop—at about a quarter past I, on that Sunday morning, we heard a noise as of some person getting over a low wall in the rear of the premises—the parlour window was raised up, and some one entered from outside, and lighted the gas in the parlour—I could see when it was alight that it was Tame who lighted it—he went through the shop to a desk in the corner of the shop, where there was some money left, took some money, and placed it in his pocket—he was in the act of taking some more, when I got out and seized him—I then took him to the station-house, and found 11 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers on him, and a knife—we had marked some coppers, and placed them among other coppers on the shelf, and we found portions of those which we marked when we searched him at the station—the window was fastened—I had previously seen both the prisoners together at 11 o'clock, in Moor-lane—I know them to be constant companions—when I took Tame to the station my brother constable went to take Bailey.</p>

I went to Mr. Ewer's shop, 18, Moor-lane—I marked some money—it was placed on a drawer in the shop—a little after I in the morning I heard footsteps of, I should say, three persons in the lane, and turn up the court—I heard some one drop heavily over the wall in the court, and I heard some one at the window—some one came into the parlour—I saw a light—the gas was turned on, and I heard some one, who afterwards turned out to be Tame, come into the shop—I assisted in taking him to the station-house, and then went t back and saw Bailey close to the wall where Tame must have got over—I told him I wanted him for being concerned with Tame, who was in custody, for breaking into Mr. Ewer's house—he said, "You have made a mistake this time, Mr. Fawke, for I have been in Shoreditch all the afternoon, at a coffee-shop"—I said, "You are wrong this time, for I heard your voice in Moor-lane at 11 o'clock"—I took him to the station-house and found nothing on him.</p>

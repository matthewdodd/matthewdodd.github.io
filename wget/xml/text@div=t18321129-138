            . I am an auctioneer and house-agent -I live in Seymour-place. In July the prisoner Jones called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183211290070"></xptr>on me; I had seen him before - he told me he was about a house at 200l. a year in Connaught-terrace, and he wished me to go over the inventory, to see if it was correct; he did not take that house; but I afterwards arranged to let him Mrs. De Windt's house - he said he was a respectable person, and could give me the best of references; that when he was at home he resided at Carno, North Wales - he afterwards said he was connected with an extensive mining concern in North Wales; he called on me afterwards, said he had seen Mrs. De Windt, that all was settled, and he was to have possession; I forget whether I sent a man with him or not, but he said he expected his housekeeper in town, and she would be ready there to take possession - I saw him after that, when he said he had taken possession, and found every thing quite correct; he afterwards appointed me his secretary for his mining concerns; and I must confess, I looked upon him as a very wealthy individual.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Was it you who recommended him to Mrs. De Windt, as an eligible person? A. Certainly not - they became known to each other by some other means.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. Is the inventory in your possession? A. Yes; Jones had altered the windows by taking out old sashes and putting in new ones - Mr. Watts, who put them in, told me they were not paid for; Jones talked of making other alterations - the locks which were put on appeared to me to be a sort of lock I had never seen before; he paid me very few attentions - he did not give me time to receive them; from July till the 17th of September, I never saw him at all - it was about three weeks after he had been in the house, that I called and heard his wife was ill; I did not accept him as my future husband, unless he could prove himself to be what he had stated - I never wrote letters to him in tender terms; I think I wrote one note to him signed with my Christian name only - I went with him in a carriage to

I went with the officer; what he has stated is correct: on searching Jones I found this pocket-book, containing some mining shares - he said it was no use looking in his pockets for duplicates; if I would go with him, he would produce them - we went to the Delaware Arms, and asked the servant for a parcel he left there, and gave me sixty-four duplicates, saying they belonged to Mrs. De Windt's property - part of it has been given up.</p>

I never had the slightest thought of doing wrong towards you, whom I really did, I may say worship - but this I must only now think of in my repentant mind, for having pledged your goods. In your religion you will find the noble happiness to be derived from compassion and mercy. There is still a chair and glass to be restored to you, which I had forgot, but shall not be so on Wednesday; also six cups and saucers, three or four plates, and part of a glass there, I am taking means to obtain and deliver.

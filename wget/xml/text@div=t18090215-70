            , my brother in law, came back and told them to make use of better words; directly this here man struck Clements in the face, and the other hustled me a little farther in the road from them; he struck me, I had a stick, I knocked him down with it; he came again, and I knocked him down the second time; I heard a voice say, you b - r, draw your knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it said that - A. The prisoner. As soon as I heard that voice I immediately turned to the left, Jonas followed me; I had the same clothes on then as I have now; he struck me with a knife, I suppose. The officer took the knife away from him when he got him to the watchhouse. I was cut through my clothes, it ran into my back as far as the back bone. I have the shirt I had on here; he cut through my coat, waistcoat, breeches, and shirt; after he had done that I believe I knocked him down; I walked away; I saw no more of them; I have never seen Jonas since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. As to the man you call Jonas he was an entire stranger to you - A. He was; I never saw him before, nor since.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore whether his name was Jonas or Smith you know not - A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did this last altogether - A. A very short time.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of which short time you knocked him down twice or three times - A. Twice, I am certain of; I did not like to stop after the word knife was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180902150034"></xptr>mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you knock him down after that - A. I am not sensible whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the other man was knocked down more than once - A. I cannot say, he was at a distance from me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go away until the prisoner, whom you had knocked down twice, called watch - A. He made a noise when he was down, I do not know what.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not both knocked down, and did not both call out watch - A. I cannot say; the one that came to me I knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath did not they both call out watch - A. The man that I knocked down, he called out watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon his calling out watch you and your companion went off directly - A. No, we did not; we did not make any stop; we moved on the same as usual.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or did you not, upon your oath, move to go off until they called watch - A. I do not know that we did; after the word knife was mentioned I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive at first that you were cut - A. I shortly after did; as I was going along I said I feel the blood running.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of your party was taken up for assaulting of them - A. I do not know any more than I am told.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been drinking freely, had not you - A. I had been drinking about two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner charge you with tripping him up - A. No; only with knocking him down.</p>

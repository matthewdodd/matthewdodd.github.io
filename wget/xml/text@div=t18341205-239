                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Lovell. About three weeks ago Smith asked me if I had seen some velvet in my mistress's drawer—I said "No"—she then told me she would show me a piece of velvet—she went into her room, unlocked her own box, and produced this piece—she then put it back into her box—I told her I would tell—she told me not to tell, as she was going to make a bonnet of it—about three weeks ago I saw Emma unlock my mistress's glass drawer with the key of her own tea-chest when I was helping her to make mistress's bed, she took out a pair of ear-rings, and told me she would take them to Mrs. Wilkins—there was a cornelian stone on the top of one—she said she would get it altered—she put them into her pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I was lodging at Mrs. Wilkins's. I know Smith, by coming to and fro—I remember her coming to the house and bringing some velvet and ear-rings—she gave them to Mrs. Wilkins, and said the velvet was to make her a bonnet, and the ear-rings to be repaired, for her mistress had made her a present of them—she gave me a frock-body, and said she would make me a present of it—she brought them on a Sunday night, and on the Monday morning I took them to Mr. Lovell's brother.</p>

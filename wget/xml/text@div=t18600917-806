                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Carter, who keeps a general shop at Woodford in Essex—on Saturday, 4th August, between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop—I don't know whether she had been there before; she asked for a pair of boots—I took her into the boot-room and showed her a pair, she asked me for a common pair; I showed her a pair—she tried them with her hand and said they would suit her—when I pulled the pair of common ones from the cupboard some others fell on the floor—I did not try them on, she said she could tell the size by her hand—she said she would take them—I then went to put the other boots into the cupboard when I heard something drawn along the floor—it sounded like boots—there was nothing else in the department besides boots—she asked for a pair of children's boots, which I showed her; but as I could not find the pair she wanted, she said she would call on Monday for them—while she was lookiug at the children's boots I heard her rustling something in a basket which she had with her—I did not notice anything else, as</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186009170109"></xptr>
               <p>there was a girl standing between us—we had to go'through the carpet-room into the draper's shop on the way to the street—I took her into the draper's shop to take the money—I carried the boots which she had selected into the front shop and placed them on the counter—she put down a half-sovereign—I went to get the change, but did not give it her then—I called the shop<lb></lb>walker, Mr. Abernethy, and then I accused the prisoner of having a pair of boots that did not belong to her—she then went to run out of the shop—Mr. Abernethy stopped her and said, "What have you done?"—she said, "Oh, Mr. Carter, you must forgive me;" believing he was Mr. Carter—he then pulled up her shawl and found a pair of boots hanging upon her left arm; they were fastened together—we then took her in to Mr. Carter, and she said, "Oh, you must forgive me"—when we were passing through the back room she took a pair of children's boots out of her basket and threw them away from her—I distinctly saw that—they had our mark upon them, and so had the boots taken from her arm—they were my master's—neither pair had been sold by me—when she threw the boots away I picked them up—a constable was sent for and she was given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to the prosecutor—on 1st August, between 9 and 10 o'clock—in consequence of something Gosling said to me I went up to the prisoner—when I reached the front of the shop I went between her and the shop door—Gosling then said, "This woman has some boots about her"—she then made a movement to go out of the door and I stopped her—I said, "What have you got there?" lifting up her shawl, and I took a pair of boots from off her arm—I think lifting the shawl was partly the act of both—I made a movement to do so and she pulled it on one side—I then saw a pair of boots strung across her arm—I took them off her arm and said, "What must I do to you now? I must give you into custody"—she said, "You must forgive me this time, Mr. Carter" or words to that effect—I then took hold of her and led her through the passage way to Mr. Carter—in passing through the doorway that leads to Mr. Carter's department, she pulled on one side from me, and on turning round I saw Gosling pick up a pair of boots—Gosling said to her, "What, another pair?" they were children's boots—she said nothing—we went in to Mr. Carter—he sent for a constable and she was given into custody—the place where the boots were picked up was not the place where the boots were usually kept—they are kept in another room—boots were never scattered about there—it is some distance from the shoe room—I believe she had a basket with her.</p>

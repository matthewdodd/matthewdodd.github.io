                  </hi>. It was Walker's duty to attend the Judges' Chambers and the Court of Bankruptcy—the prisoner bad to pay fees, and to do the mechanical part—on 17th Jan. the prisoner applied to me for a check—he said, "I shall want a check for the payment of some fees"—he gave me this list of fees, amounting to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I gave him this check—I crossed it, and made a memorandum, "Gave check to Hall"—it is quite impossible I could have given it to Walker—those fees were to be paid in the Bankruptcy-office—they were in the habit of taking my crossed checks there—this check has been paid, and written off my account—Walker was dismissed on 1st or 2nd April—the prisoner remained a fortnight afterwards, and during that time he had this book—he left on the 15th, without notice, and sent us a note—I afterwards applied to his house, and he was not to be found—I gave the prisoner this check on a Thursday, and on the Saturday afterwards he passed his account with me—in that account in his book he has made an entry of the check; here it is; and on the other side be has charged the fees, amounting to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as having paid them—I had given him instructions to enter no money but what he himself paid, and the other clerks had the same instructions—here is the name "Walker" to this—in my judgment, it was not there when I passed the account—I should not have paid it, if I had found it there, without explanation—I should have had it entered by Walker in his own account—some of the fees in this bankruptcy ease have been paid since; I am not sure whether they all have—I discovered that these fees had not been paid, some time after the prisoner had left—in course of business, they ought to have been paid about that period—we were getting our bill of costs taxed.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM STEPHENS. I am a Police-constable. On the 17th of December, between two and three o'clock in the morning, I stopped the prisoner in Sidney's-alley<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183001140031"></xptr>with this chaise-cover wrapped round his body; I asked what he had got - he said a roquelaire; I took him, and found it was this cover - I found the initials upon it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming through Windsor, where I had applied for relief, and they told me I must come to St. George's parish; a gentleman gave me this to keep me warm - I came to London, and went to Mr. Powell, who gave me a note to go to the workhouse; they gave me a slice of bread and cheese, and 3d - I could not get a lodging for that, and was obliged to walk the streets; I got to Sidney's-alley, and the officer stopped me.</p>

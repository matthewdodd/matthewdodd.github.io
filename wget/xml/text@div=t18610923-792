                  </hi>. I live at 54, Golway-street, St Luke's, and am foreman to Mr. Hector Baxter, of 49, Bartholomew-close, as a bookbinder—the prisoner has been about two years in his service as a porter, carrying out books—he left about five weeks before the robbery—I discharged bin on Saturday, 17th August, I closed the premises as usual about ten minutes past 6—I closed the counting-house door, saw that all was fastened, and then locked the street-door—there is a yard at the back and a yard door, and a back door to the warehouse from the yard—I bolted that—it is a half-door, coloured glass at the top and wood at the bottom—the panel are not perfect, the glass is broken; and where the glass it broken it is covered with paper—I suppose the bolt of the door is about eighteen or twenty inches from the paper squares—if the paper squares were removed, a person from the outside could put his hand in and take hold of the bolt—the paper is over the door—it does not move with the door—the bolt is, perhaps, five feet from the ground—no one sleeps on the premises—I took the key with me when I had locked all the doors—on the following Monday morning I went there about a quarter before 7—when I opened the street door, I found the counting-house door open—that drew my attention, because I remembered distinctly closing it, before I went out—there were two desks in there—I found desk had been broken open and the paper strewed about, and found a knife</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186109230083"></xptr>
               <p>on the desk—one desk was not closed on the Saturday; the other was looked, and Mr. Baxter had the key with him—a hand had been pushed through the paper over the back door, and the bolt pushed back—the bolt and staple of the yard door were knocked away, but the lock staple had been pushed in agai, and the door pulled to, so that any person passing would think the door was firmly fastened—the staple of the bolt was not put in at all—I found three pieces of cloth in a book bag in the yard—I went to the place where the gold was kept and found 2,500 gold leaves taken away, in books of 500 leaves each—there were five packets taken of twenty books each packet—they were taken from a corner recess in the shop; a shelf which I keep on purpose—I then went upstairs to the workshop where the gold leaf is kept in use, and it was all taken away—I cannot say exactly how much was gone, but to the best of my recollection, between 800 and 900—it was worth about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the gold dust and gold rags about 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—the first 500 were in a corner were I work, tied up in packets, and the other was in little recesses where it is put ready for use.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is there a table in the centre of the workshop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I found a finger-stall on it—I saw that table cleared on the Saturday night by the porter and one of the boys—there was nothing left on the table then, except a few old books in one corner—there was a piece of rag in the finger-stall—I also missed a saw—I did not see the prisoner on Saturday—I am sure the finger-stall was not on the table on Saturday night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You saw the table cleared; do you mean to say after the table was cleared that there was nothing left on it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing, with the exception of a few old books, which have been lying there for a twelvemonth—after they had cleared the table they waited to shut up the workshop, and they did so—I was in the workshop and locked tie door—I cannot say I saw everything the boys did from the time the table was cleared till I locked the door—if one of them had seen a finger-stall on the ground he might have tossed it up on the table—they might have picked up a book and put it on the table, but I don't think it is possi<lb></lb>ble they could do so without my seeing it—they were there two or three hours after the table was cleared—other people were in the workshop besides the two boys—after that there was nothing particular to attract my atten<lb></lb>tion immediately before I shut up the workshop, but I was standing just by the table, waiting till they got out—there was only a little light in the work shop when I was leaving, as all the windows were shut up, except the end shutter—there were several men in the workshop after the table was cleared—if there was a finger-stall on the table when the boys cleared it, I did nut see it—I must have seen it if there was—there were books and loose paper on the table when they began to clear it—I will swear there was not a finger-stall amongst that loose paper—I think I must have seen it if there was—they were strips of paper which we put at the back of books—I certainly believe there was not a finger-stall beside those old books—I swear there was no finger-stall on the table on the Saturday night—there were no gloves there—the centre of the table was quite clear—this gold leaf was not in any secret drawer—I do not think it is likely that any person could go to where it is kept without knowing the place—it was open to any one who came in there—it was not locked up at all, it was in a kind of recess, a shelf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a city detective officer, and in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation I received, I went in search of the prisoner—I went to his place, 6, Mill-street, Cloth-fair, on the morning of 20th August, about 8 o'clock, the Tuesday after the robbery—he lived there at that time—I knocked it the door—he was in bed—he let me in—I told him I was an officer and wanted to look at his hands—he showed me them, and I said, "Why, you have a bad finger"—he said, "Yes"—I took this finger-stall (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from his finger, and perceived that he had a bad finger—it was getting better—I cautioned him about saying anything, and then took from my pocket this thumb-stall with some rag in it, which I had received from Logan, on the Monday previously—I asked the prisoner if he knew anything of this—he seemed surprised, and hesitated—I said, "Is this yours?"—he said, Yes, it is"—I asked him how he could account for its being on the premiss of Mr. Baxter—he said very carelessly, "I don't know"—I told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of entering the premises of Mr. Baxter, and stealing a quantity of gold leaf; worth about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "I know nothing at all about it"—I asked him again about the finger-stall, and to his wife, who was there, said, "I suppose he left it there when he was in their employ"—I then commenced searching the place. and, turning suddenly round, I saw the prisoner holding up his finger to his wife, who was about to speak, as if to imply silence—the wife was sitting upright in bed at tint time with a baby in her arms—I ordered her to get up and dress—I then asked the prisoner to account for his time on Saturday evening—he said he was in bed between half-past 11 and 12 o'clock—I found a lot of duplicate there, not relating to this case, except one article pawned for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Saturday—while I was searching, I took from a drawer a little box—the prisoner's wife snatched it up and put it in her dress pocket—I asked what it was, and found that it was an old card of a friends' benefit society, and a contribution of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. had been paid on the Saturday night—I found also a pair of pincers, a quantity of keys, a screw-driver, and other little tools (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I was sent for to the premises where the robbery was committed on Mon<lb></lb>day morning—I saw where the entry had been been effected by the yard door—I found a hole, apparently made with an instrument like this one, outside the back-yard door—this fitted exactly in the hole that was made—I also compared the marks on the desk that was broken open, where this knife was lying, and the marks corresponded—I first noticed this card at the prisoner's lodging, when the wife snatched it up and put it in her pocket—nobody was with me at that time.</p>

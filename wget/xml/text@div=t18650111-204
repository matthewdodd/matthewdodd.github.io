I am a fishmonger, and live at 1, Andrew-court, Old Woolwich-road—on Tuesday, 3d, I was selling fish in Trafalgar-road, Greenwich—as I passed Mr. Blow's shop I saw two females standing close to the shop window—the prisoner was one—I saw the other unpin a piece of print from Mr. Blow's door and give it to the prisoner, who at it under the right-hand side of her cloak—I went over the road and stopped the prisoner—the other woman got away—I said to the prisoner, "Give that up"—she said, "Oh, Sir; Oh, Sir!"—I said, "Take it in, and I will persuade Mr. Blow to forgive you"—she said, "No, you take it in"—I said, "No; you have it, and you shall take it in"—with that, she turned round suddenly, dropped the print, and ran away—I ran after her, caught her about thirty yards off, and detained her until Mr. Blow came up.</p>

I had a mare which I turned out on the 13th of June, on the common, which is not one hundred poles from my house; she had a log on her foot to prevent her straying; I turned her out about eight in the evening, and did not miss her till between eleven and twelve o'clock next morning, when I saw her passing my house, with the prisoner on her, without either saddle, bridle, or halter; he had a stick in his hand; Pridmore and I were in the cow-house; we ran out and followed him - he was going slowly, and when I got up I asked what he was going to do with the mare; he said Oh, he was going to find the owner, or else take her to the Lord of the manor. Pridmore said I was the owner; I told him to get off four or five times, and when he did I said</p>
               <p>"What did you do with the log" he said</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is at a distance from here, I will go and fetch it," but I would not let him go; he said his master was gone on, and he must follow him; but we would not let him; we took him before a Magistrate - he then said he met three gentlemen in a chaise carl, who told him to take the first horse which he got to, and take it to St. Albans to them - but he was coming towards London; he was put into the cage and gave us the name of John Battle. Pridmore asked if his name was not Hartley, and he answered to it. I had had the mare seven years, and knew her well; I sent to the place where he said he had left the log and it was brought to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is not the prisoner an idiot? A. I know nothing of him - he was wise enough to take my horse.</p>

            . I live at South Mimms, and was with Lawrence on the morning of the 14th of June. The prisoner rode by on the mare - I said "There is your mare going by;" I have known it more than six years; we went out and stopped it: I asked what he was going to do with it - he said "I am either going to take it to the right owner, or the Lord of the manor." I said "This is the right owner;" he said "If he is the right owner he must have it." I knew a person named Hartley, who had been abroad six years, and thought, by the prisoner's appearance, that he was Hartley, but cannot say so. I heard Camfield tell him he thought he bought a cart of him six or seven years ago for 7 l., and had paid him 3 l. 10 s., but the rest was not paid; the prisoner said it was so. He said he had taken the mare out of the lane; that the log lay in the Three want way; Lawrence sent his boy for it - he brought it in about an hour and half, with the strap to it. The cow-house is about one hundred poles from the common: he said he met three gentlemen in a gig - they wished him to take the first horse or mare he could lay hold of, and bring it to them at St. Albans, and they would purchase it - but he was going a contrary way.</p>

            . I happened to be in the yard at Hadley when the prisoner was going before the Justice, and said to him</p>
               <p>"Is your name Hartley?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said he: I said,</p>
               <p>"Do you recollect some years ago buying a cart of me for 7 l.?" He said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do;" I said "Nathaniel Hartley, do you recollect paying me 3 l. 10 s. towards it?" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes;" I said</p>
               <p>"What kind of a cart was it?" he said "A blue one:" I said</p>
               <p>"Did it stand in my brother's yard at Hertford?" he said</p>
               <p>"Yes, it did." I had not seen him for five or six years. I believe he is the man who I knew by the name of Hartley - I can hardly think he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time believe he was the man? A. No, for I think he is not in his right senses - it struck me so from his answers - but it looks as if he had some knowledge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300024"></xptr>of buying the cart - but yet I do not think he is in his right senses - he said yes to whatever I asked.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked if his name was Hartley, did you believe he was the man who had had this transaction with you? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not ascertained that his name is Hartley?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know - it is well known in the neighbourhood that he says yes, to every thing he is asked.</p>

            , ESQ. I live about a mile from Potters-bar. The prisoner was in my service, and left about the second week in May; he is a poor silly fellow, laughed and jeered at by the rest. I believe him as honest a man as ever lived - he had the entire management of about one hundred ewes and rams for me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he the care of your flock? A. All last winter; he managed them and every thing they were fed with: I considered him fully capable of what he was entrusted with, and that he knew right from wrong - he knew a horse was not his property - he has been about two years in my employ.</p>

            . I am a farmer. The prisoner has been twice in my employ, and is a very honest man: I think him quite insensible, for if you tell him to do one thing he will go and do another; he came to me in July 1818, and remained till old Michaelmas, and came again on the 8th of June, this year. I found him a good deal weaker in his intellects then, and was obliged to discharge him, for he hindered the rest of the men; he offered to lend me 5 l. when I discharged him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What had he to do for you? A. Haymaking at first, and afterwards harvest work and thrashing. I considered him quite devoid of sense, and employed him from charity, but at last could do nothing with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by the Corporation of London, and by the Commissioners of Sewers, as one of the inspectors of meat in Newgate-market—I have been so twelve years—I have had considerable experience in regard to food that is brought to London in the shape of meat—on 16th February last, my attention was called to four quarters of beef which were at the shop of Messrs. Larner and Greatrex, meat salesmen, at Tylor's market—the meat was in a hamper—Mr. Greatrex had sent for me—the hamper was shut when I first saw it—they opened it to show me the meat—it had been opened before—it was not fastened in any way when I saw it—they keep a shop—it was open for the public to go in or out—in the hamper were four quarters of beef, the carcase of a cow, which were totally unfit for human food—I was there about half-past 6 o'clock in the morning, I think—business generally commences in the market about 5 o'clock—these quarters of beef were in a very bad state; what we call wet, which was, I apprehend, from disease—the fat was turned into actual serum—finding them in that state, I seized them and condemned them—part of the fat had dissolved, and by the liquid so produced the meat had become wet—that is the effect of disease—the meat was wetter than good meat would be—the whole of what ought to be fat was turned into serum—each quarter of this was dressed for the market in the usual way that good meat would have been dressed, and was packed in the hamper with cloths, in the usual way—I know the difference between tainted meat and meat bad from disease—this was not tainted—I should call this meat unusually bad—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186105050048"></xptr>
               <p>it would present some such an appearance the day before, as it presented when I saw it—it would look worse next day from having been packed; it would not look so well as it did the day before, but the general appearance of it would not be altered as to the wet and the serum—it would decidedly, in my opinion, have been in such a state the day before, that a person in the trade, a butcher, would know that it would be unfit for human food—any one with ordinary judgment, on merely looking at it, would know that it was unfit for human food; I mean a butcher, of course; one does not know that people would be sufficient judges if they were not acquainted with the business—the weather was cold at this time; it was in February—I called the attention of Mr. Newman and Dr. Lethe by to it—the hamper had no label on it—I was present and was examined at the trial of a man named Thomas Spencer at the last sitting of this Court, before Mr. Justice Williams, on Friday, 12th April—Mr. Newman and Dr. Lethe by were examined—I also heard the prisoner, Peck, examined on' behalf of Spencer.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would it make those appearances worse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would make them worse if it was packed hot—if it was wet when packed it would not be dry next day—if sound meat were packed hot it would not deteriorate the quality of that meat; it would not look so well; and it would be the same with respect to cow beef—supposing it to come up by railway with a number of other hampers placed upon it, the great heat would alter its appearance—it would depend on the weather, whether a carcase coming 100 miles, packed perfectly fresh, would be more than tainted before its arrival; in cold weather it would not, in hot weather it would—I have seen carcases arrive in a putrid state—supposing meat was washed warm, and then packed up before it was cold, it would alter the appearance, and might cause it to be tainted—I heard that it was slaughtered, not by Peck, but by a regular butcher, who stated that he ate the heart of it—supposing a butcher had killed it, a man coming in casually and seeing it hanging up, would be able to see at once what state the meat was in, after it had been washed by the butcher, merely by taking a bird's-eye view of it; he would see the quality of it; that it was unfit for market—it was about fourteen years ago that I was a butcher; I was brought up in the trade—when I saw this meat it was in the hamper—I do not know whether it had been out of the hamper—it was outside the shop by itself—there was nothing on it—it had not been exposed for sale, I believe—Greatrex and Larner are very respectable men; known to be first-rate meat salesmen—they do not buy meat at all—I know that there are persons who buy inferior meat and make it up into sausages—if there were not such customers they would not get rid of the bad meat—I. dare say a good deal is sold in London to persons who turn it into such things; I do not know, it of my own knowledge, I suppose it is so—I looked in the whole of the carcase for the fat—I looked where the fat is to be found; inside the loin, not inside the long ribs, we do not find fat there—I did not find any fat at all—I found the serum where the fat usually is—in a cow, it is in the inside of the loins or the kidneys—there was very little fat; if it had been fat it would not have been much—as there was not much fat, there was not a great deal of water.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186105050049"></xptr>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you find any liquid matter, or was it such an appearance of the meat as you supposed was the result of the diffusion of serum? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was more of a jelly than a liquid; between a jelly and a liquid, a semi-liquid—what I suppose had been fat was turned, in my judgment, into some liquid, that I call serum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there a thimbleful altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I think I might have got a good many thimblefuls—I am positive it was not the mere remainder of the washing of the cow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What quantity was there I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot state the quantity, but considerably more than one thimbleful or 100—it is my duty to check the sale of bad meat, and I do so wherever I find it—meat that gets warm in packing presents a very different appearance from that which I have described here; in that case the fat would be soft instead of hard, but there would be no liquidity—the meat did not present any appearance of taint or putridity—the whole of the flesh presented the appearance of disease—an experienced person, at all events a butcher, would see at a glance that it was diseased meat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What appearance does unsound, or comparatively unsound meat present? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It does not look so bright—the colour would not be altered materially without it was packed very hot, and that they would never do—I can hardly say how it would look if it was packed very hot—such a thing is hardly ever done with good meat—if it got over<lb></lb>heated from warm weather, it would become green and tainted—I saw nothing of that sort here—there was nothing at all of taint—if meat becomes tainted or putrid it has a smell—there was none here—the fleshy part of the meat was wet as well as the other—if there is disease that wetness would go on increasing the longer it. is kept—it must have been coming on for some considerable time; I can't form an idea how long; far beyond twenty-four hours—I should think the wetness would exist in the animal when living—in animals of that kind the carcase never gets stiff—the fat never gets set—the wetness is a consequence of disease, I should think, while the animal was living—the wetness, which is indicative of disease, would exist in the animal when alive, if it was diseased—I went to the shop of Messrs. Larner and Greatrex because I was sent for by Mr. Greatrex—they have been salesmen in the market for twenty years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am also one of the inspectors of meat appointed by the Commissioners of Sewers—on 16th February, about half-past 8 in the morning, I went to the shop of Larner and Greatrex, in Newgate-market—it is called Tylor' market—it belongs to Mr. Tylor, the brass-founder—my attention was called to a hamper of meat by my brother inspector, Mr. Fisher—there were four quarters of cow-beef in the hamper—I examined it—it was wet, diseased, and totally unfit for human food—it was a wetness from disease; not from rain or anything of that sort—it was wet all through—the word wet has a meaning in the trade—a wet one means a diseased one—when I speak of wet, I mean it was diseased all through the meat—I think that any ordinary person in the habit of seeing meat, much more a butcher, would know that it was diseased; a butcher decidedly would—I did not pull the meat out; it was in such a bad state—there was a cloth over it, and a cloth underneath at the bottom—I lifted up the cloth—supposing the cow had been killed the day before I saw it, I think the marks of disease would exist at the time the animal was killed—I have been an inspector about five years—I had been a butcher before that—the animal had been diseased for a long time, I should think, according to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186105050050"></xptr>
               <p>appearance of it—it was very bad as meat—it was not fit for human food at all—it was decidedly unwholesome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long ago is it since you were a butcher? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eleven years—I do not know what the man who sent this meat to the butcher would know about it, but the butcher who killed it would know that it was diseased, no doubt—the butcher who slaughtered it and washed it ought to know much more about it than the man who sent it to him—a person casually observing it, not taking much notice of it, would be decidedly less likely to see its diseased state than the butcher who slaughtered it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am medical officer to the City of London—on 16th February last some meat was brought to the Guildhall, where I was at the time, and I was asked to see it, by the inspectors, and I think by the Alderman on the bench—I inspected it—I think it was between 1 and 2 in the day—I had it cut, in order that I might see the condition of the flesh within the animal, and I found that it did not present that firm and solid appearance which good wholesome meat always does; the tissue was flabby, and filled with serum in the place of fat—the fat had degenerated into serum; that is, the whole of the meat had become infiltrated with a sort of serum—there was the absence of fat; but that might arise from many causes—the quantity of serum which had infiltrated the meat, was an undoubted evidence of disease; serum is produced by the degeneration of fat, and also by disease—I noticed particularly that there was on the surface of the lining mem<lb></lb>brane of the ribs, the pleura, the signs of inflammation—that is what is commonly called the lung-disease—that must have existed during the life-time of the animal, because it is an effusion which can only take place during life; it is a vital act—that trace of the inflammation seemed rather consi-derable—it existed nearly over the whole, if not the whole, surface of the pleura—I can hardly judge whether its unfitness for human food would be evident to an unpractised eye.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you explain to what extent the surface of the pleura was exposed during the time the animal was dressed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was impossible to dress the animal without seeing it—it would be seen by the butcher—it would be on the surface of the ribs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the course of your experience you have seen a great many cases of diseased meat; was this badly diseased meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very badly diseased, I think.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean unwholesome for food? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Quite so; no doubt of it; from my experience I am sure of it—it was as it were impregnated</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you of opinion that these marks of disease were existing immediately after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately before—they would show themselves after death, but would exist before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Supposing a person in the country who had never seen pneumonia, or anything of the kind, and suppose this animal had been cleaned by a butcher, and he casually saw it, would he see it at once? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You are putting a case of a butcher never having seen a case of pneumonia; such a case is hardly possible, but, of course, the man would not know what the effusion on the surface of the chest meant—this has been very common within the last three years—it has been what we term epidemic within the last three years, but sporadic before—if an animal had the seeds of disease, and had been diseased, and the appearances after death were not very great, it would depend on two circumstances whether the carcase soon became corrupt; if the animal had been feeding very recently before death, then the matter charged with the recently absorbed fat, would, in the case of disease, quickly become corrupt; that is, in the case of inflammation—that would be putrefaction, but we must not confound that with disease—I could tell pretty well what advance the disease had made, without seeing the lungs, from the extent of the inflammation on the surface of the pleura, which is the last part to be attacked—no doubt the lungs must have been extensively diseased—the heart and the inner membrane of, the chest are both lined by the pleura—the disease attacks the lungs, and when it has pervaded the lungs then it affects the pleura, and that is the part that is in the carcase—I do not ordinarily expect the pleura to be affected until the lungs have been—the man who cleaned them and took them out would see that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Of course you have seen putrid and tainted meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; this was not at all putrid or tainted; it was very fresh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Just explain what is the character of putrid bar tainted meat; is it a discolouration or smell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; there are two things, first, the appearance of it, it is flabby, and it becomes darker coloured—those are the two appearances, and it evolves an unpleasant door, varying from what we call taint merely, up to actual putrefaction—I infer from the appearances I saw on the pleura the existence of disease to a considerable extent, if not of long standing—if I had not seen the pleura at all, I should have said that it was a diseased animal—I could not have said what the disease was; but seeing the pleura affected, I could also say, not only it was diseased, but the character of that disease—I could tell, without the indications of the pleura, that it was diseased, as distinguished from taint—the appearances I saw must have existed some time before death, for this reason, that the tissue of the animal was degenerated; a thing that cannot happen after death; it must have arisen from disease before death—the muscular tissue of a sound animal is firm, dark coloured, well set; that is a condition of health—in disease we find the fibre of the muscles to be weak, never contracting or becoming rigid, and it is infiltrated with the serum infused into it during life; and it is therefore gelatinous and flabby, and pale coloured, which is never the character of putrefaction—that arises from disease in life—in other words these are vital appearances, not <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances—they require some vital power to set up and go on, and when the vital power ceases they remain—I think it impossible for a butcher to have had his attention directed to it, if he had any experience whatever, without being at once satisfied that there was disease—I now speak of the</p>

               <p>flesh of the animal, without regard to the tissue—looking at the fleshy part of the animal, there must have been such an indication of disease as a good butcher, with an opportunity of examination, would discover it—I think so decidedly; there is no doubt about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years of age. On the evening of 18th Aug. I was near St. Clement's Church, in the Strand—the prisoner accosted me; he said it had been a nice day—I replied, "Yes, but it is very close"—he then said, "Have you ever seen this down here?"—I said, "What?—he said, "If you will come down, I will show you"—he went down Milford Lane, and I went with him—alter I had got to the bottom, there was a turn round, and I said to the prisoner, "I shall not go any further"—that was in Water Street—he said, "Here you are at a street in the Strand"—before I got into Water Street, a tipsy man turned before us, and when I got into Water Street, he ran against me, and knocked me down, and the prisoner and the other man held me down by the throat while they took my watch—I am quite certain the prisoner assisted the other man in holding me down; while they were doing it, the prisoner went to the corner to see if any one was coming, and he said, "Have you got it, have you got it? make haste!"—the moment they got it, the man threw me with great force against a step, to stun me, but I did not fall—I followed him—I was hurt in the throat and the face—I do not</p>

On 18th Aug., about half past 9 o'clock at night, I was in a room which overlooks Water Street—I heard a scuffle, opened the window, looked out, and saw a young man, who I believe was the prosecutor; a man had got him by the throat, and was in the act of throwing him on a step—I was not able to see that man sufficiently to know him—I could only see his back—I heard the young man say, "I will give it you, if you will let me go"—the watch was thrown, and it flew open—I went down stairs afterwards, and picked up a cap und a watch glass, which I delivered to the inspector.</p>

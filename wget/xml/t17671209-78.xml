On the 23d of November our carman found a large piece of hard soap put up in a corner in the cellar just by the prisoner's great coat; we let it abide, to see who would take it away, as things had often been missing; when the prisoner had done his work, he carried his coals down, and put on his great coat; and when going out of the shop we took him into the compting house, and charged him with having a piece of soap in his pocket; in turning his apron aside, there was a quantity of cocoa in his great coat-pocket, and two or three pieces of candle in a paper; in the other pocket was half a pound of chocolate, and two single pounds of lump sugar; we sent for Mr.

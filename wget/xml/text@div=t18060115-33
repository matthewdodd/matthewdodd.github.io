On the 1st of this month, about five o'clock in the afternoon I met the prisoner in Thames-stret, he was coming from the warehouse, he had a bag full of sugar on his shoulder, I asked him what he had got, where he was going, and where he had brought it from, to each of my questions he seemed greatly confused, and said, I do not know, I cannot tell; I then said to him, I am afraid there is some bad work going on, come back with me to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go back with you? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Before he went back with you, while you were talking with him, did you observe any thing in his hands? - A. He had a piece of white paper swinging in his hands.</p>
               <p>Q. When he returned with you to the warehouse, did you find the warehouse door open or shut? - A. I found the door a-jarr, and no person in the lower part of the warehouse; he immediately threw down the bag, and attempted to run away, I immediately sprang after him, I called out Stop thief, overtook him, and brought him back into the counting house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you by that time examined the bag to find what was contained in it? - A. I had put my hand on the bag in the street, when I addressed myself to him, and asked him what he had got, and when I interrogated him in the warehouse, as I had done in the street, he said, If I must tell, Joseph (who is another porter in the warehouse) helped me up with the bag, and we were going to make a property of it. A constable was then sent for and he was apprehended. Joseph, was called in, but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180601150029"></xptr>he refused to make any answer. The bag of sugar is here.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the weight of it? - A. About one hundred pound weight and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. About five pounds; the prisoner had been with us about eight or ten years.</p>
               <p>- PEARSON sworn. Examined by Mr. Gurney. I produce the bag of sugar it has been in my care ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Mr Severn) What sugar is it? - A. It is East India sugar purchased from the East India company, the number on the bag is 1146, placed there by the officer of the East India company.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that it belongs to your house? - A. I have no doubt but it belongs to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. Just open the bag? - A. (The bag opened) It is sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. What wages had the prisoner? - A. One pound a week.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, nor called any witness to character.</p>

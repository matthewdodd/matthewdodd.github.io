                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 285) On the morning of 24th August, at 3.30, I was in Skinner Street, Bishopsgate—I saw the prisoner there, lying on the ground, his head was on the edge of the kerb and his body and legs in the carriage-way, so that if a carriage came along he must have been run over—I went up to him, with another officer, and we took hold of each side of his arm and tried to lift him up—he appeared as if he had been drinking a little, but he was not drunk—he said he had been knocked about by four other constables, and he was not going to stand it any longer—he gave me a violent blow with his fist in the chest—I took hold of him to prevent his violence, and he got his hand in my belt and pulled me to the ground—he took his knife from his pocket and opened it—he was on the top of me—he stabbed me three times in the left breast—I was wearing this coat and a padded waistcoat, and the knife did not penetrate to the flesh—I got him off me and he struck me a blow with the knife, on the kneecap, it cut through my trousers and cut my leg—it bled—we took him to the station, with assistance—he was very violent all the way.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I took the knife out to cut my necktie, as he was choking me, not to stab him.</p>

               <p>and one the other—I gently shook him, and when he woke up he struck at White—he got up and struck White in the chest and they both fell, when the prisoner got up I saw he had a kuife in his hand—I said "Look out, he has got a knife"—I struck him on the chest and knocked him down, and while he was on the ground I got the knife out of his hand—we got him up and took him to the station—he was violent.</p>

We lost the stockings on the 25th of May, between four and five in the afternoon. The prisoner Williams came into out shop, asked for some silk stockings with cotton feet and tops; I shewed her some; she said she wanted some with silk clocks. In the mean time the prisoner Cook came in, and said she wanted some black worsted stockings at about eighteen-pence; I shewed her some; she asked for some about a shilling; I told Williams I had got none with clocks. She told me to shew her some plain, about nine shillings or half a guinea; I could not find any of that price; I shewed her some at fourteen shillings, and then looked for some black silk stockings for Cook; I found I had not got any. I told her I had got none at a shilling; she did not go out of the shop. A parcel of white cotton stockings were loose upon the counter, underneath the flap of the counter, which turns down, and while I was turning my back the prisoner Cook must have taken two pair.</p>
               <p>Q. Why must she have taken it - A. She had got out of the shop, and the officer dragged her in, and took her into the parlour.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 25th of May, in the afternoon I was going up Holborn in company with Brown; I observed the prisoner Cook looking in the gentleman's shop-window, with a bundle in her hand; immediately after I saw the prisoner Williams pass behind her, and go into the shop, and Cook followed her; we waited about five minutes, and saw Cook come out of the shop; she had one hand under her apron, apparently with something in it; I took hold of her, told her she must go back to the shop, I suspected she had something. I put my hand to take what was under her apron; she struggled to get away; I took these two pair of stockings from under her apron. I took her back into the shop; she denied knowing any thing about them. There are the two pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 25th, I observed Cook standing at Mr. Chauncer's window with a bundle under her arm, and an umbrella behind her in her right hand; the prisoner Williams almost immediately passed her behind, took the umbrella from her, and went in at the door. Cook followed her into the shop; Cook came out, Branscomb followed her to Bartlett's-buildings, and finding her struggling with Branscomb I took her in custody, and took her back into the shop; Williams was then sitting there, and the umbrella leaning against the counter. I searched them, and on the prisoner I found this new silk handkerchief.</p>

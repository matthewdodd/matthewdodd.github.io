            . I am clerk to Mr. Mason. On Friday last, I was in the warehouse; I saw the prisoner coming out of the cellar with a bundle in a bag - I opened the warehouse-door, and asked, what he had got; he made no reply - I followed him to the street, and when he got about six yards from the outer gate, he threw down the bag with its contents, and ran off; I pursued and brought him back - I did not lose sight of him; I brought him and the paper back to the office.</p>

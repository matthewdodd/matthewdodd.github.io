               <p>Q. Did you see part of the harness, the back-bands, produced by your master, about the middle of the day after? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. In consequence of information I received of Gregory, of the stable having been broke open, I was walking round my farm the next day, about twelve o'clock, and heard a noise in the mill; I went and opened the door, and there I found the prisoner at the bar with a basket in his hand; I asked him what he was doing there; he said he was getting some chips; he said that the workmen had gone from the mill, and they had given him leave; he said he had a basket full of chips; I said, the workmen cannot have given you leave, because there have been no workmen here for these six months; then he took his basket, and was going out.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he get in; was the door locked? - A. To the best of my knowledge it was locked; I had been round before, and I did not see it was broke open, and when I came there this day, it appeared to have been broke open, but the door was put to. I saw in his basket the handle of a a tool; I said, Smith, you have got some tools as well as chips; I must search your basket, and see what you have got; he said I should not, and resisted me; I pulled the basket from him, and turned out a large axe concealed among the wood; on my examining it, he took up the basket and was going off; I said to him, I shall see the bottom of it; he said there was nothing in it but some wood; on turning out what was at the bottom of the basket, I found four pieces of leather; I said it was very much like my harness that was stolen last night, you shall go with me, and we will compare it with that which is left; he said he would not, and we had a scuffle; he kicked, and tried all he could to get away from me; he said he had got a wife and six children, and begged I would not detain him; I took him by the collar, and brought him home by force, and examined the pieces; they tallied with what was left in the stable, and I have no doubt but they are part of the same harness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I came from Rumford at almost half an hour after six o'clock, and was going round the premises, when I was told to take the bits of wood up, and among the rest I took these bits of leather, which the man gave to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where is that man? - A. I never saw that man before; he appeared to be a carpenter.</p>

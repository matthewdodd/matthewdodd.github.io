                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty about half-past three o'clock in the morning of the 9th of May, in Brydges-street, Covent-garden, and heard a disturbance in York-street—I went there, and found from twelve to fourteen <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> drivers assembled, quarrelling—I did not notice the prisoner among them at the time—I desired them to go to their <hi rend="italic">cabs.</hi> which were on the stand, which they did—I walked up the rank, and saw the prisoner standing at a horse's head of one of the <hi rend="italic">cabs.</hi> with no</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was attracted by the noise, and came up—I found the prisoner lying on his back on the ground, and the prosecutor on him—I saw him strike the prosecutor with the scissors on the chin—he bled profusely—I immediately seized his arm, and attempted to rescue the scissors from his grasp—I ultimately succeeded in doing it, after a good deal of violence on his part—he attempted to stab me two or three times—we at last got him to the station-house—he was very violent, and assaulted a constable there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker of 114, High-street, Poplar—on Satur<lb></lb>day evening, 28th September, about half-past 8 o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop, asked for a half-quartern loaf, and tendered me a shilling—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—as soon as he was gone I found it was bad,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186110210016"></xptr>
               <p>and went in search of him—I found him about ten doors off, entering Mr. Hogmire's, a butcher's shop—he bought a piece of meat—I was then in the middle of the road—he came out and joined another man, who was standing outside holding the loaf, while the prisoner went into the butcher's—the pri<lb></lb>soner then placed the meat with the loaf in the handkerchief—the other man gave the prisoner something out of his waistcoat pocket—the prisoner then went to the corner of Robin Hood-lane, where I met a policeman and gave him in charge for passing bad money—he said, "I know nothing about it"—he was taken to the station—I went with him, and said to the inspector in his presence, "This is the man who passed one to me on the night of the 14th"—the prisoner then shammed deaf, and never answered—he was silent—I remember the prisoner being in my shop on the night of the 14th—he gave me a bad shilling for a half-quartern loaf—I kept the bad shilling in my waistcoat pocket, and gave them both to the policeman on the 28th—I marked them.</p>

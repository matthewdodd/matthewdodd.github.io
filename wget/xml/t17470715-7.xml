            . On the 29th of June , I was going out of Fore-street, and I saw this Low come out of my Master's Yard, with an Iron belonging to a Chimney, and cross garnet Hinges ; I asked him who delivered that Iron to him, and he said Peter delivered it to him; I presently after met with Peter, and asked him whether he delivered any Iron to anybody, he said no; I told him I had met a Man with Iron, so we pursued him down Moor-lane; I described the Man to him, and he said, I have seen one Low lurking about my Master's Yard several times ; I said if I could ever see him I should know him, but they knew him better than I; they took him under a Lamp , and when I saw his Face, I knew it was the same; he was carried to the Watch-house , where his Wife came to him, and was very sorry, and would have had him to have asked his Master's Pardon; so I said to his Wife, if you will go along with us, we will see you home; so I goes home with her , and looking under the Bed, there we found a Board , which we carried to my Master's Yard, and there was a Stock that it belonged too; he said at one time he had the Board a Year, then Half a Year, and he told me at the Compter , that he had a Month .</p>

               <p>Mon. On the 29th of June our Journeyman met him with Iron upon his Shoulder, and he told the Man that I had given it to him; but I gave him none. So we went directly in pursuit after him, and took him in Angel Alley : His Wife came there, and we went home with her, and found the Board under his Bed and the Chest of Drawers , and we had a great deal of trouble to get out the Board . He said he had had it a Twelvemonth , then Half a Year, and a Month at last.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, I never said any such Thing , I found the Board standing at the dead Wall by Moorgate . I have a Witness to prove, that I was in another Place all the Day long.</p>

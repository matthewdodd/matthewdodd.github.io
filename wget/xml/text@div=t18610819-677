                  </hi>. I am senior clerk in the General Post-office—the prisoner was a sorter and letter-carrier at the Peckham office, and had been engaged there about twelve months—I received instructions to make up a test letter, and on 16th July made up a letter to Mrs. Smith, Grove-villas, Camden<lb></lb>grove, Peckham, and placed in it two half-sovereigns—there was no Mrs. Smith at that address—I do not know whether I addressed it—I fastened it—on the morning of the 17th I gave that letter to Mr. Clare that he might post it, and in the afternoon I received information and went to the post<lb></lb>office at Peckham—the prisoner was brought there by Bingham at half-past 2—I told him that a money-letter, addressed Mrs. Smith, Grove-villas, Camden-grove, Peckham, was missing, and asked him if he knew anything about it—he put his hand in a pouch which he had over his shoulder, and handed me the letter—I asked him how he accounted for the possession of it; he said, "I did not know I had it till I got out with my letters; I found it in the middle"—I said, "Did not you arrange your letters "for delivery before you left the office?"—he said, "I did"—I said, "This letter is not in your delivery; how did it get amongst your letters?"—he said, "I do not know, I did not put it there"—Bingham then took him in custody—he was searched at the office, and I saw the keys taken from his pocket—this letter was not in his delivery, and he should have given it to the proper letter-carrier, who delivers letters in Camden-road, or sorted it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. From instructions I received, I watched the prisoner on his delivery on 17th August, and about half-past 2, when he had finished, I took him to the post-office at Peckham—I searched him by Mr. Gardiner's directions, and found these keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in his breeches pocket—he went with me to his lodging, at his father's, in John-street, Commercial-road, Peckham, and he and his father and mother took me up into his bedroom—I said, "Which is your box?" and he pointed it out,</p>

               <p>and his mother also—I unlocked it with one of these keys, and found this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and a cheque on the City Bank for three guineas, drawn by Mr. Ford, and payable to 153 or bearer—I found this gold locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in the box—I asked him if he could give any account of the cheque being in his possession, but he gave no answer—his father also asked him, and he gave no answer.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner with the basket in Bond-street; I followed him to King-street, there I met a young man with a barrow of bread; he and I went up to the prisoner. The prisoner seemed frightened; he asked, if we wanted the basket. We said, we wanted him and the basket too. I asked him, where he was going with it. He said to a chandler's shop a long way off there. There were five quartern loaves in the basket, and six halves.</p>

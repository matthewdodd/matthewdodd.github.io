                  </hi>. I am a draper, and live in High-street, Whitechapel. I came home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, about two o'clock, in the night of the 16th of June—I got out in Whitechapel, at the Horse and Leaping Bar, opposite my house—I had a glass of brandy and water—when I came out I was accosted by the two prisoners and others—they took me to a house in Duke-street—I was in liquor—I had a watch, a hat, a neck handkerchief, and two account-books—when the policeman came he found me on the floor, and my property was all gone—I have not seen the hat and handkerchief since—these are the other things.</p>

                  </hi>. Mrs. Morris, who keeps a lodging-house, came to me for a candle to light her to bed—she said, "I wish you would go and see if my place is all right"—I went, and saw the prosecutor lying across the floor, without a coat, hat, or cravat—two girls, I believe to be the prisoners, were with him—Ellis said they had got a <hi rend="italic">bloak</hi>, and he had got no money, that he had been knocked down in Whitechapel.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable H</hi> 177.) I was called by Baldwin—the prosecutor's coat, hat, and cravat were all gone—the prisoners were with him—Ellis was just rising up from him as he laid on the floor—she took off the floor these books, and gave me—I found the watch in her shawl, which I found between the bed and the wall, after I had taken them to the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Ellis's Defence.</hi> He was lying down by a court; I spoke to him; he went down the court, and agreed to give me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the whole night; he had got no money; his two books and collar of his shirt were lying down by his side; I picked them up and gave them to him; I endeavoured to pick him up, but was not able. When Baldwin came in, she said, "What is the mat<lb></lb>ter?" I said, "I have a tipsy man, and he has no money;" they called in the policeman; he came, and could find nothing; then they took me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Jones's Defence.</hi> We saw him lying down; we went up; he got up, and agreed to go with Ellis. He had got no money. The landlady came in, and said, "Oh, what are you doing with the man?" and she called the police.</p>

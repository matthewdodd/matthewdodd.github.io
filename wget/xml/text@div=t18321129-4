On Tuesday, the 20th of November, I left the house at two o'clock in the afternoon - I locked the door, and the windows were closed; I left nobody in the house - I left my watch hanging on a shelf - it is a large silver case watch, with a blue ribbon, and two keys to it; I came back at three o'clock, and before I got to my door I saw the window had been moved, and ajar; one side of it was pushed in; it was a sliding sash - I am sure it was fast when I went out: I unlocked the door, went in, and my watch was gone - I saw fresh footmarks from the window towards the shelf, and marks of one foot on a chair by the window; I looked outside, and there were marks on the window where they had jumped up; there was the print of a nail in the heel of one shoe, and part of a tip of the other; there were only two marks - there were no nails in the front of the shoe; the marks were quite fresh - I saw the prisoner about twenty minutes after two o'clock, fifty or sixty yards from my house; he lives at the end of the buildings, near me - directly I missed my watch I went to look after him, and about seven o'clock next morning I found him laying in a barn on the top of some beans; I took him to the window, and measured his shoe with the footmarks on the ground - I did not take his shoe off; the marks were just the length of the shoe - there were nails on one side of the heel of one shoe, and on part of the tip of the other - one of his shoes had a whole tip on the heel, and there were marks of that whole tip, and the other had half a tip, and there was a mark of that; I saw my watch again last Thursday afternoon.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live at Vine-street, Uxbridge. I was at play with Lipscomb, on Tuesday, the 20th of November, by the church-yard, and saw the prisoner there; I never saw him before - I said to Lipscomb, "I wonder what it is o'clock," and the prisoner pulled out a watch, and said it was five minutes past four o'clock; the clock struck four at the time - he opened the watch-glass, and put it to his ear; the watch had a kind of a blue ribbon, which had something on it - I am not sure whether it was seals or keys.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old, and live at Vine-street. I was at play with Southam; he asked what o'clock it was - I saw the prisoner there; I did not know him before - he came to my father's about a black bitch, and staid there some time; when Southam asked the time the prisoner pulled a watch out of his pocket - the clock was just striking four, and he said it was five minutes after four by his watch; he opened the glass of the watch, and put it up to his ear - it was a large silver watch; I cannot say whether it had a string or what to it.</p>

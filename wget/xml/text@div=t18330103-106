I had reason to suppose my shop was being plundered, and had some of my servants taken into custody, and among the rest, Jones, the cook; the prisoner came to the house door on the 1st of December, to see the cook - I called her into the counting-house, and told her I had been robbed, and Jones and Fudger were in custody; I told her I had always had a good opinion of her, and begged her to tell me of any circumstance that she knew of while she was in my service - she denied knowing any thing about the robbery; I do not remember her words, but it was to that effect - she appeared to be flurried, and I told her to walk up into the kitchen, and sit down, as I had no wish to take her by surprise; she went up stairs, and I sent for the two-officers - I went up stairs with them, and told the prisoner I had then given her an hour to consider of it, and I begged to know if she still persisted in what she had formerly said; she still denied it - some other conversation took place, which I do not remember, and I gave her to the officers; I afterwards told her, that if she even had some of our property, if her account was found perfectly correct, and she would give a full statement of all she knew (or words to that effect), that I would not press the case against her - but if, on the officers searching her boxes, any articles were found, she must take the consequences - I am sure I said "on searching her boxes;" I had not then discovered any thing against her - she went away with the officers, and on the officers return they produced some property, which I could identify.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You had a person named Steane in your service? A. Yes, he was convicted on Saturday, and my cook and porter are now indicted; my suspicions arose on the 28th of November - I had no suspicion when she left me; Steane was a confidential person, and if he or any of the servants were ill, they had medicine free of expence.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You did not receive information till the 28th of November? A. No; the prisoner had the means of taking articles; I could not miss a few articles in my trade.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had Steane and Fudger more to do with the shop than the prisoner? A. Yes; they were employed only in the shop.</p>

I went with Goddard to Mr. Gray on the 1st of December; I heard Mr. Gray tell the prisoner he had been robbed, and he wished her to say whether she knew any thing about it - she said No; he then asked if she had taken any thing - she said No; he said two or three times over, that if she had, and would tell him, he would not press the case against her; but if any thing should be found hereafter, that she must not expect any consideration, or any mercy from him; I will not be sure whether he mentioned her boxes or not; I then took her into custody - I told her we must go home and search her boxes; she walked on to Rochester-street, in the lower part of Westminster, and we followed her - she turned into a house; we went into the kitchen, and saw her aunt - she had before told us she was stopping with her aunt; she asked her aunt for a light, and said we were come to search her boxes - a light was got, and we went to the front room, on the first floor; she then took a key from her pocket, opened two boxes, and we found these articles.</p>

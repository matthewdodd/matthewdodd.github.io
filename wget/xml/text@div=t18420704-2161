                  </hi>. I am a professor of music. On Tues<lb></lb>day evening, the 5th of July, about twelve o'clock, I was going along the Borough, and in Blackman-street was accosted by the prisoner—she came and caught hold of my arm, and asked me to give her some money—I took my purse out, gave her 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and put my purse back into my left-hand pocket—I then walked on with her—she kept clinging hold of my arm for some distance—about two minutes after I put my hand again into my pocket, (I do not know what impulse of the moment induced me to do so,) and found my purse was gone—I walked on some twenty or thirty yards further, and met a policeman—I did not make any complaint till I saw him; I then gave her into custody—I saw my purse afterwards—it was picked up about a yard from where I charged her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I met the gentleman; he gave me two glasses of gin, brought me back again to Blackman-street, and took me to a stable-yard; all I had was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for going up the yard. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I deny it altogether—I am positive she took my purse from me—there was no one else near.</p>

About half-past twelve o'clock I was walking up Blackman-street—the prisoner and prosecutor both came up to me together—he said, "I give this girl in charge for rob<lb></lb>bring me of a purse and its contents, a sovereign and some silver"—I took the prisoner—the moment I did so, the man she lives with came up and began to jostle us—I said to the prosecutor, "The purse is here some<lb></lb>where, I know"—she kept making signs to the kennel—I turned my lamp round, three females came up, and said, "Here is the purse"—I picked it up about a yard from where I took her into custody, and asked the prosecutor if it was his purse—he said it was—this is it—the prosecu<lb></lb>tor was quite sober.</p>

            . This coat and waistcoat hung inside the shop. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner loitering about the window alone, then saw him come into the door-way, and handle them as a customer would - he went away, returned in about ten minutes, and looked through the shop window, I went out over the way to watch, and saw him go to the door way, and come out again, and about a quarter past four o'clock, he went to the door, cut the string, and took the coat and waistcoat - I ran over immediately, and secured him. They cost 32 s.</p>

            . I had the care of Mrs Jones' place. On last Sunday, in the afternoon, I went to the door for a little air for five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went a little way from the door, and left the door - A. Yes, upon my return in the house I found the prisoner on the stairs, I called him down and asked him what he wanted; he said that he had mistaken the house, and when he passed me I perceived he had a bundle under his arm; I then called for assistance; he walked leisurely down the court; I begged a gentleman standing at a door to stop him, or send somebody; he sent somebody. The prisoner was out of my sight before he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that was stopped and brought back was the same man that you saw come down the stairs - A. Yes, and the bundle was brought back with him; after the man was brought back; I went up into the room, I perceived four shirts, five handkerchiefs, and a shift body had been removed, and the bundle that the man was brought back with, contained them articles. The prisoner then asked for forgiveness.</p>

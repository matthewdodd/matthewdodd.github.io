               <p>Q. Were you in Wellclose-square any time in the month of May - A. Yes, on the 11th of May, between nine and ten at night, I was coming through the square; the prisoner run against me; I rather rebounded him from me; then he said, God bless me, it is Mr. Smith; he shook hands with me, and asked me if I had my little horse; I told him, no. He then said, do not you remember

             that lived in the Highway. I said, I do not recollect you now, you do not follow butchering. No, said he; he said he worked at the India House. He then said, we have not seen one another a good while, shall we go and have something to drink. He took me by the arm; we went up Graces-alley, into a public-house at the end of White Lion-street, to have something to drink. We had two pints of beer there; we sat facing one another. I stopped in the house about ten minutes; we drank the beer; I got up to go home. I put my hand into my pocket to pay for the beer. I pulled my pocket-book out. I then took a shilling out to pay for the beer; I put my pocket-book in again; then directly I came to the door to go home; he said he was going my way home, he would go with me. He took me by the left arm, and we went up White Lion-street. On the left hand side there was a great deal of scaffolding; they had been repairing five or six houses; we went in and out of the scaffolding several times, and people run against me I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. You say he had hold of your left arm - A. Yes, and I had hold of my umbrella in my right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had no hand at liberty to guard your pockets - A. No. When we had cleared the scaffolding about ten yards he decamped all at once; he said, there, and when I had walked about ten yards by myself, as near as I can guess, I clapped my hand, I missed my pocket-book immediately. I cannot swear he took it.</p>

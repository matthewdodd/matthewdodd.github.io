             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gleed. I am an officer of Bow-street: On the 12th of May, in consequence of information, I went with Ruthven, Bacon, and Gibbs, to the house of the prisoner, No. 11, Church-street, St. John's church, I think, about twelve o'clock in the forenoon; I directed Bacon to knock at the door, he knocked twice, I believe; it was sometime before the door was opened; it was opened by the prisoner; I went into the passage immediately, and desired the prisoner and Nixon to go up into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. Nixon is the man who was afterwards discharged? - A. Yes; I immediately proceeded to search the house with Bacon, but smelling a great smell of sulphur, we went up stairs; seeing nothing in any of the rooms up stairs, we immediately came down into the kitchen, where we found these articles, (producing a basket full); upon the kitchen table were these two instruments, which are used in an engine for cutting blanks; upon the nob of the grate, by the side of the fire-place, I found this crucible; it was whole when I found it; I broke it to get the metal out.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the crucible made of? - A. Earthenware; it was so hot, I could not take it in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in that sort of fluid state that you could have poured it out? - A. I cannot say; for while the door was opened, it might have cooled; upon the water cistern in the kitchen, in a bag, I found a great quantity of blanks for shillings and sixpences, some of the colour of copper, and others nearly of the colour of silver; close by the side of the grate I found this stick, which appeared to have been used, and this sand paper, these filings, this pot of blacking, and these tongs; I then went to the front parlour, where I had left the prisoner, and upon the table, when I first went in, I found some filings in this box; upon searching the bureau, I found this small crucible, this cecil, and these three pieces of composition, resembling money; one of them is the colour and size of a half-guinea; in the front garret I found this shovel, this ingot mould, and some files.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dress? - A. In a working dress; he had a drab-coloured jacket on; I believe this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Let me look at those cutters; I believe you know perfectly well these cannot be used without a fly? - A. No doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore no blanks could have been cut out of this cecil without the assistance of a fly? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, with the implements you found, this cecil could not have been produced? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe they are both new, and appear never to have been used? - A. They appear to be new.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no difficulty of access to the house? - A.Bacon knocked a second time, just as we were going to break open the window; when I got to the window; the door was immediately opened.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no aquafortis? - A. None at all.</p>
               <p>Q. The smell that you spoke of, was a sulphurous smell, and not at all like aquafortis? - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. You found no mould for the casting of blanks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no instrument found, by which the shillings could have been either cast or stamped? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Q. A fly, I believe, is not necessary for the purpose of colouring base metal? - A. No.</p>
               <p>ARCHIBALD RUTHVEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I was with Sayers on the 12th of May: Bacon knocked at the door twice or thrice before it was opened, I am not certain which.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he knock pretty loud? - A. Yes; when the door was opened, I saw the prisoner in a working dress, he had on this jacket.(Producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of his hands? - A. His hands seemed rather dirtyish, Nixon was there; I searched him, and found some money and Banknotes, all of which were good; I did not search the prisoner, it was either Bacon or Gibbs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are not so foolish, when you apprehend any body, to give intimation of your coming? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the prisoner had no intimation the Bow-street officers were about to apprehend him for high treason? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You found the jacket upon him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was about eleven o'clock? - A. It was in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200055"></xptr>Q. It is a very common thing for a man to wear a light jacket in the morning, before he dresses himself to go out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear his hands were dirty in that sort of way that he had used these sort of metals necessary for coining? - A. I will swear they were in a dirtyish state.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not hear Carpmeal say at Bow-street, that his hands were clean, not dirty? - A. I did not hear him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Carpmeal was not at the house, and therefore knew nothing about it? - A. Yes, he was.</p>

             sworn. - I went to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe his hands? - A. No; I went up to the door of the house with a book under my arm, and knocked three times at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of knocks were they? - A. Pretty smart knocks, such as might be heard all over the house; after I had knocked three times, the prisoner at the bar opened the door, Nixon was in the passage, just behind him; I immediately went across the passage, and went up stairs to the front garret; we smelt a very nasty smell upon the staircase as we were going up, a kind of sulphurous smell; Sayers said, there is a furnace here somewhere; we then returned into the kitchen, and found two sieves, and a sand paper in one of them, this butter boat, with bread crumbs in them; there were several files, and a pair of pincers; I found this apron in the kitchen, it appears to be eat up almost with something; and here are a pair of thumb-stalls that I found upon the kitchen shelf.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that paper? - A. It is base metal, shaped like shillings and sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in your judgment in a state fit for circulation? - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these, and say what they are? - A. Some of them are shaped like shillings, but not coloured.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bag? - A. They are pieces of metal resembling shillings and sixpences not compleat; they would require the process of colouring to make them fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these three pieces, one of them having the resemblance of a half-guinea, and the other a foreign coin, are they counterfeit? - A. The half-guinea is a counterfeit; as to the others, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long have you been employed in this way? - A. Nine or ten years.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you have conducted these prosecutions for Mr. Vernon for a great number of years? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the process by which this is to be attained? - A. I have seen the articles and the money, and I will state the process which I believe to have been made use of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you ever see the manufacture compleated, or have you ever manufactured any yourself? - A. I have one in my pocket, that I have finished myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Look at these blanks? - A. These blanks have been cast in a mould; after they are cast, there is a considerable quantity of metal round the edge, which is called the spray, and the surfaces are extremely rough; therefore the first thing necessary with respect to the edge, is to clip the spray round with a pair of scissars; this pair of scissars, which have been produced, will answer the purpose; the next process will be to file the edges and the surface with files; here is a file, which is produced, which is the proper sort of file to be used on that occasion.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are the files any other than common files? - A. No, they might be used for any other purpose; the next thing to be done would be to take the scratches out with sand-paper; some of this sand-paper appears to have been used, and some not; the chief part of the blanks in the bag appear to have undergone the process I have described; the next thing will be to colour them; those that I have now in my hand have been coloured, and are fit for circulation; the preparation for colouring them would be a solution of silver in aquafortis, made into a paste, with the addition of cream of tartar; that being applied upon the surface of the blank, and to the edges, the next thing would be to put them into a strong pickle of aquafortis alone, which would six the colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that be done without a fire? - A. They might afterwards have the addition of fire and heat, but that is sometimes omitted; then they are put into water, with an equal quantity of salt and cream of tartar, boiled over the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. In what kind of vessel? - A. Any kind of vessel, boiler, or pipkin; that brings the colour a great deal fresher; they might then he heated over<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200056"></xptr>the fire in a shovel similar to this, this appears to have been much heated over the fire; they are then taken out, and scowered with fine powder of cream of tartar; they have then a bright silver colour, too bright for circulation; then the next thing is to apply what is called the blacking, which is a composition of mutton fat, bees wax, and lamp black, melted and incorporated together over the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that blacking? - A. This appears to be the stuff that I am speaking of; this is the sort of thing that it is generally done in; rubbing the money with a piece of it, dulls the brightness, and makes it fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that butter boat, and tell us what it contains? - A. It contains butter crumbs of bread; I forgot to mention that after they are scowered with cream of tartar, they are thrown into cold water, and then, in order to dry them, they are often shook up in a cloth with burnt bran, or burnt crumbs of bread.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us, aquafortis was absolutely necessary for colouring? - A. Yes; it cannot be done without it; after they have been rubbed with the crumbs of bread, they are put into a sieve, to separate the bread from the coin; this sieve would answer that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that stick, at the end of the stick, and tell us whether there is any appearance upon the stick of its having being used with aquafortis? - A. I saw this stick on the evening of the day the prisoner was apprehended, at Bow-street, it then smelled very strong of aquafortis, the end of the stick was quite soft; such a stick as this, most probably, would be used in a process of this sort, it is for turning them round in the pickle after they have been washed with the solution of silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us if you can discover from the appearance of that apron as if there had been aquafortis upon it? - A. Aquafortis would have this effect upon it; here are a pair of pliers that would be necessary to hold the money during the process of filing and rubbing it with sand-paper, and it appears to have been very much used.</p>
               <p>Q. You have in your left-hand some file-dust, is that file-dust of metal? - A. It is correspondent with the metal of which the blanks are made.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the contents of that basket? - A. Here is cecil, the refuse of the cuttings; and a crucible for melting metal; the metal is first melted in a crucible, then run into an ingot mould, and flatted in a mill, this mould would answer the purpose; here is a blank, which was delivered to me by one of the officers, upon which I tried the process that I have been describing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Though a very honest man, you have proved yourself a very good coiner, in theory and in practice; there are a great many things necessary that you have not enumerated to-day? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. In the commencement of the process, you told us it is necessary to use files? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not the most usual way not to use files, but to use bags, in which they are moved backwards and forwards? - A. I cannot say, I never heard of that; they are shook backwards and forwards after they are coloured with bran.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated aquafortis as necessary? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. A stick has been produced here which you suppose to have been used with aquafortis? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where one of the component parts is silver, is not aquafortis used to throw the silver upon the surface? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that sixpence? - A. That appears to me to be cast metal.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Suppose there was, in that cast metal, any composition of silver, would aquafortis alone extract that silver upon the surface? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You yourself procured elsewhere, and not at the prisoner's house, the ingredients with which you made the mixture, with which you tried this experiment? - A. Yes; the principal thing will be aquafortis.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no aquafortis found, nor cream of tartar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any solution of silver found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Your hands are very black, was that by the process upon that shilling? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you cannot get it off? - A. I have not had an opportunity of using that that would be necessary for the purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. If a man is taken in the act of colouring he cannot get rid of it? - A. No, certainly not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What do you think would take it off? - A. A little salt and vinegar.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I live in Church-street, Mill-bank-street, Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know No. 11, Church-street? - A. Yes; that is my house; the prisoner at the bar is my tenant; he has the whole house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. What other persons might frequent the house you cannot tell? - A. I cannot.</p>

               <p>Jury. (To Sayers). Q. Did you find any utensils which had the appearance of having contained aquafortis? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say from whence the stench that you have described proceeded? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, which was read as follows: - "My Lord, I stand here before your Lordship and a most respectable Jury, accused of a crime of the most heinous dye; my counsel have already urged in my behalf all that possibly could be said to prove that I am not guilty of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200057"></xptr>the crime imputed to me; but, nevertheless I have humbly to beg the indulgence to add a few words. My Lord, I am a foreigner, and as such, unacquainted with all the ways to extricate myself from this dreadful dilemma; therefore, my Lord, and respectable Jurors, I claim your protection, indulgence, and candour. My Lord, I came to England with the late Earl of Bute, and the character given me by his Lordship in his own handwriting, will, I hope, prove the disposition of my heart; this will appear by the annexed letters, which I crave may be read; I have since lived steward with several foreign Ambassadors, always acting, and always conducting myself with becoming rectitude. I am near sixty-six years of age; I have been near thirty-three years in England; I always maintained a spotless and unsullied character; I never before darkened a prison, or saw the face of a Judge. I was too old for service, and not having enough to live independent, I made use of my talents in refining silver and other metals; I got a living by it during four years; I never imagined my doings could be deemed unlawful. Mr. Sayer, the officer, who arrested me, will no doubt tell your Lordship, that I did not hesitate moment to admit him; he humanely told me, that as neither aqua fortis nor any colouring was found on my premises, I must account in the best manner I could for the other things found to my prejudice. I did, my Lord, at my examination at Bow-street, state how the cast things found came there, and had the officer given ear to my proposal, not to make so much noise in the house or neighbourhood, the owner, Jones, would in all probability have come to take them away the same evening. I have, since my confinement, sent different persons to Bayswater to find out his residence, but without the desired effect; besides, my Lord, there was neither furnace, or any other tool or apparatus whatever for casting found in my possession, without which it is impossible to counterfeit the coin of this or any other realm. This must appear no less mysterious to your Lordship and the respectable Jury than to myself and to the whole world that know any thing of casting. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I have only to add, that although a foreigner, I rejected the offer to be tried by a mixed Jury of my countrymen, fully convinced and persuaded of your Lordship's impartiality, consummate wisdom, and justice, and also of the wisdom and probity of these respectable Jurors seated here to decide on my fate, fully persuaded that their decision will be favourable to me, and thereby convince the whole world that neither prejudice nor country can influence an English Jury to depart from the path of rectitude, justice, and feeling, or any indulgence that could be granted to an unfortunate prisoner. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I therefore humbly bow to the justice of your verdict."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. (To Sayer). Q. At the time you apprehended Mr. Theirars he made no sort of resistance? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that the things belonged to a man of the name of Jones, and if you would wait quietly till the evening, probably he would come for them? - A. No, he did not; I heard him mention a Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know what is become of Nixon? - A. He was discharged in consequence of his hands being quite clean.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. (To Mr. Powell). Q. Look at that blank, do you think that has ever received the white? - A. Certainly not.</p>

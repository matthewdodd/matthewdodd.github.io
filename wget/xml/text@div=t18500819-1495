                  </hi>. I live in Primrose-street, Bishopsgate, and am assistant to a whosesale clothier. On 29th July I had been drinking at a public-house in Tottenham-court-road, and left about one o'clock in the morning—I was not quite sober—I had changed a sovereign, and got a half-crown and the rest in shillings and sixpences, which I put into my waistcoat pocket—I went down Holborn, past St. Giles's church and Drury-lane, where some parties came behind me, and I received a blow at the side of my neck which knocked me down senseless—I afterwards found that all except 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was gone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Salter, a tailor of 190, Holborn. On 29th July, about half-past two o'clock, I was waiting at my door for it to be opened—there is a gas-light there—I saw four or five men talking, and saw Kean going towards the City—the prisoner was one of the men—he struck him a blow on the back of his head, and then pulled him back by the shoulders on to the ground—the prisoner did not fall, but he was in a stooping position—he searched Kean's pockets, and I heard money fall on the pavement—I told a policeman, and he went after the prisoner—I saw him brought back about five minutes after—he is the same person—I did not know the other persons.</p>

               <p>I heard a cry of "Police!" ran towards the place, heard money fall, and saw the prisoner leaning over Kean, who was lying on the ground—when I got about forty or fifty yards from them the prisoner ran up Museum-street into New Oxford-street—I followed, crying "Stop thief!"—he got out of my sight at the corner of George-street, and was stopped by another constable—I went and brought him back—I afterwards searched the place where Kean had laid, and found a shilling, and afterwards another shilling.</p>

No, says she, I want a bit of Meat. I have no Money to buy you any says he. You know, says the Deceased, I have had, but little to day. D...n ye, ye Bitch , says the prisoner, I'll stick ye the next Word that ye speak. The Deceas'd again askt for Meat, and then the prisoner pushed her back with his Left Hand, and stab'd her under the Breast with the Knife which he had in his Right Hand. This Evidence seeing the Blood flow so fast from her Mother, ran and took the Child from her Breast; and her elder Sister Betty, crying, Lord Father, you have murder'd my Mother! he swore, D...n, ye Bitches, hold your Tongues, or I'll stick you too. And then putting the Knife into his Mouth, he sent this Evidence for Sugar and Basilicon; which having applie'd to the Wound, he went away, and the Deceas'd dy'd in about half an Hour after.

The Surgeon depos'd that the Wound was mortal, and he could perceive no motion of her Pulse. Several of the prisoner's Neighbours confirm'd the Girl's Evidence, and depos'd, that the prisoner was a very ill Husband, often abusing and beating his Wife, and using her barbarously upon the least provocation. The prisoner in his Defence said, that upon his Wife's asking for Meat for Supper, he deny'd her; whereupon she said, if I can't have it here, I'll go out and get it.

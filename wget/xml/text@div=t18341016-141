             re-examined. Q. You told this gentleman he was not intrusted to receive money on your account? A. Yes, he was - I paid him 8s. a week, and gave him bills to go to the houses, and get the money - he never accounted for these sums - he went to Bartholomew fair, and the next day he did not come - he went away on the 4th September, on a Thursday, I believe, and he had come to me on a Friday morning - he was taken on the Saturday, and we found this bill in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never authorized him to receive any money? A. Yes; any money that was offered him - I do not think there was any thing owing to him - it was his business to carry out goods, and go and get money- I have known Mrs. Robinson these six years - I did not give the prisoner authority to receive her money - I said to him, on the night before, "Have you called at No. 22, Oxford-terrace, for orders?" - he said, "No" - I had given him the bill on the Monday morning, and he said the lady told him to take change for a sovereign - he took the change, but brought it back to my wife, and said the lady was not at home.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he receive this money from Robinson with your approbation and consent? A. No; I did not authorize him to receive it - I had sent him with several bills, and he brought the money - I did not give him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160068"></xptr>leave to receive money of any regular customer who dealt quarterly.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Suppose any customer had brought this man a sum of money, would you have found fault with him for receiving it? A. Yes; if he had not paid it to me.</p>

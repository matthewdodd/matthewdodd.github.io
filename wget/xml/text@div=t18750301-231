I am a carpenter—my mother is a laundress—on 30th January about 8.45, I was carrying home some washing on Wandsworth Common—I was perfectly sober—the two prisoners sprang on me and made a snatch at my parcel, knocked me down, kicked me on nay hip, and I lost a weeks' work from it—when I holloaed out they went away and I followed them to the Freemasons Arms, about 150 yards, they went in there and I waited outside till a constable came, and then gave them in custody—I am positively certain that they are the men.</p>

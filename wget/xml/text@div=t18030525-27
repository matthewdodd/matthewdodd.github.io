             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Where do you live? - A. In Dartmouth-street, Westminster, I belong to the Twopenny Post-office; I have known the prisoner since the 5th or 6th of April. In consequence of a suspicion I entertained, I gave information at Bow-street, and on the 3d of May I went with Pasmore and Lewis, two officers, to the <placeName id="t18030525-27-crimeloc152">Red Lion public-house, in Davies-street, Berkeley-square</placeName>

In consequence of some information, we went to another public-house, the George, close by; I went first into the parlour; in the course of a little time, the prisoner came in, followed by Lewis; Pasmore, I believe, was in the tap-room; the prisoner sat down in the same box with me, and in the course of a little time, he asked me how many I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him you wanted any thing? - A. Yes; his appointment was to meet him that day at another public-house; the price was fixed before; I was to have twelve bad shillings for six good ones; he told me he had but ten; he put them down on the table, and I gave him five marked shillings; I put the ten into my left hand waistcoat-pocket, he put the five marked shillings in his pocket; he had his hand in his pocket for a minute or two; as soon as he pulled his hand from his pocket, I gave the signal to the officer, and Lewis came up and seized the prisoner; Lewis rung the bell, and Pasmore came in, and he was secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. How long have you been in the Twopenny Post-office? - A. About a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were not in the Twopenny Postoffice at the time of this transaction? - A. No; I kept a chandler's shop in East-lane, Lambeth, till the 25th of March, and then I tried to get into the Post-office.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other business between the 25th of March, and your getting into the Post-office? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had no other sort of dealing with the prisoner at this time, but for bad money? - A. No other.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you did not pay money to the prisoner in advance towards the purchase of a pair of breeches? - A. No, nothing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is a person dealing in cloaths? - A. He had a bag with some cloaths in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say positively, you had no dealing with him but for base coin? - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You had an anxiety to bring a man to justice who was dealing in this manner? - A. Yes, I had indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. And that anxiety led you into Newgate to visit him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went there from that anxiety to bring this man to justice? - A. A person called upon me, and said, he wished to hear his proposals, and I said, I had no objection.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180305250029"></xptr>Q. You did not at all go of your own motion? - A.I was sent for.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.Do you know the name of the man who called upon you? - A. I understand his name is Howell.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you first desired by the officer to lay the information? - A. No; I wrote a letter myself to Justice Bond, in consequence of conversation with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What communication had you with the prisoner before this? - A. I had purchased some bad shillings of him before.</p>

             sworn. - On the 3d of May, I went with Lewis and Ellis to Davies-street, for the purpose of apprehending the prisoner at the bar; I gave Ellis six shillings, which I marked in his presence; I went to the George, in Davies-street; I saw the prisoner go in, I was on the opposite side of the street; I went into the tap-room, and remained there till Lewis sent for me into the parlour; I went in, and found the prisoner in custody; Lewis searched him, and among a quantity of other silver that was taken from the prisoner, I found the five shillings that I had marked, (produces them); as we were taking him to Bow-street; he said, I am done at last, or, I am had at last, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q.Had not the prisoner a bag of cloaths? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>EVAN LEWIS sworn. - I was with the last witness at the George; Ellis and I went into the parlour, the prisoner came in, and I heard a conversation about a watch; after that, I saw the prisoner put down something like shillings; he was reckoning it; I then saw Ellis picking them up; then Ellis gave the prisoner some money, and he seemed to be examining it; then another person came in, and a signal was given me by Ellis, and I went up, and laid hold of the prisoner; he was very much agitated, and wanted to get his hands to his pockets; I prevented him; I rang the bell for the waiter, and sent for Pasmore; Pasmore came in, and I searched the prisoner; I found in his right hand waistcoat-pocket three bad shillings, not fit for circulation, but such as you may buy in the streets, and in his left waistcoat-pocket, I found two shillings and eight bad of the same sort, and a bad sixpence among some halfpence; I found no bad money upon him in a state fit for circulation; in his right hand pocket, I found a guinea, and a seven-shilling piece, and twenty-three shillings in silver, from among which Pasmore picked out five marked shillings, (produces the ten shillings); Ellis gave them to me the same day, at Mr. Powell's office.</p>
               <p>Ellis. The shillings I delivered to Lewis, were the same that I received from the prisoner.(Mr. William Parker proved the ten shillings to be counterfeit.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I sold that man a pair of leather breeches; he told me I should go home with the breeches to my house, and he would fetch them; he was to give me twenty shillings for them; he paid me five shillings earnest for them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

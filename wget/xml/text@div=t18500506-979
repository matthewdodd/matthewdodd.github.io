                  </hi>. I am a tallow-chandler and oilman. The prisoner was in my employ six or seven weeks—on 4th May I had suspicion, and came down-stairs earlier than usual; and in consequence of something that happened with reference to some wash-leather, I sent for a policeman, and gave him in charge—I afterwards examined his boxes with the policeman, when he was not present, and found three squares of fancy soap, a packet of <hi rend="italic">la veno beno</hi>, which is a kind of herb to mix with tea to improve it; and a box of wax-matches—I did not miss any of them from the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I brought the soap from home; my father is in the same trade. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> His father is a traveller in the same business—this soap has "Stratton" on it, which is not the name of the house his father travels for—they are in a large way of business, and supply a great number of shops—I had no other description of fancy soap.</p>

I searched the prisoner's box with Mr. Sanderson, and found these things in it—they laid at the bottom of his box, under his clothes—it was not locked—the prisoner said before the Magistrate he would not say but what he had taken the <hi rend="italic">la veno beno.</hi>

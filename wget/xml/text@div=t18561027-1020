On 29th inst I was on duty ia the Minories—I met the prisoner walking with a piece of cloth under his arm—I asked what he was going to do with it—he dropped it, and ran away—I ran after him—a man picked up the cloth, and gave it to me—I asked the prisoner his address, and he refused it to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, at No. 110, Minories. This piece of cloth is mine—I cut a coat from it on Tuesday afternoon, the 28th inst and put the remainder of the piece on the shelf—I saw it there the next morning—I had occasion to go out at about 9 o'clock, and left my son in the shop—I returned at twenty minutes before 10 o'clock, my son was in the parlour—having lost a piece of cloth the week before, I looked round and missed this piece—a policeman then walked in with this person in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was coming down the Minories, and was going to Tower-hill to see if I could get a job of work; I saw this piece of cloth at the corner of the court I ran with it under my arm; I was going with it to the watch house; I had a notion that it might be stolen, and I dropped it, as I thought I might get into trouble, as I am sorry to say I have; I have a wife and three children at home, entirely depending upon me.</p>

I am a greengrocer, and live at 40, Paradise Place, Essex Road, Islington—I have seen the prisoner before, but never spoke to him that I know of—on the night of 8th December, between 7 and 8 o'clock, I had been in a public-house, and had something to drink—the prisoner was in there—I was a little the worse for what I had taken—I believe the prisoner followed me from there, but that I could not swear to—at the corner of Pitman Street, Essex Road, about fifty yards from the public-house, he struck me, and knocked me down—I found him atop of me, and when he got off and ran away I hallaoed out "Stop thief!"—I put my hand in my pocket, and found I had lost my moriey, 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., tied up in a bag—I have never seen it since—I had seen it safe hardly a minute before, as I came out of the public-house—I had taken it out there, but did not take any money out of it—I came out of the house with my hand in my right hand pocket, and when the prisoner struck me my hand flew out of my pocket.</p>

               <p>night of the 8th December, a little after 7 o'clock, I was going along the Essex Road—there was a crowd on the pavement, and the prosecutor and prisoner came in contact—there appeared to be a wrangle, and almost im<lb></lb>mediately the prisoner knocked the prosecutor down with a violent blow in the mouth, which caused blood, and he fell on him—I called to a young man to take him off, which he did with great force, and when he got up the prosecutor called "Stop thief!"—he ran and I after him; but I lost him, and came back—I gave a description of him, and afterwards, about 11 o'clock, I called at the station and saw seven persons drawn up in the passage—at first I did not recognise the prisoner, but a second time I put my hand upon him, and said he was the man.</p>

I live at 17, Popham Street, Islington—I work for the prosecutor—on Friday night, 8th December, a little after 7 o'clock, I was at the top of Pickering Street, Essex Road, and saw the prisoner hit my master in the mouth and knock him down, and he held him by his shoulders on the ground—he got up and ran away—my master said "I am robbed."</p>

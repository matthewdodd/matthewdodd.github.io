            . I am one of patrols belonging to Bow-street. I was along with some sawyers about a fortnight ago, at the Adam and Eve, in Tottenham Court Road. I heard the discourse about the prisoner running away with a saw of another person, and likewise that he had run away from the hulks.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he escape from the hulks. - A. I do not know. In the sawyer's discourse I heard that he was one of the nineteen that run away from the hulks I went home and looked at the Hue and Cry, I found that his name answered to one of them. On the 15th, I found him at the <placeName id="t18120115-77-crimeloc453">White Horse, Kensington</placeName>

I apprehended him, and put him upon a coach, and coming through Kensington he jumped off the coach with his hands tied, I jumped off and caught him going down the lane into Fulham Field, he made use of a desparate oath, and said,</p>
               <p>"if it was your case you would do the same, and try to get off, if I am taken my case is desperate, I have served four years." I brought him back, and put him on the coach again, and took him to the office. I produce the copy of the conviction of the prisoner, I got it of Mr. Shelton, I saw him sign it.</p>

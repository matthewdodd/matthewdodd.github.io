On 3rd August I saw the prisoner and another man in Petticoat-lane—I went after them, stopped the prisoner—I asked him what he had got about him?—he said, "Nothing"—I felt him down with my hand—I then asked him where he got the coat that he was wearing—he asked me why—I said, "Because it is too big for you a great deal"—he said he bought it of a man at the top of the lane for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "You must go back with me to that man"—he went to a man, and he said to him, "Did not I buy this coat of you last Sunday week for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—the man said, "No; you came here to me just now to sell it"—I took the prisoner into a shop, and searched him—I found this time-piece in the lining of his waistcoat, between his waistcoat and coat, and in the pocket of the coat I found this handkerchief.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent to Mr. Thomas Jackson a builder, at Pimlico. The prisoner was foreman of the smiths—on 22nd or 23rd Aug. he had under his charge the whole of the tools—some of them were in the shop, but the small ones were under lock and key in the smiths'</p>

               <p>shop—they had no business at the prisoner's lodging—several tools were missing I gave the prisoner notice, on the 23rd, to leave on the Saturday week following, and told him to deliver up his things, to get his work square—on 2nd Sept. I asked him for some hammers which we bad given instruc<lb></lb>tion to be made, and also for a ratchet-brace—he said he would get them presently—about two o'clock the same day I went to the nail-room—he came to me, and said he was very sorry, but he had taken part of the ratchet-brace home—I asked why he did so—he said, "I thought to ask you to give it me several times, but I neglected to do so; the reason I took it home was, it would be a very useful article to me, as I intended to set up in business for myself"—I went back into the smiths" shop—I again asked him for the hammers and tools—he did not produce them—he had opportunity to go home if he liked—I then asked him for the key of the box, and looked in the box, and found several things, but not the hammers—I then fetched a police-man, went with him to the prisoner's lodging, and found a number of tools in a tool-box, worth about 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

The prisoner was given into my cus<lb></lb>tody—he said, "It is no use for me to deny it; I had better acknowledge it"—after he had gone a little farther he said, "I was going to leave to-night—I was going into business for myself; I was preparing these tools in order to set me on"—the tools have been in my possession ever since—they are not all finished.</p>

                  </hi>. I am store-keeper to Mr. Jackson. On Saturday, 2nd Sept., I heard llford request the prisoner to deliver up some tools—he pro<lb></lb>duced several from a box—he was asked if they were all—he said they were—Ilford asked the men if they were all—they said there were several dozen more—llford asked the prisoner again, and he said there were all that bad been prepared within the last three months—I went with him to his lodging at Pimlico, between three and four o'clock, after Mr. llford had gone for the policeman—he asked me to take the ratchet-brace to Mr. llford to induce him not to fetch a policeman—I asked him to give up all the tools, and then to go to Mr. llford and tell him, and that might perhaps induce him not to send for a policeman—he opened a cupboard and gave them up—the policeman was at the yard—the prisoner went to the yard, to make that representation—he acknowledged taking the whole of them.</p>

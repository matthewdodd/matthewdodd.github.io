On Wednesday morning, 26th Jan., I saw it safe at 7 o'clock—I did my work in the kitchen, and then went up stairs to do my work there—after I had done my work there, Lieutenant Fitzgerald sent me into the town, to a chemist's shop—I had left the plate in a drawer in the kitchen, and the key was in the drawer—that was about 8 o'clock—when I came back I went down stairs to the kitchen, and the prisoner was standing at my kitchen door—I cannot say whether he is a soldier—he said that he was poorly, and asked whether I had any milk to give him—the kitchen is under the quarters—each servant has a kitchen, and there is a back yard to the kitchens—there are four kitchens in each passage—a person on the outside to get into the kitchen would come through the parade, and in at the doors which are always open—he would go into the passage and down stairs from the passage—there is nothing to prevent their going in, and straight down—when the prisoner asked me for milk I told him I had none to give him—I locked my kitchen door and went to my barrack room, and had my breakfast—I did not see the prisoner again till he was in custody—I was preparing my master's breakfast, between 9 and 10 o'clock, that morning, and I found there had been two spoons and two table forks taken out—they were Maltese silver—they were bought at Malta, where I had been with my master—I also missed a pair of boots that my master had given me, which I had left under the stool in the kitchen.</p>

            . About three or four days before Christmas day, N S. mrs. Appleford came to town in order to recover 200 l that was due to her; she came and ask'd my advice. I told her I would write a letter to her husband, who was then at the Tower to desire he'd do it in an amicable manner, and I would assist him; I told him, if he would give me a letter of attorney, I would endeavour to recover the money, which he agreed to. This money was left by will of her father in the hs of her uncle, to be paid at the age of 28 years I sent for an attorney to act in behalf of them; he then said he could not do it, and begg'd some time to consider of it. Then I desired he would meet me at a house near Charing-cross, which he did ; he began to cry, and begg'd to be in private, and told me he had another wife and a son about fourteen or fifteen years of age, who was register'd in Newbury parish, and that his wife was living in that parish: I went for Newbury on the Friday morning, and got there the next morning: I went to the register, and had this certificate from it, it is wrote on the back of the book, The book of the registers at Newbury. The sexton and I examined it by the book.</p>
               <p>I saw the first wife, she was at Easton, at the house of farmer Harsel, about five miles from Newbury.</p>

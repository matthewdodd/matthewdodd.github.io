               <p>Prosecutor. On Sunday Night between 9 and 10, I met with some Company, and went to drink with them at a House in Newtoner's-Lane, where I left my Watch-case for the Reckoning, and then going out I met with the Prisoner and three more. They ask'd me to drink, and said it should cost me nothing. So they pull'd me into a Gin-shop; I ask'd what was to pay, for they promis'd to treat me. I did not expect they would. They said there was a Crown to pay. I found I was got into ill Company, and therefore pull'd out my Watch, in order to secure it; but the Prisoner snatched it out of my Hand, and ran away. I follow'd her, but could not catch her. Indeed I met with her next Day, and took her up with a Warrant, but I never got the Watch again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw him before the Monday Morning that he took me up, and then he said he was inform'd by some Neighbours that I had got a Watch that he had lost - But he had pawn'd it a Month before to Bess Thompson. <rs id="t17340911-49-verdict230" type="verdictDescription">

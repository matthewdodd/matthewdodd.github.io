On the 21st of July, I sent the prisoner, Bigsby, with eight sacks of potatoes to carry to Spitalfields. I saw part of the potatoes at Bow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. There was a man named Archer with him. His cart was one sack deficient.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH LEACH. I am a watchman at Bow. On the 22d of July, I saw the carts stop at the Bird and Hand at Bow, about three o'clock in the morning, they watered their horses, and drew up to the inn gates - I saw the prisoner, Turner, come out of the Bird and Hand, and open the gates, with a bushel and a empty sack, into which he measured the potatoes - He is hostler at the inn - He measured them out of Bigsby's cart-Bigsby untied the sacks and took the potatoes out of different sacks and put them into the bushel measure-Turner measured them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170061"></xptr>into the empty sack; the man who drove the other cart assisted - He got away; Bigsby put the sacks down at the hind part of the cart-the other man took it on his back to carry it away, I asked him where he was going with it - He made no answer, I told him to put it down; Turner was walking about. I took the two prisoners.</p>

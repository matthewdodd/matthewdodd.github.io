                  </hi>. I succeeded to an ironmongery business at Hammer<lb></lb>smith, which had formerly been Mr. Wright's—I took possession on 11th May—I purchased Mr. Wright's stock. The prisoner was in his service, and continued in mine—in consequence of information, I gave him into custody on 24th July—I believe this tea-pot is one of the articles that I took in Mr. Wright's stock—there were nine tea-pots, of different qualities and patterns—there</p>

               <p>were some of this pattern, I cannot say how many—I missed six metal tea-pots, but I cannot say of what patterns—I have sold none—there are three now in stock—I firmly believe this was one of the patterns I lost-Mr. Knibb has the charge of the stock chiefly, I am out a great deal—the mark on the bottom of this tea-pot has been scratched or erased.</p>

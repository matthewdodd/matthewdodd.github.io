                  </hi> I am manager to William Taylor Copeland, Esq. The prisoner was in his employ as a salesman—on the 9th of Oct. I charged him with stealing something form Mr. Copeland's desk, which Mr. Powell had the charge of—he faintly denied it—I asked what he had got about him—he said. "One shilling"—he took it out of his pocket, and I handed it to Mr. Powell,</p>

               <p>who said, "This is marked"—it was one of those that had been marked the day before, and put into Mr. Powell's desk, under lock and key—I am quite sure it was one of the marked shillings.</p>

                  </hi> I am cashier at Mr. Alderman Copeland's in Portugal-street—I marked two half-crowns and seven shillings—they were put in a bowl in my desk, with two or three others—I showed the marked money to Mr. Gribbon—these are two of the marked shillings that were in my desk—the desk was locked, but the key was left in it—they were taken out of the desk by some one.</p>

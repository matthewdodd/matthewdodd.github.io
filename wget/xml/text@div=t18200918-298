            . I live in Herod's-place, Well-street, Well-close-square. On the 21st of July, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, I was coming from a dancing-house next door to Mrs. Williams, in <placeName id="t18200918-298-crimeloc1709">Dock-street</placeName>

As I came out I saw her at her door, but did not see her son; she moved her hands towards me; I did not see anything; nobody but her was near me. I immediately felt a great pain at my ancle like burning; I went home took my stocking off, and found three or four holes burnt in it; my shawl was all over with the same sort of stuff, and had holes in it; my gown was the same, and my petticoat. In the morning I went to Lambeth-street and took out a warrant against her; the other prisoner came to me and said he would serve me ten times worse, and said he was behind her at the time.</p>

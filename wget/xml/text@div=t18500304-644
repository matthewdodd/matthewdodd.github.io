                  </hi>. I am constable of Lewisham. On 20th Feb., I was by the George, and saw the prisoners with a wagon and three horses—one of them took a quantity of corn in a sack from the wagon and handed it to the other, who put it on the shaft, and then took it into the stable of the George, and handed it to the assistant to the horse-keeper, William Pledger—I went in and asked the man for the sack, and got it—the corn had been shot into the bin—it was taken out and put into the sack again—I took a handful of corn out of the nose-bag, and it exactly corresponded with that in the sack.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coal-merchant, of Peckham. Warren was in my service, and had a wagon and horses under his care—Langley had worked for me—this sack is mine—this corn is the usual sort that they take out to feed the horses—I allow them half a bushel of oats a day for each horse, and they have chaff to mix with it—I do not allow them beans, but the day before this they had beans on account of one horse being ill as they said.</p>

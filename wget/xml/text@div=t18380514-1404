                  </hi>. I am the wife of Aaron George Jones, he is a coffee-house keeper in St. George's-circus, Southwark. On the night of the 9th of March I went to the Surrey theatre—I had a purse, which contained fifteen sove<lb></lb>reigns, a double—sovereign, and an old guinea—when I went in, the theatre was very much crowded—I went to the second tier of boxes, to see if I could see my friends, and a young man, who I believe was the prisoner, offered me a place to stand—I stood some time, and felt him, or some person, pressing against me—I do not know that it was him, but I turned and said to him, "Don't do that"—they were pressing on me very much—I stood some time, and when the lights were put out in the Gnome Fly, I felt a great pressure—I took my cloak round me, and when the lights came on I found my purse was gone—I should know my double—sovereign again—to the best of my belief I think I could swear that this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I went down stairs, and saw Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Nash—they told me to look for an officer—the officer was found, and I went to the station-house—I could recognise no one there that I had seen by me—one man was taken up, but he was not the same—a week after went to Ipswich, and when I returned the prisoner was in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long was it after that you returned from Ipswich? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not exactly know—I was four or five days in London before I went to Ipswich—I staid there three days—I returned in about a week after—I had seen a man named Williams in custody, and there were a great many examinations—I was several times called up to see persons, out I did not know them—I had seen a person resembling the prisoner at she theatre—I did not take my oath positively at Union-hall that he was she man, but I think I can say so with safety—I had no more doubt of him then than I have now—they asked me if I would swear to the man—I said would not—I said, as I do now, that I believed it to be the prisoner—I</p>

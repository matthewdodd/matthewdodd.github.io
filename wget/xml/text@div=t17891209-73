               <p>I am one of the patrol of St. Sepulchre: about a quarter before ten the prosecutor came to the watch-house for a constable; I went to a public house in Long-lane, and took the prisoner into custody, on suspicion of stealing this leaden pipe; it was the first of November, on a Sunday evening; I have seen him in bed in the room about a twelve-month ago, but I cannot say how long exactly; I drew a basket from behind a door, and under a stair-case I found some leaden pipe; I took it to the watch-house; I examined part of it that night at the prosecutor's house, and it matched exactly; a piece of pipe that is broke close to the cellar window that comes into the street; it appeared to be newly broke; it matched at one end, and the other end was taken away entirely; as nearly as possible, I can swear it came from that place; it had lost its shape, and we were obliged to bend it in the proper form to try it.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long had you known the prisoner? - Five or six years.</p>

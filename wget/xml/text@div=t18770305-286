                  </hi>. On 16th February I was staying at the Sailors' Home, Wells Street—about 11.30 that night the prisoner spoke to me in the street, and I went with her to her lodging, 20, Brunswick Street—I sent for some beer—she called in another girl from upstairs, and a third girl brought in the beer—we had a drink each—I was sitting on the bed, and the women began quarrelling between themselves, but I did not interfere—the beer was in two jars—the prisoner said "Are you going to give me the money for to-night?"—I laughed and said nothing, because I had told her in the street that I had no money—she drew a knife from her pocket, opened the two blades, and said "You see this?"—I laughed at her still, and she said "You see that?"—I said "You don't mean to strike me with that knife"—she said "By God, I will"—I stood up by the bed, and she made two or three blows at my face, but I defended myself, and at last I fas cut across the nose and fell down on the floor, and she gave me two or three cuts on my face and then ran downstairs—I am quite certain the prisoner is the girl—I bled very much, and went down and told a policeman—it is not true that I was hit with a stone jar; it was a penknife with two blades—I was not exactly sober, I had had a couple of glasses, but I knew what I was about, so as to distinguish which of them it was.</p>

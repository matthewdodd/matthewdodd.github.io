                  </hi>. I live in Ormond-street. On 4th Jan., between 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking along—I lost my handkerchief—I felt a touch, immediately put my hand in my pocket, and my handkerchief was gone—I had it safe, and had used it a few minutes before—on turning round I saw the prisoner standing on the Kerb within a yard of me—directly he saw me put my hand in my pocket he ran away—I ran after him—I saw him caught, and the policeman came up—the prisoner took the handkerchief from his breast, and gave it him—this is it—it is mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the post-office. I was walking along Aldgate—I saw the prisoner at the pocket of the prosecutor—the prosecutor turned round, and I drew his attention to the prisoner, who made across the road, and went down Houndsditch—I pursued, and took him in custody myself—I saw him give the handkerchief to the policeman—he said a boy had given it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a police constable at that time. I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner running down Houndsditch—I stopped him—he gave me up this handkerchief, and told me a boy gave it him—the prisoner's father is a respectable man—I have seen the boy employed in getting his living—his father means to send him to America, where he has some friends.</p>

I am a sandman and work for Mr. Lee, at the loam pits, Deptford—about February last, I was driving a cart, which was run into by another vehicle driven by Mr. Harriett's carman—I was taken to the hospital by a City officer, and four or five days after I came out I met the two prisoners in High Street, Deptford—my wife was on the other side of the way—I told them I had met with an accident, and must have somebody to write a letter for me—they said "Well, you may as well give the case into our hands"—they both said that; I knew them before and always thought Mr. Chappell was a solicitor—they said they would call on me in a day or two, and Mr. Chappell gave me this card "William Hicks, solicitor," with "Mr. Chappell" in the left hand corner—Chappell crossed out the address "3, Strickland Street, Deptfcrd," with a pencil and wrote "20, Prior Street, Greenwich"—about five days afterwards Dobsou drove up in a cab to my house—he came in and said "I shall charge you 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and. I will give you a. copy of the letter," and my wife gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but we did not get the copy until we had paid a guinea for the writ—the letter looked like this.

Received of Samuel Ballard one guinea, on account of costs. Miles John Do! son"—eight or nine days after that they both came in a cab—my wife said again "I do not believe you are solicitors" he had said so at the Amersham Arras, and they both said Well, we should not take the money and represent ourselves so if we were not solicitors"—they wanted 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more to show an appearance in a higher court—my wife said "Then you will not have it"—they said "Then you will get yourselves into trouble and us too, and you will not have a bed to sleep on"—Dobson had got the witness's papers in the action in the City, who look me to the hospital, and (he second time he said "Now, pay me some more money and I will give you up the papers and get somebody else to take further proceedings"—I did not give him any more money—I shewed him some and he thought he was going to have five guineas, and pulled out a receipt, but 1 put the money in my pocket and said "Thank you, I will take it somewhere else"—they wanted five guiueas to take the case up to the Queen's Court at Westminster—they both said that—they did not go away—I walked out of the house and left them there—my wife was at home—I saw no more of them—I instructed somebody else and the result was a summons in this case—I authorised my wife to pay the money because I thought they were solicitors as they represented themselves.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. I have known Chappell about twelve years and always thought he was a solicitor—I have not seen him at police-courts—I was cross-examined at the police-court as to the offence for which I was tried—it was thirty years ago since I came out of Brixton for seven days—we were a lot of boys together in a field roasting <hi rend="italic">laters</hi>, and twenty years ago 1 got three months for stealing a sack of beans—I have also had six months for gambling in 1866—I have been home thirteen years and nobody can say anything against me—I call it gambling, it was for stealing money from the person—there was not six months for gambling us well—the first statement I made to the Magistrate was that Chappell gave me the card and my wife paid the money—I had to admit in cross-examination that I had the card five days before any money was paid—I cannot read much, nor can my wife—we did not read the card—nobody read it to us till I took it to the solicitor—I saw the prisoner outside the Centurion at Deptford, and told them that I had had a horse killed—I did not say "I have got a bit of a law job on"—I said "I have got a bit of a hard job on"—I said I should have to get somebody to attend to it for me—I did not go for the purpose of getting Chappell to attend to it—they stopped me and said "Halloo, Bailard, how are you getting on?" and I told them, and they said "If you are going to have anybody you might as well put it in our way, we are both solicitors"—when I said I had a bit of a law job on 1 intended to ask Chappell to do it for me, thinking he was a solicitor—I should not have told them anything about it or asked them to attend to it if 1 had not thought they were soli<lb></lb>citors—Chappell said that he could not stop to talk the matter over then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187709170221"></xptr>
               <p>and I went away—it was five days before I saw them and paid any money—the next time I saw them was on 15th February, at the Amersham Arms, when I paid the money, but Dobson got the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at ray house when Chappell was not there—I did not go to the Amersham Arms for the purpose of seeing them, they met me in my cart and told me to meet them—I sent my wife to see if they were there and they were both there—I did not ask Chappell which was the cheapest way to take a summons out in the Mayor's Court, or the County Court, nor did he tell me that if Mr. Harriett was in the jurisdiction of the Mayor's Court it would be cheaper to go there—the Mayor's Court was mentioned; it was to be taken there for 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., that was to show an. appearance—I had had that card five days before that—I went into the Amersham Arms and came out again—they both represented themselves to me as solicitors outside the Amersham Arms—I did' not say before the Magistrate that nothing of the sort was said at the Amersham Arms; I said that it was not said inside.</p>

               <p>for a receipt for the guinea—they said they did not think he wanted a receipt for a guinea and they would have to go to the Queen's Court to get the writ—they gave him this receipt, I put it on the file and the copy of the letter too—I should not have paid the money if they had not represented themselves as solicitors—they both said "We cannot go just yet, we must wait here till 12 o'clock to see a lady on the same business, as her husband has met with an accident, and one journey will serve for two—we met the prisoners a couple of weeks afterwards coming out of a railway station and Dobson said "Mrs. Ballard, I want you to give me 235."—my husband said "What for?"—Chappell said "For putting in an appearance"—I said to my husband "I don't think I should let them have anymore"—he said "I don't think I shall let you have any more," and Chappell said "If you do not give Us the money you will get into a great deal of trouble, you will have everything taken from you, and not only that you will be sent to prison besides"—I saw them three or four times after that, and on each occasion they asked my husband for money.</p>

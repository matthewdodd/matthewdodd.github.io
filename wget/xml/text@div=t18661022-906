I am a brass rule maker, of 6, Ropemaker Street, City—the prisoner's father works for me, and the prisoner came to my place five or six times a week to bring work from his father—this com<lb></lb>posing stick is mine—I put a mark on it, wrapped it in paper, and locked it in a drawer on, I think, the 16th September, about one o'clock—the prisoner came in about that time, and asked me to lend him a small file—I went upstairs to get one, and when I came down I opened the drawer, missed the composing stick, and communicated with the police.</p>

On the 27th September I went to the prisoner's residence, told him I was a detective officer, and should take him into custody for stealing a large quantity of composing sticks—he cried and said, "I took them"—I asked him where they were—he gave me this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him where the other was—he said, "I took three up to Mr. Livermore's, a pawnbroker, in Shoe Lane, Holborn, who lent me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each on the three," and that when he went again he said, "Here is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for you, you do not want a ticket," and that that had been going on since.</p>

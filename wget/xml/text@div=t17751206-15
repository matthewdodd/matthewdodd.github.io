When I went out I locked the door, and left in the room between three and four hundred rabbit skins; my wife went along with me: a quilt off the bed and a piece of cotton out of my chest were gone, and likewise a pair of leather breeches: I value the quilt at about eight shillings, the cotton at twenty-four shillings<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177512060045"></xptr> and six-pence, and the rabbit skins at about seven pounds; I found the cotton pawned at one Mr. Hedley's in Smithfield: I can swear to the rabbit skius; there is one parcel a narrow white skin, there is not another like it in the whole parcel.</p>
               <p>Can you undertake to swear that these are the skins you lost? - Yes, I can; for the rest are all grey skins; there is another little bundle consisting of about three dozen black and white skins, the rest of the bundles have all five dozen in each.</p>
               <p>How do you know the bundles? - Because I have had them a long time in the house; they are the very same I lost.</p>

            . I was at a justice of the peace, near Clerkenwell, when the prosecutor came for a search warrant, alledging that his house had been robbed. I and two more officers went to the pawnbroker's with the prosecutor, where we found the cotton. We apprehended the woman first, and found the man in bed, stark naked, on the Monday following. Justice Blackborow ordered them into custody: the justice told them the consequence if they did not confess where the skins were; we found them at a house on Saffron-hill, by direction of one Mr. Bulbridge.</p>

She came to me, and I went with her, and told the pawnbroker I believed she was a very honest woman, and that it was her own property; whereupon the pawnbroker gave her the 12 s. upon the linen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor, belonging to the schooner <hi rend="italic">Sarah Ann</hi>. On Wednesday morning, the 3rd of November, about eleven o'clock, I went into a shop opposite St. Katharine's Dock—I had a watch with me—the prisoner came in, and asked me where I got it—I said my father bought it, and gave it to me—he asked if that was true—I said it was—I had at the time two bundles of clothes in my hand—he asked me where I got them—I said I bought them in a shop a little further on—he asked me to show him—I went and showed him—I saw he was a police-officer by the buttons on his waistcoat—he took my watch from the shopman, and said I should go home with him to his house—I said I would go with him—I went to his house with him, and had a dinner and some beer—I had never seen him before—he had the watch all this time—he had put it into his pocket—I took my clothes to his house, and left them there—after dinner he took me out, and said he would find me a ship the day following—he then left me in the street, and said I should go back to his house again, but I could not find the way back—(he had the watch at that time)—on Saturday I went to the shop where he took the watch from me, and the man sent me to the office—on Sunday morning I met the prisoner by the Dundee Arms public house—he asked where I was going, and said if I would go with him he would give me my clothes, and he would bring the watch down to where I had been lodging, at two o'clock.</p>

On the 3rd of November the prosecutor came in about half-past ten o'clock, and said, "Will you buy this watch?"—I said, "No, I buy nothing of lads"—the prisoner, who is a Thames police-officer, tapped him on the shoulder, and said, "I want you"—he took the watch from my young man's hand, and went out.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Telfer, a pawnbroker, in Ratcliff<lb></lb>highway. I produce this silver watch, which was pawned by the prisoner, on the 4th of November, about five o'clock in the evening, for 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., in the name of John Cook.</p>

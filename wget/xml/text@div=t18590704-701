                  </hi>. I live at 184, Prospect-place—in October, 1857, I went to 32, Spring-gardens, and saw a plate on the door with the name of Dr. Watters—I did not observe any plate on the railings—I saw Edwards, who asked who I wanted to see—I said "Dr. Watters"—he asked who I had been to, and mentioned several people, but I said I had not been to them—he then went up stairs, and I saw Dr. Watters who examined my ears, and said that he would cure me in eight days—I had trumpets in my ears, and he said that they would be of no use to me after the second day—he said that he had been deaf, and cured himself by the same means as he would cure me; that he had seen sixty patients that morning, and that an Admiral had called on him that morning to thank him for curing him—I was to pay 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I gave him my address, and he wrote it down in his book, and promised to send me some medicine, which Edwards brought in the evening—there were no directions with it, and he wrote a receipt which was destroyed—it had on it, "Received for the means of cure for deafness, 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—when Edwards brought that down I said that if it should fail I should call and see the doctor again—he said, "If the doctor says it will succeed, it cannot fail"—I used the medicine, but my deafness was no better—I afterwards went to Spring-gardens—Watters was not at home—I saw Edwards and told him that I was no better, but he made no remark—I went a third time, and saw Watters—I said that I was not any better, and he said that he would send some more medicine; and at all events there would be no more to pay; but none was brought to me—I fetched it, but did not see Watters—it was sent down to me by a dark young man who wanted me to pay 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, but I refused—I used that medicine, and it made me very ill—I then went to Spring-gardens and saw Watters again, who promised to send me some more but he did not, so I sent him a lawyer's letter—this bottle is the same sort (<hi rend="italic">Labelled, "The embrocation to be well rubbed into the nape of the neck and behind the ears every night at bed time"</hi>)—this injection (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was to be syringed into the ears; it had that label—that is what he wanted me to pay 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—this bottle (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was to put into my ears (<hi rend="italic">Labelled, "Three or four drops to be dropped, into the ears at night, immediately after the injection has been used."</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman's servant, of Son-street, Grosvenor-square—in consequence of an advertisement, I went to 32, Spring-gardens, and saw a plate there with "British and Foreign Ear Infirmary for the cure of deafness" on it, and the name "Dr. Watters" on the door, not on the large plate—I saw Edwards and said that I wanted to see Dr. Watters; he said that he was Dr. Watters; I told him I had come for a cure for deaf<lb></lb>ness; he examined my throat, and said that he could cure me from a fort-night to three weeks, and that it was nervousness—he was to charge from 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he left the room and returned with 2 bottles of medicine, one was an injection and the other to rub behind the ears, and I was to buy a syringe—the receipt was brought up, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and I paid that—I used the medicine and became worse—I went again to Spring-gardens the fol<lb></lb>lowing Wednesday, and saw Edwards again; I said that I had received no benefit, and he wished me to keep on for the next week—I afterwards went again, and saw Edwards; he said that the case was worse than he at first thought it was, and I should require a vapour bath, which I was to pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for—this is it (<hi rend="italic">A tin box with a tube at the top</hi>)—I had six bottles to put into this, and had some wool to put in; and I was to buy some tincture of myrrh, and while it was burning, I was to put the tube into my ear for seven or eight minutes each time, twisting a paper up in my ear to prevent the tube being too hot for the skin—I paid him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and received this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">Read: "November</hi> 17<hi rend="italic">th,</hi> 1851. <hi rend="italic">Received of Mr. Woolrich,</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for vapour bath and tinctures.</hi>

I am a medical chemist, residing at 41, Derby-street, Pimlico—I was for 17 yours professor of chemistry at St. George's Old School, the one that was originally established—I can identify this ear injection (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) as being given into my bands by the witness Cotterell—(<hi rend="italic">Cotterell here stated that he received this bottle from the prisoner Edwards, and gave it to Mr. Rogers</hi>)—I have analysed this ear injection, and find it to consist of acetate of zinc, sulphate of lead and urine; no doubt the</p>

               <p>result of a mixture of ordinary sugar of lead and sulphate of zinc; in fact, when the two things are mixed together there is decomposition; not without the urine: with urine and some water—this "Embrocation to be rubbed on the back of the neck" is made of oil, ammonia, and urine: this third liquid, "The drops to apply to the ear affected," is potass, oil, and green oil—I received some bottles in a box enclosed in a newspaper with the seals unbroken—(<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Rousseau here identified a bottle which she had received from Edwards, and given to Inspector Young</hi>)—this is not the same ear injection; it is water, and there is no urine in it; I examined this one—(<hi rend="italic">Another bottle was here identified by Mrs. Rousseau, which was marked "To be-placed behind the ear with a piece of linen rag"</hi>)—this consists of the same materials, coloured with compound spirit of lavender and a little urine in it—this "Oil to be dropped in the ear" consists of potass, rape oil, and green oil, (<hi rend="italic">This was also identified by Mrs. Rousseau</hi>)—I also examined this bottle without a label; it was in the same package as the others; I don't know who it belonged to—I also examined some powder which consists of oxyde of iron—(<hi rend="italic">Produced and identified by Francis Thomas as his medicine, which was to be taken internally</hi>)—this is merely coloured water—those medicines containing urine would unques<lb></lb>tionably be most prejudicial to the ear, and this containing potass would be in all probability injurious; this containing acetate of lead would be injurious in a great many cases; they would cause irritation—the effect of the powder would be rather beneficial than otherwise.</p>

DOYLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is a well known tonic is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it is a proper medicine in proper cases—I did not examine Thomas, and so do not know whether it was proper or not. There are certain consti<lb></lb>tuents of urine; salts formed during decomposition which are easily recognised under a microscope; then the smell of putrid urine is easily recognised; it is a most objectionable ammoniacal smell; and again when you burn it, there is a peculiar smell, so that there is no difficulty in detecting it, and the acetate of lead and zinc makes no difference; that mixture tends to check the putrefaction a little, but still it goes on—urine is water which contains salts, and some acids; the salts are phosphate of soda, and chlorida of sodium, which is common salt, and there is sulphite, uric acid, and urea—the am<lb></lb>monia is only developed after decomposition—if some of these salts, the am<lb></lb>monia for instance, had been mixed with it, they would not produce the sour smell, they would not produce the phosphorous—in analysing I took some of the residue, evaporated it to dryness, and examined it under the microscope; but each of these things require a different mode of analysis—in analyzing the urine I evaporated it to dryness, and burnt it, and then I had the smell of burning urine developed; that test was completed when I burnt the residium, and after that I put some of the precipitate under the microscope, and found a sediment; I took a portion of that sediment, placed it under a microscope, and found phosphate of ammonia and magnesia; they are not to be found in any combination except in human urine; unless you go to a shop, and purchase it—if you liked you might go and buy the salts, and have them in combination, but those materials would not give you the smell; you would not get the smell without adding urine; ammonia would not do—I do not take snuff; some snuff is flavoured with ammonia, and some has been actually flavoured with putrid urine; I could tell if you would give it to me—I did not find uric acid, and lithic acid; those are not always constituents of urine in a deposit—I simply examined the sediment in which there was no uric acid, I might have fifty samples without finding it—I do not mean to tell you that urine is to be found without urea, but without</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185907040093"></xptr>
               <p>uric acid—I saw in one a slight trace of ammonia and sulphurated hydrogen, that would produce hydro-sulphate of ammonia—I did not find that, but there is a specimen in the hands of another chemist—the sediments are pre<lb></lb>cipitates of sulphate of lead; sometimes that, coming in contact with hydro<lb></lb>sulphate of soda, would produce a black precipitate, but not always; it is a peculiarity rather; there is no law; it would be the ordinary result—I did not find that in what I examined; but the presence of the salts would inter<lb></lb>fere with that—that would be the effect added to the lead; the same added to the zinc would produce a white sediment—I did not find that—hydro<lb></lb>sulphate of ammonia throws down a black precipitate from all the solutions of salts of lead—from such mixtures as I have described, a clear liquid could he had without filtering, by just pouring off the super natant liquid without the sediment—you may get it clear by filtering, or by allowing a subsidence, and pouring it off—a bottle of this kind would be filtered in about three minutes—you get a smell in urine undergoing decomposition, without the sulphurated hydrogen and ammonia—I say that these solutions in which there is urine would be probably injurious—I have a large practice as a medical practitioner, but not as an aorist—I have never heard of urine being used—I do not know that persons use empirical remedies—I have heard of St. John Long and counter irritation—I have not a higher opinion of those who profess to cure special diseases than of the general surgeon—if a surgeon uses his head and judgment in the same way as the speciality doctors, he will treat diseases as well—speciality doctors are not called quacks, if they are qualified; we apply that term to the unqualified—St. John Long had a system of counter irritation—I believe he applied it to all diseases—I am acquainted with hydropathy and homoeopathy—I do not believe in either of them—there are many highly qualified men who practice both; not men of recognised skill and ability—I am not at liberty to mention names; but I have seen men do it merely as a way by which they can make money; not men of high reputation, men who have been educated; but not one of high qualification; not among those who recommend hydropathy and homoeo<lb></lb>pathy—under certain conditions, I think that a person professing either one or the other ought to be brought to that bar—I have known cases requiring active treatment where a verdict of manslaughter has been returned—I have heard of a medical practitioner being the victim of a verdict of manslaughter—in my opinion, the bottles containing urine would probably be injurious; the crystals would stick in the glands, and produce dreadful eruptions even in the bladder, much more in the ear, where it is sore; if they accumulate in the bladder, they form stones, and produce grevious diseases; but in certain states of the urine, you will have these little crystals floating about suspended, and they will remain attached to the inner coating of the bladder, and the person is forced to take medical advice to have that peculiar kind of gravel treated—it produces the same pain as any foreign substance in the bladder would—the inner lining of the bladder is not so sensitive as the sore surface of the ear—deafness is not produced by a sore surface of the ear; a thickening and accumulation of wax are one or two forms of it—I should not use a stimulated caustic, or irritant, for the ear, to give a more healthy action—I would not give an opinion upon that.</p>

I am surgeon to the National Ear Institution, Pall Mall, East—I have heard what these bottles contain—I have studied diseases of the ear—in my opinion there is not any one of the medicines calculated to restore deaf people; on the contrary, they are likely to do injury in certain conditions, because they produce great irritation, and are likely to produce very great mischief in certain conditions of the ear—the effect of acetate of lead on the ear, when the membrane is perforated, would be very injurious; and supposing it to get into the internal membrane it would be very dangerous, it might be fatal; that is to say, that substances getting into the internal ear, certain diseases of the brain might prove fatal.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you sailor-boy on board the ship Commerce? - A. Yes; on the 10th of January, between six and seven o'clock, Ritchie and Penny brought a bag of tallow into the half-deck, between the pumps and the main-mast, and it was agreed that I was to go on shore with it; I was ordered to go on shore for half a gallon of beer for the Custom-house officers; Ritchie went with me; we got the lend of the Charlotte's boat, that laid alongside of us; Penny gave the tallow into the boat to Ritchie.</p>

               <p>Q. What sort of a shop does he keep? - A. A tallow-chandler's shop, in Star-street, near King James's stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in your sailor's clothes then? - A. Yes, I was in the same dress that I am in now; after I had just entered into Star-street, there was a man of the name of Melkin asked me what I had, and where I was going to; I said, what was that to him, and went into Mr. Archer's shop; I put the bag behind the half-door, it is a door that divides into two.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop? - A. A little girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody else? - A. No; I told the girl I had brought some tallow; she stamped with her foot, and Mr. Archer was coming up, when Melkin came into the shop; then he took hold to the bag, and asked what was in it, and dragged it to the door; Mr. Archer came up out of the cellar at the same time; some words passed between Archer and Melkin, but I cannot tell what they were; I saw Archer put something into Melkin's hand; I could not hear what passed; Melkin then threw the bag into the cellar, and went away then as I thought; but he says since that, he did not; the mouth of the bag was loose, and the tallow sell out as he was throwing it down the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. What weight might there be, do you think? - A. About forty pounds; Archer and a young man were in the cellar picking it up, they fetched a thing like a frying-pan, and put it into; I went down, and helped them to pick it up; just as I came down into the cellar, Melkin came close after me, and took a sample of it; he told me to go up out of the cellar, and after that he took me to the Shadwell office.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the bag if it was produced? - A. Yes. (It is produced). There were some holes in the bag, and it was tied up in several places.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were carrying this stolen property, and was stopped by Melkin? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he took you to the office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were frightened? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Jackson. I am a serjeant in the Tower-Hamlets Militia; On the 10th of January, Wednesday evening, about seven O'clock, or it might be a little after, I saw Lumsdale with a bag, I crossed over the way, and asked him what he had got; he said, what was it to me; I felt the outside of the bag, and found it as I thought, tallow; I followed him gently down Star-street, into Archer's door, and he threw the bag down behind the door, I immediately laid hold of the bag with one hand, and Lumsdale with the other; I brought the bag to the door, I saw it was tallow; Archer then came forward, and said, do not meddle with it, for the boy may be hurt, or sent on board a man of war, I will give you half-a-crown, and you drop it, he nodded to me as if I was to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179802140063"></xptr>drop it, and I dropped it into the cellar; and I believe, as I recollect, that I did turn round, and then I went down into the cellar and took a sample of it; he gave me half-a-crown, Mr. Archer was standing at the cellar window at the time I desired the boy to go with me; I took the boy and the sack of tallow before the Magistrate; from there I went back to Mr. Archer with a Police-officer.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he understand that you were going to take the boy before a Magistrate? - A. I do not know that he did; when I came back, there was the bag empty, and the tallow put into a cask.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bag, is that the bag? - A.If it is the same bag, there are three small ties, (looks at it); there is only one tie now, I believe it to be the same bag, I do not swear positively, but I believe it to be the same. (Produces the sample of tallow).</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any bag out of your ship? - A. Not till I had a letter from the Police-office, and then I missed such a bag as this, but I cannot say whether this is it or not.</p>

On the 26th of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the female prisoner and some chrystal were brought to my house by the officer; the male prisoner was at work there at the time - the officer brought a basket of chrystals, and put them on the board; I heard the male prisoner say, "There are some officers with my wife" - I was then called by my servant, and went down - the officer asked where I kept my chrystal; I said in the top back room, and the male prisoner worked in the top front room - there is a passage and stair-case between the rooms; there are leads to the house, but he would have no business on them - in July last I picked out some chrystals, and put them into the top back room; there were some particular pieces, which I knew, and in those which the officer brought back were some of those pieces - I had never given any to the prisoner nor sold him any, nor authorized him to sell any; the whole of this chrystal belongs to myself - there is about 20lbs.; it cost me about 3l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.What are you? A. I deal and work in chrystals, minerals, and all kinds of stones, and am a butcher - I only keep the male prisoner, and a man who carries out the meat; I employ other men out of doors - the male prisoner was employed in cutting chrystals, and had been with me off and on about seven years; he worked in the front room next the street - I do not know whether a man, who wanted to know what o'clock it was, could see from the front room, but he might from the leads very easily; I do not know whether he was employed by any other person, or dealt in chrystals himself - I believe all these were part of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290077"></xptr>stock, but I have no mark on them; I know this piece to be mine, by having it several times in my hand - I have perhaps 2000 lbs. weight; my daughter and wife give out the work - I had seen this piece on the Thursday; the female prisoner was brought on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.When the woman was brought in, did you examine your stock of chrystals? A. No, but I did when the male prisoner ran away, and missed a considerable number.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I see part of this is clear, and the other part is not? A. Yes, I knocked a piece off, to see if it was clear, to go to work.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police-surveyor. On Saturday morning, the 26th of September, I was in Craven-street, and saw the female prisoner with this basket of chrystals; I asked how she came by it - she said she brought it from home, and was to have met her husband at Charing-cross, but, as he had not come, she was going back with it; I left her in charge of an officer, made inquiries, and took her to Mr. Barnett's house - in consequence of what I said, the male prisoner came down; I asked if he had given his wife any chrystal - he said Yes, he had half an hour before, and he would put on his coat and explain it to me; he went up stairs - I followed him a few steps, and he said," Come on;" I thought it was all right, and waited for him - he made his escape at the top of the house; I went up to the top of the house, and saw some saw-dust, and a foot-mark in the gutter - a person might get from the workshop window, to the window of the room where the chrystal is kept; the rooms are on the same floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What time did you meet her? A.Between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; I do not know that the prisoner was afraid of a civil process for debt.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.When he talked about his coat he did not say any thing about a civil process? A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I suppose if you had seen them in Whitechapel, or any where, you would have known them again? A. Yes, they have been so often in my hands; I do not know that there ever were such pieces any where else - (looking at some other pieces produced by the prisoners' Counsel) I know some of these to be ours; this one by a flaw, and this by its being partly coloured.</p>

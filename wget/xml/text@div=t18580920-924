I was on duty in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood, and saw the prisoner in a lane at the back of the prosecutor's house in Stainton-street, at half-past 3 o'clock in the morning—I asked him what he did, and where he came from; he said he came from White-street in the Borough, and he was going to Mr. Wright at Bermondsey, to ask him for a job, as he was a painter—I took him and searched him, and found on him this watch and a table-knife—on the way to the station I saw him put his hand over a fence and drop something; I could not see what; I went back to the place and found this other watch—I went to the prosecutor's pre<lb></lb>mises, found the window was open, and everything in confusion—this knife would open the window.</p>

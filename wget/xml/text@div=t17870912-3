            , jostled me against the wall, and took my watch out of my pocket; he came against me with his shoulder, and drove me up between him and the wall as close as he could; he ran away immediately, and I pursued him, and knocked him down, I held him fast when he was down; till I raised him up upon his feet again; I held him fast, and some people went for an officer; a great multitude gathered about me; when the officer came I delivered him to him, but never quitted hold of him myself; the watchman found a part of the watch.</p>
               <p>Did you ever lose sight of him? - No, he was was not the length of himself from me in the whole pursuit, till I knocked him down.</p>
               <p>Is the watchman here? - Yes, his name is Russel; I saw part of the glass the same night, but I did not see the guts for three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Is it here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are sure he was the person? - Yes, I am very sure, because I never lost sight of him till I went and got him put into the lock-up-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was you sober? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean to say you was perfectly sober, had you not been drinking? - No, only what I had drank at dinner, which was not above a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was it dark or moon-light when you laid hold of me? - It was under a lamp that he robbed me, so that I saw him distinctly and perfectly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I turn any corner so as to lose sight of me? - No.</p>
               <p>GABRIEL RUSSEL sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman, I was on duty, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178709120007"></xptr>saw the prisoner and the prosecutor have a scuffle, in the middle of the street, pulling and hawling one another; and I heard something go smack up against the house where I was, over my head; I paid but little regard to that just then, but looking at the prisoner and the prosecutor, I saw the prosecutor had got the prisoner down upon his back in the kennel; the prosecutor called out watch, watch, several times, and said that he had robbed him of his watch; at the same time he had fast hold of the prisoner, on hearing the prosecutor say he had lost his watch, and recollecting something being smacked against the house, I thought that might be the watch; I went immediately back to look, and I found the guts and some of the broken glass, the outside case I could not find, nor I never heard who did find it.</p>
               <p>Is that the same watch that you picked up? - Yes, it has never been out of my custody since; I saw the prosecutor have hold of the prisoner, till the officer took him away.</p>
               <p>Shew that watch to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch, there is I. B. in it, and the maker's name is Jones, and the Number is 731.</p>

               <p>Court to the prosecutor. Was that chain to it when you lost it? - Yes, I can swear to the seals and the chain too.</p>

               <p>The justice asked the watchman, if he picked up the watch; he said no, only a little bit of the glass; and I told the justice it was very hard for any body to swear to a piece of glass; he produced no watch, and the justice committed me for an assault, and they have brought the watch to lay to me a thing I know nothing about; he said he had picked up no watch at all.</p>

On Tuesday night the prisoner and another person came into my house about half after eight in the evening; they sat about an hour, drank a couple of tankards of beer, and smoked a pipe of tobacco. The prisoner came to me and said he wanted some supper; I showed him the parlour. He said that would do very well. When the supper was ready I called them out of the great parlour and told them the supper was ready, and followed them with this tankard with the remaining beer in it.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - About a quarter or half an hour after nine; when I carried in the supper, I saw no more of them for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. I said to my man, these gentlemen must have done with the meat, and desired him to carry in the cheese, which he did. About a quarter of an hour after a person brought in the prisoner, and said to me, do you know this man? I told him that I did know him, for he had just had a supper carried into the little parlour. I opened the door of the parlour, the window was open, there was nobody in the room, and the tankard, the pepper castor, and the silver spoon were gone.</p>
               <p>When the man brought him in did you know him again? - Yes; I knew him immediately. The window which was fastened, was open, the window-shutters unbolted, the curtain undrawn, and the candle left alight.</p>
               <p>Are you sure when these men were left alone in the room, that the tankard, the pepper castor, and spoon were there? - Yes, I am certain of it; I carried in the tankard, and saw the pepper castor upon the table. He desired to go into the room; I went in with him, and he immediately began to pull the tankard out of his pocket; the lid made a noise; my boy took up his coat and said See! see! he is pulling the tankard out of his pocket; it was in his side-pocket. There was the mark where the beer had run down out of the tankard in his pocket.</p>

               <p>Did he say any thing? - No, I do not recollect he said any thing. After that I took him into the great parlour to several gentlemen who were there smoking, to show them how he had served me. There he was further searched, and I saw this pepper box taken from him; it is my property, my name is upon it.</p>
               <p>What might be the worth of these things? - Five or six shillings the pepper box, and four or five pounds the tankard. The spoon I have not got yet, that I believe his partner had.</p>
               <p>These men were left alone in the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>This man was not quite sober I suppose? - I declare upon my oath I did not see that he was the least disguised in liquor; he had been three or four times at my house, and had behaved very decent and genteel.</p>
               <p>Had he been in good company in your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to have the other witnesses examined separate.</p>
               <p>(The witnesses were ordered to withdraw.)</p>
               <p>Is the parlour in Newman-street, or Oxford-street? - The windows of the large<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230035"></xptr>and little parlour both look into Newman-street.</p>

               <p>Last Tuesday se'nnight as I was going from my work about ten o'clock at night, I saw two men jump out of the window of Mr. Abbott's house. I went directly to the window, and seeing nobody in the parlour I suspected there was a robbery. I desired my fellow-servant to follow me, and I directly pursued them into Berners-street.</p>
               <p>Did they both go the same way or separate? - Both the same way. I took the prisoner; the other was about ten or a dozen yards before him. I directly brought him back to Mr. Abbott's house, and asked him if he knew any thing of the prisoner; he said he had been there before and had had a supper there.</p>
               <p>Did you go in with him when he went into the little parlour? - Yes. Directly as he went in he sidled up to a chair, and dropped the tankard in the chair.</p>
               <p>Did you see him do it? - I saw the tankard drop from his clothes. After that we took him out of the little parlour into the great parlour; there I searched him; I took out of his hand a pepper-box, a pocketbook and some keys.</p>
               <p>Have you these things in court? - The pepper-box I have; the pocket-book and keys the beadle has.</p>
               <p>What sort of keys were they; a bunch of keys? - No, loose keys; one was a street door key with a hinge in the middle to shut it together.</p>

               <p>Were you with Wellington last Tuesday se'nnight in the evening going past Mr. Abbott's house? - Yes. Going past, about ten o'clock, we saw two men jump out of the window of the little room. My fellow-servant looked into the room, and seeing nobody, he said there was some mischief done. I followed him to Berners-street, there I collared the prisoner on one side, supposing he was the man who jumped out of the window.</p>
               <p>Are you sure he is the man who jumped out of the window? - I cannot say, I lost sight of him; my fellow-servant was before me. We brought him back to Mr. Abbott's. When we brought him in, he was very desirous of going into the room; I said he should not go in till I saw Mr. Abbott. Then he went in; I stood at the door; I saw him with his hand shuffling in his pocket; I heard the tankard rattle, and immediately after I saw it on the chair.</p>
               <p>Did you see him further searched in the other room? - Yes, I saw him searched, and the pepper-box taken out of his hand.</p>

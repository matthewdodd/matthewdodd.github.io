                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's daughter—I lived with him and my late mother at 19, Cable Street—on Saturday night, 10th August, I got home between 11 and 12 o'clock, and saw my mother standing by the street door; the prisoner was in the kitchen—I had not seen my mother strike him, but he got up and said that if she struck him again he would strike her with the shovel, which he was picking up at the time; and he got up and struck her with it on the right side of her head, I think, but I cannot tell for certain; I know it was on the top of her head—she put her hand up to her head and said "Oh, my God!" but she did not fall—no blood flowed from the blow—it was with the flat part of the shovel, not the sharp</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chimney-sweep, and lived in the same house with the prisoner and my late mother—on Saturday, 10th August, I came home and saw my mother and his daughter, the last witness, standing in the shop, and the prisoner standing in the kitchen, the door of which opens into the shop—he could hear what passed between me and my mother—I said "What is the matter?"—she said "Nothing"—I said "If you go to bed, open the back door and I will come in at the back, "and when I came in again they were in the kitchen, and they followed me—I lit a candle and walked up stairs into the top back room and then walked down on to the next landing, and heard the prisoner using language which is not fit for publication—I did not see him do anything to my mother nor did she in his presence make any complaint, but she showed me her on the Sunday, and I saw a small dent which you might lay your finger in—I could not see whether the skin was out or broken, but seemed to be a white rim round it—it was not bleeding—she afterwards complained of dizziness and flashings across her eyes—she saw Mr. Low, a doctor, and had two bottles of medicine from him—he is not here.</p>

                  </hi> (M. R. C. S.) On 20th August I was called to the deceased and found her partially insensible and paralysed on the right side—she recognised me, but she could not articulate distinctly—she was not able to make any statement to me as to the cause of her illness—my attention was not then called to any injury on her head, and I did not look for it—I saw her on Wednesday and twice on Thursday and on Friday—when I went again she was dead—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination and found no injury on the body, but there was a mark of a recently healed wound on the left side, very near the centre of the head—it had apparently been a contused wound—on opening the scalp there was a congested and inflamed patch of imflammation under the external mark, and a corresponding one on the pericranium or covering of the skull—there was no mark on the internal surface of the skull, but under the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> and directly under the external mark there was a large clot of blood on the surface of the brain—she was an immensely fat woman—there was a layer of 3 or 4 inches of fat over her bowels—all the organs were moderately health; the liver was rather congested and the spleen was large—the heart was quite healthy—there was a tendency to a deposition of fat in all the organs; a tendency to fatty degeneracy—her death arose from extravasation of blood on the brain—that would not be caused by the injury, but it would predispose to the formation of the clot—the mark was evidently from some external cause, and it must have been caused by some violence, which, in such a subject, would predispose to the formation of that clot of blood—there being an interval of nine days, it prevents my being so positive; if she became paralysed immediately on the receipt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187209230043"></xptr>
               <p>of the blow, I should say that that was the cause; but during those nine days I cannot say what happened, because she died from apoplexy, which is pressure of blood on the brain—the complaint of dizziness of the head and eyes would lead me to come to the cause of the injury, but it is only an opinion—my idea is that there was an injury received which set up an injury or congestion of the vessels underneath, and some after cause might cause the blood to form, such as a violent fall, or another blow, or great excitement—there was undoubtedly mischief set up in her head, and if she had lain up and not attended to business, the chances are that it would have become absorbed—the predisposing cause was, I should say, the injury received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> It is tolerably clear that if this clot of blood had been caused at once by the blow she could not have done as she did? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Certainly—I cannot say how the dot was formed, it had evidently been formed entirely, if not altogether, at once, and I believe at the time of her being paralysed, for the clot was homogeneous throughout, which woulds how that it was all formed at one time—the substance of what I say is that she died from apoplexy, which might certainly occur constitutionally; I can only say that the blow would predispose to an attack of apoplexy—supposing there had been no blow, I should not have been surprised to find an attack of apoplexy.</p>

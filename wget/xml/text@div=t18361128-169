                  </hi>. I am an officer of Lambeth-street. I accompanied Mr. Linder to Eason's father's on the 14th of November—I got this bundle of account-Books from the younger Palmer on Wednesday the 16th, and this bundle of papers on Monday evening, the 14th, from Mr. Gorton, a cheese<lb></lb>monger in king-street, Tower-hill—I went to Palmer's house the night I saw Eason, but found it shut up—I went to some almshouses in Cooper's-row, near Crutched Friars, and saw them both in a room—I asked if they were in the habit of buying waste paper—they said they were, in small quantities, three or four pounds at the time—they bought and sold it—I told them that Mr. Linder had lost a great quantity of paper, which had been stolen by two boys, and some of them were very valuable to Mr. Linder, being ships' papers—that some of the paper had been traced to them from a shop which they had sold it to, and asked of they could give me any assistance in recovering any more of it, as the papers were of great con<lb></lb>sequence—they said they could not say exactly whether they could or not—they thought they should not recollect the two boys who had sold it—that they were in the habit repeatedly of buying and selling over the counter, and could not recollect persons who came in—I requested them to recollect as much as they could about the paper by the next morning, and told them it would be necessary for both of them to appear before the Magistrate at one o'clock next day—on the Tuesday morning they ap<lb></lb>peared, and said they had given 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for the paper, and sold it for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they appeared again before the Magistrate on Wednesday, and the younger prisoner said he had discovered two persons who had part of the papers—that he had some from Mr. Martin of Somerset-street, and had it at home at his shop if I would call for it—this book is part of what he gave me—his father was present in the office—he then said there was a larger quantity at Mr. Catchpole's, in Cable-street, Rosemary-lane—I went there, and brought away this quantity of paper, which seems principally to relate to the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> steam-packet—it weighted fifty-nine pounds—Mr. Catch<lb></lb>pole produced this bill of parcels, which he states he received from Palmer—Palmer saw it before the Magistrate—they neither of them said from whom they received what they sold—they said Eason had frequently been with paper, but denied all knowledge of Morant—Eason was not in cus<lb></lb>tody then—they did not mention his name—but pointed him out at the office—I heard Morant say he was not at all in Mr. Linder's counting-house, he never was further than the parlour door.</p>

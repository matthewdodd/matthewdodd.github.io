I live in High-street, Wapping, and have a wife, who is insane—the prisoner was at my house occasionally to attend to her—she was not a regular servant, but used to come in as a friendly neighbour—I received information on the 21st of March—I had missed a variety of articles—I went round to the pawnbrokers, and found some things that I had not missed—after that, I spoke to the prisoner, she was in the house—I asked her what she had done with the money for the things she had pledged—she denied having pledged any thing—I said it was very odd, because Mrs. Bragg was making a great noise about her crape shawl—she said she supposed she had pawned it herself, and said it was great audacity to charge so respectable a person as she was—I took her into custody on the Thursday following—she said at the station-house that she would return the duplicates, and fourteen were given up—but I found a great many more on the Monday following, not having seen her from the time she had been taken before she was taken again.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Carlisle-street, in the parish of St. Mary<lb></lb>lebone, and am a shoemaker. I have known the prisoner between three and four years—I then made her a pair of leather boots—I have seen her at different times since—on Wednesday night, the 19th of January, I was in my shop, which is part of the dwelling-house, till eight o'clock—it was a foggy evening—the shop-window was then safe, and the street-door shut and fastened—a new pane of glass had been put into the window that day, and it was then safe—a man afterwards called out to me—I went into the shop, and into the street, found the pane of glass out, and taken away—the shoes which had stood opposite it were taken from the window—a per<lb></lb>son could put a hand through the window, and take them—I missed three pairs of bluchers, and two odd ones—I found them at the station next evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Tomlinson, of Upper George-street, Bryanston-square, pawnbroker. On the 20th of January, at eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, accompanied by another female, and offered a pair of blucher boots in pawn—I asked if they were her own—she said they were her father's—I asked where he lived—she said, "No. 4, Brown-street"—we detained her while we sent a boy to inquire—my master was present—the boy returned, and said he could find nobody answering the description living there—she then said she lived in Steven-street, Lisson-grove—we sent for a policeman, and he took her and the boots—she said at the station, that a boy had given them to her to pawn.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Edwards, a butcher, at Hox<lb></lb>ton Old-town. On the 18th of January he left a pair of steps outside the evening, and found them the Tuesday-week following at Mrs. Wilmot's a broker's, nearly opposite our own house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Wilmot, a broker, at Hoxton Old<lb></lb>town. The prisoner came and offered these steps for sale, for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., last Tuesday-week, the 26th of January, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon—I said they would not fetch 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have known him in the neighbourhood about two years—he lives within twenty yards of my own house—Mrs. Edwards came over—I offered them to her for sale, and she claimed them—I told her who I bought them of—the prisoner is a brush-maker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner, and told him the charge—he said he found the steps in a court close to his house, a week previous, as he was going to the theatre—he lives about one hundred yards from the prosecutor's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I was going with my wife to the theatre on the Monday-week, previous to my selling them, and my wife and another girl kicked against the steps—I took them up—I could see nobody belonging to them, and took them home—I kept them till Tuesday-week, when having no money, and my wife being ill, I sold them to Mrs. Wilmot, who has been my landlady for twelve months—does it stand fessible I should sell them to her if I had stolen them?</p>

On the Monday evening I was going to the penny theatre with the prisoner and his wife, about five o'clock—as we were going down Davis-place I saw a pair of step lying in the court—I kicked my foot over them—he said, "Mind the steps, or you will fall over them"—I took no more notice of them, but went to the play.</p>

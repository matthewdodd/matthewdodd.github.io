She paid four and six-pence a week. There was no one besides herself. She left the lodgings in April without my knowledge. I suspected that she had stolen some things, when I found the door was locked. An officer was sent for, and he broke open the door. There was a pair of sheets, a bed quilt, a looking glass, and a flat-iron missing. I saw them afterwards at the pawnbrokers, Mrs. Fothergill's and Mr. Summer's, and Gadesby's.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The humble petition of Elizabeth Green, sheweth, that she is an unfortunate woman, and rented a room of the prosecutrix, for the weekly sum of four shillings and sixpence; that your petitioner always most punctually paid her rent, until this time, when she was driven by distress to commit the act which has brought her before this bar. She fully intended, and told the prosecutrix that she would, leave every thing as she found it. I was about to go and get these things out, when the officer took me into custody, and I surrendered up the tickets freely, and without hesitation. By receiving the mercy of the honourable judge and jury, your petitioner will for ever feel bound to pray.</p>

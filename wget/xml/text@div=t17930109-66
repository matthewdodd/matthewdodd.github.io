These legs were taken from our house in an unfinished state, nearly finished but not quite; one pair of them was taken to Mr. Read's and he was asked whether he could do any thing to make them softer; I went down to Mr. Read's, and I saw they were our legs by the mark that is on them; knowing that we never sold legs in that state, that they must be stolen, I asked Mr. Read who left them there, he said one

Did it not strike you as an odd thing that he should have boots to sell? - I thought they were given him, and Mr. Skillet told me, they were damaged legs every one; they stunk with some stuff, and were all over mould; I did not ask him any questions about them.

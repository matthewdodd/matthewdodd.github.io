On the 9th of August the prisoner came and asked for a pair of shoes; I had not a pair she liked - I said I had a pair of black ones, but she asked for red ones; she looked out a pair - I was to nail them for her, and she was to have them the next day - she was going out; my apprentice said she had a pair of shoes under her shawl, and she dropped a pair at her feet - I felt then and saw them at her feet; I was flurried - she ran out, and went up a passage; I was not able to hold her - she tore her clothes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was she not to return the next day and pay for some? A. Yes; she did not move from the spot - my apprentice is not here.</p>

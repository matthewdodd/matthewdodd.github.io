                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Neptune-court, St. George's, East—it is my own house—I had a pair of trowsers, jacket, a sovereign, some half-crowns and shillings, belonging to Hector Steel—three ear-rings and two handkerchiefs belonging to myself—the ear-rings were in my ears—on the 16th of Jan. I saw the prisoner at Stepney—I was coming home with Hector Steel, and fell in with the prisoner, and we all came home to my house to<lb></lb>gether, between twelve and one at night—we all three had something to drink there, and I told the prisoner he might lie on the sofa down stairs, as it was late, and I would go up stairs to bed with Steel—the prisoner remained</p>

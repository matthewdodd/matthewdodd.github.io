                  </hi>. I am a dairyman, in London-road, Rotherhithe—I saw the prisoner driving this horse, about 300 yards from the accident—he had got the reins bound round his hands and his feet on the foot-board, pulling the mare as hard as he could, and she was dragging the cart entirely by her mouth—she had not got the traces tightened at all; they were hang<lb></lb>ing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186505080043"></xptr>
               <p>half-way on the ground, so that the reins were acting as traces—that was the state of things all the way along.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are you an acquaintance or friend of the prisoner's? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never saw him before that day—I first observed him as he left the railway arch, coming down the hill—I was standing at my door watching the things going down—it was Good Friday—I was not examined before the Magistrate—the distance from the railway to where the accident hap<lb></lb>pened is about 250 or 300 yards—there is a curve near where the accident hap<lb></lb>pened—there was a large number of persons passing along the road, and a considerable amount of traffic; more than usual, being Good Friday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the horse trotting or galloping? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Trotting the whole way; what I should call a runaway trot, drawing the cart entirely by the mouth.</p>

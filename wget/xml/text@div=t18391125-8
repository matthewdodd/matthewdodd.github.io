                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Greenhill, Harrow. On the 20th of October, on going round my farm, I missed a Welsh sheep, which I had seen the day before—I had one hundred altogether, and they were right the day before—I went round the field, and in a ditch found the skin and entrails tied up together—the skin was marked "R I "—the initials of the man that brought them from Wales—I found foot-marks by the skin, and traced them about a mile and a quarter or a mile and a half—I went afterwards with the patrol to the prisoner's house—I traced the footsteps to there—the prisoner was at the door—the patrol told him I had lost a sheep, and he had come in search of it—the prisoner said he had not got any thing but what belonged to him, and he might search—I remained outside while they went in—I afterwards went into the cottage, and saw in a dish on the table the head and, legs, a small piece of pluck, and about half the loin—they were all boiled—I asked him bow he came by the meat—he said that was his business—he said he had bought it of a man who was driving a drove through to at place—I asked if he knew the meat—he said, No"—he afterwards said he did know him—that he would not tell me who he was than, but he would another day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 41). On the 26th of October I went with Mr. Hodsdon to Spencer's house—I saw him at the door, and told him the prosecutor had lost a sheep and suspected it was brought to his cottage, as there were marks of footsteps from where it was killed to his door—he said I was welcome to come in—I did so, and found no undressed meat—there was a pot on the are—I asked what it was—he said a sheep's head—I said there was more thane that—he said, yes, there was, part of a leg—I found a head, a leg, part of the loin, and the pluck—I laid it on a dish on the table—the prosecutor said he thought it was his as it was fresh killed and small—the prisoner was put into the cage—I searched him, and his son Henry said, "Father, the last tine he took you he took your knife away, he shall not take it away this time, because you have got never a one"—I went to the cage next morning and found him lying on his back with his hands stretched out and his throat cut—I went for a doctor,</p>

               <p>who sewed up his throat—I remained with him four hours, and then the doctor got an order for him to go into the Hendon Union.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a patrol. On the 20th October I went to the prisoner's house—he was in custody at the time—I heard Butler ask where he got the mutton from—he said that was his business—he afterwards asked him again, and he said he bought it of a man with a drove—he would not tell the man's name—I went to Hodsdon's and traced footsteps across three fields—I found the prosecutor's shepherd there, and we did not trace further than that, but found the same traces coming back again, and a dog's foot with it—I know the prisoner has a dog—I traced the step to the prisoner's back door—I found no boots that corresponded with the steps—I told the prisoner the step was traced to his door—he immediately came out and put his foot on it and stamped it out—the boots he had on did not tally with the mark, and they were quite clean and dry, and had not been out.</p>

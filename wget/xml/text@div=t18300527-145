The prisoner was in my employ till the 27th of March - on the 13th of April I missed this property, and on the 27th of April I found it in his lodging, where I went with a search-warrant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where did you miss this printed cotton from? A. From a roll which I had of it- it was not made up; it had been in the second floor back room - I have two men <rs id="t18300527-145-deflabel792" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18300527-145-defend1226 t18300527-145-deflabel792"></join>s and two maids; the maids had access to that room - the prisoner was in my employ four years, and behaved well; I had some changes to make, and did not want him - he was in the employ of a baker named Watts, at Camden-town; I had not asked him to come back - I found this cotton up at his window, made into a curtain; it had no mark - I only know it by the pattern: I had not applied to him to conduct a business for me in Oxford-street - my father took that shop, and wished to know if he was disengaged, and would go and live with him - that was the day after he left me; he did say he had bought this two years before, in Tottenham-court-road, and I believe the officer went there; I never knew the exact quantity I had of this cotton, but it appeared not so bulky as it had been.</p>

            . I went with the prosecutor on the 27th of April to No. 92, Park-street, Camden-town, where the prisoner lodged; I waited till his wife got up - I took this curtain down from the window; the prosecutor said it was his - I found nothing else that he could identify; the prisoner's wife said she had bought it some time before - I then took a quilt, which has a piece of the same pattern in it, but a different ground; I went to Mr. Hewitson's, in Tottenham-court-road, where the prisoner said his wife bought it; I asked if they had any of the same - they said No, for it was a pattern they supposed twenty or thirty years old, and they never had it: the pattern is two men in a boat, and in the curtain here is only one, and here is some green which there is not in the curtain.</p>

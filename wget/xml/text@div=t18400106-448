                  </hi>I am son of John Howorth. On Thursday night, the 28th of November, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner came for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco, and gave me a bad shilling—I put it into the till, and gave him change—there was no other bad money in the till—a boy came twenty minutes after, and gave me a bad shilling, and then the woman brought me one—these three shillings were the only ones in the till—I took them from the till shortly afterwards, and one was weighed by my mother, after that I put them into the till again—my father came about eight o'clock—I showed him the three shillings—he called the policeman in, marked them, and gave them to my mother.</p>

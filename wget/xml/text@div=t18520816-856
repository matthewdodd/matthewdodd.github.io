                  </hi>. I am a labourer and live in New-street, Borough. On 29th June I was at work at a dust yard, at Rotherhithe—the prisoner was at work there about half past 1 o'clock—we are both Irishmen—when I came in after dinner, there was work thrown on me which I had no right to do, by a man that worked alongside of me—I objected to do it—the prisoner was working up over me on a hill of dust—he said if I did not do it he would put me out of the yard—I said he dare not do it—they came and gathered round me; one of the five struck me with a brick in the mouth, which knocked out one tooth, and loosened three more; the prisoner came up, stabbed me with a knife in the shoulder, and gave me three or four kicks in the belly—I did not fall then, but was knocked down afterwards with a pot—I was in the hands of a doctor afterwards—I had offered to fight the prisoner.</p>

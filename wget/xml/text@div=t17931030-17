               <p>Q. Do you remember being in the house when it was broke open? - The street door was on the latch. I was gone backward into the yard, and my front parlour door was on the latch, Mrs. Duck was up stairs, she is a very old woman, that very seldom goes out; the prisoner opened my front room door, and went through my front room into my bed room, and took my husband's property; I saw them through a window.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the door was shut? - I shut it after him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before? - Not half a minute, I am sure it was on the latch.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that positively? - Yes, I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you so positive? - Because I latched it again; I saw the prisoner in my room, I did not see him open the door to come in; I looked through the parlour window, and when I saw him in the room I turned round and met him at the parlour door, and he had got my husband's blue coat, &amp;c. I hallooed stop thief! he ran out of the door before me, and was taken in less than four or five minutes, not more; my son followed him directly on my calling stop thief; I saw him try to fling some things over some pales into a garden, and they hitched on some of the pales on the top, and I went and took them immediately;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179310300018"></xptr>I gave them to the constable.</p>

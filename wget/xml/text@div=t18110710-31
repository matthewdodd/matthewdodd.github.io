               <p>Q. In the course of last month was the prisoner in your father's employ - A. He was. On Saturday the 22nd of June we lost the carcase of a pig, we missed it between eight and nine in the morning, and within half an hour after the pig was missed the prisoner came and said to me, sir, I understand there is a pig lost again, I can throw some light upon it; I said I should be glad if he could; he said he was going in with some meat, and he heard some words. He took me up to Middlesex hospital, and from there to the Haymarket, we found no tidings of the pig, about half past four that afternoon I received some information which led me to Paskin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your pig again - A No. We took the prisoner up the same afternoon about six o'clock, I told him what we took him for; he said he knew nothing about the pig.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you seen the wash-house window open the night before? - A. No; I saw it at one o'clock the day before, when I came home to dinner, it is a place that we never have occasion to open in the winter time; the bead that confines the window was taken off, and laid by the sink, inside of the wash-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any light? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who uses this wash-house, I suppose, the family and the servants? - A. Yes, but we had no servants at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How is it situated? - A. Close to my dwelling.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no inward communication? - A. No; only by the flews, there is no door, it is built against the wall close up to the house, and immediately adjoins in the yard, enclosed with a wall.</p>
               <p>Q.Do not the lodgers wash in it? - A.Nobody washes in it, at present, but my wife, for the lady in the first floor does not wash at home.</p>

             sworn. - In the morning of the 14th of December, a few minutes after six o'clock in the morning, I was awaked out of my sleep by the cry of thieves; I came down without putting my cloaths on, and at the bottom of the stairs, I heard that the prisoner was secured, I told them to keep him while I put my cloaths on; when that was done, I came into the yard, and interrogated the prisoner; I said, what have you got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179801100086"></xptr>nothing to do, but to come to break open the house, and to disturb people at this time of the night? and he said, it is true, sir, I do come for that purpose; what, says I, do you come for the purpose of breaking open the house? yes, sir, says he, It is the first offence I ever committed, I never will do so any more, I hope you will forgive me, and concluded, by adding, that he was drove to it by distress, or poverty, I cannot say which was the word that he made use of; I went into the washhouse, and saw the cloth that was round the copper all torn off, and the door laid about the middle of the wash-house, the prisoner was secured and taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Bristow.) Q. What was usually kept in that wash-house? - A. Utensils about the house; our yard is so exposed, that we never leave any thing there of value.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, it seems to me, that the prisoner cannot be convicted upon this indictment; he is indicted for breaking the dwelling-house, with intent to steal the goods, and stealing a copper door, the property of

            ; the evidence has shewn, that about six in the morning, when there was occasion for a candle, the prosecutor discovered the prisoner in the wash-house, and he found the copper door lying upon the ground, but that could not be a stealing of the goods, it must be laid to be assixed to the freehold; and as to the charge of breaking, with intent to steal the goods, it does not appear that there were any moveable goods in the place.</p>

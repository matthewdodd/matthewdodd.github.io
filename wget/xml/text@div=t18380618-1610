                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in High-street, Deptford. On the 12th of June, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was at the fair and felt a pressure round me—I heard a scuffle behind me, and some one said, "You have picked the gentleman's pocket"—I did not feel any thing at my pocket, but the officer said to me, "Is this your handkerchief?"—I said, "It is"—I am not certain whether it was in the hands of the officer or the prisoner.</p>

On the evening of the 12th of June, I was on duty at the fair in plain clothes—I saw the prisoner tab this handkerchief from Mr. Currie's pocket—I immediately laid hold of his hand with the handkerchief in it—he stooped down, and was about to throw it away—one portion of it was on the ground, and part in his hand, when I took him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of James Bentley, a publican at New-cross, Deptford. On the 12th of June, I was in Deptford fair, and saw the prisoner trying two or three gentlemen's pockets—I walked along, and after a while saw him at the prosecutor's pocket, and saw him take the handkerchief out—Wild laid hold of him with the handkerchief in his hand, as he was about to throw it away.</p>

               <p>"No." I said, she was the person that was described to me; she coloured up and said nothing. I told her to come back - she said, she would not, for she must go and sell her things which she had in her basket. I said, she had taken two half-crowns from the till - she said nothing to that, and returned with me at last, and said, if I would let her go, she would give them to me - she said, she had them in her shoe. I took her shoe off, and found them.</p>

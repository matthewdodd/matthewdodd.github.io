                  </hi>. I am a seaman; I lodge at No. 18, Severn-street, St. George's; I have been for the last three years in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company, as a lighterman; I was engaged as a lighterman in their service at Vancouver's Island. I came home from there in the <hi rend="italic">Norman Morrison</hi>—she left Vancouver's Island in March—on leaving the island I had 136<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in my possession; it was in twelve fifty dollar pieces, four tens, four fives, one single dollar, and a twenty dollar piece—they were all gold coins, and there were six silver dollar pieces, several diems, or sixpences, and one English shilling—I am a married man—my wife was with me at Vancouver's Island—I received 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year wages for three years, and my wife took in washing—she came home with me—she is not here today; she is close to her con-finement—we expected her to have been confined on board—she was very bad when I left home this morning—I took out 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods with me to the island, and I cleared between 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by them; I got between 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them on the island—that, with my wife's earnings, and my own, was the way in which I made my money—when I first left the island I had the money in a leather belt, with pockets in it—I afterwards had it sewn up; before that, I gave it in charge of the apprentice, George Naunton, for four or five days, on board the ship, till I got settled on board; and after that I received it all safe from the apprentice, and then had the belt sewn up by the sailmaker on board the ship—I wore the belt always about me till we came oft' Cape Horn, when we had some bad weather—I then left it off, and put it into a small basket inside my chest—in the course of two days after<lb></lb>wards I went to look for it, and it was gone—I made an alarm to the captain of the ship—the captain has got the date down in the log; it was in May—I know the prisoners, and knew them on the island; they went out in the same ship as I did originally—they were labouring men on the island—they were invalided by the Company, who sent them home—they had been sick on the island; I cannot say for bow long, but for a long while, or else the Company would not have sent them borne—I do not know whether they were in the habit of trading at all—while we were on board I bought a pipe of Wicks, for a dollar and a quarter; I went to my chest for it, and I paid him with a five franc piece—Wicks saw me go to the chest—he and Lane were sitting on Wicks' chest at the time—our cabins were opposite one another, between decks—Lane was between decks, and there was Wicks, his wife, and two children—I do not know the age of the eldest; I did say up at the Court that it was about fourteen or fifteen years of age; it looks about that—Lane has no family—it may have been a week before I missed my money that Lane and Wicks saw me go to my chest for the dollar—to the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge, it was in the middle of the day that I discovered my loss—my chest was unlocked—the captain sent the doctor and the chief mate all over the ship to make search—I was present when the boxes of the prisoners were searched—I saw what the doctor found in them, except the three fifty dollar pieces belonging to Wicks—I did not see them found, because I was called away at the time—the money was all laid out for me to look at—I was there when Wicks' box was searched—I saw the other coin found, but not the three fifty dollar pieces—in Lane's box nine fifty dollar pieces, and a great sum more money, was found; I do not know how much altogether—the captain has got it all down, and he can tell—Lane had some twenty dollar pieces; how many I cannot tell—I was not able at the time to identify any part of the money that was found—one of my fifty dollar pieces had a <hi rend="italic">nitch</hi> in it, as I reported to the captain on the same day—I have not seen that since—I saw it at the</p>

                  </hi>.

I was captain of the <hi rend="italic">Norman Morrison.</hi> I remember the prosecutor complaining of having been robbed on the 14th of May, the sums he mentioned are in my log (<hi rend="italic">reading</hi>); twelve 50-dollar pieces, one 20-dollar piece, four 10-dollar pieces, three 5-dollar pieces, one 1-dollar piece, that was in gold—in silver there were 6 dollars, 4 diems, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in answer to my question he gave me a description of one 50-dollar piece; he said one 50-dollar piece was slightly indented in the edge; it did not appear to be filed, and it was an old piece—he did not mention to me anything about two marked pieces in reference to Lowe—we came to England about 14th or 17th of July—we came in the dock on the 1st of August—the boy Naunton gave me the two dollars I produce to-day—I gave direction to my surgeon and mate to search the ship—in consequence of that certain money was found in possession of the two prisoners; in Wicks' possession there were three 50-dollar pieces, one 20-dollar piece, one 16-dollar piece, that is a doubloon; five 10-dollar pieces, two 5-dollar pieces, and three English sovereigns, in gold, and 197 1/2 dollars in silver, 24-quarter dollars in English and American money, 4 dollars of silver, and a bill for 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there were three 50-dollar pieces on Wicks, and nine 50-dollar pieces on Lane—till I arrived in Eng<lb></lb>land Lane and Wicks were in possession of their money; I then took possession of it—it is here with the men's own seal on it; it has never been broken—Metcalfe has never had an opportunity of seeing these moneys in my possession.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Open the parcel, and produce the twelve 50-dollar pieces? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> These are them—these nine 50-dollar pieces are Lane's—these are the other three that were on Wicks—the ship was searched, and the other men's money was searched as well as these—I did not find a 50-dollar piece in possession of any other man in the ship—these moneys remained in possession of Lane and Wicks till they were sealed up—I did not consider myself justified in taking it away—I took it away when I thought there was a possibility of their making away with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Metcalfe examine the money in your presence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not in my presence—the report was made to me by the surgeon and mate—I spoke to Metcalfe afterwards—he said the mark he spoke of was not to be found—if he had identified any of the coins I should certainly not have let the money remain in possession of the prisoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prosecutor at any time tell you that Lowe had two marked</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185308150101"></xptr>
               <p>pieces of money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a report from the chief officer, the prosecutor did not make any report to me—he knew that I had taken the coins down—he was fully aware of the whole matter—he frequently spoke to me after the robbery as to what measures he should adopt to recover the money—he did that once or twice from 14th May till we made London—he did it about the early part of July—he never said one word about the marked dollars—he never told me about Lowe having the marked dollars till they were in my possession, and I had sent for him and mentioned it to him—I believe he was aware of the fact before I told him—the prisoners had conducted themselves quite well—Vancouver's Island is a place where emigrants pick up money—I know nothing positively about Lane's employment on the island—I simply know that when I arrived he was in the service of the Rev. Mr. Steane, the clergyman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You had conversation with Metcalfe before and after these dollars were given up by Lowe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; be consulted me on the measures he should take on more than two occasions—I gave him such advice as I thought was right—I took possession of the money, that he might take what steps he pleased—my crew consisted of thirty men—all their boxes were searched.</p>

               <p>Bartley. By stamping upon her left side, till the blood guished upwards and downwards from her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before she died, did you see those marks upon her?</p>
               <p>Bartley. It was some time before she died; Mr. Morris used to come to see her very often, and he would give her a few halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she for health before?</p>
               <p>Bartley. She was in very good health when she came into the neighbourhood; that was two or three months before she died; but since she has been dead, I have heard she was in a very bad state of health before, by the foul distemper.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he use to give her money before she went into the workhouse?</p>

             M'Carty. I am journeyman to Mr. Bartley, the deceased worked in my room some considerable time; she seemed to be in a very bad state of health at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she work in your room before she died?</p>

               <p>M'Carty. About seven or eight weeks; she seemed to be in a very good state of health about February or March last; but she seemed to be pretty big with child, the prisoner has often came and importuned her in a candid manner to go out; I believe about a month before she died, I saw black marks about her face; she languished in my room, several days before she died; but she lay in her lodgings next door but one to me, she was only in my room on days. The prisoner came to my room one morning, in a very candid manner, and took her out; they staid out a little later than ordinary.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before her death?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. It may be about six or seven weeks before; he sent for half a gallon of beer, and then they took a walk together in a good natured way. The next morning she came to work, she had a bruise on the side of her head, and a mark or scratch on her nose, and a black eye, nothing extraordinary desperate. She said, the rogue has almost killed me last night, and her hand on her side, and said, she should not be able to live. I said, What is the matter you whore? Said she, some time ago, do you remember, when I was with child? I said, I do not know whether you was or not you whore. She said, I have got such a hurt on my side, I know not that I shall get over it. She said, one night he had some keys in her care, and he asked her for them, that he knocked her down with his fist, (she was a scratch-cat creature,) she got up again, and he knocked her down again; his old mother called out, kick her guts out, d - n the bich, and she called out murder; and she said, she had a bruise on her side.</p>

               <p>Q. On which side was it?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. I cannot tell that, she said,

             gave it her; that he stamped upon her, and the watchman came to the door, and there was no entrance.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before her death?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. I believe this was five or six weeks before she told me this; but the thing happened some time in April or May last.</p>
               <p>Q. When they went out together, as you say, in a good natured way, when was that?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. That was about a month or six weeks before her death; and when she came back, she said, her hat flew off, and she turned round to take it up, and he knock'd her down; that was the time that she had marks on her face.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she say this was?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. She said, this was in Parker's-lane; she said, as she arose, he hit her a blow on the belly, and kick'd her, and made the blood gush out both ways.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this told you in the presence of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. Yes, it was?</p>
               <p>Q. What was his answer?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. He said, you richly deserved it you know; I never saw the man use her ill in my life, or ever heard him give her a bad word before that time.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she for temper?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. A turbulent violent creature, and as great a liar.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen them often together?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. Yes, very often; and I have drank with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How has been his behaviour to her?</p>
               <p>M'Carty. I always saw him behave the gentleman to the woman, all my life-time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176110210061"></xptr>Q. Repeat his answer to her ( when she related his ill usage to her,) the very words as near as you can recollect.</p>
               <p>M'Carty. He said, You whore, it is justly what you deserved, it was your own fault. She said, You bloody son of a bitch, you thief you murderer, you kick'd me down. He smiled at her, at the time, with all the good nature in the world. Come along now, said he, and away they went out together; there is the man now before my face. he knows it.</p>
               <p>John Brown. The deceased lodged at my house a fortnight, she was coming home one night to her lodgings, and Mr. Morris met her at my door.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Brown. This was about three months ago; I was shutting my shutters up at half an hour past 11. Mr. Morris knock'd her down, the woman said to me. Mr. Brown, I wish you would be so good as to come over here; I am murdered; this was facing my door. She came into her lodgings, her nose had a cut upon it, and her left eye was swelled; I said to her (as I saw it,) If you will go along with me, I will go to Mr. Welch's, and get a warrant the next morning. No, said she; if I was to go to get a warrant, I should be murdered.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you this talk?</p>
               <p>Brown. This was in my shop, she quitted her lodging the next day.</p>

The next morning after she came again, with her arm to her left side, and shewed me a black mark under her left breast; I thought it look'd like fresh done, with the heel of a man's shoe. All her continual story was, Morris, Morris, has been the death of me; he has given me my death's wound, and I shall never get over it. When she was bad, Mr. Morris came and visited her very kindly; she lodg'd but next door to us, but she came and worked at our house; he used to come like a gentleman, with the best of behaviour, and the best of manners, and gave her the best of words.</p>

She told me, she and Mr. Morris kept company together, and at the time when she was with child, he used her very ill, and she miscarried upon the account of it. But after that, he used her very well, her words were exceeding well; she said, they went out once together, and in Parker's-lane he struck her; she came home with a black eye, and a scratch upon her nose; she complained terribly of a pain in her side; she said, whether she had it by a fall, or by a kick, she knew not: but it was done in the quarrel that Morris and she had; I never saw him carry it otherwise than well to her.</p>

             I went to her, she was sitting on a bed; she said to Mr. Haywood, who was with me, You need not have troubled yourself to get me into the workhouse, for I have got a friend. I then went home, and in about two hours, she came from her lodging to my house, and said, she did know whether she had a friend or not, or such like words, and accepted of the work house. After that, some body told me, if that woman died, Mr. Morris would be brought into question. I called upon Mr.

             the day following, and said, I understood you have been a friend to this poor woman; our workhouse is not a proper place for her, I think an hospital is better. He reply'd, she had been in an hospital; I desired him o call at my house, if he had any thing more to say about it, but know nothing of his calling. I went to her at the workhouse, and told her, I heard that if she died, Mr. Morris would be called to an account. I asked her, if he was the occassion of her death, if she died; she said, she had got the better of it, or words to that effect. After she was dead, we went to Mr. Howard in Covent-Garden, and he came and saw the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the body opened?</p>
               <p>Storton. No, it was not.</p>

               <p>I stand here accused for murder, that I am innocent of; not only that, but the murdering a person that I had a very tender respect for, which I shall make the court sensible of, and that she died a natural death; I never used her with the least degree of cruelty; I ever shewed her the greatest respect and kindness; we were very intimate together; yet in our intimacy, little quarrels sometimes arose, and I cannot say, but that I might give her a little slap, but not to do her the least injury; I have very rarely given her a little slap.</p>

            . I am apothecary to the workhouse of St. Giles's; I remember the deceased being there, I attended her; I asked her if she had been beat, because she complained of a pain in her side. She told me no. She had not received any injury from any body. I said, tell me particularly, or I cannot tell what to give you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she under your care when she died?</p>
               <p>Penfold. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she charge or discharge any body?</p>
               <p>Penfold. She did not mention any person to me, or to any body else, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think was the cause of her death?</p>
               <p>Penfold. She was in a languishing condition, and almost starved for want; I found her very low, and very weak, she had a decay upon her. She said, she had but very little victuals to eat. My opinion was, she died of a decay, not by any violence of any kind in the world. I asked her, if there were any marks of violence upon her; she said, no.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the nurse's name?</p>

            . I was the nurse that attended this woman, deceased; the day before she died Mr. Morris came to see her, she seemed to be very bad; she said, she had got a great cold, and a violent purging; I hearing of this affair, I really taxed her with the thing. I said, you are very bad; if you have received any violent blows, or abuse from this man, or any body else, don't die with a lie in your mouth, but tell the truth, that they may be brought to justice. She said, Nurse, no, I have not received any ill usage from any body, neither will I lay my death to his charge upon any account.</p>

               <p>M. Woodcock. I believe as much as any thing, it was from a violent cold upon her bowels, and a violent purging.</p>

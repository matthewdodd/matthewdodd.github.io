On the 12th or 13th of September, I marked my money and put it on my desk in the parlour. The prisoner has lived five or six years with me, I suspected him, as he dressed a good deal - I marked the shillings and halfpence in the evening, and next morning 1 s. 7 d. was gone. I sent for an officer, who searched him - he gave me a key of his box from his pocket, which I tried to my desk, it fitted it perfectly well, he then gave me some silver from his waistcoat pocket, 2 s. of which I knew, and in his coat pocket three halfpence were found, which I had marked - he had no occasion to go to the desk.</p>

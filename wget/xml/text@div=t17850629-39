             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. I believe you was taken up for stealing this lace? - Not for stealing it.</p>
               <p>Court. That is only to her credit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I submit it goes a great deal further, it will go to her competency, to prevent her being let in now, she is the principal felon, there is no ground at present.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you? - A servant out of place, I lived with a painter and glazier, in St. James's-street, Covent Garden, at Mr. Saint Clare's, I was out of place at the time this lace was taken away; I went to drink tea with the prisoner Molly, and she asked me if I would sell some lace for her, I asked her how she came by it, she said it was given her by a person who came from abroad, I sold them for her, and she had the money, I delivered it to Mrs. Samuel, she sold it, she lives in St. Martin's-lane, I do not know how much there was, but I can tell you how much money there was, it was thread lace, a piece of lappeting at four shillings a yard.</p>
               <p>How much money was it? - First she had thirty-four shillings, then she had a guinea, and next eleven shillings.</p>
               <p>Do you remember the quantity of lace? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was it once, or twice, or three times? - Three times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The lace that you received, you delivered to Mrs. Samuel? - Yes, I did not measure it, or take any particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>How much had you from Mrs. Samuel? - The same I gave her.</p>
               <p>You understood this was a bit of smuggled lace, did not you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Who told you to go for the keys? - The prisoner at the bar told me to unlock that press , and to take out some lace and give it to her.</p>
               <p>Where was the prisoner? - She stood in the yard, and took the lace from me.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now you must know you was committing felony at this time? - She said , if I told, I should be hanged, but she should not be hurt.</p>
               <p>She told you this before you took it? - No, Sir, after I had taken it.</p>
               <p>How soon did you tell anybody? - I did not tell it at all till it was found out, I was afraid.</p>
               <p>Was you taken up? - No, Sir, that young lady carried me to my aunt's, and they kept me up stairs I believe from about two o'clock, till about eight or nine at night.</p>
               <p>Did they give you any victuals? - No, Sir, I was not to have victuals till I told, I did not say a word about it all these hours, for I was afraid to tell.</p>
               <p>At eight o'clock what did they do to you, what did Miss De Charmae say to you, who was with you? - My aunt, she ask-me about it, and I said, I knew nothing about it.</p>

            . I gave the laces to Mrs. De Charmae .</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Can you swear that these laces that Mrs. Samuel gave you are the same? - Yes, by the length they are the same, I did not measure them.</p>
               <p>Then how can you swear to the length? - The prisoner told me the length.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they of the same quality and sort? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you believe them to be the same? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long were they at Mrs. Samuel's? - A week, I do not know what has been done with them to night, I know the pattern.</p>
               <p>Is it any common pattern, or is there anything curious in it? - Not very curious.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. This is my lace, I can swear to it, the patern is familiar to me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178506290045"></xptr>Have they any shop marks on them? - No, they have taken away the shop marks and private marks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Those that you lost, you lost with a private mark, and Custom-house mark? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How often do you take an account of your stock? - Once a year.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, I humbly submit to you, here is no evidence to put the prisoner on her defence, the property is not proved, that these are the same laces that were given to Mrs. Samuel.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. He has spoken as much to the property, as a person can do to property of that nature, Pennington swore, she sold some lace which she received of the prisoner to Mrs. Samuel, she demanded that lace of Mrs. Samuel, and received it back again; therefore, if there is any charm, it is in Mrs. Samuel; therefore, it is still a matter of fact, of which the Jury are to be satisfied, whether it is the same lace.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then I submit that the evidence goes to prove a receiver if it proves anything.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Buller. No, the prisoner first of all tempted the girl to take the lace, and the prisoner herself stands in the garden at the time, and receives it from her out of the window.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mrs. De Charmae , how long had the prisoner lived with you? - Eight months, and we took her to be very honest.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses who gave her a very good character.</p>
               <p>The Jury retired for sometime, and returned with a verdict</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 78, Kingsland Road—on Saturday night, 2nd March, about 10 o'clock, I was coming along Kings<lb></lb>land Road, and turned into a urinal—I turned out of it towards the rail<lb></lb>way arch, and the prisoner Marvin said to me "George, would you oblige me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187204080063"></xptr>
               <p>with a match?"—I said "I have not the pleasure of knowing you, but I will give you a match"—when I had done so he said "You will know me better now," and caught me by the throat and arm, and tried to throw me down—he whistled, and four men came up—Haynes and Homerton are two of them—they caught me by the legs and lifted me up—I thought they were going to throw me over the wall by the side of the canal—they kicked me and fumbled me all over, and tore my coat all to pieces—I turned over and said "I shall know every one of you "—they took my silver watch and two half-crowns and fourpence—my watch was fastened round my neck, and through a button-hole into my waistcoat pocket—they broke off a piece of the chain, and left the rest hanging round my neck, which was cut by the chain—I said "I shall know you again," and they turned me over, and all five kicked me in the ribs and between my legs, so that I was obliged to go to a doctor—they ran away towards the railway arch—I lay there, and the parties who passed did not assist me—ultimately a gentleman assisted me to get up, and I sat on the bridge till I got a little better, and another gen<lb></lb>tleman assisted me to the station-house, where I gave a description of the parties—Marvin then had a black moustache—I had seen Homerton before—I have no doubt that these are three of the men who robbed and assaulted me.</p>

It was 10 o'clock when I was knocked down—I said so before the Magistrate—they all kicked me before they ran away—Haynes did not kick me when I was knocked down at first, he only caught hold of my legs; but he kicked me just before he ran away—I was then down on the ground—I was lying close against the wall when other parties passed me—some of them were on the same side that I was, and some on the other—I am a Christian—there were two lamps six and nine yards off, and the moon was shining—I had never seen Marvin or Haynes before—I saw Marvin next when the policeman went into a public-house, and came back and said to me "Go into that public house, and see if there is any one you know," and I went in and picked Marvin out from fourteen or fifteen.</p>

I am an ostler, of 8, Laurel Street—I was examined at the Police Court—I get my living at the Victoria, Queen's Road, watering and minding gentlemen's carriages and traps—Marvin was there all the afternoon and evening of Saturday, 2nd March—I kept going in and out, and saw him up to a little after 10 o'clock—I did not get any drink to harm me till past 11 o'clock—I was in the private bar from 10.30, and did not see him again until the house closed, and then he went home with me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carver, and live at 71, Howe Street, Kings<lb></lb>land Road—I remember Saturday, 2nd March—I was acting as chairman in the concert-room at the Cherry Tree, in the Kingsland Road—I have been engaged there for the last fifteen months—I know Homerton—I saw him there that night—I was in the chair at 9 o'clock—he came in about 9.30, and never left till 11.30—he was sitting at the right-hand side of me—he was not out of the Cherry Tree during all that time that I could notice—he was not out of the room, or I should have missed him—he was at the same table, and at my right hand—he left when I closed the room at 11.30—I have seen the prosecutor in this case and Homerton together in the Cherry Tree tap-room—I heard the prosecutor ask the witness Barter one day how Homerton got his living, but that was weeks and weeks before he said he had lost anything—I heard that there was a difference between the prosecutor and Homerton—I did not hear it pass between them—I gave my evidence at the Police Court on the Tuesday after the remand—I did not attend on the first occasion because I was engaged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Homerton was taken into custody out of the tap-room—there are a good many persons who attend at the concert—the room is pretty crowded—I have to keep the room quiet, and announce the singers—it would be impossible for Homerton to leave the room without I noticed it, because he was sitting at the corner—he left when I announced "No more to-night"—they all left—I saw him leave the room at 11.30 with the other people—he sat on my right hand—the table will accommodate four or five on each side—he has sat there before—he was in the habit of at<lb></lb>tending on Mondays and Saturdays—he does not always sit in the same place; it is not always he could get the same seat—I have not heard the prosecutor utter any threat to Homerton in his presence, but some time be<lb></lb>fore he lost his watch, I think seven or eight weeks, we were going to work, and he stopped me and another young <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> and spoke of Homerton, and he said if he could not beat him by fighting, he would have him some other</p>

               <p>way—I know where the robbery took place—I have walked the distance from the Cherry Tree, and it takes ten minutes to go there and ten minutes to come back—I told Homerton that the man had threatened him in that way, chaffing him about it—I spoke of it to him, and was telling him what I thought the prosecutor would do with him—I thought it was a chaffing matter, not knowing it was coming out here.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The prosecutor had been to the Cherry Tree, and has played at bagatelle with me—he never said rightly what the ground of his complaint was, but it was because Homerton used to chaff him in the street, tease him—I believe Homerton is a licensed costermonger—I have never known anything against his character.</p>

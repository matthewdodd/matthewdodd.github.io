                  </hi>. I am servant to William Hollidge, of Stepney. On Friday morning I got up, put the parlour things in order, and got master's breakfast ready—I went into the kitchen, and left the table covered with a white table-cloth and a blue one—the parlour window is rather better than two feet from the ground—I heard the spoons, and cups and saucers rattle—I went into the parlour, and found the window up, and the table-cloth taken off—I immediately looked out of the window, and saw the prisoner running along the pathway (the window was shut when I left the pariour) the pri<lb></lb>soner was tucking the cloths under his arm as he ran—I could see the corner of the blue and red cloth as he tried to put it under his arm—I had seen him near the house about ten minutes before, when I took in the milk—I saw him pass the window several times the week before that, and am sure he is the man—I went to the station, and gave a description of him—the same day, about twelve o'clock, I was speaking to the beer-man, and saw the prisoner coming along within twenty yards of the parlour window—he jumped off the path, and ran along the road, when he saw me—the cloths were my master's property—he was about forty or fifty yards from me when I saw him going away—I only saw his back, but he looked behind him as he was going along, and I saw his face—I have no doubt of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on Friday, in Alfred-street, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, with four or five more boys—I asked him about the cloths and the cover.—he said he knew nothing of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker; I live in Blue-anchor-yard, Westminster. I know the prisoner—I used to live in the same house with him—on Sunday, 16th July, I was in a beershop, in Tothill-street, about a quarter past 10 o'clock—I had a young woman with me—the prisoner came into the place where I was—he had seven or eight men with him—he came and asked me if I wanted to fight—I told him I did not want to fight him—he said he would make me fight, and with that he laid hold of me, and pulled me up, and he tried to throw me down—he threw me down, and the men said, "Cut his throat"—I struggled with him, and he cut me over the right eye with a knife—I felt the knife go across my right eye while I was on the ground—I did not see the knife—the first thing was feeling it go across my eye—I got on my feet, and got out of the house as quick as I could—some men called out, "Cut his throat," and he tried to cut my throat—I pre<lb></lb>vented</p>

               <p>it as well as I could with my arm—it was after that my eye was cut—I ran away up Tothill-street, and he ran after me—I was bleeding—he ran to the top of Tothill-street after me, about fifty yards—I went home, and gave information to the police—I went afterwards to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in company with Edward Edwards that night at the beershop—I saw the prisoner, and some more men with him—they came into the beershop—the prisoner asked Edwards to fight—Edwards said he did not want to fight—I did not see anything in the prisoner's hand at the time—I afterwards saw a knife in his hand in the passage—it was a short table knife—the prisoner said he would make Edwards fight him, and he pulled him towards the door and threw him down, and I saw him stab him across the right eye—Edwards scrambled up, and ran out of the house—the prisoner ran up Tothill-street after Edwards.</p>

Q.</hi> How long had you been in that beershop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We had not been there above half an hour; I saw the knife in the prisoner's hand in the passage—I did not cry out when I saw the knife in his hand—I did not halloo out—when Edwards came outside the house he ran away, but when I saw him I told him I saw a knife in the prisoner's hand—I saw Edwards after he came out of the hospital—I saw him with a patch on his eye—I went to his house, and told him I saw a knife—there was only his brother in law there—I did not see any blow struck at all—I was sitting on a seat in the beershop when the prisoner came in—he pulled Edwards up off the seat—that was as far from the passage as I am from my Lord—they were both down, and Edwards was struggling to get up—I did not see the landlord, nor any waiter—they brought the beer in, but did not stay—there was a light in the passage.</p>

I live in Blue Anchor-yard—Edwards lives in the same house—I recollect that Sunday night—I saw the prisoner at my place about half-past 10 o'clock, as near as I can guess—he had a small knife in his hand, not a clasp knife, an open one, like a bread and cheese knife—he called out for Edwards—I asked him what he wanted—he said he wanted him to come and have a game at <hi rend="italic">coddem</hi>—that is a game that is played at a public house, but not on a Sunday night though—he also said he had given him a <hi rend="italic">darn</hi>, and he said he would give him another—I suppose he meant a cut—I do not know what he meant—he challenged me down—I suppose the reason was because I am Edwards's brother-in-law—he chal<lb></lb>lenged me to fight—there were seven or eight men with him—he went away, and about five minutes afterwards Edwards came home, covered with blood—I went to the hospital with him, after he went to the police station.</p>

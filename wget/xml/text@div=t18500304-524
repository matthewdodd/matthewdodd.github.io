                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 175.) On 10th Feb., at half-past twelve at night, I was in Rosemary-lane, and while talking to a person named Lynch, a person came behind me and struck me a violent blow between my eyes, and knocked me down and ran away—there had been a disturbance between a man and woman, and I had got them away—there was a great crowd, which I was trying to get away—I could not tell who struck me; but a person ran after him and held him, and the prisoner is the person I secured—I was in the act of taking him to the station, assisted by Duffy; and one of the mob took Duffy's staff away from him, and I was beaten with it, but I cannot tell by whom—I got three cuts in my head, and was rendered insensible—the prisoner was rescued from us—the prisoner then had a short white slop on, what they call a <hi rend="italic">jumper,</hi> and when I was taken to look at him on the Sunday he was in a blue shirt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> You stated before the Magistrate that the person that first struck you knocked you down insensible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not: I said I was knocked down, but not insensible—it was Lynch who overtook you in Blue Anchor-yard—I followed him, and collared you, and was surrounded by a mob of 400 or 500 persons—the place is about two-and-a-half yards wide—it is a carriage thoroughfare—there may be room for one person and a cart to pass—it is eight or ten yards long—there may have been 200 or 300 persons then in the lane, and in that space, too, they were as thick as they could be—it was Saturday night, and just as the public-houses were clearing out—about a quarter-past twelve—it began through a man and woman fighting—I told</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cheesemonger, of 51, Rosemary-lane. I was just coming out after closing my shop to see what was the matter—there had been a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I was speaking to Smalley, and a party struck him on the head and knocked him down, and ran away—he had a <hi rend="italic">slop</hi> coat on—it was rather dark, I could not identify him—I caught hold of him, and kept him down till Smaller came, and I gave him in charge—he had a short white frock on, what is called a <hi rend="italic">jumper</hi>—he broke away afterwards—there was a mob of about 150 persons, and I was afraid to interfere again—I stuck to the rear of the mob—they threatened me for taking the party—it is a common thing to have mobs there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am a watchman, of 50, Queen Anne-street, White<lb></lb>chapel. I saw Smalley struck by a man with a straw hat on, and a short frock, which is termed a <hi rend="italic">jumper,</hi> and canvas trowsers—to the best of my belief the prisoner is the person, but there was a great concourse of people there, and it was done very quickly—all I could recognise him again by, when he was taken, was his voice—I saw Smalley and the man both down together—I had no chance then of seeing his face, and I cannot speak positively to him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 85). I saw Lynch and Smalley both holding the prisoner—I assisted in taking the prisoner to the station—the mob so thronged us that we could not get him out of the mob, and I just took my truncheon out to move the mob to give us room to get him out—some person came behind me and wrenched my truncheon out of my hand and gave it to the prisoner, and told him, "Now you have got the b—s <hi rend="italic">lay it into them"</hi>—the prisoner then struck Smalley with my truncheon—I rushed on him to take the truncheon from him—he had on a white smock frock which came down to about his middle, and a white straw hat—the prisoner got away at the time—about two hours afterwards I met him in Glasshouse-street, and there apprehended him—he was then differently dressed, but I can speak positively to him—I knew his face directly I saw him, and I knew his voice—I can positively say that he is the person that struck Smalley with the staff—the change of dress makes no difference on that subject—wherever I saw him I should know his face—I have no doubt on the subject.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

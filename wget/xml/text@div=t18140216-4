It was daylight when I went out, I and my wife only live in the house. I rent the house myself. When I went from home at four o'clock in the afternoon I left my wife at home, and when I came home the two officers shewed me the knife taken from out of my window; it had the appearance of being mine. I do not know what number of knives I had in my window, and they shewed me another knife that they had broke the window with.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the window been broken - A. Yes; the pane of glass had been broken at the bottom by a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether it had been broken before you went out - A. It had been cut on the Friday; I mended it, and it was broken again on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it broke before you went out - A. No, it was perfectly sound before I went out, and perfectly safe. I had seen it about half an hour before I went out. I know nothing of the breaking of it; it was done in my absence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing - A. I did not know then what had been exactly in the window; there were knives in the window such as the officers shewed me.

            . I live at 74, Holywell-street, Shoreditch. I live next door to Mr. Stotter's. I had been out, and on my return I saw a confusion at Mr. Stotter's door; a gentleman of the name of Knighton picked up the knife by Mr. Stotter's door; the boys were in doors with the officers. I took the knife from Mr. Knighton, and took it into the shop; I said I thought it was their property. I delivered it to Armstrong, the officer.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the night of the 31st of January last, I was on duty, in company with Gleed, another officer. In going down Shoreditch we observed three boys standing at Mr. Stotter's window. We heard something crack, and the three boys ran away. This was about half after six; it was dark; the snow was on the ground. We observed a lady come from another room into the shop, and take the light out of the shop window, and put it in again; she then went back into the back room again. We waited about three minutes, and the boys returned. Fowler put his fingers into the inside of the window, and laid hold of something; I do not know exactly what it was; he dropped what he had in his fingers as soon as we laid hold of him; he dropped something by the window that he had got in his hand. Woolfe was then standing close to him as possible. We took the two prisoners into Mr. Stotter's shop; the other boy ran away. Mr. Andrade brought me this knife, saying, it was given to him by a gentleman at the next door, at his house, by Mr. Knighton. On searching the prisoner Fowler we found another knife; we compared this knife to the frame of the window where the glass had been broken; it fitted the marks in the frame where the glass had been broken, and the mark in the putty. The glass was broken in four or five pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he get his hand in - A. I do not think the hole in the glass was big enough to admit his hand; his fingers were in. I produce some of the pieces of glass, with the putty sticking to it. I asked Mrs. Stotter if she had lost any thing; she said she could not tell, but such knives as that were in the window.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Armstrong. I saw Fowler with his fingers in the window. I catched hold of Fowler, and then something dropped. I did not see what it was, Armstrong catched hold of the other. We took them into Mr. Stotter's shop. They were both close together. We asked Mrs. Stotter if she had lost any thing. She said she did not know exactly what was in the window. After that, Mr. Andrade came in with this knife. This is the knife that was in Fowler's possession; it fitted the marks in the putty and in the wood. Mrs. Stotter saw us fit the knife to the place. We took the two prisoners into Mr. Stotter's shop. I catched hold of Fowler, and something dropped; I could not see what it was Armstrong catched hold of the other. We asked Mrs. Stotter if she had lost any thing; she said she did not exactly know what was in the window. After that, Mr. Andrade came in with this knife, and this is the knife that was in Fowler's pocket; it fitted the place between the putty and the wood. Mr. Stotter saw us fit the knife to it. The little boy ran away. The two prisoners were standing as close together as possibly they could.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that knife - A. I cannot swear to it. I had a number of knives like this laying at the bottom of the window close to the glass where it was broken.</p>
               <p>Q.How many knives had you there - A. I do not know, a great number. I don't know the number. I have every reason to believe this knife belongs to me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Look at that knife - A. I cannot swear to it. We had knives of this sort in the window; they were laying close to the glass where it was broken. I believe this knife to be our property.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. James Allen, 158, Cheapside—the prisoner was in his service. I produce the ready-money book kept by the prisoner—the receipts to these bills are the prisoner's writing, and the whole of these invoices—they would be written by the person who received the money—if he received 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on 7th Oct., he has accounted in the ready-money book 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. only—on 27th Oct., if he received 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. here is only 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. entered—there are some erasures in the book—this does not appear to have been 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. originally, it has been altered—on 8th Nov., 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered, not 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—all these entries appear against the goods named in these three invoices—the sums which we have been paid over, are the same as in the book, not those in the invoices—those sums appear to have been en<lb></lb>tered in the book originally, and then altered—the person who sold the goods would call out the articles—it would be the prisoner's duty to enter them, and call them out, and the price also.</p>

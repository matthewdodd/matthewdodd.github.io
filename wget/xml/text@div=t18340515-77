            . I live at the Red Lion public-house, Gray's-inn-lane. On the 22nd of April I was going to my lodging, and asked a man to direct me - he was not altogether certain - the prisoner came up, and offered to direct me, but instead of taking me to my lodging, she took me to her own lodging - it was about half-past ten o'clock at night - there was some drink brought in, and I fell asleep- I did not awake till six in the morning - I then missed every thing I had in my pocket - my coat was gone, and a small parcel - I asked the prisoner about them - she said she had the coat - she went out, and returned about half-past eight o'clock, quite intoxicated - she said the coat was in pawn, but she would not give me the duplicate till I gave her more money - I had given her all the money I had the night before - this is my coat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said he had no money - he proposed to leave his coat with the landlady - she would not take it till he signed a paper, which I have here.</p>

             (police-constable C 146). I met the prosecutor that morning in Gray's-inn-lane - he said he had been robbed - I went and took the prisoner - she said he had been with her all night, and gave her the coat to pawn, and she had bought some liquor, and he had part of it - the prosecutor was not sober.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the two prisoners go to bed to you?</p>

               <p>Hallaly. No, they sat by the fire; I soon fell asleep; I do not know what became of them afterwards. About seven in the morning Hearne came; he waked me, and asked me what business I had there, that it was his bed; I got up and then first discovered the loss of the box and money. I was in liquor at the time, and do not know the house I was carried into.</p>

There were but four guineas in it; she was asked what she had done with the rest; she said she had paid it away.</p>

On Monday the 12th of June, these tablecloths were in the house-keeper's room on the area floor, they were missed soon after ten o'clock in the morning; I had seen them safe about three minutes before, I found them at Marlborough-street office that morning, the prisoner was then in custody. Somebody must have come down the area to take them. There were six table-cloths, I was to have paid 30 guineas for them if they had not been found - they cannot be worth less than 5 l.</p>

            . I am a porter, and lodge near Baker-street. A little after ten o'clock in the morning, I was coming down Baker-street, and saw the prisoner and two more; he and one of the others went down the area of No. 27, I saw them go inside the house, and in about five minutes the person down the area whistled, the other stood opposite the area gate in the street, with a stick. I stopped to watch them, and saw the prisoner come out with all this linen under his arm into the street, with the one that went down with him, but he had nothing. A gentleman told me to halloo out stop thief, I did so, and they all three ran; I ran after the prisoner, and never lost sight of him, a coachman laid hold of him, he threw the linen down about two minutes before he was laid hold of, and ran down Blandford-mews. I never lost sight of him. Mrs. Fisher picked up the linen, it was five small and one large table cloth.</p>

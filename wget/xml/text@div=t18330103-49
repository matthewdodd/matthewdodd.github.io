            . I am a Policeman. On the 3rd of December, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I was watching the house of Alfred Amstie, in <placeName id="t18330103-49-crimeloc290">Long-acre, in the parish of St. Martin in the Fields</placeName>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors. I had desired the Policeman to watch, having suspicions - I was watching in front of the house; Turpin was formerly in our employ; he left about four or five months, but lived on the premises with his father, who was our foreman at the time in question - I watched the premises for three-quarters of an hour; Owen came and gave me information - I went down a street, and met Banks, and the Policeman behind him; I went on, and met Turpin, with the worsted in his possession, in a blue apron.</p>

My foreman resided in the house, as a servant - I and my partner pay the taxes; it is the dwelling-house of us both - I know nothing of Banks; Turpin himself had been in our employ once - I swear positively to both parcels of property; my handwriting is on the papers - it is regimental lace, and worth more than 9l.</p>
               <p>Banks' Defence. A young man in Covent-garden-market asked me to carry a parcel for him to Somers'-town, and said he would give me 1s. - this young man told me to go to the first turning on the left and stop till he came; as I went through the court, the young man brought the parcel out, and gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Turpin's Defence. I happened to be standing in my father's passage. I dropped a shilling down the cellar grating - I observed some parcels laying there, but did not interfere with them.</p>

             when she was brought to the Hospital; she had a small wound upon the head bleeding; I think she was brought there on the 14th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that that wound was dangerous at first - A. Not in the least; it afterwards assumed an alarming appearance by assuming another disease, an erysipelas produced inflammation of the brain, and the inflammation death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the erysipelas produced by the wound - A. I cannot say that; she was attended skilfully by other surgeons of more skill than me.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181401120015"></xptr>Q. Was the erysipelas in the wound - A. Yes, and it affected her arms. It spread from the wound to other parts of the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it would have been at other parts of the body, but from its origin in the wound - A. I think not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any erysipelas there before the wound - A. I rather think not. I think the wound was the acting cause of the erysipelas.</p>

               <p>Q. When you saw the erysipelas in the wound, and saw it spreading over other parts of the body, did you, as a rational man, think it proceeded from the wound - A. Yes, I rather think it produced from the wound, but there are causes which it might produce besides wounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. She and I had been together a month or six weeks, or better. We had been drinking together several times; she was passionate and abusive; she abused me much that morning. The drink rather took effect of me. When she spilled my beer I went from her and touched another pint pot. I am very sorry I happened to do such a thing. I never intended to do any such thing.</p>

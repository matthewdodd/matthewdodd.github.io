                  </hi>. I am salesman to Messrs. Henry and Alfred Sharp, of High Street, Deptford, clothiers—about 7.30 on 15th April the prisoner came in and asked if I had got a pieco of silk for sale—I placed two lengths on the counter, one eleven yards, and the other two and a quarter yards long—she looked at them, and said they were not the sort she had sen a pattern of, which a friend of hers had obtained from our shop—I showed her another piece, a longer length—she looked at that four or five minutes, and then asked me to give her a small piece of it as a pattern to take away, which I did—I put that roll back in the drawer, and then I missed the piece containing two and a quarter yards—I looked about for it, but could not find it—I had attended to another customer who wanted a coat for her husband, but when I left to do that the silk was lying on the counter—I looked among the coats the woman had been looking at, but could not see the silk—I said to the prisoner, "Did you observe two pieces of silk when I first showed you them?"—she said, "Oh!'dear, no, I only saw one"—I said, "I am certain there were two pieces, one was a small piece"—she then said she wished to buy a pair of boots—I called the boy to get her three or four pairs, and she choosed a pair—she had on a large long cloak, and she kept her left arm close down—I asked her to try on the boots, but she would not—I said, "It would be more satisfactory if you were to see them on"—she said she was certain they would do, but if not, would I change them for another pair? and I said I would—I had an object in asking her to try them on—she paid for the boots, and was about to take them off the counter—I said, "I do not feel satisfied about this silk"—she said, "Per<lb></lb>haps it may be among the coats"—I said, "I will take them up one by one," which I did, and shook them—she took up one coat with her right hand—I asked the boy to look on the floor where the prisoner was standing, but he could not see the silk—she was about going, and I said, "Would you have any objection to step into the parlour? Mr. Sharp is there"—she did not hesitate at all, but said, "Oh! yes," and walked down towards the parlour—when near the parlour door I saw her left arm rise, I looked, and there was the piece of silk I had shown her in the first instance on a box—the box was about eight yards from where the prisoner had looked at the silk—I took the silk up and said, "I am rather surprised; I did not think you would do such a thing, you being dressed respectably, and from your manner"—she said, "It must have caught by a pin, and then dropped"—she implored of me to let her go for the sake of her family, and offered to go on her knees—I spoke to Mr. Sharp, and sent for a constable—this is the piece of silk (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was she not dreadfully frightened and agitated? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I do not think she was—perhaps she was not quite so cool as I am now—she said it was the first time, and hoped and prayed to God I would not take any notice of it, but let her go—my deposition before the Magistrate was read over to me, and I signed it—I did not notice any omission in it—</p>

               <p>I was on her right side when I saw her left arm move—I could not see the silk drop, because her cloak reached nearly to the ground—the box was close to her—I should say the cloak was lower than the top of the box—the box was about a foot and a half high, and then there was a parcel on that containing a good many things.</p>

I was called into Mr. Sharp's shop on the evening of 15th April—the last witness told me she had stolen a piece of silk, and Mr. Sharp gave her into custody—she begged and prayed of him not to do so, but he said he could not look over it—I took her to the station—she told me it might have caught by a pin, and that was the only way she could account for it—she opened her cloak, but I could not see a pin about her.</p>

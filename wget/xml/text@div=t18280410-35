No; I had my trousers and waistcoat on; I was putting my jacket on at the time: I lost sight of them when I went from the window to go to the door - I only had to go down six stairs, and directly went out; I had only two bolts and a lock to undo; the key was in the door; I unlocked it, and got out in a very little time.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Brentford, which is in Isleworth parish. On Sunday morning, the 30th of March, I heard an alarm of Stop thief! three men came up to me - I tried to stop them all three; Rust then came up, and hit me on the head with this crow-bar (producing it) - I did not let him hit me more than once; I threw him on his back, and took it from him; one of the other two men hit me with a stick across the back of my head and shoulders - they escaped; I kept hold of Rust.

            . I occupy this house, and lived in it on this night - it is in the parish of Isleworth. I went in pursuit with my cousin, and assisted in taking the two prisoners; I went to my premises after they were secured; the watchman (Welch) gave me this crow-bar - I found the sash of the kitchen window thrown up, but the shutters were shut and fastened; I observed a mark on the under part of the shutter - it was the mark of a crow-bar; the crow-bar appeared to have gone through underneath, quite at the further end of the shutter, and there was a mark on the inside ledge of the shutter - it appeared to be the mark of the crow-bar: I applied the end of the crow-bar to it - it corresponded exactly. I found some footmarks under the kitchen window. Gold gave me the stock of a centrebit. I searched Ford, and took a knife from his pocket, also a sixpence and 5d. - it was a very large clasp-knife; a penknife was also found on him. I found nothing else on the premises.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has any person a right to the dwelling-house besides yourself? A. No - I carry on business there, and have no partner; I have no other Christian name. I am sure the house is in Isleworth parish. I have no lodgers; the fastenings of the shutters were not injured.</p>
               <p>Q. All the security which would arise from the shutters was as complete in the morning as it was at night? A. Yes; the mark inside was just underneath the shutter - there was no hole made through the shutter, but the crow had been introduced underneath; the window was open - the shutters are inside ones.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far is the shutter when shut, from the glass of the window? A. I should think two inches or two inches and a half from the glass of the window.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was present at the prisoners' examination before the Magistrate; the pencil-case and comb were produced before them; Ford said they were both his property - Rust made answer, and said the comb was his, but he had lent it to Ford. I confined the prisoners in the cage, and after that went through the garden of Gold, the last witness, and observed that his garden door and the wall were broken all to pieces; those premises join Mr. Roper's. I went to Mr. Roper's kitchen window - there was a number of footmarks about the place- I went to the cage on Sunday morning, about nine o'clock, and took off Rust's shoes, which I compared with the footmarks about the kitchen window; they fitted exactly; one shoe had an iron tip, and the other had none - they both fitted exactly.</p>

On the 18th of May, I went out at five o'clock in the morning, leaving my wife and family in bed; when I went out, I left the outer door on the latch - I have two up-stairs and three down-stairs rooms in my house - the back door and windows were fastened.</p>

            . I am a constable of Barnet. I was at South Mimms on the morning of the 18th, near the prosecutor's house, at nearly six o'clock; the outer door of the house was open; I went in, and saw the prisoner there in the first room - he was putting his hat on - I examined his hat, and found in it a child's petticoat and a woman's petticoat; they were in the crown of his hat - I took him into custody - he threw one petticoat out of his hat while he was in the house, and while I was picking it up he slipped by me, but never got out of my sight - I saw a box in his trousers pocket when he was in the house, and it was afterwards brought to me by a neighbour - I had not seen him throw it out of his pocket; it was a box like that - when I apprehended him, he told me he did it from distress (I neither threatened nor made him any promise), and I really believe he was in distress; I did not lose sight of him when he ran away - I found this comb in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. He said, what he did, he did from distress? A. He said, "I did it from distress," and he really appeared to me to be in distress - I never knew him before - I don't know whether he was committed for the larceny or housebreaking.</p>

            . These things are my property; this box I know particularly, it belongs to my child, this comb is mine, and these other things are mine; I don't know where they were before - my wife is not here - I know this to be my wife's petticoat, from seeing it several times before; there was no mark on it particularly - I know the comb from having used it for years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is a common born comb? A. Yes; it has no particular private mark.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you pulled the door too, if you wanted to get back to your house, how would you get in? A. By lifting the latch - my father lives next door to me, and several of my sisters - none of my children live next door; they were all in bed in my own house - when I came back my wife had just got down stairs - my wife might have gone down and opened the door - my relations next door frequently come to see me (it is a common thumb latch); we are frequently in the habit of running into each others houses - my wife had just come down stairs, and was half-dressed when I came home.</p>

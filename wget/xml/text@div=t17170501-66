The Evidences for the King in the case were also Evidence for the prisoner, and deposed, that the Prisoner, the Deceased, and some others were drinking together at the sign of the Cock and Bottle at Charing-Cross , in a very friendly manner, till about 10 a clock at night; when the Deceased, taking umbrage at something the Prisoner said, fell a swearing in a very profane manner, that he would have Satisfaction of him before he slept, bidding him go into the Meuse and he would make a D - I of him; that then the Deceased laid hold of his Sword and would have fought the Prisoner, but was hindred by the Company and Landlord, who took away their Swords; and the soft language of the Prisoner, which was to this effect, Prithee Jack be quiet; what should you and I fight for? We have been old Comrades abroad; so calm'd the Deceased's fury , that they shook hands, kissed one another, and then sat down again to drink very friendly, but some observed the tokens of ma-lice still to appear in the Deceased's conntenance; that the rest of the Company going away, they went out together about 12 a clock at night, seeming friends; and that the Prisoner offered the Deceased the conveniency of a Coach. The Prisoner pleaded in his Defence to the same effect, add ing, that what the Deceased was so inraged as was, that when the Deceased was railing against his Agent on account of force Money he refused to let him have, and threatened he would buy an Oaken Stick and cudgell him, the Prisoner replyed, Prithee Jack don't talk so; I 'll go along with you to the Agent, and persuade him to let you have some Money; at which he fell into a great Rage, swearing in a very prefane manner, and saying, What! must I be under your Di rection ? No; I will have satisfaction of you before I sleep, but was seemingly pacified, as has been before deposed: That when they went not of the house, the Deceased refusing a Coach as he offer'd him, he parted from him, and having been gone about 20 yards, the Deceased called him, saying he had something to say to him; that going back, the Deceased asked him to walk a little way with him , carried him into <placeName id="t17170501-66-crimeloc326">Spring-Garden</placeName>

This was confirmed by a Watchman in Spring Gardens that was within hearing, and a Boy that saw the action, who added, that the Deceased drew first, and said to the Prisoner , D - N you, are you a Man? if you are, draw, and shew your self so; and that the Prisoner retreated, and would have pacified him, but he would not; and that when he was fallen, the Prisoner endeavour'd to help him up, saying, Get up, Jack; let us take Coach and go home; I have't hurt you; but the Deceased never spoke, but gave one groan and died.

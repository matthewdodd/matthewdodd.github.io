                  </hi>. I live in James-street, City-road. I had known the prisoner by light for twelve months, but in June, 1842, he came to lodge with me—I married him on Christmas day last, at St. John, Hackney—about March last I received intelligence, and spoke to him about hit wife—I said, "How came you to marry me, knowing you had a wife alive?"—he said she was no wife, he had not married her in the right name, and it did not stand good, but he had two children that he supported—he said it was a bad job—when he paid his addresses to me, he said he was a widower.</p>

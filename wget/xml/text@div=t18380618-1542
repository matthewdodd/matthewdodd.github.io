                  </hi>. I am a cab-man, and drive Mr. William Clement's cab. I have driven it about six weeks—on the 17th of June I left it in Liquorpond-street, at a quarter to twelve o'clock at night, for about two minutes, with a horse and harness—a gentleman called me inside a cigar shop to ask my fare—I told him, and when I came out, my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and horse were gone—I could not find it, and went and called master—we made inquiry, and were riding about all night—about half-past seven o'clock the next morning, I found the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in Back-hill, Leather-lane, and the prisoner driving it—he was quite a stranger to me—I instantly jumped out of the chaise, and took hold of the reins—the policeman, who was with me, took a new bag out of the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> which was not mine—the plate of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> had been broken in two—it was No. 1583—the 15 was taken away, and the 83 left—I jumped into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and drove him to the station-house—I had left the mare outside the shop while I went to get my fare—she was a quiet mare, and never moved of her own accord.</p>

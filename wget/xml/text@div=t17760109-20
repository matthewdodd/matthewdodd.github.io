I told him I had none; he said he wanted money, and swore by his Maker he would have money, and that if I made the least resistance he would call a third man, and take me to the dead wall, and then I might help<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177601090011"></xptr> myself as I could: I desired him not to use me ill; that half a guinea was all I had, and that I was very poor woman; then he asked what I had under my arm? I said nothing of great value; he took the poplin from under my arm, and then demanded the half guinea, which I gave him: the moon did not shine at that time, but it was under a lamp, so that I saw his face very plain; I described him to all my neighbours when I came home: the prisoner asked me whether I knew him? I said I did not; then he asked again whether. I thought I should know him if I saw him again? I said no, for fear of the consequences; then he bid me not say any thing, or it would be worse for me. Upon leaving me, he put into my hand a ring, wrapped up in a paper; I never opened the paper till I came to lord Essex's; the paper was there read, and it appeared to be a receipt for 4 l. 4 s. 6 d. for the ring, dated that day week: by the description I had given of the men to the chairmen about lord Essex's, they knew the prisoner, and he was taken up: he was carried to Mr. Coward's, a public-house; there he confessed the robbery, and desired me to take the money the poplin was worth, and the half guinea; he told me that he kept the Marquis of Granby, a publichouse, in Drury-lane; and rather than give me any trouble, he would make me satisfaction; I refused it: Mr. Coward advised me not to take the money, for I might be prosecuted for compounding of felony: the prisoner put down two guineas at the time he made the offer.</p>

               <p>Did not the prisoner say it was a lucky thing, when he produced the ring and receipt, and whether it was not taken notice of at that time? - The receipt was not produced, nor given to me till after I was robbed: there were watchmen at the ends of the street, but I did not call out, nor alarm any body, because they threatened to carry me to the dead wall if I did: I went to lord Essex's and shewed the receipt and ring, and I laid there all night.</p>

               <p>The prisoner was brought to my house upon the 27th of December, about eight or nine o'clock: the chairmen charged him with robbing Mrs. Ship; I said I would send for her, for I have known her for many years: while the man was gone to fetch Mrs. Ship, the prisoner took out a guinea, and offered to leave it in my hands, in lieu of the poplin, and he said he would find the poplin the next day if he could; he offered to leave that guinea if I would set him at liberty: the prosecutrix came immediately; there were then eight or ten people in the room, many of them were strangers to her, she directly pointed out the prisoner: she said Mr. Williams I am glad to see you; the prisoner said he would pay her for the poplin; he asked her what it was worth, and offered her a guinea, he afterwards offered her two guineas, and I believe the poor woman would have taken it if I had not persuaded her, that if she did she might herself be indicted for compounding felony; and she did at the same time mention being robbed of half a guinea; and farther, that he had forced a ring and a paper into her hand.</p>
               <p>What character does the prosecutrix bear? - I have lived where I do now fourteen years; I believe she has lived there ten years; her husband is groom to lord Orwell; she takes in washing, she is a very honest, industrious woman. The chairmen mentioned in the prisoner's presence, that he offered them a guinea a piece to let him go when they were upon Hay-hill, and the prisoner did not deny it.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM HANCOCK. I live in Mount-street, Grosvenor-square. On Monday, the 14th of November, a little before eight o'clock, I was in the second floor back room, with my wife and an upholsterer, putting up a bed - my wife went down for the curtains; she returned, and alarmed me. I went down to the back room on the ground floor, and missed the articles stated in the indictment; I opened a side door which leads into a mews, and saw my hat and gloves laying outside the door. I got a search-warrant on the 25th, and went with Ballard and Collins to the second floor back room of No. 9, Gilbert-street, Oxford-street; the prisoner and his wife were there; we found six leaves of the History of England, which I had been reading a night or two before. I found two metal seals - the clapper of a bell, a button, and an ink-stand. - The door leading to the mews is half glass, and slides up like a window, and was not fastened down - it would not keep up, having no pullies; the door was locked, and the key out; there was dirt on the side of the window of the door, as if they had entered there. There was no appearance of any one getting in elsewhere. The officer told the prisoner our business - he denied all knowledge of the things.</p>

            . I lived in Gilbert-street, in the next room to the prisoner. On the 14th of November, about eight o'clock, or rather later, I heard persons going up stairs, in a great hurry, and enter his room; I cannot say whether he was there; I did not see them, but heard them say, "There is money in there."</p>

            . I went with a search-warrant to the prisoner's room, on the 25th. I asked if his name was Willis - he said it was; I said I was come to search for stolen things, and asked if he knew any thing about a box and an unfinished silk dress; he said No; I searched and found a spectacle glass, and two pieces of one - he said the old one he had been in the habit of reading with. In a small box in a tea-caddy I found a button, two metal seals, and the bell-clapper, which Hancock claimed. I found some leaves of the History of England, between the bed and sacking. I went there afterwards, and found a glass ink-stand on the dust heap, which I had before seen on the mantel-piece, and shewn to Hancock, but he did not know it. Mrs. Hancock afterwards claimed it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

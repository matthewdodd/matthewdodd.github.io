               <p>On the 11th of May, at about ten o'clock at night, I was going home to my lodgings, at No. 8, in Union-court, Holborn. Going up the court, the prisoner stopped me; she catched me round the middle, and pushed me against the wall; then she called another girl; she asked me, If I would have a - , or something of that kind: the other girl came up that moment; the prisoner directly snatched the watch out of my pocket; I felt her do it; I catched hold of her, and that instant the other girl pushed me, and got the watch, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Did you see this girl give the watch to the other? - No; I could not see that, because she pushed against me: at the time I took the prisoner to the watch-house, she swore very much, and was not willing to be searched; she was searched, but my watch was never found. I am quite certain it was the prisoner who took it out of my pocket.</p>

I was in the court with the prosecutor: I left him, and he was with another girl in a black gown; he afterwards charged me, because I had a black gown: I was taken to the Compter, and afterwards before the Lord Mayor, and was committed till the other girl could be found. He came to the Compter, and said, If I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178105300015"></xptr> pay him 50 s. for the watch, he would be at no farther trouble about it.</p>

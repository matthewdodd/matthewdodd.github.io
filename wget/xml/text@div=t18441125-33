               <p>New-court, Nicol-street, Bethnal-green. I knew the deceased Jane Gregory—she lived next door to me, at No. 3—she was an unfortunate female—I know the prisoner—he vas in the habit of visiting Jane Gregory at her lodging—on Thursday night, the 19th of Sept., about eight o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Nicol-street with Jane Gregory—I was with them at her room—Gregory called me in—I found the prisoner sitting down by the fire, smoking his pipe, and she sitting by him—they both appeared to be sober—there was a quart pot on the table with some beer—the de<lb></lb>ceased asked me to take some of the beer, and I did so—she also drank of the beer—the prisoner did not—I saw a wine-bottle on the table—it was a long-necked bottle, which would hold about a pint and a half—it was a black glass bottle, tapering up at the neck—it was not a common shaped bottle—there was a tea-cup—there was no candle in the room, and I could not then tell whether there was anything in the bottle or the cup—there was a fire—I staid there about three or four minutes—I said to the deceased, "Jane, what have you got in that bottle? "—I asked her twice over before she answered me, and she told me it was catchup—she did not say where she had got it from—I said, "Jane, when I have fish I shall know where to come for sauce"—she never told me in the prisoner's presence where she got it from—I then went down, and came up again about half an hour afterwards—the prisoner was then sitting on one side of the fire, and she on the other, the same as before—they had no light then—I took my own light up then—I could see then that there was something in the bottle—it seemed to be about half full of dark-coloured liquid—it was a dark bottle—any liquid would look dark in a dark bottle—I did not take it up to look through it—neither Gregory nor the prisoner took up the bottle—there appeared as if there had been some poured out into the tea-cup—I went up to the table with my light—it was a dark colour in the tea-cup—it was a dark green cup—it was dark green inside—I could not very well judge of the colour of the liquid—it looked to me like catchup—it was such a mark as would be left in a cup by catchup, but not quite so thick—Gregory asked me if I would go out with her when Alfred was gone—the prisoner was there then—I told her, that if it was not too long I would go with her, but if it was too late I could not go with her—she repeated it over again, and said, directly after Alfred was gone she should go—she told me, that against I got myself washed, and got my bonnet and shawl on, she would be ready—I then went down with my candle, and washed myself—before I went down I asked her whether she did not want a bit of light—she said she did not care about a light when she had a fire in the room—when I returned to the room the door was shut—I called "Jane"—she told me to stop a bit—the prisoner was not gone then—he said, "Mary, wait a bit"—about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes afterwards she opened the door, and said, "Polly, come up"—the prisoner was standing by the side of the fire, and the deceased was tying on her bonnet—I said, "Jane, it is so late, I shall go in-doors, I can't go with you, it is ten o'clock"—the prisoner took out his watch, and said, "It is not ten o'clock, it wants ten minutes to ten"—the prisoner took the bottle off the table, and put it in his coat-pocket—he took it out again almost directly afterwards, and put it on the second shelf in the cupboard—we then all came down together—we went together as far as Cock-lane, or Boundary-street, and there the pri<lb></lb>soner left us—I saw him part with Gregory—he said, "Good night, Jane"—she said, "Good night, <hi rend="italic">Alf</hi> "—they shook hands, and he kissed her—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250047"></xptr>
               <p>said to me, "Good night, Polly"—I said, "Good night, Alfred," and he ran away—she called after him, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Alf</hi>, what time shall I see you to-morrow?"—he said, "Stop till to-morrow comes, and I will tell you"—he then ran away—he appeared to be in a hurry—he said he was going some<lb></lb>where, where, and he could not stop—I then went with the deceased down Shore<lb></lb>ditch, Old-street Road, and afterwards to Hoxton, as far as the Britannia public-house—she afterwards went into the Britannia, or next door—I did not go in with her—I left her there—while we were going there she complained of feeling very sick—that was, as near as I can tell, about half an hour or twenty-five minutes after we had parted with the prisoner—we had gone down Shoreditch, and up Old-street Road, to go to the Britannia—we had not gone two miles—she complained of sickness, of an inclination to vomit—she did not do so, she only spat—it appeared to be like water—she ap<lb></lb>peared to try to vomit—she did not seem to retch, but as though she wanted to retch, and could not—what did come was like water—it was very little—she said she had a pain in her stomach—she had nothing to drink while I was with her—I left her there—she went into the Britannia, not into the public-house, but into the part where the play is—there is an en<lb></lb>tertainment there, and she went into the theatrical room—I left her there, and came home—I ran all the way home—it was eleven o'clock when I got home, and I should suppose it was about twenty minutes to eleven when I left her—I saw her again next morning, about a quarter past ten—I went into her room—she was in bed, alone and undressed—she appeared to me as though she was dying—she spoke low, but was quite sensible—I ob<lb></lb>served her hands—her fingers were contracted, and were quite black, and her face was as black as her hands—I laid hold of one of her hands, it was as cold as could be—I could not open her fingers—I asked her what was the matter with her—she said, "Mary, I am dying"—I said, "Jane, what have you been drinking?"—she told me she had not drunk anything except the brandy-bitters—she requested me to send for her brother—there was no one in the room but myself at that time—I saw Sarah Russell in the room afterwards—I sent her for the deceased's brother—soon after Russell had gone the prisoner came into the room where the deceased was lying—she still appeared to be suffering—he said to her, "What is the matter?"—she said, "Alfred, I am very bad, I am dying"—he said, "What have you been drinking?"—she said she had not drank anything but the brandy-bitters he had given her last night—he coloured up very much, and said, "Never"—that was all I heard him say—I then went for the doctor, and left him in the room—Charlotte Scott, Caroline Watson, and several other young women, were in the room—I was not absent five minutes—I ran all the way there and back—it was to Mr. Wildbore's, in Shoreditch—when I returned the prisoner was gone—Mr. Smith, Mr. Wildbore's as<lb></lb>sistant, attended her—he advised her to be taken to the hospital—I did not tell Mr. Smith that I thought she had been poisoned—I did not know it—on the Tuesday before this Thursday I went up to the top of the stairs, and went just inside the deceased's room—I saw the prisoner there, and the de<lb></lb>ceased—I did not go into the room, and did not hear what passed between them—they were having a few words—I cannot say how long they were together—I came down stairs then, I thought it my business to do so—I did not want to hear what they had to say—I went into my own room, and did some needlework—I saw the prisoner come down a few minutes afterwards—the deceased came down directly he was gone, and she was then crying.</p>

I am a boot and shoemaker—I am the brother of the deceased, Jane Gregory—I saw her in company with the prisoner about the latter end of July last, or the beginning of August—I saw him twice in her room—those were the only two occasions on which I have seen them together—I heard very little conversation between them then—I went there to take my sister some tea, and he was there on those two occasions—I was sent for on Friday morning, the 20th of Sept., about half-past eleven o'clock—I found my sister still alive in bed, and quite sensible—Mr. Smith, the doctor, came while I was there—I went and fetched him—I saw a bottle in the cupboard—I took it out of the cupboard and gave it to Mr. Smith—it was the only bottle in the cupboard—I saw the cup—Mr. Smith poured a little of the liquid out of the bottle into the cup and tasted it—I also tasted it—I drank none—I spit it out—by Mr. Smith's order I placed the bottle in my pocket, and took it to Mr. Wildbore's, in company with Mr. Smith—I placed it on the counter at Mr. Wildbore's, in the presence of Mr. Smith and one of the assistants—while Mr. Smith was mixing up a bottle of medicine to take back to give to her, a man came in and said he thought she was dead—we went back immediately and found that she was dead—I should say twenty minutes had elapsed since I first entered the room—my sister was twenty-seven years of age—I after<lb></lb>wards accompanied Sergeant Sheele to look for the prisoner—we found him at a public-house in Cock-lane, Shoreditch, which is about 100 or 150 yards from the house where my sister died—we got there about two in the afternoon, as near as I can recollect—we went into the public-house—he got up off the settle, and said he was waiting to see me—he was sitting on the settle in the tap-room—I had inquired for him before of the landlord—I asked if the young man Alfred, that I had been inquiring for before, was come in, and he got up and said he was waiting for me—I beckoned him to the door and asked him what was the matter with my sister Jane—he said he did not know, but he had taken her some brandy-bitters, and they (meaning the witnesses) said he had poisoned her—before any more conver<lb></lb>sation took place, Sergeant Sheele came up, and I gave him into custody.</p>

I visited the deceased on the morning of the 20th, about eleven o'clock—I found her in a very pro<lb></lb>strate state, suffering intense pain about the stomach, on pressure, with a low, weak, and fluttering pulse—her skin was very dark, very discoloured—her extremities were cold, and the hands were contracted a great deal—they were rather rigid—I thought she was labouring under poison, particu<lb></lb>larly larly after I saw the bottle—the appearances and symptoms led me to sup<lb></lb>pose so—I asked her the cause of the pain, and she pointed to the bottle—she was able to articulate, and perfectly sensible—on asking her some questions my opinion was confirmed—I poured some of the contents of the bottle into a cup, and tasted it—it bad a very disagreeable taste, very pungent—I spat it out immediately, for I expected it was poisonous—that is the best definition I can give of the taste—it was pungent and strong—it tasted of brandy flavoured with bitters, brandy bitters—I went home in order to prepare some medicine, and whilst there I heard she was dead—she was almost in the act of death when I saw her first—she was in a very prostrate condition, and I expected her to die shortly—there was inflam<lb></lb>mation mation existing in the stomach and bowels—the deceased's brother after<lb></lb>wards gave me the bottle, and I gave it to Dr. Leeson—I first of all poured some out into a phial, and took it to Dr. Leeson, and afterwards gave him the whole bottle—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the body on the following night, the 21st—I examined the stomach—there were appear<lb></lb>ances ances of inflammation, and likewise dark-coloured spots, very character<lb></lb>istic of poison, particularly at the cardiac or upper extremity next the throat—much inflammation had existed there very recently, I should say for a few hours only—the small intestines were inflamed—the large intes<lb></lb>tines were not so much inflamed—the lungs were perfectly healthy, and the rest of the body in a healthy state—the brain was congested, but there were no morbid appearances about it—there was general congestion—I observed that the kidneys were congested—nothing beyond that—the bladder was contracted and empty, but there was nothing remarkable in</p>

                  </hi>, Esq., M. D. I am assistant physician at St. Thomas's Hospital, and also lecturer on Forensic medicine and che<lb></lb>mistry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are the general symptoms previous to death of a person who dies from poison? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In cases of irritant poison a disposition to vomit is one of the symptoms, also great pain and tenderness of the stomach, pain in the chest, great thirst; and when the poison has acted for some time, a small feeble pulse, impeded circulation, producing lividity or blackness, rigidity of the limbs, the whole terminating in death—there would be contraction of the hands, that would be probably the result of great pain—lead</p>

               <p>is, to a certain extent, an irritant poison—if taken in sufficient quantities it would produce such symptoms as I have described—the metal itself would not, but a compound, such as acetate of lead, carbonate of lead, and many other preparations of lead—acetate is what is commonly called sugar of lead, and carbonate what is commonly called white lead—I have seen the effects of sugar of lead on several persons—we had a case in St. Thomas's Hospital on Monday last, where a person had taken a large quantity of sugar of lead; and hi that case, in addition to the symptoms I have already noticed, there was great blueness of the gums—that would be the effect of any preparation of lead—that patient has re<lb></lb>covered, and they generally recover—if that blueness of the gums existed during life, it would not disappear in death—there would still be the ap<lb></lb>pearance after death—I never saw the body of the deceased—I examined the stomach, and observed that it was in a very inflamed and congested state at the lower portion of the cardiac extremity; that is, the portion of the stomach immediately adjoining the <hi rend="italic">oesophagus</hi>, or throat—there was but trifling inflammation, in comparison, in the lower portion of the stomach—the state of the stomach was indicative of inflammation pro<lb></lb>duced by an irritant poison—that partial congestion of the coats of the stomach is not usual, except in the case of an irritant poison—it does sometimes exist in cases of <hi rend="italic">gastritis</hi>; that is, of acute inflammation, but it is then generally more diffused—<hi rend="italic">gastritis</hi> is a disease very often conse<lb></lb>quent upon <hi rend="italic">miasma</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">typhois</hi> poison, and a variety of things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there anything in the colour of that portion of the stomach different from what would exist in <hi rend="italic">gastritis? A</hi>. It was not so diffused—it would be impossible to judge by the colour alone between the inflammation excited by disease and that produced by an irritant poison—by <hi rend="italic">typhois</hi> poison I mean nothing that can be touched or seen, but poison in the atmosphere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you did not yourself see the intestines? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had a small portion sent attached to the stomach, but it was not in a state from which I could well judge—it was too far decomposed—I saw the stomach on Sunday the 22nd of Sept—I did not see the other portion of the intestine until some days subsequent—I afterwards analyzed the stomach, in order to see whether there was any poison in it—I boiled it in distilled water, the purity of which I carefully ascertained; to that water, which I filtered and separated from the stomach, I added a solu<lb></lb>tion tion of sulphuretted hydrogen, which yielded a black precipitate; I ultim<lb></lb>ately ately obtained a globule of metallic lead from the stomach, which I pro<lb></lb>duce—I duce—I am quite satisfied that nothing I put in, in the course of my ex<lb></lb>periments, has produced that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you any means of forming a judgment in which condition it was introduced into the stomach, whether as acetate or carbonate of lead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be impossible to say—obtaining the metal was a conclusive proof of the previous existence there of some compound of lead—it would be impossible to say what compound—the stomach had been previously washed in water several times before it was delivered to me by Mr. Smith, and therefore the probability is that the portion of lead that I obtained proceeded from some carbonate of lead, which is comparatively insoluble, adhering to the coats of the stomach, because the greater portion of any sugar of lead that might have been present in the stomach would, in all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184411250056"></xptr>
               <p>probability, have been removed by the washing—if it was washed in water which had carbonate of lead in it, it would have had that added to it—sugar of lead is easily decomposed, and probably a portion of it would be converted into carbonate—this globule weighs one grain and one<lb></lb>tenth of a grain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would the quantity of carbonate of lead producing that be sufficient to kill a person? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think not—I boiled the stomach in pure water—nothing could come from that—I previously examined the water to assure myself—I then added a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen to the water—I then took away the water from the stomach after it had been boiled, leaving the stomach bodily as it was before—carbonate of lead is soluble in water to a certain extent—I have made an experiment, and find that one pint of water will dissolve one grain of carbonate of lead—I boiled the stomach in about two gallons of water—I believe it was suffi<lb></lb>cient to have dissolved more than I found, therefore I conclude I got very nearly all the carbonate of lead that was in the stomach—it is possible, and very probable, that some did remain in the stomach after the boiling, from the water having not sufficient access to it, and from the length of time—I only thought it necessary to obtain sight of the indications, and did not repeat the experiment—my experiment was rather directed to ascertain the presence of lead than the quantity, and I do not imagine, if I had made an experiment to ascertain the quantity, it would have been at all conclusive in this case, as I had not seen the stomach before—I judged it necessary to be careful in examining the water in which I boiled it, to see that it contained no lead, because distilled water sometimes contains a small quantity of lead—if anybody had washed the stomach without that pre<lb></lb>caution, caution, I do not think it would be a reasonable experiment—it is impos<lb></lb>sible for me to say that the water in which the stomach was washed before did not contain sugar of lead.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you examine part of the contents of the bottle out of which it is said the deceased had drank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—this is the bottle—(No. 1)—I analyzed it, and found that the liquid was a strong alcoholic liquid—I found that it contained rather more than half its bulk of absolute alcohol—that is the strongest spirit—it is stronger than spirits of wine—it is more than two to one of the strength of proof spirits—it also contained prussic acid, which appeared to have been derived from almonds or kernels, with which it had been flavoured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the way in which they usually make brandy bitters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is the common ingredient in flavouring all bitters, along with orange peel, gentian, and other things—those things which go by the name of <hi rend="italic">old Tom</hi>, and other things, are compounds of the same kind—I should call them poisonous if taken in too large a quantity.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you did not discover any preparation of lead in that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The liquid contained no metallic salt whatever—there was no lead in the liquid—there was a sediment in the bottom of the bottle—I ascertained the existence of chalk in that sediment, and the appropriate test for lead and mercury yielded faint indications of the presence of both; but such test may be fallacious, in consequence of the quantity not being sufficient to enable me to separate the metals themselves—when I first received the bottle I did not perceive the sediment—the liquor poured off clear, and it was not till I had reason to examine it further that I found a sediment closely impacted in the lower portion of the bottle, so that it</p>

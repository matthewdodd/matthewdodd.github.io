One of these pamphlets was received at the City office, about 5th December, with' a Manchester paper with adver<lb></lb>tisements similar to the one produced in the "Birmingham Daily Post"—in consequence of that I went to the third floor of 1 and 2, Fish Street Hill, about two days afterwards, where I found a room, on the door of which was "Snelling &amp; Son, stock and share brokers"—I saw the boy Riches—on 15th December I went there again, with Simmonds, between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning, and saw about thirty-two letters which had been delivered, addressed to Messrs. Snelling &amp; Son, which I took, as also some other letters and newspapers addressed to them—I found about 200 provincial newspapers there, many of them containing the advertisement which has been read to the Jury; also Irish and Scotch papers—I afterwards went to Seething Lane station where I found the prisoner in custody—I said "Your boy has taken some letters from 1 and 2, Fish Street Hill, to the coffee-house to you which you have received"—he said "I am only the printer for them"—he was asked his name and address, which he refused to give—I said "We know your name is Riches"—he said "Yes, it is"—then he gave his name as John Riches, High Street, Acton—I searched him and found on him the letter which has been produced from the Birkbeck Bank, unopened, directed to G. Riches—he said "It isn't for me, it is for my brother"—Simmonds took a parcel from him—I afterwards went down in the country and got copies of the "Western Times," the-" Birmingham Daily Post," and various news-papers—I had seen the same in the office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, residing at No. 68 1/2, Augustus-street, Regent's-park. I am the father of the deceased, Eliza Lea—the last time I saw her alive was on Monday, 31st Jan., at half-past 7 o'clock in the morning—I know the prisoner well—my daughter and he had lived together, and had been separated between five and six months—I saw the body of my daughter about half-past 11 o'clock, on Monday night, when I was fetched by the policeman—when I saw her last she was in very good health, and most excellent spirits she enjoyed at home all day on Sunday with me—she was twenty-six years of age within one month.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the deceased. I remember seeing her on Monday morning, 31st Jan.—she spent the Sunday with me, and slept at my house that night—she had been living with the prisoner <hi rend="italic">for</hi> five or six years as his wife—they had been separated for five months—she was not living with me at the time in question; she was living in Portland Town, at a place called Townsend-cottages, I think—she went out on Monday morning, about 9 o'clock, or a little after—before she went I gave her a half sovereign and a duplicate to get an article out of pledge in Tottenham Court-road—she was to buy some lining, some trimmings, some buttons, and a reel</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040050"></xptr>
               <p>of cotton—it was, to make two frocks for two of my children—She went out for the purpose of getting the stuff from the pawnbroker's to make the dress—it was merino—there were five or six yards of it—I should know it again—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I know it by the colour—it is merino, and of the same quantity, five or six yards—it had been pawned about ten or eleven months—she was to redeem it, and to buy some lining, trimming, and buttons, to make it up on the same day, or Tuesday—I expected her back in half an hour, if they did not keep her at the pawnbroker's—she did not return—I never saw her again alive—I afterwards saw her dead body at St. Pancras-workhouse—I had never been to her lodgings in Townsend-cottages—she got her living by going out to work at ironing at a laundress's.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I believe that she had not lived with the prisoner for the last five or six months, had she? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not for five months—she had worked for her living that time—I was aware of their separation—she got her living by going out to a laundress to iron—that is very poor work, but she used to earn enough to support herself, both by washing and ironing and doing needlework at times—it was about 9 o'clock on the Monday morning when she left my house, as near as can be—Townsend-cottages is somewhere St. John's-wood way, but I do not know the neighbourhood—I did not give her any more money besides the half sovereign—I wished her to get it changed before she went, and only to take the money she would want—the amount of the pledge was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the interest would have been only a few pence—I wished her to change the half sovereign, and take the exact money—she said she should perhaps get bad change in the neighbourhood, and she had better get it at the pawnbroker's—I have never seen my daughter intoxicated—she was subject to hysterics and illness if she was out in company—she was very spirited; she had high spirits—I only taw her in hysterics once—I attributed the excitement to some hysterical feelings, and not to drink—she had been out in company at the time—I have known her to be hysterical when she has been out in company—it was crying hysterics.</p>

               <p>buttons, some gimp, and a reel of cotton—after she showed me the things the parcel was done up again—she made some inquiry of me about the prisoner, in consequence of which I went with her to Kensington—he was not there—we then returned, and went to Henry-street, Margaret-street, Oxford-street—there is a church building there—we found the prisoner at work there—it was about 20 minutes past 5 o'clock when we got there—the deceased spoke to him—I did not hear what passed—after she had spoken to him he went in and fetched out his basket—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a basket produced by the policeman</hi>)—I cannot say that this is the basket, it was such a basket as this, and there was a tin bottle like this—I cannot tell whether he put it into the basket or not—he carried the basket with him, and came with us—the deceased and he and I came away together—we went into a public house close by the building, and had a pot of beer there—Eliza Lea paid for it, it came to fourpence—we then left the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he make any communication to you at that public house about being married? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He told Eliza that he was married—that was at that house—she said she did not believe it—he said, "I am, so help me God!" and she said she would not believe it without he showed her the certificate—nothing more passed upon that—we then left the public house, and went into the New-road—we stopped at another house at the corner of the New-road—I do not remember the name of it—we had a pot of beer there—the deceased paid for it—we then came on again towards my house—we went to the Southampton Arms, and had a quartern of gin there—there were three glasses, we each had one—she paid for that—I think it was about half past 7 or a quarter to 8 o'clock when we left the Southampton Arms—I then proposed that we should go to my lodgings in Pratt-street to have tea and we all three went there—we got there about 8 o'clock—my husband came in about 10 minutes past 9 o'clock—we had a pot of beer at home besides the tea.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what state of spirits was the deceased as to cheerfulness during the whole of this day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very cheerful; I did not notice any change at all in her manner after the prisoner had told her that he was married—after having had the tea and the beer she said to my husband, "Let's hare a song"—my husband said no, he would not have it, it was getting late, and she said she would sing whether he liked it or not—she did sing a song, and then she called upon Mackett—he objected, but he did sing—they left my place at about a quarter to 10 o'clock—they left together—as she was going she asked me if I would allow her to leave her parcel at my place, and take it to her mother the next day—I told her no, and she took it off the table, and said, "Then I will take it myself," and she did take it, and the prisoner took his basket and bottle—when we had the last pot of beer at my place the deceased said she had only got two pence halfpenny, and she asked me if I would lend her a penny to make up the money to pay, and I lent her a penny—when we first met the prisoner she asked him whether he was going to stand anything to drink, and he said he had no money but two pence which he had brought with him to get a pint of beer for his dinner, and she said, "Well, I will stand a pot of beer, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, if I never see you again"—that was at their first meeting near the church, before we went in to have the first pot of beer, in Henry-street—I occupy the second floor in Pratt-street—I did not go down stairs with them when they left—neither of them were at all in liquor when they left—they appeared on the best of terms when they went away.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you speak as to that man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my belief, but I cannot swear to him—to the best of my belief it was Thomas Mackett, the prisoner—I ran quite close to the man—he had on a light jacket and light trowsers, and a white cap, and a basket or bundle under his arm—I noticed his height; it was apparently about five feet eight, or something near that—I spoke to him, and asked him what was the matter—he replied, "I think therein woman thrown herself in the water"—I did not say anything to him then—Mr. Wolfe spoke to him—he had followed me—the man appeared in mind very cool and collected—what Mr. Wolfe said was to the effect, "Come down and give her assistance then"—he said that to the man—we then proceeded down to the canal, Mr. Wolfe going first, followed by the prisoner, and I following after him—when I got down to the canal I still heard the gurgling sounds once or twice, and several splashes in the water—Mr. Wolfe said he would go and fetch a light, and he went up the passage, followed by the prisoner—I remained at the water's edge—I did not move from the spot till Mr. Wolfe returned with the light—the man whom I suppose to be the prisoner did not return with Mr. Wolfe—I immediately went in search of him, in consequence of something which Mr. Wolfe said, and attempted to find him—I went down Augustus-street, towards Cumberland-market—I did not find the man—I met the policeman, 144, I think, and he returned with me to the canal—there were several more persons at the edge of the wafer at that time, and I saw Percival the policeman with a rope, which Mr. Wolfe had brought when he brought the candle—they tied a stone to it—Percival threw it in—it caught under the arm of the deceased woman, and she was gently drawn in to the water's edge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first heard the footsteps coming up the passage, could you form any opinion as to whether they were near, or at some distance from the canal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Close to the edge—I should imagine they proceeded from almost the immediate edge of the water—I was not far from the edge myself—I do not know the width of the towing path; it is something about thirteen feet perhaps—I believe the distance from the spot at which I first heard the footsteps to the spot where I first met the man, as measured in the plan produced, is 119 feet—that would be about the distance—the distance from the spot in the garden where I was to the spot where I met the prisoner was about sixty feet—immediately I heard the footsteps I went into the house—I ran at the top of my speed, but I had to open two doors.</p>

Q.</hi> You have not been asked this question, but I think it was so foggy thatyoucould hardly see a foot into the water, could yon? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the body of the deceased was found rather towards the opposite side of the canal—I should say the width of the canal is about thirty feet, or nearly that—the body was found fifteen or eighteen feet, I should think, from the edge of the towing-path—the passage that I speak of is used for the purpose of attaching the horses to the barges at the basin—it is the commencement of the towing-path—it is well known in the neighbourhood—I do not know that men and women go down there of an evening—I have never witnessed anything of the kind—I have used that passage myself as a means of going to Primrose-hill—it is a short cut—it brings you out a considerable distance above the York and Albany—you get out close by Primrose-hill—it may be nearly a quarter of a mile long, or probably not so much—I have always declined to swear positively to this man, and have always expressed myself in the same way as I have to-day—I could not swear whether it was a bundle or a basket that he had.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Regalia public house, in Augustus-street. On the night of the 31st Jan., in consequence of a communication made to me by Mr. Wilson, I went out of my house—when I had gone a few yards out of my house with Mr. Wilson, I met a man—I am not able to say that I see that man in Court—I did not distinguish his features at all—it was a dark, foggy night, and, going from the light, and understanding there was something wrong, my attention was taken to the water, so that I did not distinguish the features of the man at all—he bad on a white dress, I could see that—it was a light-coloured dress, but I could not distinguish what texture it was—it was a jacket—I noticed the man's stature—when I met him, I said, "Halloa! what's the matter?" and he made answer, "I think there is a woman in the water"—I do not know what he was doing at that time, for I felt a little <hi rend="italic">irritated</hi> myself—I did not know at the moment whether he was standing still or walking, but I thought perhaps he bad turned in the gateway, hearing the noise—I do not know whether he was walking towards us, or whether he had just turned in—I did not notice which way he was standing—he appeared to be standing half-sideways like when I went in—I said to him, "Let us see whether we cannot assist her"—his observation to me was, "I think there is a woman in the water," or, "I think there is somebody in the water"—it was one or the other—it was words to that effect—when I said, "Let us see if we cannot help her," I ran down to the canal, and left Mr. Wilson and the man behind me—they followed me to the water's edge—when I got to the bank I heard a gurgling noise in the water, a stifling, as if of choking from the water—I went to get a light, and left Mr. Wilson and the man there—I returned in a few minutes with a light—I then only saw Mr. Wilson there—the man was not there—after some exertions, we succeeded in getting the body of the woman out shortly afterwards.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But I am speaking about this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it was not so foggy as it had been—there was a gas-lamp close by the place where I was—I believe the person who passed me to be the prisoner—I have not the least doubt about it—I had never seen him before—I noticed his dress—he had on a flannel jacket, and, I thought, a pair of corduroy trousers, smeared with plaister or mortar—he had on a kind of a lightish cap—he was about five or six yards from me I think, at the time I observed his dress—he was going in a direction towards the York and Albany—he had either a bundle or a basket under his left arm—shortly after, a person of the name of Adams gave me some information, in consequence of which I went down to the Regalia—I was present when the body of the deceased was taken from the water—I sent for Mr. Johnson, the doctor, and he came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 383). From information I received on the morning of 1st Feb., I went to a new chapel that is being built in Margaret street, Cavendish-square—I afterwards went to a place called Eccleston buildings, close to the Marylebone police court—I think that was about 1 o'clock—I there found the prisoner—there were other parties in the room—I did not go in—I saw a woman in the room—I called the prisoner out, and told him that his employer, Mr. Norris, wanted him to go somewhere to erect a scaffolding—he came with me—after we had gone, I suppose, 500 yards on, I told him I was a police-officer, and I wanted to ask him a question or two; he might answer me, or not, as he thought fit—I said, "I believe you were in the company of a woman named Lea last night?"—he said, "Í was"—I said, "Where did you leave her?"—he said, "At a friend's house in Pratt-street, Camden-town; where is she now?"—I said, "I believe she is in St. Pancras' workhouse; she was found last night in the canal, at the back of the Regalia"—he said, "Is she dead?"—I said, "Yes, she is, and I shall take you into custody, on suspicion of having caused her death by throwing her into the water"—he immediately dropped his head upon his bosom—I took him by the sleeve, and led him along—we walked about 200 yards, I suppose, before bespoke—he then rose</p>

               <p>himself up, and said, "I shall be able to clear myself"—I then took him to the station-house—on the Toad I said to him, "Was that your wife that I saw?"—he said, "Yes; I got married last Sunday week"—I left him at the police court close by, in the custody of another constable, and returned to the room from which I had taken him—I there got a brown paper parcel—it was produced by the woman who said she was the prisoner's wife—it contained some merino, lining, buttons, and a reel of cotton—those are the things that have been produced—I went a second time the same day to the same house, in Eccleston-buildings, and brought away from the room this basket that has been produced—the bottle was in the basket; I took it out and put it on the drawers—I believe it is the same bottle; it was one like it—I took that when I went a third time to the house—I know the neighbourhood of Augustus street and the Regalia perfectly well—if a person was going from the Regalia to Eccleston-buildings, he would not pass through Augustus-street in the direction of the York and Albany—the York and Albany is at the top of Park-village East, and Augustus-street is at the bottom—a person going through Augustus-street towards the York and Albany would be going away from Eccleston-buildings, quite in a contrary direction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> There is not the shadow of a doubt about that, I appose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I was in plain clothes when I went to apprehend the prisoner—when I told him that his master, Mr. Norm, wanted him to erect a scaffolding, that was a falsehood of my own invention; I wanted to get him out of the court before I let him know what I wanted with him—I was quite alone, and it is a very low neighbourhood—it was about 1 o'clock in the day—the moment he was called he made his appearance—I am not generally in the habit of inventing falsehoods—it was not done to throw the prisoner off his guard—Eccleston-buildings is within sight of the police court—it is not a general thing with the police to tell untruths of this kind—we adopt the best plan we can—I did not think it was wrong, because I had not told him who or what I was at that time—I walked, I should think, quite 500 yards before I told him—he was walking by my side—he was talking about the building in Margaret-street—he asked me if I had seen it—I said, "Yes"—he said it was a very nice building, and I said it Was—I bad seen it—I had been there previously—I went to find out who his master was—I am not aware that when a person is charged with an offence, neither the Judge nor any one else can ask him a single question; I swear that—I put the questions to him, having told him he might answer them if he liked—I had told him I was a policeman before I put the questions—I had not told him the charge on which I apprehended him—I was not fishing for information; I had not the slightest object of that kind—I did not ask him any question in reference to the case, not the slightest question—when I asked him whether he was in company with a young girl named Lea last night, that was after I had told him I was a police-officer—I had not then told him the offence he was charged with—I had told him he might answer, or not, as he liked—I did not put the question for the purpose of entrapping him into answers—I had no object in putting the questions—I did not put the questions till I had told him I was a policeman—after I had told him that, I had an object in putting the questions; but if be had thought proper not to answer me, he had no business to have done so.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185304040057"></xptr>
               <p>because the court where the prisoner was living is a very low Irish court, and a great number of loose characters being in it, and I being alone, I thought it was possible, if I had gone to the room and told him I was a policeman, and what I was going to take him for, I should not be able to apprehend him by myself—it was to get him away from there, and likewise to get, if possible, possession of the parcel which I was aware had been in the deceased's possession previous to her being found in the water.</p>

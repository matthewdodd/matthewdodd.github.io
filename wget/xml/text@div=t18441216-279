               <p>told him—he wass accused of a hoghway robbery in the London-road on the night previous—he denied it, and said he was not out that night—I then fetched the prosecutor to identify him, as one of the parties—he saw him next morning—the London-road is not the same road as Waterloo-road it is nearer the Elephant and Castle—Princes-street comes into the Lon<lb></lb>don-road—the two roads are not very far distant—St. George's-circus divides the two.</p>

               <p>had carried the supper—I did not see my husband then—it might be about half an hour after, or rather more—I cannot say exactly the time—I then saw Bing at the other end of the same court, near St. George's-road, talking to a short man, and when I turned round the corner, into St. George's-road, I saw Palmer talking to a man, either in a sleeve-jacket or Waistcoat, with a handkerchief tied round his chin—that was directly after I bad seen Bing—he was not in the same court, but in St. George's-road, round the corner.</p>

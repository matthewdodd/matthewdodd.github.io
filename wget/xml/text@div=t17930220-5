            's house and he lives in it; last Wednesday as I was sitting at the end of the parlour adjoining to the shop with Mrs. and Mr. Page, Mr. Page thought he heard a person in the shop, and Mrs. Page getting up to see, said, there was a man taking off the things on the counter; Mr. Page immediately pursued, and the man finding himself pursued throwed the things over some palisades; I saw the things behind the palisades where he threw them; I followed and took them up from the place where the man threw them; Mr. Page has the things.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this parlour of your's at the back of the shop? - It is, and the glass door between them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the shop door shut or open? - It was shut to, but I cannot positively say whether it was fast or not; it communicates with the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any partner, or any body concerned in this business with you? - No, nobody is concerned with me. I am a single person; I never saw the boy till after he was retaken; the prints are here.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>We were drinking tea in the parlour adjoining the shop, there was a candle in the shop but not in the parlour; I saw the reflection in the shop of a man; I said there is somebody in the shop; I believe Mrs. Page got up and said, there was somebody; I went out to him; on his being closely pursued, I saw him throw the things over the palisades; I did not see any body near him not so near as to lay hold of him; I am confident that I perfectly saw him throw the things over; when he threw the things over he was a very little distance from me; Mrs. Brookes came up as I was bringing him back to the place; he was got about seven or eight houses off when I took him, and she went inside of the palisades and took them out; we brought him back to our house, the prisoner was very penitent and begged pardon, and wanted to get off, he would go for a soldier, or do any thing if we would set him at liberty.</p>
               <p>(The print produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Page. Did you see him go out of the shop? - I did not see him till I was out of the shop; but I immediately pursued and never lost sight of him till I got him.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Brookes. What is the value of that cotton? - It cost me 3 l. 12 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were two men running before me about three yards, these two men were before me, I had been looking after work, and I was going through the town, I never saw the things; I have no witness at all, I have no soul in London that knows me excepting the girl that I live with.</p>

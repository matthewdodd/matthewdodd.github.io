             then went out, leaving the other man and Turner there; they looked at a dress that was there, and asked the price of it- they then went away; I have since seen the blue handkerchief which I sold them, and four other handkerchiefs, which are my employer's, in the care of the inspector.</p>

There is one counter which goes round the shop; there was one other person serving at the time the prisoners were there; and one other man standing in the shop nearer the door than I was - these two women came in first, and the men close behind them; I should know the other man if I saw him - ours is not a regular haberdashers shop; we have not a great many customers- I did not know I had been robbed till the next morning; these handkerchiefs are part of what I showed them.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA FREDERICK CLEMENTS. I am an inspector of Police. The female prisoners were given to me on the 1st of March - they objected to my searching them, and I sent for a woman; these four handkerchiefs were found on Turner, tied up in this blue one - John Sherman afterwards came to the station, and I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the prosecutor's shop? A. Yes, I think it is half a mile from the station; I saw this property taken from under Turner's clothes - she had a cloak on, but it was under her other things.</p>

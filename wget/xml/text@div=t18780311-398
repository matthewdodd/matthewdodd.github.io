                  </hi>. On 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> February, about 12.30, I saw a parcel in the cook's department at the Asylum in a wrapper tied with rope, and addressed to Miss Cook, Putenham, Guildford, and gave information to the police—my cook was housemaid at the Asylum eight years—my former evidence as to the "Obligation Book" would apply to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Cook left in March, 1877, and went to live with her parents at Futenham—she had an excellent character—she came to the institution ball on 16th January by my permission—I do not know whe<lb></lb>ther she left her dress behind—I was told her mother was ill afterwards.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Surrey Constabulary</hi>11). On 2nd February I watched Hunt's van from Knap Hill—I saw this box taken out and put into Giles's van, the earner to Futenham—I went to Puttenham—I saw Giles take the box from his van and put it into the cottage where Mary Cook resides—she came downstairs, received the box, and paid Giles 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for carriage—I went in and told her I was a constable from Guildford, and asked her to open the box in my presence—she hesitated—she undid the cover and took out two skirts and a collar—she then said "I know pretty well what is in it and who sent it"—I said "Will you take it out for satisfaction?"—she would not do so—I took it out—the key was in the skirt—there was a piece of fresh pork and half a shoulder of mutton, a piece of bacon, some pickles, tea, sugar, pudding, and cake—I put the things back—I told her I must take her to Mr. Barker upon the suspicion of these goods being part of the proceeds of a robbery at the Brookwood Asylum—she said "I am sorry."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Cook was called downstairs by her mother, who appeared to be an invalid—she was standing by the fire.</p>

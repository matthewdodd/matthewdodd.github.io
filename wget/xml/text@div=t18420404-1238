                  </hi>. I live with my father, William Mills, a grocer a High-street, Poplar. On the 17th of March the prisoners came into my father's shop—Tyler came in first, and Hippesly in two or three minutes after—Tyler asked for cheese and tobacco—I gave him them—he returned the cheese, saying it was bad, and I gave him a different cheese—Hippesly asked for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—I gave it him—they both paid for what they had—Tyler went out before Hippesly came in—they were not in the shop both at the same time—Hippesly went to the door or to the street, came back, and asked for a different sort of tobacco—I took it from him, and gave him a penny, and then he went out—Mr. Griffiths, as opposite neighbour, came and said something, in consequence of which I looked at the door-way of the shop, and missed a chest of tea from the door—I ran down Wade's-place, into the East India-road, and there saw the two prisoners with the chest of tea in a cloth, carrying it between them—they were about half or a quarter of a mile from the shop—I was after them, and called "Stop thief"—they dropped the tea—I contained to run after them—a person came out of a shop in the East India-road—I left him with the tea, and pursued the prisoners—they both took that course for some time, and then turned into different roads—I left Hippesly; and continued following Tyler—I took him at last—I followed him for about ten minutes—I am sure of their persons—there were 25lbs. of ten✗ in the chest, and it was the property of my father.</p>

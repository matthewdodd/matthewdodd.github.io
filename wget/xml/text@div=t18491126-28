On the morning of 5th Nov., about a quarter past ten o'clock, I went to the weigh-bridge, at the Camden-station; I saw another constable there, and in consequence of what he said, I called the prisoner and asked him what he had taken into the porter's lodge—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "You have taken something, and I must know what it is"—we were walking towards the porter's lodge, and he said, "Come along and I will show you"—I went with him to the lodge, and he showed me a piece of wood which he picked up—I said "No, that is not what you brought in, it was something else, and I must know what it is; let me see your locker"—he said, he had not got his keys with him; he had left them at home—I said, "I must have it opened"—he said, "I must go and borrow a bunch of keys"—he went out, and came back with some keys which he attempted to open the locker with, but they would not—another constable was there—he left, and we were left alone—he then fell on his knees and said, if I had any feelings for an aged mother I would say nothing about it—I said, I was placed in such a situation that I must go on—he then took his own key out of his pocket and opened his locker—he took something out and threw it behind him, which I found to be a dead partridge—he repeated, that he hoped I would say nothing about it, and said, "It is no use to deny it; I did take it"—I afterwards saw the boxes on the tarpaulin, from one of which the partridge had been taken.</p>

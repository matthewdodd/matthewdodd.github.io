               <p>Q. Where were all these things? - They were locked up in a box, in a chest, in the one pair of stairs room.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you lose them? - The 9th of last month.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you had seen them before you missed them? - I do not know when I had seen them before they were lost; my wife can inform you.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you do not know much about them yourself? - No further than I found the property on the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live in your house? She came to visit me and my wife, on Sunday the 28th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known her? - About three or four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she stay with you till the 9th of October? - She said she was out of place, and my wife said, Betty, you are welcome to my apartment, until you can get a place; on the Tuesday following she came, on the 30th, and continued till the Friday night, when she said she was going to her mother's; then she came again on Saturday, and staid till the 9th of last month, which was the day she committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you missed the things? - On the night following, the Friday night, as the 9th was the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take her up? - I took her on Sunday night afterwards in Thames-street, on Garlick-hill, I was standing there by myself, and I saw her come along with my wife's property on, and I stopped her; she had the black silk cloak, cotton gown, and cotton stockings on her, and the gown I knew very well; she was passing by her mother's door when I took her; I took her immediately into her mother's, where my wife was.</p>
               <p>Mrs. STEWARD sworn.</p>

               <p>I am the wife of the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us how the prisoner came into your house? - She came on the 28th of September, she came on a visit, and staid to tea and sup; accordingly she told me she was out of place; I told her she might be at my place and do some needle work, and eat such as I eat, and I would pay her for her work, till she got a place. Accordingly she came on Tuesday, and continued till Friday, and slept with me in the bed. On Friday night my husband said he was very ill with a cold, and he would stay at home; she went out that night to sleep and came the next morning at seven o'clock and staid till nine, and while I was in one apartment and she was in the other, she found the means of opening my place and took away these things; one gown she had pledged.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you known her? - About three or four years; I knew her to be a servant, and I knew her mother to be a very honest woman, as I always thought, and I have no doubt but what she is at this time.</p>
               <p>Court to Steward. Was there any body with her when you took her? - There was a young man that she had hold of his arm; I do not know nothing of the young man; I lost him in a moment. I produce a key, which was found on her, and which, she told me, she had opened the box with.</p>

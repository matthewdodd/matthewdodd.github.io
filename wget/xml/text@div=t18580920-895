                  </hi>. I am cashier at the London Joint-stock Bank. Mr. Goodered brought this cheque to the bank on 3d September, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon; it was in the same state in which it is now—this is not Mr. Jupp's handwriting—we sent an officer with Mr. Goodered in search of the prisoner, supposing this had been the writing of Mr. Jupp, and he had been in the habit of drawing in this form—if I had believed this to be genuine, I should have paid it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant—I presented this order to the London Joint-stock Bank on 3d September—in consequence of what they said, I went with an officer in search of the prisoner—I ob<lb></lb>tained this cheque from the prisoner, merely as a charge; he gave it me to take care of on the Wednesday evening, before I went to the bank—he gave it me at 222, Piccadilly—on the following day, he asked me if I had been to the bank to obtain the money for that cheque—I told him I had not, I did not understand that I was to present the cheque—he said I had better do so on the following day, and he gave me to understand that he would meet me on the following day, I presume after I came from the bank—having heard what Mr. Saunders stated, I went in search of the prisoner with an officer—I found him at 222, Piccadilly—I asked him if he had given me such a draft to that amount, and the bank it was drawn upon—he said he had, stating the amount, 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the bank—I left him with the officer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He had been in the habit of attending this saloon, 222, Piccadilly, some years ago, and you knew him to be a young man of respectable family? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I always understood so—I knew he was very lib<lb></lb>eral, not getting intoxicated frequently—on the night when he asked me if I had been to the bank he was evidently very much excited by drink—when he came to the saloon he was the worse for drink—he came staggering in, and asked if I had got the money, and said, "Go to-morrow and get it"—I had on former occasions lent him money, and I would again, if he had asked me—I don't know that I would have lent him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I would have given him credit to the amount of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the next day, when he was given in custody, I saw him come out of a cab, in Piccadilly; I could not say that he was the worse for liquor—he appeared excited, and in a hurry.</p>

               <p>Q. You had been drinking, I suppose? - A. I had been working very late that night; I had been drinking a little that night at a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you drank. - A. I might have drank three or four glasses of spirits, and a pint or two of porter; it took a little effect of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say two pints of porter, or only one? - A. Two, I believe, I cannot exactly say.</p>
               <p>Q. You met this girl in the street; where did you go? - A. I was not talking with this girl, I was talking with two other women; she picked me up; she catched hold of my arm just as I was wishing these women good night; they were all three strangers to me; she told me to come away from these girls, for they only wanted to rob me of my bundle which I had.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your bundle contain? - A. There was this great-coat, and a new flannel waiscoat belonging to my master Mr. Bagg.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this great coat delivered into your care; did you take it away from your master, or did he give you charge of it? - A. I was to take it home and repair it for him at my lodgings, because we had not time to repair it on Saturday night; after I had repaired it, I was to take it to a gentleman who owned it, Mr. Kenoll, a gentleman in Poland-street.</p>

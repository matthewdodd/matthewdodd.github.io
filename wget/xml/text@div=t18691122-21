                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant A R</hi> 413). I am stationed at Uxbridge—on Tuesday night, 16th November, about 10.15, I was outside Mr. Wood-bridge's premises—the river runs through a field where I was—about sixty yards from the fowl-house I saw the prisoner walking along the field, in a direction from the premises—he got over some hurdles into the foot-path, near the river—I went and met him—I knew him before—I asked him what he had been in the field for—he said, "I have been in no field"—I said, "It looks very suspicious; what have you got about you?"—he said, "Nothing!"—I said I wanted to see what he had got about him, and I felt the side of his jacket—he then seized me by the throat, and said he would</p>

               <p>see me b—before he would tell me—a struggle took place, and we fell down—we got up, and he got hold of me again—I caught hold of him again, with his back to the river, and I pushed him into the river, as I could see that he was trying to push me in; it was not very deep, just enough to cover him all over—I picked him out again, and searched him, and took from his jacket pocket three dead fowls, two cocks and a hen; they were warm, and had evidently just been killed—I took the prisoner to the station—on the way there he said the fowls did not belong to him; they belonged to me—he then said they were swimming down the river, and be went in to pick them out, for fear they should be drowned—I found this key upon him—I have tried it to the lock of Mr. Woodbridge's hen-house, and it fits the lock—I showed the fowls to Harman and Weatherley, and they ideiiti<lb></lb>fied them.</p>

I am under gardener to Mr. Woodbridge—on Tuesday afternoon, about 5 o'clock, I looked through the beer-house, and the fowls were all safe—in the morning, about 6.45, the two cocks and the hen were shown to me by the sergeant; they were the property of Mr. Woodbridge—I had known them ever since they were hatched—the look of the hen-house door was not damaged at all, but it was partly open.</p>

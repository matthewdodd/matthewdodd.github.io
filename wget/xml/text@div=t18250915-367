            . I am a Thames Police Surveyor. I was on duty about two o'clock in the morning of the 28th of August, and heard a call for the police from the Sarah and Mary. I went on board, and found the prisoner in custody of the crew. I took him, but only found a small piece of money on him - he had no hat on; I asked him where it was, one of the ship's company took up a hat from the deck, and said "Here is a hat;" the prisoner at first said it was his; but I looked into it, and found this watch - then he said it was not his. I put it on his head, and said "It is your's no doubt." I took him in the police-boat, and asked where he got the hat; he said he bought it on shore for 1 s. 6 d. I then said "Where did you get the watch?" he said I should hear about that next morning. I then called to the people on board the vessels in that tier, and said, if any person had lost a watch, they might apply to the office - the Times was one of the vessels. The prisoner then said, he had taken it from one of the vessels - he had only come out of prison on the Thursday, and he must go there again. I asked him how he found it in the dark; he said he heard the b - y thing tick, and took it through distress.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was three months in the House of Correction. I applied to the Prussian Consul, and he said "You have been in confinement, and shall go there again;" So I was obliged to go on board the ship, and take this watch to support me.</p>

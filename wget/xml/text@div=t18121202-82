On the 4th of November, about four in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the shop, and enquired the price of treacle. I told him. He went away. There was a five shilling paper of halfpence on the counter. A woman was standing next to where the halfpence were. In about three minutes the prisoner returned into the shop again. He asked for an ounce of barley-sugar. My man served him. I suspected and watched him. He went out of the shop, and I missed the halfpence. I desired my man to go after him, saying, that he had taken the paper of halfpence. My man went after him and brought him back. The halfpence were found upon him.</p>
               <p>- ANTHONY. In consequence of what my master told me I went after the prisoner. I overtook him. I brought him back to the shop. I desired him to take the halfpence out of his pocket. He produced them. These are them. They are my master's property.</p>

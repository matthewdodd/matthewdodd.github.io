                  </hi>. I am a carman, living in Archer-street, Camden-town. On the 27th of March I had a bay gelding, which I turned out into some fields near Chalk-farm, very lightly fenced—I saw it safe on Sunday night, the 27th of March, at nearly nine o'clock in the evening—I went to look for it at five the next morning, and missed it—I never knew the horse to stray previous to that, but since this has happened I have heard be has been out frequently, and the labourers about there have put him in his place again—there were plenty of vacancies for him to get out of—there are very few rails—I had put him there—for about a fortnight or three weeks—I saw it again about twelve, or a little after, the same day I missed it, in the custody of a policeman, at Clerkenwell—it was worth between 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know the prisoner—I know the York and Albany public-house—it is about a quarter of a mile from the field.</p>

               <p>The prisoner brought me a bay gelding on Monday, the 28th of March—he told me he brought it to be slaughtered, from a gentleman named Rouse, a hay and straw dealer and farmer, between Hanwell and Southall—he asked me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I told him the horse would work, and it would not do for me to buy it without I knew who it belonged to—I went to Southall the same morning, to Mr. Rouse, who he said he had brought it from, and he bad not sent the horse, and knew nothing about it—when I came back I went t6 Clerkenwell police-station—the prosecutor was there, and the horse—I gave the prisoner into custody on suspicion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prisoner was given into my custody, with the gelding, on the 28th of March—he said he had brought it from a person named Rouse, at Southall—he afterwards said he found it in Barnsbury-road, near Chalk-farm.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going past the York and Albany about four o'clock on Monday morning. A man came up the road with a horse; he called to me, and said, "Have you got anything to do?" I said "No;" he said, "I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if you will take this horse down to the horse-slaughterer's in Sharp's-alley. "I said very well, I would go with it; he said, "If you don't sell the horse, bring it back to me at the Jew's Harp; and if you sell it, meet me at the Jew's Harp, and I will pay you the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."</p>

               <p>I took it to Mr. Achelor; he was not up; I waited till he was up. He asked whose horse it was. I said, "Mr. Rowster's, of Southall" He said he did not think it was right, he would not buy it. I took the horse and came away with him, and was coining up Cow-cross, to go to the public-house where I was to meet this man, when I was taken.</p>

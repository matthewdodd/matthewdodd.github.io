We have an internal communication with it - the prisoners are strangers to me. On the 27th of January, about five minutes before nine o'clock in the morning, I took the notes and cash stated in the indictment out of the iron chest, and laid them on the desk - there was 297 l. 9 s. 6 d. in all - the warehouse-door was open. I went into the back warehouse, leaving nobody in the counting-house; the door was open. I was not absent five minutes before I heard the warehouse door shut; I came into the front warehouse to see who was gone out, and immediately missed the property. I went out, and saw a man running in the middle of the road, fifteen or twenty yards from the door; I pursued him some distance, calling Stop thief, but he got off, and I cannot say who he was. The notes were my sole property - I had received the whole of them the night preceding from

            . I am a linen-draper, and live at No. 318, High Holborn. On the 27th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the female prisoner came to our shop, and bought a hearth-rug, carpet and counterpane, which came to 2 l. 18 s.; she paid me a 20 l. note, I gave her the change and goods, and she left the shop. About fifteen minutes after, from information I received, I went out to look for her, and saw her at the corner of Gray's Inn-lane, in company with the male prisoner. I followed them up Gray's Inn-lane, and saw them go into the Marquis of Granby - the man had a bundle under his arm when he went in. They came out in a minute, and I followed them as far as Gray's Inn-gate, across the square through the passage up Brownlow-street into Holborn again, and up to Manning's, the linen-draper, at No. 52, Broad-street, St. Giles's - the female prisoner went in there, and the man returned down Holborn in the same direction in which he came. I followed Sperry into the shop, and communicated my suspicion to one of the shop-men. While I was there I heard her ask for change for a 25 l. note. I went over to Manning's other shop, at the corner of Museum-street, she was brought over there, and a constable was sent for. I went to look after the man, and saw him standing about thirty yards from the shop, where the four streets meet, and asked him to step into the shop with me, telling him the young woman was there whom he was with - he went in without hesitation. In the mean time the constable came, and went into a private room with Manning - the male prisoner walked off. On the following day I was with Plank, and pointed him out in Leather-lane, and he took him into custody; he struggled to get away. I gave the note to Mr. Nutting, after marking it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you point him out to Plank, or did he ask you if he was the man - A. No, I said</p>
               <p>"that is the man." Plank said</p>
               <p>"Be sure" - I was sure, and he took him. I had described him to Plank before.</p>

I asked her how she got the note? I neither threatened nor promised her - she said it was given to her by a gentleman from the country, who frequently visited her, and that he gave her two 25 l., a 20 l., and a 1 l. note.

At a late hour that night, Mr. Nutting brought me a printed bill, with a description of the notes; one of them exactly corresponded with the 25 l. note delivered to me. Next morning I went with Mr. Nutting and Mr. Shepherd to New Prison, and asked her, in their presence, if what she had told me the night before, as to her name and address, as also the person she had the note from, was all correct? she said it was. I asked her when the gentleman gave them to her? she said last Wednesday (which was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182002170013"></xptr>26th). I said,</p>
               <p>"You was apprehended on Thursday, are you sure it was not that day?" she said, No, she was certain it was the day before.

I found she did lodge in Vine-street in the name of Allen, in the back room first floor - it is a little broker's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of Allen - A. I was in Leather-lane with Nicholson about the middle of the next day, Friday - he had given me a very exact description of the man before that. I saw the prisoner at some distance before me, with a large bundle under his left arm, and an umbrella in his right hand - his back was towards us; Nicholson said</p>
               <p>"That is the man!" I desired him to be sure. I got as near to him as possible - he looked at him, and gave me a signal; when he got near him I advanced by the right side of Allen, and asked him to step into a shop, as I wished to speak with him. He rather started back, and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want?" I seized him by the right arm and said I suspected him to be the man who had robbed a gentleman of 297 l., and if he was innocent he could have no objection to walk into the shop with me. He instantly threw his bundle and umbrella down, and made considerable resistance - I succeeded in getting him into Mr. Green's shop. In securing him the bundle was lost, as a mob gathered. The umbrella was brought in, it was broke in the scuffle. I put him into a coach, took him to the office, searched him, and found one 50 l., two 20 l., four 10 l., two 5 l., one hundred and five 1 l. notes, and 3 l. 15 s. in silver, and a key, which he said belonged to his room. I told him he lodged at No. 4, Vine-street, Mutton-hill, he said he did. I tried the key - it opened the door, and in that lodging, the back room on the first floor, I found a 10 l. note in a small box. He said I should find more money there. I also found a memorandum, which I produce - Nutting claimed it. I also found a shop-bill of Nicholson's for a counterpane, a carpet, and a hearth-rug, which came to 2 l. 18 s. I found a duplicate in his pocket of a hearth-rug, carpet, and quilt, pledged that day at Hill's, Turnmill-street - I went and found them there. I found a new hat on his head, with Blissett's name in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found nothing at the lodgings but the 10 l. note - A. No. If Sperry had not given me the address I might not have found him. She said she was drawn into it by a man.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mrs. Hill. On the 28th of January, in the morning, the prisoner, Allen, pledged the articles referred to in the duplicate produced. He was in the habit of pledging with us. He brought them in and said,</p>
               <p>"I have just been buying these, lend me 5 s. on them," which I did without undoing them.</p>

I delivered a paper with it - it was composed of the different notes stated in the indictment - (examining the notes produced). The 25 l. note paid to Manning, the 50 l., two 20 l., four 10 l., and forty-three of the 1 l. notes found on the prisoner, the 10 l. note found at his lodgings, have all my writing on them, and are part of the notes.

            . I am a pawnbroker, 135, High Holborn. On the 10th of August, between two and three in the afternoon, the prisoner came to pledge a gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say - A. She asked two pound; I lent her that sum upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about the prisoner being the person - A. No. I saw her again on the Monday following, at 28, Cato-street, at her lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you where she lived - A. Yes; St. Mary Devises, in Wiltshire; she pledged it in the name of

            , No. 9, Virginia-row; I have had the watch ever since; I produce it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to her house, 28, Cato-street - A. Because I disputed her pledging the watch. I went No. 9, Virginia-row, to enquire for Mrs. Gamble; I was told that Mrs. Gamble did not live there; I went there to enquire whether I could hear any thing of her; she gave that address; I was told that Mrs. Gamble did not lodge there, but Mrs Sweetman did. I was directed to Cato-street; I told her of the circumstance of the handbill coming round of the watch; that she must go with me; she came without any hesitation.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not deny having pledged the watch with you, did she - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the watch - A. About ten pound.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Look at that watch and tell me whether you know that watch - A. Yes; it is mine; I know it by the form of it; the name inside is Vivan, No. 19. I have no doubt of it being my watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going down Holborn talking to the child; a gentlewoman tapped me on the shoulder, she said I believe you are a countrywoman of mine; she asked me if I was not a Wiltshire woman; I said my husband was a Wiltshire man; she said she was going down into the country, she would give me a shilling to do a favour for her; she gave me the watch to pawn for two pound; she told me her name. Through the gentlemen disputing about the watch I forgot her name; I pawned it in my own name; I thought she came honestly by it; she was a creditable person. I gave the gentleman my true direction.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. What other person was in the house at the time - A. There were two servants, a gentleman that lodges in the first floor, an a servant of his.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door fast or not - A. No; and that is how I supposed she got in; it was a very sultry hot day, the door was left on a jar for the purpose of air coming in.</p>
               <p>JURY. I wonder how she could escape the notice of so many in the house - did any of the servants abscond from the house at that time - A. No; nor did the gentleman; he is a man of respectability.</p>

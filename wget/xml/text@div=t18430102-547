                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Henry Pounce—we live in Ed<lb></lb>ward-street, Portman-square. On Friday night, the 16th of Dec., I was in Park-street, Dorset-square, between six and seven o'clock—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner soner and two other persons—the prisoner was the middle one of the three—when I left home I had a purse in my pocket, containing a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank-note, with the name of Mrs. Gilby on it, four sovereigns, and six half-sovereigns—I had seen it safe not two hours before I left home—while I was walking in Park-street, I felt a push down at the bottom of my pocket—I went on a step or two, and put my hand into my pocket, and missed my purse—I then turned round, and saw the prisoner and the other two walking straight abreast away towards the bottom of the street, and the prisoner was the middle one of the three—when I turned round the prisoner spoke to the other two—he turned, and saw me following them—I saw the one on the right hand turn round his face a little as it he was going to have a sight of me, and immediately they all made a very quick pace forwards, abreast—when I first turned round after I felt the push, they were twenty yards from me, if not more, and they were then going forwards—I had not seen them before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you turned round, and saw these three men, was there anybody else near you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, no one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see a policeman, and give them into custody? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the policeman brought the prisoner in custody, and we went to a baker's shop—the prisoner said, when the policeman took him into the shop, "You are mistaken, I am not the person; I was walking quite alone."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you said anything to the prisoner before he said that, or had you said anything that he might have heard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I called to the policeman to take those men, and he said, "What have they done?"—I said, "They have robbed me"—they could all hear it—they were close by—when I said that, the prisoner ran—the policeman ran after him and took him while running—when I turned round after I felt this push at my pocket, there was no person near me but those three, and when the prisoner was brought back to the baker's shop, before I had said anything to him, he said, "You are mistakes, I was walking alone."—I said, "You was not walking alone, there were three of you, and you was the middle one of the three, there was one on your right hand, and one on your left"—the prisoner said nothing to that—a coach<lb></lb>man then came into the baker's shop, and said, "That is not the man you want, that one has gone round the corner, I heard the money rattle in his pocket"—I do not recollect that the prisoner said any thing when he heard that said.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not before make a mistake, and say it was the prisoner said that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I thought so—the policeman did not tell me to say so—the police<lb></lb>man man had no communication with me about it—he did not say any thing to me about the coachman—he did not say, "It was not the coachman who said it, it was the prisoner"—I had not heard that till I was before the Magistrate.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable D</hi> 137.) Mrs. Pounce called to me that even<lb></lb>ing in Park-street—I saw the prisoner, and one person in company with him—they were from eight to ten yards from Mrs. Pounce—she said she had been robbed of her purse and money, and said, "There goes the man"—I only saw the prisoner, and one other person—I directly went after them—as soon as the prisoner saw me coming after him, he set off, and ran—I ran, and caught him when he had run about twenty yards—I said, "I want you; a lady has accused you of stealing her purse and money"—he said, "You are mistaken, I am a respectable tradesman"—I said, "I can't help it, you must return with me"—Mrs. Pounce came up, and the prisoner said, "I am not the man you want, he is gone round the corner"—I took him into a baker's shop—I found on him a pocket-book, but none of the property that Mrs. Pounce complained of losing—the coachman came in in a minute or two after I was in the baker's shop, and he said, "The man you want is gone round the corner"—before I had searched the prisoner, Mrs. Pounce said she would give him in charge, and I said to him, "I know you"—he made no reply—he exhibited a card in the baker's shop, and it was left there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it a card similar to this?—(<hi rend="italic">producing one.) A.</hi> Yes—I told the prisoner I knew him—that was not my imagination—I knew him well—I have seen him repeatedly before in Oxford-street—I cannot name the time—it might be six months ago—I have not been on duty there for these four months—I saw him in the evening, while I was on duty—I cannot say when—it might be six months ago, and I had seen him before—it might be three months previous, passing in Oxford-street—within the last year I might have seen him three or four times—I have seen him in company with <hi rend="italic">swell</hi> mobs—I have not myself had any person in custody whom I have seen him in company with, nor seen any man tried whom I have seen him in com<lb></lb>pany with, but I have a witness, Sergeant Thompson, to prove it—I have made a communication to Thompson since the prisoner has been in custody—I did not know at the time I took the prisoner that he had been in company with those who have been in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had any conversation about this matter with Mrs. Pounce? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing particular, sir—I have certainly called once or twice at the house she lives at, in Edward-street, Portman-square—I might have called twice—I did call twice at the house—I do not like to speak unless I am certain—I was not certain momentarily, when you first asked me, but I know I have now—I cannot recollect when the last time was—the prisoner was committed last Thursday—I have called on Mrs. Pounce once since then, and once be<lb></lb>fore—I had known her before—I have been on duty by the house for two years—I have been in the shop lately, talking with her a few minutes—I was employed to trace the other two if I could.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What had your calling at that house to do with your tracing the other two? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I called in to tell her I had done nothing further—I do not recol<lb></lb>lect that I had any further conversation with her—the first time I called I was on private duty—I saw her in the shop—I might have asked her how she did—I did not go into the little back-parlour the first time—I will not swear I did not the last time, because she walked home with me from this place—I have been in her house three times altogether—I did not go into the shop then, only into the parlour—I do not know whether she is a hospitable lady—I took a glass in her presence at the bar yesterday, but I paid for it—I have taken one glass of gin in her house—that was the night before last—I was not on duty then—I had walked home with her—when she pointed out two persons to me, who she said had robbed her, they were about ten yards off—I should say they could not have heard what she said—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a coachman, but am out of employ. On the evening of the 16th of Dec. I was in New-street—I saw the prisoner and lie two men who have got away—they were coming towards the square, towards me—the prisoner was just in the act of running when the policeman took him-the other two ran past me, and I heard some money rattle in the pocket of the shorter one of the two—he went round the corner—I went into the baker's shop, where the policeman took the prisoner—I said, "It is no use to detain this one, the one you want is gone round the corner."</p>

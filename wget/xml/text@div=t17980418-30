             cut the leather out of the waggon, in Mr. Fish's yard, the White Bear, at Hounslow, about half past eight in the evening; then he carried it down to Master Woods's, a broom-maker; he cut three pieces off, and ordered me to put it into our waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you tell this story? - A. Two or three weeks after, I told Mr. Fish of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had there been any enquiry made about it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to conceal it so long? - A.Because I was coming from Hounslow, and he lathered me well.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Goddard.) Have you seen the leather since? - A. Yes; Mr. Fish shewed it me.</p>
               <p>- FISH. sworn. - I keep the White Bear, at Hounslow: Mr. Wood's waggon was at my house the same night, Mr. Goddard told me he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179804180026"></xptr>had been robbed; the prisoner drove Mr. Woods's waggon, belonging to this little boy's father; the boy lives at Bagshot with his father.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the leather was found? - A. Yes, I found it. This boy being beat, the prisoner was discharged; and the next journey they came, this little boy and his father came up, and while they were at supper, I asked the little boy, if he knew any thing of a saw being taken from the yard, and he said, yes; I asked him if he knew any thing of any halters, he said, yes, they were about the horses heads; then I asked him about the leather; and, in consequence of what the boy said, I went down to Bagshot, and had him taken up. A man came up, and said, if he had bought the stuff of him, he should have been in a pretty mess; that was in the prisoner's presence, his name is James Draper; I asked him, what stuff? and he said, some leather. Upon that I went with the driver, and found the leather; I carried the leather to him, and asked him if he knew any thing of it, and he said, yes, he had it out of Mr. Goddard's waggon, in my yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make him any promises? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. It is a troublesome piece of business; you must settle it amongst yourselves.</p>

On Sunday morning, 21st March, about 3.10, I was called to the prisoner's lodging, 51, Orchard Street, Lime house—the door was open—his sister lives in the house—I found his wife on a bed which was covered with blood—her sister and his father were also there, but the prisoner had left—I was at the station about 6.30, when the prisoner came there—I knew him by his description, and I told him I had been looking for him since 3 o'clock, and should charge him with attempting to murder his wife by cutting her throat with a razor—I searched him, and found in his waistcoat pocket 'a knife and a piece of paper covered with blood, as if the knife had been wiped on it, but there was no blood on the knife—he said, "Is she dead?"—his left hand was very much cut, and I' sent for a doctor—I searched the room, but found no sharp instrument.</p>

               <p>I then went out about 6 o'clock, leaving him in bed, and stayed out five hours—I returned at 10.55, and he was still in bed—I woke him up to have his supper—he got out of bed and asked me where I had been—I refused to tell him, and said that I would go out again, and got up to do so; he tried to prevent me—we both fell over the machine stool, and when I got to the door I found I was bleeding—we struggled, but he struck no blow at me, it was only to prevent me going out again—I saw no weapon in his hand—when I got to the door, I was going up to my sister, but found I was bleeding, and said, "Oh, look here"—that was at my night dress—he said, "Emma, lie down," and I do not recollect any<lb></lb>thing more—I was removed to the hospital next day, and was there a fortnight.</p>

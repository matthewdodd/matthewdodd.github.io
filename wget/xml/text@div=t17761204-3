               <p>HAMMOND. The person that held me by the collar I am positive was not the person that held the knife to my throat.</p>
               <p>HECKSTALL. From thence we went in a coach to the White-horse in Picadilly; and then to the Nag's head again in Hedge-lane; from thence we took a coach and went to Petticoat-lane; we went to Bull's house; he asked what we had to sell; I pulled out this watch, upon which he immediately seized me; upon being seized, I gave the watch to Catherall, who, as he told me afterwards, dropped it in the street: I parted with him in Oxford road at three o'clock.</p>

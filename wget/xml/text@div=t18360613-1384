                  </hi>. I am a servant out of a situation; I lived near Tunbridge Wells last. On Thursday morning, the 2nd of June, about one o'clock I had been with a friend inquiring for a situation, and did not get home so soon as I expected—I was quite sober—I met Connell in St. Giles'sshe asked me to go up to a room with her—she took me by the arm, and asked me to go up and give her a glass of gin—I refused at first, but she took me by the arm, and I went with her to a room in Jones's-court St. Giles's on the second floor, and there was a girl lying on the he I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Thursday morning, the 2nd of June, about one o'clock the prosecutor informed me of this—he was sober—I advised him to go home and change his clothes, as I knew the situation of the placeit is Jones's court, Bainbridge street—I took Connell on the Friday morning, about half-past two o'clock, on the 3rd of June—I found her in bed, and he identified her as the girl directly—I knew them both perfectly well, and he went up to the room with me both times—the prisoners knew each other perfectly well—they kept company together—I took Jones on Tuesday night, the 7th of June, close to the spot—I fetched the prosecutor down, and he identified her.</p>

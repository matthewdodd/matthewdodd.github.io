                  </hi>. I live at 132, Blackfriars-road—on 13th November be<lb></lb>tween 1 and 2 in the morning, I was returning home through Farringdon-street; when I came near the railway-station, I passed the two prisoners briskly—after having passed them some few yards they overtook me and knocked me violently down from behind—I got up and confronted them face to face, and was levelled to the ground again by both of them—while on the ground Williams laid hold of my left hand and tried to get my ring off—I clutched my hand, and finding there was some difficulty in getting the ring off, she held my hand and bit me violently in the place—my three fingers were lacerated in getting the ring off—I then got up in a sitting posture, almost exhausted, but I was able faintly to ejaculate "Help!"—I said to Brown, "Oh, let me get up"—Brown said, "Oh yes, we will let you get up"—before that they were both kneeling over me—Brown then rose to her feet and gave me a violent kick on my face—I wore a mantle and a black shawl under it—the shawl was taken from under my mantle, it being only secured by a pin—then a desperate struggle ensued for my mantle; that was secured by a brooch, which gave way, and the mantle was also taken—I had four teeth loosened, and I fear I shall lose all four—I have not been able to masticate a bit of food since—I am now suffering from the injuries then received—I am very ill this morning—I did not sleep a wink last night—my nerves were so shaken—the prisoners were in the act of starting from me, when policeman 121 arrived—I said to him, "That woman (<hi rend="italic">Williams</hi>) has got my ring"—I did not lose sight of the prisoners—the policeman came up and took them—I am quite sure they are the women—there was no one else near the place at the time—I had lost my way, and it was a foggy night; I was en<lb></lb>deavouring to find my way.</p>

I was on duty in Farringdon-street, on 13th November—shortly past 2 o'clock in the morning, I heard faint cries of "Help"—I proceeded to the railway, where there is a dead wall, and as I approached I saw some object lying down on the footway, and the two prisoners stooping down, leaning over it—I saw another constable, 42 G, on the opposite side of the way, and I called out to him to come to my assistance—we hastened to the prisoners, and they made off—they got about seven or eight yards from the prosecutrix, when we took them in custody, and brought them back—Brown said, "It is all right; it is only our friend, Mrs. Brown"—I went to the prosecutrix and found her in a most deplorable state—she had been most cruelly ill-used—she was lying on her back on the footway, and was in an almost insensible state—she could scarcely speak—she was bleeding, her bonnet was off, and her mantle and shawl—her dress was torn, and her face was covered with blood and mud—she had a wound on her cheek, her eyes were swollen, and three or four of her teeth were loosened; her hair was hanging down her back—as soon as she recovered herself, she said, pointing to Williams, "That woman has taken my ring"—Brown said, "Give her ring, and have no bother about it"—I did not find a ring at that time—I saw Brown drop the prosecutrix's shawl at her feet on the footway, and I picked it up—the mantle I found lying between the prisoners—the prosecutrix was quite sober—I took the prisoners to the station with the assistance of the other constable—there</p>

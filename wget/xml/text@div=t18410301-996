Duffel"—I said, "What is the matter?"—"Oh!

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it after you had told the Magistrate what you have told, us that he said it was not proved? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, at the first examination he did not enter into it—I did not tell the Magistrate on that occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any evidence at that time of the first marriage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nothing more than what she stated to me the first day—she gave me the certificate, and the next day I asked her who this Ri<lb></lb>chard and Frances Bell were—I cannot say whether I asked her that day or the next—I think it was the next day—the certificate was produced when I first apprehended her, but it was not then that I asked her the question, to the best of my belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the certificate in your hand on the second occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, I opened it, and produced it to her, and I said, "Who is Richard Bell and Frances Bell," and she said, "The man and woman belonging to the church"—this passed in the King's Head public-house, where she pro<lb></lb>mised to meet me—Mr. Clothier, the father, gave me instructions to appre<lb></lb>hend her—he did not tell me they could not prove the marriage—the prisoner told me that Clothier knew she was a married woman—I said, "Did Mr. Clothier know you was married?"—she said, "Yes; because I represented myself as a widow."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to mention what you did to the Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> After he entered into the case, he said there was not evidence, and then the solicitor for the prosecution asked me whether I had heard her say any thing—that was at one of the examinations—I think it might be the second, be did not enter into it the previous night—there was no solicitor the first evening—the first examination was the second time of going before the Magistrate—we went three tunes after that examination—I gave this evidence about the conversation more than once—after the first examination the Magistrate said there was not evidence enough—I had then given this evidence to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell me it was after the first examination that you said this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had been examined on the first examination—the soli<lb></lb>citor had spoken to me both before and after the examination—I had not given my evidence to the Magistrate at that time, I bad not said a word—I went forward, and gave my evidence about apprehending her—I cannot take my oath to all the words that passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say a word about the conversation till after you were spoken to by the solicitor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The solicitor had had conversation with me before I had been with the Magistrate at all—that was on the first examin<lb></lb>ation, the second time of going before the Magistrate—when I went first, I gave an account of apprehending the prisoner—I do not know that I was asked about any conversation—I stated that I got the certificate from her, and she said that was what she got from Mr. Clothier—I did not state that till after the solicitor had the conversation with me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not tell us that the solicitor, in consequence of the Magis<lb></lb>trate's saying there was not evidence enough, asked you if you had heard</p>

               <p>any thing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, both before and after I went to the Magistrate—the solicitor came to me before he had heard a word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was it the Magistrate said there was not evidence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Tuesday, the 2nd of February, I had told the Magistrate what the prisoner said about the certificate, and after that he said this.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first mention to any body the conversation between you and the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Tuesday, when I saw the solicitor, he asked what I had heard, and I think on my oath that I told him both before and after the Magistrate made the remark.</p>

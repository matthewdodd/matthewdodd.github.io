               <p>THOMAS BANE. I live at Marshfield, near Chippenham, in Gloucestershire - it is one hundred and four miles from town. I had a mare in my possession, which I put into the field myself, about seven o'clock on the evening of the 5th of October - I locked the gate; the field has a fence round it, and the mare could not stray; I went to the field myself about half-past seven o'clock in the morning of the 6th, and it was gone; I found the gate open. By getting over the wall, the latch could be opened inside; a public road runs close by the field: I found her in London, in possession of Garton, the officer, on the 10th of October - I am quite sure it is the mare I had missed; I had had her ever since the 4th of May.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Marshfield. On the evening of the 5th of October I saw Johnson at Marshfield, in Mr. Jones' tap-room; I knew his person before, by seeing him about there, and have no doubt of his being the man; I saw him again on the 17th of November, in London, and knew him; I pointed him out as the person I had seen before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How often had you seen him at Marshfield? A. Sometimes once or twice in the course of a year; I never saw him above two or three times before the 5th of October.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. How long have you been out of Devizes gaol? A. I never was in Davizes gaol in my life; I was in Horsley gaol, Gloucestershire, for a month, for an assault, for striking a man - I was confined a month.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the charge for an assault, or for taking any thing as well? A. No - it was only for striking him; I was confined a month there, to hard labour; I was tried before a Justice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. Do you know you are on your oath? A. Yes; I am telling nothing but the truth.</p>

            . I am a carrier from Marshfield to Bristol. I know Jones' house at Marshfield - he keeps the King's Arms. I saw Johnson there on the 5th of October; he had a smock-frock on, and grey stockings - I spoke to him, and have no doubt of his being the man: I knew him before, for a year or two; I saw him again between ten and eleven o'clock the same night, in the streets at Marshfield: it was a moon-shiny night - the moon was full; I said, "Good night, Johnson," and he said,"Good night, Bond." I know Mr. Bane's field - he was going towards there; I parted from him about two hundred yards from Bane's field; he goes by the name of William Carter at Marshfield: I said, "Good night, Carter," not Johnson. I know the other prisoner, by seeing him at Bristol-market - I always knew him by the name of Thomas Derrick; Marshfield is twelve miles from Bristol - when I saw Johnson in the street, he had boots and spurs, and a light coloured great coat on, and a little stick in his hand; his coat was buttoned up, and rather swollen out on one side, as if something was under it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner JOHNSON. Q. Where did you meet me? A. Just over-right the lane, about half way up the town, opposite Mrs. Martin's, where you turn off to the road.</p>

               <p>Prisoner CHAPMAN. Q. Did you speak to me? A. No; I was not two yards from you - I passed by you: I am quite certain of seeing him twice that day - I have not the least doubt of it.</p>

            . I am a coppersmith, and owner of some stables in Bath-street, St. Luke, Middlesex. On Monday evening, the 8th of October, between eight and nine o'clock, I saw both the prisoners (I had never seen them before) - they came to my yard with a black mare each, and requested the mares might stop for the night; I have a board over my gate, as a livery-stable - they took the mares into the stable, and unsaddled them; I asked if I should feed them - they said No, they had not come far since they were fed: they wished them to have a rack of hay; they left the mares with me, and came again for them the next morning, between eight and nine o'clock: I fed them in their presence. Carter asked who did my smith's work, as they wanted shoeing - I said Blake, and they were both shod by Blake, by Carter's direction, and he paid for the shoeing; he gave me a sovereign - my son gave him change - Chapman was present at the time. Johnson rode out on one of the mares while they were in my care; the mares were both taken away from my stable on Thursday, the 11th, by Brown and Armstrong, the officers: I was present. When Brown had brought Chapman into the stable, in custody, Brown asked him, in my presence, if those horses belonged to him - he said, No, they belonged to the other man, meaning Johnson; Chapman was left there, in Armstrong's custody - Brown went out, and in about five minutes brought in Johnson: he was asked, in Chapman's presence, if those horses were his - he said he never saw them before. Both denied their belonging to them. I have no doubt of the prisoner's identity, and of the mares being what they brought.</p>

I took him to Wilkins' stable, left him with Armstrong, and went back to Coleman-street, and on the way, two or three doors from the house where I took Chapman, I met Johnson, whom I knew before: I took him to the stable, where Chapman was with Armstrong, and when they were both handcuffed together - we asked them if they belonged to those horses, if they knew anything of them, pointing to them: they both said they did not, and denied knowing anything about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060048"></xptr>them - they were taken to the Police-office; there was no owner appeared for a fortnight and more, and at the end of the fortnight the prisoners each claimed one of the mares - they did not know that no owner had come forward - they stated that they had bought them of a person whom they did not know.

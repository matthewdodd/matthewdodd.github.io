On the 12th of Dec, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was on the bar at Shadwell Dock, in plain clothes, and saw the prisoner and another—I knew them both—they went to the bottom of the stairs—one entered the boat, and the other went off to a barge at Carpenter's Wharf—while he was gone, the prisoner came to me and said, "It is a cold night"—I made him no answer—the other went and took some coal out of Carpenter's barge, came back, the prisoner went to the bottom of the stairs to him, he gave the prisoner one lump, and took one himself—I took possession of the two lumps of coal—the men got away at the time—I took the name of the barge—I afterwards apprehended the prisoner—I told him I wanted him for stealing the coals—he said, "You know it is a poor old man in distress, with a large family at home"—on the way to the station I said, "We have had several complaints about coals there"—he said, "I am aware of that, it was distress drove me to it"—I pointed out the barge to the foreman.</p>

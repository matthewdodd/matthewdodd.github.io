            , ESQ. On the evening of the 4th of November. I was going down to Hendon, in a one horse chaise, in company with Mr. Robert Withey. We passed the five mile stone, and got on <placeName id="t18151206-2-crimeloc10">Goulder's green</placeName>

I then pulled up my horse. A second came immediately to the side of the chair, and planted himself at the dashing iron; he also presented a pistol into the chair towards one of us; he came on the near side; they were both on the near side, Mr. Withey told them to take away their pistols, and one of them said, if you will deliver your money, we won't hurt a hair of your head. In a very short time, a third man stepped on the step with one foot, and put the other into the chair; that man had a pistol also, which he put to my breast; he had a black patch hanging from his hat over his face, so as to conceal it. He demanded our money. I was about to put my hand to my pocket to give it him, when he said, don't touch your pocket! sir! if you do, you are a dead man! I then dropped my arm, and then he put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket, and took from it a small note case, containing five pounds in small notes, and some memorandums. He then took my watch; last of all, he put his hand into my right hand breeches pocket, where was some silver; it had got into a corner, and he did not thurst his hand to the bottom, so that he missed it; he then ran his hand down on the outside, and missed it then also. He then proceeded to Mr. Withey, who can relate better than I can what he did to him. I believe he did not take any thing from him. He then got out of the chair, and one of them said, now drive on as fast as you can, but do not look back. I think all this happened in about two minutes; during the whole of the time. I had particularly in my command the man at the horse's head; I mean I took particular notice of him.</p>
               <p>Mr Gurney. Look at the bar, and tell us if either of the priooners is that man - A. I have no doubt at all that the man in the black coat is he,(John Brown,) I am also satisfied that the other is the man who stood at the dashing iron; that is

               <p>Court. Do you mean to swear positively to either of them - A. My firm conviction is that they are the men, and I can't swear more strongly; they both had great coats on at the time.</p>
               <p>Paisoner John Brown. Do you know any particular mark by which you speak to me - A. I took such particular notice of the character and person of the man, as leaves no doubt in my mind, that you are he. The prisoner John, at the time he committed the robbery, wore a drab coloured great coat. When I went to Bow-street for the purpose of seeing whether they were the persons who robbed me, on their apprehension, they were not dressed in the great coats, but as, they are now; still I was satisfied by the prisoner John Brown's face, and his person, that he was the man who stood at my horse's head. When they were taken from the bar, I went into the place of confinement to look at them again, and observing one of the officers to wear a drab coloured great coat, I requested that it might be put on the prisoner John Brown; it was accordingly put on him, and then I said, I have no doubt. He then either said, you have seen me before, or else interrogatively, have you seen me before? I said I had, and then he asked me where? I said that must be enquired into in another place.</p>

            , ESQ. I was in the chaise with Mr. Rich, going down to his house at Hendon, at the time of the robbery. I have heard the account which Mr. Rich has given of the transaction; it is correct, except that I was the first searched. I was searched by the man with the patch over his face. I am not enabled to speak positively to the persons who robbed me; only as to my belief; I think that George was the one who stood on my left side at the dashing iron. I cannot speak at all to the other, nor particularly to either.</p>

            . I am a conductor of the Bow street patrole. On the Saturday evening next after the robbery, the 11th of November, I was in the Green Lane road, to Hornsey, in company with others of my patrole; I went on duty at about five o'clock. At about twenty minutes after six, we met three men in the company together, walking within two or three yards of each other, We apprehended them all; they turned out to be the two prisoners at the bar, and one who has made his escape.

We brought them towards Islington? the third got away. We lodged these two in Clerkenwell watch-house, whilst we went to look for the third; but unsuccessfully. When they were fully committed, George asked me for a key of his box which I had of his, he said, I had no key at all, but one of my brother officers had taken a key from the man who made his escape, and that was the one to which he alluded. I mention this, to prove that they were all in company together.</p>

               <p>Mr. Rich, re-examined. At the time John Brown was standing at the horse's head, I took particular notice, owing to some cause which I was not aware of, but which I now perceive to be a fracture in the stock of the pistol; I could plainly distinguish the ram-rod sticking out from the stock, and am by that means enabled to swear more positively that it was a pistol.</p>
               <p>Both the prisoners made long defences, denying their guilt of the robbery in question, and setting up an alibi, but the witnesses whom they called to substantiate it, not only contradicted each other upon several leading points, but were also contradicted by the officers.</p>
               <p>THE JURY, retired for a considerable time, and on their return to the box, to the astonishment of the Court, found the prisoners.</p>

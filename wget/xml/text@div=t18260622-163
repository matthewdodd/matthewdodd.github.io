I lost some trusses of hay - in consequence of which I wrote my name on some little bits of paper, and tucked them into some trusses of the last I had purchased, which stood near the door, on Thursday, the 15th of June, and, on the Saturday following Morgan, my lad, told me he missed some hay. I went and counted the hay, and missed two trusses - I got an officer and a warrant - I went to their stable about five o'clock in the afternoon - I found the two prisoners there, and two trusses of hay with the papers inside; I said I thought it was my property - they said it was not; I showed the officer the papers in the trusses in my lost, and then he came down again, and found one paper in one truss in Jessop's stable, and the other was found at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. I believe Jessop is the owner of the stable? A. Yes; the other acts as a kind of servant to him, and has slept there two years - they both said it was not my hay. Jessop does not sleep in the stable. There is an opening in the lost over the stable, and a piece of an axletree of Jessop's came through into my stable, which my man gave him again; I was there at the time, and told my man to pull it through, as it might be lost: I do not know of any sack coming through. Holding said he knew more about the hay than Jessop, as he did not sleep there.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to this place with Sumner, about five o'clock on Saturday evening. I found the prisoners there, and a cart and horse at the stable door; I found two trusses of hay, and asked Jessop where he got them; he said he had bought them of a carter that morning. I searched one truss and found this paper in it. Jessop then said he had been out all day, and knew nothing about it; Holding said "I know more about it than my master - Sumner, where is your son? he knows all about it." I found another ticket in the other truss at the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Sumner, sen, was in the stable at the time? A. Yes, and heard all he said.</p>

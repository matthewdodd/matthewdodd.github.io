               <p>When was you apprised of it? - On Monday, the 19th of September; I know the child was in great pain.</p>
               <p>Did you search her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What did you observe? - I found her linen very much disordered, an appearance of great running and stain.</p>
               <p>Did you observe any marks of violence? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Had she any disorder in consequence of it? - The running, I supposed it to be the venereal disorder, but there is a surgeon who can speak to that; the child, when I was first alarmed of it, could not make water by any means in the world; I could not attend to the child, a servant attended her; in the morning I examined her, and she could not by any means make water, and when she attempted it, it was in such extreme pain; I told one of my brother's acquaintance of it, and he went with her to the Middlesex hospital; I live, No. <placeName id="t17871024-78-crimeloc399">14, Monmouth-street</placeName>

               <p>Could there have been any penetration of the hymen in that condition? - No, Sir.</p>

            . I am foreman to the prosecutor. On the 1st of May the cart of dung was there, and two trusses of hay and a sack of oats and chaff mixed together, were found in it; I had been in the loft, and counted the trusses of clover hay - I then went to breakfast; the prisoner was loading the dung - when I came back he was still doing the same; I went into the loft and counted the hay again, and missed two trusses - I know he had not hay in his cart when he came to the yard; the two trusses were found on the copse in front of the cart - they were of the same sort as those in the loft, and made up the forty-four which I had at first counted - he first said he found it on the road, and then that he did not know how it got there; we had some mixed oats and chaff in the loft, but we could not miss any of them - that found in his cart corresponds with it exactly, and the sack, in which they were found seemed to be one which he had brought empty.</p>

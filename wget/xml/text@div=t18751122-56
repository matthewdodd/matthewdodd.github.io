                  </hi>. I am an agent and sell goods for John Lewis—I live in Kent Street in the Borough—I was in. Covent Garden Market about 6 o'clock on the morning of the 23rd October last—I had a barrow there with six brooms on it—I left it for a few minutes, and when I came back the brooms were gone—about 5 o'clock the same evening I saw the brooms in Kent Street outside a coffee shop—the two prisoners were in the coffee shop—two policemen came up and took them into custody; I put the brooms on the barrow and went with the policemen to the station-house—Archer, by what I could hear, said he bought them off a carrotty<lb></lb>headed boy for eighteen pence, and that he had given Hickson the money to pay for them—the value of the brushes was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

In consequence of what the last witness said to me, I went with him on the 23rd ult., to a coffee-house in Kent Street—the two prisoner's were there—he said tome "These two men have stolen my brooms; I shall give them into custody"—I said to the prisoners "You hear what the prosecutor says? I shall take you into custody for having them in your possession"—Archer said "I bought them off a carrotty-headed boy in the Covent Garden Market, this morning"—he was remanded; I tried to find the carroty-headed boy, but there was no such boy known—at the time Archer was being charged he said to Hickson "You know Hickson, I gave you money to pay for the brooms"—Hickson retorted "I did not buy the brooms because I had no money, and I know nothing about them."</p>

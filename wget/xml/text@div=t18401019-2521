                  </hi>. I live in Carlisle-street, Portman-market, and am errand-boy to Mr. Bury, a poulterer in King-street, Golden-square. On the 11th of September, a little before eight o'clock in the evening, I was standing at the corner of Golden-street, with Edward Phillips, and saw the prisoner go into the prosecutor's shop, in High-street—he stooped rather as he went in, and brought out a piece of white cloth—he ran round Bow<lb></lb>ling-street, and down Little Marylebone-street—I ran down High-street, the other way, up Great Marylebone-street, and met him at the corner of a street, opposite Welbeck-street, with the cloth—he went down Welbeck-street, turned down Wigmore-street, and into a house in Barrett's-court, with the cloth—I came back to the prosecutor's shop, and told them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Mousir, a hosier. On the 11th of September, a little before eight o'clock in the evening, I was coming from within our shop to the door, and as I turned round, I saw a person's arm taking the calico from the shelf, which is about a yard from the door, in the shop, and about a yard high—I could see the person, but not to recognise him—he was in a stooping position—I could not say whether it was a man or a boy—I called the young man in the shop to stop him, and ran out—I saw people running—I did not know Stocker—he came about half an hour after by himself, and gave me in<lb></lb>formation.</p>

In consequence of informa<lb></lb>tion, I went to No. 16, Barrett's-court, about eight o'clock in the evening, but did not find the prisoner or property there—I went to several public-houses, and at last found him at the Fox, in Oxford-street, in company with several others—I told him I took him on suspicion of stealing some cloth out of High-street—he said he knew nothing of it—I took him to the station-house—on our way there be called to some of them who had followed him out of the house, "Come on, I know all about it, I will make plenty of liars out of it"—I detained him and two of those who had followed him to the station-house—when Stocker came there I asked him which of the three was the person who took the cloth, and he pointed to the prisoner—after the charge was taken, and the prisoner was told what the charge was, be again said he knew all about it, and he would make plenty of liars before he had done with it—next morning he called one of the two I had taken the night before, who was standing outside, and said to him, "Where is it?"—the other replied, "Go on, it is done with, I will tell you more about it by-and-bye"—the other two were let free.</p>

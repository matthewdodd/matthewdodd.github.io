I am in the service of Mr. Brotherton, a chemist at Islington—about 4 o'clock on 28th August the prisoner came for two ounces of Epsom salts—she offered me a penny—I told her they were three halfpence, she said she only gave a penny at other shops—I told her they were three halfpence, and she said, "Then I must change half-a-crown"—she put a half-crown down—I took it up and gave it to Mr. Brotherton—he said it was bad—he came into the shop where the prisoner was—he spoke to her, and asked her where she got it—she said she got it from a cabman the night before—I went for a constable and when I came back the prisoner was gone from the shop—I went to a greengrocer's shop, and saw the prisoner come out—I pointed her out to the constable, and she was brought back to Mr. Brotherton.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chemist and live in Clyde-terrace, Islington—it would take me a quarter of an hour or 20 minutes to walk from the Angel to my house. On 28th August, about half-past 3 or 4 o'clock I heard my shop lad talking to a person in the shop—my lad came into the room to me, and gave me a bad half-crown—I then went into my shop and saw the prisoner there—I said to her, "This is a bad half-crown"—she said "Is it? I will change it"—I said "Not quite so fast, you knew it was bad"—she said, "No, I did not know it; I took it of a cabman last night"—I said, "I am of a contrary opinion; I shall give you in custody"—the boy then left the shop—the prisoner said, "You need not do that, I will bring my husband; he will make it all right"—she then went out of the shop, and I saw no more of her till she was brought back within a quarter of an hour—I gave her in charge—I gave the half-crown to Holmes—they took it to the station, and I believe Emmett marked it—I did not go</p>

               <p>to the station at that time—when the prisoner was brought to my shop I said, "I shall give this woman in custody for uttering a counterfeit half-crown"—she said, "You make some mistake, it is all a mistake."</p>

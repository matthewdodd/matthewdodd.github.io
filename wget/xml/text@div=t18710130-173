                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 105). On Monday night, 2nd January, about 11.10, I was in Thomas Street, Bethnal Green, and heard men shouting and women shrieking in Chilton Street—I went there and found about twenty men and women quarrelling; the men wanted to fight—I advised them to go away and take another time for fighting—the prisoners were all there—I knew Bryan, Beer, and Davey by sight—I advised them to go away, but they would not, and Bryan came behind me, put his hand round my neck, and threw me on my back—I got up and took hold of him, he struggled and we both, fell—while I was on the ground the other prisoners kicked me violently about the head and under the arm—my mouth was hurt, and I lost a tooth—I got up, still holding Bryan, and was making my way to the station, when Browning stood in front of me, and said "Let him go, let him go," and he struck me on the head with something very heavy, which felled me to the ground—they all commenced kicking me, and some one called out "Don't kill him "—with that they ceased, and I got up and seized Bryan again; the word "<hi rend="italic">rouse</hi>" was given; they all surrounded me and I was <hi rend="italic">punched</hi>—Browning struck me several times on the head with something like a bludgeon; it was large and black, something like this (<hi rend="italic">a truncheon tipped with an iron band</hi>)—this is much heavier than one of ours—I drew my truncheon and made a strike, but my arm was caught behind, and my truncheon was taken away from me—some one I do not know asked me for my rattle—I handed it out, and there were several hands to take it—it was sprung, and the prisoners went away—a constable came, or I should have fallen from loss of blood from my head—my nose and mouth were bleeding—my wounds were dressed at the station—Brown<lb></lb>ing had a bandage round his head—Davey, the smallest prisoner, climbed up by the side of me and tried to reach my face—on Wednesday morning the four prisoners were brought to my bed, and I knew them at once—they were not placed with others at that time—Beer kicked me, when I was on the ground, first.</p>

I live at 51, Chilton Street, Bethnal Green—on 2nd January, about 11 o'clock at night, I was in Chilton Street, and saw about twenty men quarrelling, and using very bad language—Young told them to go away, and not kick up a bother there—they did not go, but the prisoner in the drab jacket (<hi rend="italic">Bryan</hi>) struck Young, and they fell together in the road—Young got up, took him by the collar, and asked him what he had done that for—they fell again, and the other men kicked Young while he was on the ground—Browning was one of them; he had a white bandage on his head—I cannot identify the other two—I said "Oh, you vagabonds, to serve a man in that manner!"—I went for a policeman, and when I was half way down Hare Street I heard Bryan behind me—he went into a doorway, peeped round a corner, and then walked out again, and went into the "Hare" public-house—I remained at the opposite corner, what we call the "Crown" corner, looking for a policeman, and while there I saw Browning go into the public-house, with several others—soon after<lb></lb>wards I saw Young going to the station, in a dreadful state, another con<lb></lb>stable was helping him, and a young man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 90, Hare Street—on 2nd January I heard women screaming—I went up Chilton Street, and saw a policeman, with fourteen or fifteen men, and two women—the policeman was persuading them to go away, because they wanted to fight; but they would not—he got two of them down Thomas Street, and two more of them wanted to fight—he said "As soon as I stop two of you fighting, two more want to begin," and one in a light jacket struck the policeman, and knocked him down—I do not know who he was—the policeman took him by the collar, and he struggled, and fell, and all the others went round him and kicked him—he got up again, still holding the one with the light jacket; they struggled, and fell again, and they all kicked him as they had before—I cannot tell who they were, it was too dark to discern their features; but one had a bandage on his head—they all ran away but the one who the policeman had got—the one with the baudago said "Who has he got now? I will go back and see"—he came back, and the one who was underneath the policeman said <hi rend="italic">"Cop,"</hi> and he got away, and ran off, and the one with the bandage hit the policeman upwards of a dozen times on his head with some weapon, I could not see what, and the policeman said "I have had enough"—he had nothing on his head, and he reeled on to the opposite side of the way and said "What, no help?"—I said "Where is your rattle?"—he pulled it out, and tried to ring it; but could not—a little girl, about fourteen, said "Give it to me, master," and she tried to ring it, as well as she could—he said, a second time, "What, no assistance?" and as he said that another policeman came to his assistance, and then Davey came up to me in his shirtsleeves—he lives next door to me—he said "Emma, what is the matter?"—I said fourteen or fifteen <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> have nearly killed this policeman "—he said "Don't you say nothing, or perhaps you will get a crack from some of them"—I said "If I see any of them I shall lock them up "—the policeman was then taken to the station, and Davey followed, and stood outside the station with me till 12.15, in his shirtsleeves, and no cap on.</p>

I generally lock up the house, but I did not that night—I went into his room at 7.30, while he was having his supper; not later—I stayed there about ten minutes—I did not see Charles Beer come home—I was in the house and heard him, but I was not in the room—it might be 7.45 when he came home—the beer was not sent for while I was in the room—I know the little girl who has been called—Beer's mother spoke to me about going to the Police Court—she said "You remember that me and my daughter went out," and "You remember asking my son if we were all in"—the little girl was in the room, and the mother and the son who was locked up, he was in bed—they all heard this, it was spoken in the room—we talked the matter over as friends—it was on Wednesday morning that the mother asked me to go to the Police Court to speak for her son what I knew; I said that I would go—she said "Do you remember that he came in at 7.30 and that you came down at 11 o'clock and asked if all were in "and then I told her all—she did not tell me what time the policeman was assaulted, but I have heard that it was about 11 o'clock—I heard that on Wednesday—I live in the house—I do not know where Chilton Street is—I heard Alfred Beer examined at the Police Court—Charles Beer did not speak to me when I called out and asked who was in, he was asleep, or he might not be asleep, but he was in bed—I do not know that he was in bed, but I know that the young prisoner answered me.</p>

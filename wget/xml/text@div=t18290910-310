On Saturday. the 15th of August, I went out at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning - there are no lodgers; it is a small house, with two rooms and a kitchen; I locked my door, and saw two bad boys throwing stones; I turned back, and put my shutters too - my children were at that time at school, and no one was in the house; I locked my door very particularly, and when I came home at a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I met my little boy, who had come home from school; he said to me,"How came you to leave your window open;" I went to the house, and found the window was open, and the curtain torn down; the parlour door was wide open - my drawers were open, and the property stated was gone; the person had got in by pulling open the shutters, and lifting up the window, which was down, and fastened by a latch. I found my property at a pawnbroker's on the Monday - I know the prisoner, and knew his father; they did live three or four doors from my house, but they had moved a short time before; his father is a watchman.</p>

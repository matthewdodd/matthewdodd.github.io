                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, at Notting-hill—on 27th August, I went into the Hope and Grapes public-house in the Broadway, Westminster—the prisoner was there—I had not known him previously—he asked me to give him a pot of ale, and I refused him several times—we then agreed to toss for a pint of ale—I won, and after that he would not pay for it—I told him to drink it, and he came towards me—I pushed him away, and he pulled a knife out and struck me in the face—he made a second cut at me—he cut me from the eye here, and then across my cheek—it was a short knife, with a black handle—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the doctor sewed the wounds up with silver-wire.</p>

I am a dressmaker, at Spring-gardens, Pimlico—I was at the Hope and Grapes public-house on this day, and saw the two men quarrelling—they had a few words about some beer—the prisoner refused to pay—he said he did not lose—there was a struggle between them, and I heard the prosecutor say he was stabbed—he did not strike the prisoner before he was stabbed—I think I must have seen him if he had—there was a scuffle—I saw the prisoner try to hide the knife down his trousers, and I told him not to put it away—I saw the last witness take it from him—he threw it down outside the public-house door.</p>

I was called into the public-house, and, as I was going towards the door, I saw the knife thrown out, and saw Weeks pull the prisoner out by the collar—he was the worse for liquor—he was not stupid drunk, he was very excited—he said, going to the station, that he was struck, and that he was not going to be struck by a vagabond like that without settling for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you rent the whole house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 22nd of May did you lose any printed callico from your shop - A. About half an hour after eight o'clock in the evening, I was standing a little within the door, with my arm upon a pile of goods; this pile consisted of several bundles, containing from ten to twenty pieces, each tied round with a string. A gentleman came to the door, I went round to the desk with him; I had not been there two minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this printed linen within the shop - A. Yes, just within the door; every part of the goods was within nine inches of the threshold of the door. The next witness, Roffey, ran in and asked me if I had lost any goods.</p>
               <p>Q. On turning your eye to the pile of goods, did you percieve the pile was diminished - A. Certainly, it was diminished one bundle. I ran to where the prisoner was reported to have gone. and found the goods at Mr. Dobson's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the goods in the personal possession of the prisoner - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner while they were pursuing of him - A. No; I did not see him till after he was apprehended; after I left Mr. Dobson's. Such part of the goods that were found, are here. The goods were delivered over to me at Mr. Dobson's. I took them to Worship-street office myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mr. Dobson's - A. About fifteen doors from my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was your parcel of goods - A. Quite sure; I have not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the goods - A. A bundle of printed callico.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in soldier's clothes when he was apprehended - A. No.</p>

            . I am a stone mason, I work for Mr. Porter, Finsbury-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you near Mr. Titford's shop about half past eight, on the evening of the 22nd of May - A. Yes; I saw the prisoner at the bar take from the pile of cottons at the door, a bundle; he reached within the shop to get at them; the cottons were within the door; I believe he did not put his foot in.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him do it, did you - A. Yes; he walked gently off the pavement with the cottons; then he began to run gently about ten yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire in the shop whether he had any right to take them - A. No; I holloaed out stop thief, then he began to run as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Still keeping this bundle - A. Yes, I pursued him with the cry of stop thief; he turned down Finsbury-street; as he was running down there, he was knocked down by some man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him knocked down - A. Yes; he dropped the bundle of linen there; the prisoner got up, and ran again; I pursued after him, I never lost sight of him at all; he ran down Finsbury-street, then he ran through a court; I do not think it was altogether five hundred yards before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thoroughfare in the court - A. Yes; he crossed the other street, and went into a kind of a stable place; he was taken there.</p>
               <p>Q. From the time that he laid hold of the goods, to the time he was taken, had you ever lost sight of him - A. No; immediately he was secured, I went and gave information at Mr. Titford's shop.</p>

Yes; he got about two yards before me, When I heard the cry of stop thief, I pursued after him, and knocked him down; he ran half way down Finsbury-street; a pawnbroker's boy went to stop him, he struck him on the eye; I cast my foot before him, he dropped down with the bundle, and I dropped with him.</p>

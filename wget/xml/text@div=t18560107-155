                  </hi>. I am buyer and manager of the Birmingham and Sheffield department at the prosecutors—I never sold these forks to the prisoner—they are plated, they are worth 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you been in the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eight years—the prisoner was there before me—Mr. Hyams is here—when I first went into the employment, it was the constant practice of the servants of each department to sell to each other—they were all allowed to buy from the establishment—I believe that has been going on down to the time of the prisoner's apprehension, although lately not allowed by our employers—I have occasionally purchased things—I have things at my house now that I have purchased—I have not been in the habit of purchasing goods to sell again, I may have done so once or twice, but I have not been in the habit of doing it—I do not know others that are in the habit of doing so, many of them may have done so—as far as my knowledge goes they have not been in the habit of doing so, they have occasionally done so as well as myself, but it has not been a recognised thing among us—I have bought things to sell again; it was kept quiet, it was understood it was not allowed, it was done to accommodate one another—I heard something of some night lights being consigned to Messrs. Davis, which were not sold—I did not take a sample of those night lights, I am quite sure of that, I am not aware that any persons in the employment took samples of them at the request of Messrs. Davis for the purpose of seeing whether they could get rid of them—I am not aware that Mr. Davis asked the prisoner to try and sell them, it is possible he might have done so—I am quite sure that no one, to my knowledge, took a sample away—I never sold the prisoner these forks, nor any plated forks—I may have sold him a set of knives and forks, I think I have on one or two occasions—he has not bought forks of me of this descrip<lb></lb>tion for the purpose of selling again, he has ordinary knives and forks—I have no book here—these forks were in my department—I was not present when the prisoner said he had bought them from me, I first heard of it on the Saturday morning following—my employers have not blamed me at all since this has been found out for disobeying the orders of the house—I have sold forks, not in the establishment that I know of, I do not remember—I cannot swear that I have not—when I did sell it was usual to make out a bill, and call the cashier to take the money of the purchaser—that was the case throughout the establishment, either when we sold to each other or to any other customer—I have not been a witness here before—my employers have prosecuted several of their servants, and unsuccessfully, except in one instance—ours is a very miscellaneous business, we sell a great variety of articles—we do not keep spirits to give customers to tempt them to buy, we occasionally have a glass of wine, or ale, but not spirits—we take a glass of wine with them occasionally, we are not compelled to do so—we do not</p>

               <p>invite every customer, only our bettermost ones that come from a distance—I am not aware that the prisoner need to bay to sell again—we were intimate in business—I have visited him at his house once or twice, and he has visited me on one occasion—when we made out the bills for one another we did not always put the name—we do not always put a name, we have so many customers that we do not know the names of—we do not generally put names for small customers, either for customers, or fellow servants, not unless there is an entry made—I am not aware that the prisoner or any of the servants have had things on approbation for sale, I should say not.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

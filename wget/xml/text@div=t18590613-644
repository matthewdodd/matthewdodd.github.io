                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist, of Bridge-road, Lambeth—on 5th May, about 10 o'clock, the prisoner came for one pennyworth of snuff, and gave me a bad shilling, which I put into a little bowl in the till—there was no silver in the bowl, and only some copper in the till; and immediately I gave her the change, I recognized her as a person who had been there two months before for some snuff, and tendered me a bad shilling—I tried it, told her it was bad, took the change and the snuff from her, and asked her to pay for it—she said, "No," and asked me to give her back the shilling—I said. "No; if you bring a policeman here you may have it"—she said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185906130108"></xptr>
               <p>that she would go and fetch a policeman; but two policemen immediately afterwards opened the door, and I gave her in custody with the shilling.</p>

            . I am a pawn-broker: On the 18th of April the prisoner brought this spoon to me. It was produced in court and depos'd to by the prosecutor and Clark. She wanted to borrow half a guinea on it. I ask'd her her name, she said, Swarts, and that she lodged at the sign of the Feathers in Charles-court, in the Strand, and wanted the money to pay for one night's lodging there. I told her it was something odd; then she said, it was to pay for her lodging where she came from before. Then as I had the spoon, I ask'd her what letters there were on it, she said J. I. B. saying it was left her by her father, whose name she said, was

I told her, I would lend her half a guinea on it if she would satisfy me it was her own; so I went along with her to a place where she said I should be informed; when we came there, she said, it signifies nothing to enquire here for the gentlewoman is mad. Then she told me, it was one of the maid's, and if I made any enquiry she should lose her place. Then she told me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175105230011"></xptr> she had a husband, and where, I went but found none.

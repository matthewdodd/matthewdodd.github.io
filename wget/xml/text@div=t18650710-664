                  </hi>. I live at Isleworth—I know the prisoner—up to 14th June we were the best friends in the world—about 9 that morning we went to work together at Mr. Nevett's farm at Isleworth—we were hoeing between the raspberries till 1 o'clock—we then went to dinner—we went to a public-house, and had four pots and a pint of beer between the two of us—one woman took a drink out of one of the pots—we got back to work at a quarter to three—we worked for about quarter of an hour—the prisoner then stood up, put his hoe under his left arm, and said to me, "Pat, we are doing too much work"—I said, "No, it was quite late when we came back, and whatever you do don't cut up the plants, or the master will blame us"—he said, "b----you, and the plants and the master too"—he then began speaking about his wife and her mother—we then shook hands—we were not drunk—I was stooping down to pick up some weeds and he said, "Well, Pat, you are a b----liar"—I said, "All right"—with that he took up his hoe and hit me on the side of the head, and cut my head—I put up my hand, and said, "0, Lord, John, what did you do that for?"—he said, "I will have your life this moment"—I ran out to the end of the road, six or seven yards—he followed me, and said, "You might as well stand, because I will have your b----life"—I then received a second stroke on the crown of the head with the hoe—I made straight across the ground—I heard him stepping out after me, and I put up my hoe, making sure he was going to hit me again, and so he did—I received the blow on the handle of the hoe—I did not go much further before I fell down, and he threw the hoe out of his band in the path and said, "You are dead now, you b—"—he ran away—I was confined to my bed, and I am not able to work now.</p>

About 5 in the afternoon of 14th June I went to the prosecutor's house—I found him insensible—he had two large cuts in the head and his clothes were all smothered with blood—I took the prisoner into custody about half-past 11 that same night—I said, "You are my prisoner, Johnny, for assaulting Driscoll"—he made no reply to the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Isleworth—On 14th June I was called to attend Driscoll—another surgeon had previously seen him—he had two wounds on the back of his head, and one, a more severe one, at the side—he seemed to have lost a good deal of blood—he was sensible at that time, but was in a very weak exhausted state—the wounds must have been produced by some sharpish instrument—I have been attending him up to the present time—he is quite out of danger now.</p>

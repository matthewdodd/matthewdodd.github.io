                  </hi>. I am foreman to George Groom bridge, an outfitter, of St. George's-street—I know the prisoner and Jacob Cohen—on 5th April, the prisoner came and gave me this order, saying, "I want these goods for my brother"—<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi>"April 5, Mr. Groombridge, will you send per bearer my brother, one dozen handkerchief flags of all nations, six blue guernseys six blue serge, and a black satin vest, Jacob Cohen")—I believed that to be in Jacob Cohen's writing—I gave the prisoner the articles, and he went away with them—there was a running account between the <hi rend="italic">governor</hi> and Jacob, in which these articles were included, and Jacob declined to pay—I did not see the prisoner after 8th April till he was arrested, and when I did see him he ran, and was caught—he understood the charge on which he was taken perfectly well.</p>

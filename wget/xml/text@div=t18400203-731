                  </hi>. I live with Thomas Smith and another, pawnbrokers, in South-street, Marylebone. On the 27th of January, at half-past' five o'clock, the prisoner and another person came to pawn some calico and flannel—after I had received them I thought I missed something from where they were standing—I went round the counter, and asked the pri<lb></lb>soner's friend if there was not something hanging up—she made no answer—the prisoner was going out—I stopped her—she had the petticoat under her cloak—I called a person, and she ran away—she was on the step of the door when I took it.</p>

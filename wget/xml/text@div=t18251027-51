The prisoner came to our house on Wednesday, the 21st of September, and said he wanted to turn on a cane, to which we consented; I said he had no reed - which was necessary; he said he would go and get one: I then went down stairs, and when I came up again I saw him near a box in which we had sixty-three bobbins of silk; he said he was picking up the cane; he then went down, and said he was going into the city: I counted the bobbins as soon as he was gone and missed three. I then turned on the prisoner's cane, and counted the bobbins again - I found there were but sixty: he came back in about two hours: I said to my father "That is the person who took the bobbins." I was sent for an officer, who came, and he confessed he had taken them.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How long before he came had you seen the silk all right? A. Two or three weeks - the bobbins were marked.</p>

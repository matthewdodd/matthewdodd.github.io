                  </hi> I am a boot and shoe maker, at Limehouse—the prisoner was in my service. Here is an agreement for his weekly services—I have a signature in the cash-book, for his money, which was paid every week—he was to canvass, bring an account of what orders he wanted, collect his money, and give an account of it every night—he had books to enter the sums and dates—on 14th Feb., here is no entry to Mears; nor on 15th, nor after that—it would be entered in the same week's account—here is no entry of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 13th March, received from Mears, or of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Pheasant—he has never paid me amy of these three sums, or accounted for them—his wages were 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he has robbed me of between 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Is the signature to this partnership-agreement your writ<lb></lb>ing? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—this is an agreement to sell on commission—you were to have half the profits—you were indicted for perjury here last Dec.—I told you you were indebted to me 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, and I should not have anything more to do with you—you begged of me not to discharge you, but to give you a weekly salary--the agreement, as a servant, is dated 3rd jan., 1848—what you call the agreement for the partnership, was in 1847—I never had you as a partner—you never had a farthing in the world—I do not know of your being in partnership with your wife I went to see you at the watchhouse, and I said, "If this is all you have done (that was with respect to pawning some things) I shall not prosecute you, "but I found these things afterwards—you went to the Thames Police, and swore against me, and then wanted your wife to charge a rape against me to get me out of the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You had goods sent to my house, and you came to, me the last day and said, "I wish you would accept a hill for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to cover the amount, "I said, "I considered myself your partner;" Mr. Taylor took the bill; this indictment is preferred against me to put all the concern on my shoulders; the two shillings are in my collecting-book; the agreement was to get 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take my apprentice off my hands; I have been greatly taken in; I have only received a few shillings of that pound a week. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I paid it in presence of a witness who is here—no wages were due to him—he was considerably in my debt—this second agreement has been acted on ever since the date of it—he has received his wages every week, and he ought to have accounted for all he received.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was in partnership with this man's uncle; I got in difficulty in a Loan Society; I assigned over all my property to this man; he took all my goods from me; he made an agreement that I should well as many goods as I could, and should share in the profits; neither of us were to take any part till Christmas; at Christmas I had sold 220<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth; a balance was left of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of which was considered good: it was then agreed that neither were to take anything out of the firm; I had and appren<lb></lb>tice, but was not in a situation to keep him, and Mr. Davis agreed to take him off my hands; this is got up to prejudice my character; I have collected 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a day; they did not think anything of two or three shillings being wrong in the account, so long as it was made up before the bills were settled; Mr. Davis was willing to take my apprentice if he could get 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he</p>

               <p>said to me, "You enter into an agreement to become my salesman, it is only a nominal thing;" he said it was only to show Mr. Wandly, at Fishmonger's Hall, to get 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more for the apprentice; I signed the agreement, and it was shown to the people at the Hall; this is all done because I could not obtain goods; I obtained 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of goods of Mr. Taylor; they were all delivered at my house; the last day I collected was on 13th March, and Mr. Davis went with me, he was in presence of Mrs. Mears when she paid it.</p>

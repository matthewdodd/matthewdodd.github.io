My fish-pond had been dragged, I think, between twelve and one o'clock on the morning of the 19th of May - I saw the marks of several feet round it, and the flowers were trodden down, and some of the young spawn was on the bank. I then went to an officer, and directed him to search for the parties - I know nothing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not he admitted to bail? A. Yes; he has now surrendered.</p>

            . I lodge in the same house as the prisoner, in Catherine-street, Holloway. On Friday night, the 18th of May, the prisoner was out - my husband went out about four o'clock in the morning, and at half-past six the prisoner came home - he knocked at the door; the landlord let him in - he had a watering-pot in his hand and asked him to see what beautiful fish he had got - I saw them afterwards; there was one large gold fish, full of spawn, and two small silver ones - he put them down by the water-butt; they were there at eleven o'clock in the morning, when I went out, and before twelve I was accused of stealing his fish.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the morning of the 19th of May I was at the door of the Coach and Horses public-house, and heard the prisoner and Rankling at high words - I heard her say he had brought in the fish, and that they were in the house - I found them in the watering pot - he said at the examination that he got them from his father's pond.</p>
               <p>Mr. SANDERS. I cannot swear to the fish.</p>

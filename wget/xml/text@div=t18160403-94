He insisted that I did, and immediately commenced an attack upon me. I told him I should be obliged to call the watch; I saw the watchman at the other side of the way, and called him over; there were some more men coming along, and they came up. The prisoner had his fist in my face, and immediately gave me a shove with his elbow against the wall, and at the same moment I felt my handkerchief go from my right hand great coat pocket. I then exclaimed, I have lost my handkerchief, and the watchman seized the prisoner, as the man who took it.</p>

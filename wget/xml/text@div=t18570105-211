                  </hi>. I am brother of the last witness. On 15th Dec. I saw the two prisoners in my father's house—I heard a conversation between them and my sister—I saw the first and the second counterfeit shilling—I afterwards saw a good half crown—I saw Brown take from my sister the change out of the half crown, two sixpences and one shilling—I heard my sister say it was a George's shilling that she gave—I did not see what shilling it was—I afterwards saw a shilling and two sixpences brought by Johnson and put on the counter, and that shilling was a bad one—my sister told me to fetch a constable, and I went out for that purpose—at that time Brown was outside, about twenty-five yards from the door—he had his hands in his pockets, and he threw something away—there is a wall near there, and with his right hand he tried to throw something over the wall—I heard something link like money, and it fell on this side of the wall, it did not go over—I went back to the house, and Brown went back after he had thrown away this money—when I got back my father was there, and he was holding the prisoner Brown, who was standing against the counter, and he tried to rescue Johnson—he pulled my father on one side—two constables came, one of them went inside and searched Brown, and the other went with me to where I had seen Brown throw something—we there found one shilling—I picked it up, and gave it to the constable—it was about three feet from the brick wall.</p>

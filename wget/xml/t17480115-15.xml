            . On the 8th of this month, I heard a noise in my cellar about seven o'clock at night. I went to my hatch-door, and saw the Prisoner slip out, and run to a neighbour's house with these candles that are in this handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them from her in this handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Penn. No; I put them into this handkerchief, to carry them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had she them?</p>
               <p>Penn. She had them in her apron and pocket together.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Penn. She had little or nothing to say; when she was brought back she owned she had them out of my cellar, and since that I have had several pounds brought home by my neighbours , half a dozen pounds at a time, and they said they bought them of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was with child and longed for candles , and I could not help taking them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she ever a one of them in her mouth ? if she had, I should have thought she had a mind to them.</p>
               <p>Penn. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any of them bit?</p>
               <p>Penn. No. I have lost a matter of ten pounds worth.</p>

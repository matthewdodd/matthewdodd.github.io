                  </hi>. I am the master of St. Olave's Union—the prisoner has been an inmate there since 1849, in consequence of some defect in his eyes—on Wednesday I was going up stairs to inspect the sick ward, and the prisoner was walking backwards and forwards on the landing—he struck me a violent blow on the ear, which turned me back, and he instantly drew this table knife, belonging to the Union, and made several stabs at me—I parried the blows off, and fell on the landing—I regained my standing, and was going down stairs when he made a desperate plunge at my throat, which I parried with my left hand—he said, "You b—r, I will murder you"—I was cut on the thumb—I was above him, and he had power over me—he followed me a yard and a half or two yards—I slipped through the doctor's door, and was in in an instant—he went into the yard after somebody who</p>

               <p>he thought was me—he had come in the morning and asked me for a suit of clothes to go out, and I told him he must make his application to the Board of Guardians—I said, "You had better go to your ward, you are not a fit object to leave the house, as you cannot get your own living"—that was all that had passed between us from the 24th to the 29th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer to St. Olave's Union—on the 29th Mr. Rayner came into my room bleeding very much from his throat—it was a deep wound, extending nearly to the bone—it was likely to be done with such an instrument as this knife—I also found a wound on his arm, and another on his leg, which had been done immediately before—there is nothing the matter with the prisoner's intellect, only with his eyes and his constitution—he is suffering from scrofula.</p>

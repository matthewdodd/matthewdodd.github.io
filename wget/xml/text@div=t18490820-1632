                  </hi>. I am foreman to Richard Batterbury; he is a builder. The prisoner was in his service, and was working at a building in Regent's-park—I left some pipe in a room there, and missed some of it—I have com<lb></lb>pared what has been found, with what was there, and believe they are the same.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">MASON</hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, S</hi> 168). I met the prisoner, near Morning<lb></lb>ton-crescent, on the evening of 17th July—he had a coat slung over his shoulder with something in it which appeared heavy—he sat down in front of a public-house—my brother officer and I watched him for several minutes—we then missed him, and went into the public-house—we met him coming from the back yard—I asked what he had done with what was in his coat—he said he had nothing in it—I took him, and my brother officer went and searched for the lead—in taking him he said, "If you had as many depending on you as I have, you would be glad to make a shilling or two."</p>

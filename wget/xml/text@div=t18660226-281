I am one of the cashiers of the Union Bank of London—Mr. Ella, late of Gresham-street, kept an account there; but it has not been operated on for some time—he has gone abroad, and there are only a few shillings left—on 14th Februrary, about 11 o'clock, the prisoner came and presented this cheque for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I am an accountant, of 13, Gresham-street—I know John Ella—he left England, for Australia, in October, 1862—I act for him, under a power of attorney, in his business—he transferred it to me—this cheque is not signed by him, or by his authority—I should be the only person to whom it could come—on the morning of 14th February, on arriving at the office, I found three drawers in my private office forcibly opened—in one of which was Mr. Ella's cheque-book—it did not occur to me then, but the next morning, when I saw that the prisoner had been apprehended, I found that five cheques had been torn out at the end of the book, Nos. 49, 696 to 49, 699—the prisoner was office<lb></lb>lad to Messrs. Smyth and Pim, solicitors in the same building, and had frequently come into my office on messages—he was acquainted with the time that my clerks would be away—I also missed two cancelled cheques, with Mr. Ella's signature on them, which might be imitated.</p>

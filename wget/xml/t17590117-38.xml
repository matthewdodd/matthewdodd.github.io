               <p>Robert James. Upwards of a month ago, I lost a board of livery lace; I made strict search throughout my shop, and could not tell which way it went; some time after that, came Turnis the evidence, and a man with him; they ask'd me if I did not lose a parcel of livery-lace; I said I had; Turnis said he was the instrument in taking it, they desired I would go before Justice Welch; I went; there I saw the lace as I believe; I said I could not positively swear to the lace, as there were other lace much like it; I then said, and so I do now, I believe it to be mine.</p>

            . The two prisoners and I were going by the prosecutor's shop; this livery-lace stood against the window, where the glass was brook; there was one Terry Smith with us; he took the lace out and gave it to one of the girls at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you walking about the streets to do?</p>
               <p>Turnis. To see what we could get: the two girls went to sell it at a Cook's-shop in St. Giles's, and left Terry Smith and I in the Bowl-yard; the mean while they came back, and told us the lace was stopp'd; I saw no more of it 'till it was brought to Justice Welch's house by the Cook-woman.</p>

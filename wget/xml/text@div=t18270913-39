            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On Friday, the 7th of September, in consequence of information, I went to No. 12, Buckeridge-street, St. Giles' - it is a lodging-house - I found the street door open; Edwards, Lee, and Kirby were with me; we tried the first door on the right hand side, in the passage, found it fast, and burst it open; directly on entering the room, I saw the prisoner standing fronting the window; he threw something into a pail of soapsuds - I could not see what it was, but I took out of the pail some colouring powder in brown paper, which I produce - I tried it on copper, and it gave it the appearance of silver: we secured the prisoner, and I took from a cup two bed shillings, in water - they had been rubbed down, recoloured, and were fit for circulation.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the prisoner threw the powder into the tub did you get it out? A. I went to it immediately, but the water had made it into a sort of paste; I took the two shillings out of the cup, and put them up in paper, wet as they were, which has made some specks on them that were not there then; the cup stood on a dresser; I saw Mrs. Lowe standing very near the bed, and under the bed I found some more colouring, which is here; I searched a shelf over the door, and found a piece of glass paper, which had not been used - it is used to file down the edges of the coin; I found some sheets of whitey-brown paper on the shelf that is used to tie the shillings up in; I found nothing else that day - I think I saw a cup on the dresser: we seut them to the office with Bailey, who was in the room, but was afterwards discharged: I locked the door up with a padlock, which the landlord got, took the key with me, and returned to the room the following day with Edwards and Kirby; I saw Edwards move this cup, which is the one I had seen on the dresser the day before; he took the top of it off, and took from it four bright shillings - it was a child's Tunbridge ware cup.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it Thursday or Friday? A. Friday, the 7th of September.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer, and accompanied Limbrick and Kirby to the prisoner's room, on Friday, the 7th of September; the street door was open - the room door was fast: we forced it, and found the prisoner standing by the window, and two others in the room - I saw something drop from the prisoner's right hand, into a tub of dirty water. I saw Limbrick take from that tub a powder, which he tried on a halfpenny, and it gave it the colour of silver; there was a show-board in the room, and on that I found a quantity of sand paper, which appeared to have been used in rubbing down coin - there appeared a portion of coin on the paper. They were taken to the office. I went there again on the Saturday afternoon, between four and five o'clock, with Limbrick, Kirby, and Powell. I saw a Tunbridge-ware toy, which appeared to be part of the top of a cup, and under it I found four shillings, bright as they came from the die; they were wrapped up in paper; I did not observe where that stood the day before. The lower part of the window is wood instead of glass, which prevents persons seeing from the street, unless they are very tall.</p>

            . I live at No. 13, Buckeridge-street, St. Giles', next door to the prisoner - I am not in any business. I have known the prisoner two or three years - I am landlord of the room which he was taken in - I let that room to him on the 23d of June - he continued to occupy it, and paid the rent himself, sometimes weekly and sometimes part of it; nobody lived there with him but his wife and their child, who is about twelve months old. I never knew how he got his living.</p>

            . I am an inspector of coin at the Mint. I have seen the articles produced. [The witness here wetted with pure water the powder found by Limbrick in the tub, and upon rubbing it on copper it produced the colour of silver] - this is the powder usually used on base coin - it is nitrate of silver and salt. This cream of tartar is used in the process of colouring; the four shillings produced are counterfeit, and in the new state as they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182709130045"></xptr>came from the die - the two shillings produced appear to have been rubbed down and resilvered - they are now in a bad state, by being apparently left in acid.</p>

               <p>MR. FIELD. They are from the same die as the foar others; the rubbing down is to give the money more the appearance of having been in circulation - it takes off the sarface, as the coin now in circulation is worn.</p>

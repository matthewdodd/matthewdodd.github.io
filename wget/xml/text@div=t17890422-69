               <p>Did any other person come into the shop, while they were in it, besides the woman you were serving. - No other person.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I produce two pieces of muslin, one of which I saw the prisoner drop; I was accidentally in Sidney's Alley, going past, I believe it was about four in the afternoon; I saw Langard in the Alley at the time; I did not know what he was doing, he was among the mob, there was no cry of stop thief! I am sure I saw the prisoner drop the piece, there were not many people.</p>
               <p>Court. How many? - There might be two or three dozen people.</p>
               <p>Court. People enough to obstruct your view? - No, I saw her put it under her arm before she dropped it.</p>
               <p>(The muslin deposed to by Langard having his private mark.)</p>
               <p>Can you also swear that that piece of muslin was on the counter at the time the woman was in the shop? - Yes, I had had all the pieces in my hand about ten minutes before; and this is the piece I took from the other woman, and which I saw the prisoner give to the other woman; this also was on the counter at the time.</p>
               <p>Court to Langard. Are these two pieces of muslin new? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the value of them? - About three pounds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Where did you see me first? - The corner of Sidney's Alley, in Prince's Street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Elliot swore at the Justice's, that he saw me drop a piece in Liecester-fields; I was a quarter of an hour in the shop before any constable came; I was sitting in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Elliott. There was no such thing said.</p>

               <p>I went into this gentleman's shop; what I asked for I bought and paid for; I went out, and this gentleman came out, and he had some muslin with him; he brought me back; two or three of the neighbours came into the shop, and a constable came in; I did not think that my trial would come on 'till six o'clock.</p>

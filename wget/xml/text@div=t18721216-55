My name was Margaret Grady before December 3rd—on December 3rd at 10.45 at night I served the prisoner with a pennyworth of eels—she tendered a florin; I knocked it on the counter and gave it to my servant Bounds to go out for change, but she put it in her mouth and bent it, and gave it back to me—I told the prisoner I would not give it back to her—she said she got it from her master—I said I had a good mind to lock her up—she <hi rend="italic">hooked it</hi> pretty quick, and the girl went out after her and came back with her—I gave her in charge with the florin.</p>

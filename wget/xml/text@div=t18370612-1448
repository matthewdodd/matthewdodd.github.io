                  </hi>. I am a cordwainer, and live at No. 19, Mills-court. The prisoner came to me, and asked which were Mr. Tanner's houses—I pointed them out to him, and said, "Has Mr. Tanner sent you?"—he said, "Yes—have you seen Mr. Tanner this morning?"—I said, "No"—he said, "He has given me one key to go in, and was to meet me here"—I said, "He must have been an old fool to give you only one key to go into thirteen houses"—next day I saw him again, and asked him if he worked for Mr. Tanner—he told me again that he worked for him—at another time he told me Mr. Tanner was gone to Lambeth to buy some scaffolding poles—one morning I came down and opened my window, and saw him with a half-sash on his shoulder—he went into No. 16, and said he was to take them all there till he saw Mr. Tanner—I then went and told Mr. Tanner, and next morning I went and tried the doors, and they were fast.</p>

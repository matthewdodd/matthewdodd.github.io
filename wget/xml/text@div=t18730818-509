                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer</hi>). I saw the prisoner, on Tuesday, 29th July, a few minutes after 5 o'clock, p. m., in Leadenhall Street, stand<lb></lb>ing inside a ham and beef shop door—he was offering this ring (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to Beauchamp, a young man engaged in the shop—I was in the street, but could see distinctly what was going on—the prisoner was holding the ring, and had got one finger inside, as if pointing to something inside—there are some marks inside it—he stayed in the shop from five to seven minutes after I saw him—he then came out and walked towards Bishopsgate Street, where I spoke to him, and told him I was a police officer, and asked him what he had about him—he said "Nothing"—I said "I believe I saw you offer a ring for sale in Leadenhall Street"—he said "No, it was a friend of mine showing me a ring"—I said "I saw you put the ring into your pocket"—I took him to the station, searched him, and found this ring and two other common riugs, two duplicates, one for a pin and one for earrings—I asked him where he bought the ring—he said "I bought it from a young man for 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I asked him who the young man was—he said he did not know his name or address—he afterwards said that it was a-good ring, 18 carats</p>

               <p>—I went to Beauchamp, and be came to the station and charged the prisoner with endeavouring to obtain 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him by representing the ring to be gold, and 18 carats—the prisoner then said he had not offered it for 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it was not gold, and he never represented it to be gold—the ring has never been out of my custody since, and I am certain it is the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman at Messrs. Hart &amp; Co.'s, 87, Leaden<lb></lb>hall Street—I know the prisoner as a customer, that is all—he came to me on Saturday, the 26th July, and said "I have got a ring, can you do with it?" and showed it to me—I asked him what he wanted for it, he said 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. it belongs to a young gentlemen who has got into some trouble, and got discharged from his situation. Last week he sold his watch and chain, and he now wants to sell this ring, and I am trying to sell it for him"—I laid "It seems a lot of money for it," and he said "Did you know Thomas Payne, the cashier?" and I said "I have heard of his name," and he said "He bought one like this, and gave 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and it was not so good as this"—I said "I have heard talk of imitations, and I don't like to buy it"—he pointed out the hall mark, and said it was 18 carat gold—"Well, "I said, "I don't like to buy it; it seems so much money to part with"—I identify the ring produced as the same—he called again on Monday, the 28th, and again offered me the ring—he said "My friend has another gold watch and chain to sell, will you buy that as well?"—I said "I cannot say," and he said he would come in again to-morrow, and perhaps I should buy the two together—he came in again on the 29th—I had a customer in the shop, and he went out—he came in about 12 o'clock, and I had a customer then, and he came a third time, about 5 o'clock I think it was, and said "My friend has pledged his watch and chain and you shall have the ring for 24"."—I said "I don't like to buy it, for I don't believe it is good," or something to that effect, and he said "I will take my solemn dying oath, if I never go out of the shop alive, that it is 18 carat gold," and that he was offered 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it by the landlord of a public-house in South Hackney, where the <hi rend="italic">'busses</hi> stop—he also said "If you lose this chance don't blame me, for you will never get another such a chance"—he offered to forfeit his life that it was 18 carat gold.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is your master here? A. No. I was taken near the church in Whitechapel - I believe they took me to the watch-house for safety; I had a long way to go home: I live at Stepney- my master is Mr. Cann, a hair-dresser, living in Fleet-street; I received my money at his shop, and then went with him to a public-house in Fetter-lane; I and three more drank nine or ten glasses of gin and water. In going from the public-house to Whitechapel a number of men and women spoke to me; several females came very near to me: after I left the public-house I showed my money to two of my shopmates, named Scott and Sinclair.</p>

            . I am beadle of Whitechapel. On Sunday morning, the 20th of January, the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, but I am not certain whether he was searched or not; while he was there I brought in the prosecutor from High-street, the worse for liquor; I do not know what he had about him, but about six o'clock the next morning he said he was very sorry, and hoped I would let him go home; I said, "Have you got every thing safe about you?" he then felt, and said he had lost a sovereign, some half-crowns, and some silver; I went into the room where the others were, and brought out the prisoner; I found a sovereign, two shillings, and two sixpences in his left waistcoat pocket, and one half-crown in each of his shoes - he said he had it from his father. I saw an apron taken out of a hat, but I do not know whose it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did the prosecutor say he was sorry for having done? A. I was dispersing some low men and women, and he came in among them, and asked what I wanted to do; he was a good deal the worse for liquor - he had a watch when he went in, but I did not see any money.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Whitechapel. I assisted in taking the prisoner to the watch-house, for rescuing a girl from a watchman, in White Lion-street; I saw him searched the next morning, and the money found - Dungate took his hat off, and found in it this apron, which was claimed by Wade; I heard the prosecutor say he had lost 1l. 10s. 6d. - I think he said a sovereign, four half-crowns, and a sixpence; I did not search the other persons who were there, as they were only put in for being disorderly, fighting, and such like, which is frequently the case in that part of the town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you search the prisoner when he went into the watch-house? A. No - I searched the other persons who went in; and one of them had no money when he went in, but the next morning there was half a crown and a shilling found upon him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see the prosecutor brought in? A. Yes; he certainly was very drunk - I was in an adjoining room; I was not in the hole with the prisoner. They have no candle nor fire.</p>

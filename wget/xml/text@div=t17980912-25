               <p>Q. Where did you carry them? - A. I took them where I had taken some before.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was that? - A. To a court in Whitecross-street; I delivered them to a woman that was in the shop.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner reside at that shop? - A. I do not know that he did; I had left others there before. The woman put them upon a little table, and I told her to take care of them; and the man made answer, I am going to them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What description did you give her of the person to whom they were to be delivered? - A. I told her, I had brought a parcel for the same gentleman that I had brought a parcel for a great while ago.</p>

               <p>Q. Now do you mean to tell us, that the account you have given to day, is the same account you have always given of the transaction? - A. As far as I have answered to.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell us, that the account you have given to day, tallies with that which you gave when you were first interrogated? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you never say, after the prisoner was apprehended, before the Magistrate, that you had given the prisoner the notes in the street? - A. Not these notes; other notes I did.</p>
               <p>Q. The notes in question, you left at the green grocer's shop, to be called for? - A. Yes, in Long's-buildings.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not at home when this parcel was first left? - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then all you mean to say is, that you got 215l. in return for two checks, and put them up in paper, and left them at the green grocer's shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were from home at the time they were left, and therefore you could not know who had left them? - A. I had seen the person in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not seen the prisoner from the time you carried the parcel till you saw him at Bow-street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did your wife tell you who she had them from? - A. She did not know his name, nor I neither, till after that.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Const. Q. The person you left them for was the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had left them for the prisoner before? - A. Yes.</p>

            ? - A. Yes; they were made payable to bearer, and drawn by Robert Sturdy, one for 75l. and the other for 140l.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the 75l. draft that you so paid?(shewing it him.) - A. Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you pay it to? - A. To Barker, the porter, I had paid several before to him; he was accustomed to write upon the back how he would have them, and upon this is wrote seven twenties.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I take it for granted you made a memorandum in you book immediately how you had paid it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. The person who demanded the money shewed you, at the back, how it was to be paid? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you follow those directions? - </p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. I must beg first to ask another question. - Have you any memory how you paid them, except your books? - A. No; I put in the book how I paid them.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you rely upon your book, and not upon your memory, how you made your payment? - A. Certainly.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Are you positively certain, without recurring to the books, that you paid it according to that direction at the back? - A. Yes, I am certain of it; I gave seven 20l. notes of following numbers for the 140l.; and for the other, I gave a 50l. two tens, and a five.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. You have discharged Mr. Sturdy of the account? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I think you told me as to the memory of numbers, you rely upon the books entirely? - A. I recollect these two drafts coming late in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. But have you any recollection of the numbers of the notes, without recurring to your books? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a Mr. Croft a partner in your house at that time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there no other person but the four whose names you have mentioned that derives any profit from the business? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am one of the Bow-street officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you apprehend the prisoner at the bar? - A. I did not; I was at the office on Wednesday evening when the prisoner was brought there by Noble and Owen; I searched him, and found upon him Bank-notes to the amount of 210l.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That was the amount of the two drafts? Mr. Close. No, it was 5l. short.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Evans.) Did you take any account of the amount of those notes? - A. I marked them all; I first shewed them to a gentleman who was in the room with me and the prisoner, and afterwards I sealed them with my own seal, and it was sealed with the seal of the office likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that? - A. This is the same parcel, this is the seal that was put to it at Bow-street; I gave them to Mr. Close.</p>
               <p>Mr. Close. I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Evans.) Where about did this pass? - A. In a back room, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You marked the notes-look and see if these are the same? - A.These are the same notes.(They were given to Mr. Shelton.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton. Here are two 10l. one 50l. and seven 20s.; the 20s. begin with No. 1542 and end with 1548.</p>
               <p>ROBERT STURDY sworn. - Mr. Knowlys. I object to Sturdy as a witness.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. We have a release. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Do you know the young man at the bar? - A. Yes, he came to me as clerk in the month of May, 1797, and continued to live with me till the 27th of July, when he withdrew himself upon the plea of being indisposed, and having been for some time dissatisfied with his appearance, I had given orders that he was to be dismissed, and no more to enter my office.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as look at that draft-is the signature your hand-writing? - A.Certainly not, or any part of the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Are Messrs. Devaynes and Co. your bankers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whose hand-writing it is? - A. I am sorry to say it has too much the appearance of his writing, I believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him authority to draw upon your banker? - A.Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. He is a very young man? - A. About eighteen.</p>
               <p>Q. His friends live in Warwickshire, I believe? - A. Yes; I never observed any thing improper till this; he was in a very inferior situation in my office.</p>

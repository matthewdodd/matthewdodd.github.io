                  , Ann Shelly, Decemb. 27. 1731. And did produce and publish, and cause to be produced and published the same, knowing it to be Forged, False, and Counterfeit
            </rs>.</p>
               <p>1st King's Council. The Prisoner sands indicted for forging and publishing, knowing it to be forged, a certain Writing, or promissory Note, for no less a Sum than 4000 l. in the Names of Ann Shelly, the Mother, and Ann Shelly, the Daughter. It may be proper to inform the Jury, that an Action was brought by the Prisoner, (who was their Plaintiff) for this Note. The Trial was at Guild-Hall. A Defence was made, Council were heard, and Witnesses examin'd; but on the Prisoner's giving it up, there was no Verdict, but only a Nonsuit. And there being Cause to suspect that the Note was forged, the Court order'd the Prisoner to be committed to Newgate, bound the Defendants to prosecute, and Mr. Billingsly, to whose Care the Note was deliver'd, to produce it here. If the Facts appear in this Court, as they did in that, I believe the Jury will have no Difficulty to find the Prisoner guilty; but as the Statute has made the Offence he stands charged with, Capital, I shall not attempt to aggravate it.</p>
               <p>If my Instructions are right, the Prisoner carry'd on the Trade of a Weaver, in Spittle-Fields, tho' it seems he did not so much follow that, as the Business of a Fortune-Hunter. He did not affect to be over-nice in his Choice, Young or Old was much at one with him, if the Lady had but Money. He kept a Gentlewoman in his House, who was sometimes taken for his Wife, sometimes pass'd for his Niece, and sometimes for his House-keeper only; and accordingly, she wet by several Names, Mrs. Bourk, Mrs. Dugdale, or Mrs. Puget. This Wife, or Niece, or Maid, or what you please to call her, was one who was very well qualify'd to start Game for him, for she was a Woman of Address and Art : And hearing that Mrs. Shelly, a Widow Gentlewoman, and her Daughter, who lived at Lawton in Essex, were considerable Fortunes, she went down thither, took a House in the Neighbourhood, and in a little time became not only acquainted, but very intimate, with them both. Having thus far succeeded, the next thing was to bring her Cousin (as she called the Prisoner) acquainted with them too. A Scheme was soon laid, pursuant to which he goes down to inform her, that a great Estate was fallen to her, and that she ought to empower some Person to get it in. He carry'd a Power with him, but this must be Witness'd by two Persons of Credit, and who so proper as her new Acquaintance Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter? and they accordingly are sent for, to sign their Names as Witnesses. At this Interview, the Prisoner fell passionately in Love with the - Mother - or Daughter - he hardly knew which, for some time, though at last, I think, he made Choice of the young Lady. Frequent Visits were paid, and received, till Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter discover'd, his Intention, and then they forbid him and his Cousin to come there any more. The Prisoner, however, comforted himself with this, that if he could not have the Daughter, he would have her Fortune. When he had got their Names sign'd to the Paper I just now mentioned, it was no difficult Matter to add a promissory Note for 4000 l. You know the Names of Witnesses to a Writing, are sign'd on the left Side, near the Margin, under the Words Seal'd and Deliver'd. Now it is but opening the Sheet thus - and you have the whole Breadth of one half Sheet, and the Margin of the other, to write what you please to the Names:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100010"></xptr> That the Prisoner took this Method, appears to me very plain; we have his Note in Court. In all Modern Paper there is some Mark in the Middle of the half Sheet, by which, the Maker, and the Time when made, is known; you will see by the Note itself, that this Mark is not in the Middle of it, but much farther from that End, where the Names are signed, than from the other; whence it's evident, that the Length of the Note is considerably more than the Breadth; of the half Sheet, which I need not tell you, is very unusual; you will see, that the upper Part of this Note, near the End where the Names are sign'd, is not cut strait, but indented, and you will judge whether this was not done to prevent any part of the Writing above, from appearing on the Face of the Note.</p>
               <p>Our Indictment is laid two Ways, for forging this Note, and for publishing it, knowing it to be Forged, False, and Counterfeit. If Names are sign'd for any Purpose, and a Man shall cut the Names from the first Purpose, and then write a promissory Note to those Names, with an Intention to defraud any Person, this I take to be Forgery within the Statute, as much, as if he had Counterfeited the Names. However, as 'tis a Moot Point, I shall rather insist upon his publishing the Note, knowing it to be forged. I believe it will be admitted, that the Note was all of his Writing, except the Names of Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter.</p>
               <p>2d King's Council. And if 'tis admitted that the Names were sign'd by Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter, yet if this was done on another Occasion, and the Names were afterwards cut off, and a promissory Note writ over them, I believe, his Lordship will tell you, that this is Forgery - You may observe one thing more on the Face of the Note: By its being indented and rounded off, on this Side, there was a Difficulty to bring in the Words, As Witness our Hands, for they were forced to put, As Witness, lower than our Hands; so that you would naturally read it, Our Hands as Witness. Then there is something so peculiar to the Prisoner, in the Writing and Spelling, that it would not be easy to find any Body else to Write and Spell like it.</p>
               <p>Court. Before you proceed to Evidence let the Act be read.</p>
               <p>Clerk reads. If any Person, after the 29th of June 1729, shall falsly make, forge, counterfeit, or cause or procure to be falsly made, forged, or counterfeited, or willingly act or assist in the false making, forging, or counterfeiting any Deed, Will, Testament, Bond, Writing-Obligatory, Bill of Exchange, promissory Note for Payment of Money, Indorsement or Assignment of any Bill of Exchange, or promissory Note for Payment of Money, or any Acquittance or Receipt, either for Money or Goods, with Intention to defraud any Person whatsoever; or shall utter or publish as true, any false, forged, or counterfeited Deed, Will, Testament, Bond, Writing-Obligatory, Bill of Exchange, promissory Note for Payment of Money, Indorsement or Assignment of any Bill of Exchange, or promissory Note for Payment of Money, or any Acquittance or Receipt, either for Money or Goods, with Intention to defraud any Person whatsoever, knowing the same to be false, forged, or counterfeited, then every such Person, being thereof lawfully convicted, shall be deemed guilty of Felony, and suffer Death as a Felon, without Benefit of Clergy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Billingsly. I was Associate to my Lord Raymond. On the 19th of June last there was a Tryal at Guildhall, in which the Prisoner was Plaintiff, and Ann Shelly Defendant. On the Issue, this Note was produced by the Prisoner, and read in Evidence; he stood at the Elbow of his Attorney and instructed him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. We admit the Body of the Note to be the Prisoner's writing.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. The Body of this Note is my Hand, and signing is theirs.</p>

            , Stationer. I was desired to inspect the Note. I presently saw it was longer than a half Sheet. We call this Kind of Paper a Fool's-Cap, because it was formerly marked with a Fool's -Cap in the Middle of the half Sheet, but now it has different Marks, according to the Province it's made in. This the Note is writ on has the Arms of Amsterdam. It never has more than 9 Wires on a Side, but this Note has II Wires, and the Arms is not in the Middle; whence I am certain that this is 2 luches longer than the Breadth of a half Sheet, and, I believe, it was cut from some Writing which these Persons were Witnesses to; and the rather because it is indented, which looks as if it was done to keep clear of some Writing that was over it - and here's a piece of Paper pasted on to make it appear even. Besides, I never saw, in the Course of my Trade, a Note of so extravagant a Length.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever see a Letter of Attorney with Witness our Hands, at Bottom, instead of Signed, sealed, and delivered?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ridge. I did not say it was a Letter of Attorney, or any thing else in particular, but that the indenting looked as if it was done to avoid some Writing that might have been over it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Could it not have been cut from the back of a Letter ?</p>
               <p>King's Council. The Question is not from what Paper the Names were cut, but if they were not cut from sme Paper, to which they had been affixed; and if you cut can from a Letter, 'tis all one to us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. We have so many Witnesses to give an Account how we came by the Note, that all you can bring against us will do you but little Service.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Then they were imported since the Trial at Guildhall - 'Tis pity you did not bring all your Forces in an Action for 4000 l. - Call Martha Todd - Do you remember any thing of Mrs. Shelly 's paying the Prisoner any Money?</p>

Indeed I have heard him say, that he would have all the Widow (Shelly's). Money from her - That he had courted the Daughter, but would have the Mother now, because she had most Money.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Pray what was his general Character?</p>

               <p>The Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had some Acquaintance in the Town where Mrs. Shelly lived, and with her among the rest. I was about to be married to a young Lady at Highgate, which Mrs. Shelly hearing of, came to my House, and after some Discourse she told me, her Daughter was not every One's Money, and if I made Suit to her, I should be very well received. I went that Night, and was kindly entertained, from which Time we grew very intimate; and Mrs. Shelly, the Mother, had so good an Opinion of me, that she told me I should take my Choice, either to be her Son or her Husband. I constantly visited them, at least three times a Week, and they came as often to my House; and if any Time I happened to neglect going at the usual Time, the Mother would come and tell me her Daughter was Sick. When I continued this Course for about a Year and a half, the Neighbours told me that Mrs. Shelly was a cunning old Woman, and bid me take Care of what I did, and so I press'd her to bring Things to a Conclusion. Atlast it was agreed that I should marry her Daughter, and thereupon she gave me this Note for 4000 l. as a Security for her Daughter's Fortune. I was so far from imposing upon her, that I told her when I first came to London I had but 4 s. 6 d. in the World, and what I had got since was all by my own Industry; and so far from making a Secret of this Note, which I should have done if I had forged it, that I shewed it to Mrs. Todd as soon as I had it, and told all the Neighbours that I had got Miss Shelly's Fortune, and I have said the same before Company in Mrs. Shelly's hearing, and she has never contradicted it. This was in December, 1731, and in February following Mrs. Shelly told me, as I was a Tradesman, if I should meet with any Misfortunes her Daughter would have nothing to trust to, therefore she would agree to pay me 1000 l. in part of the 4000 l. before it became due, in order to purchase a Security of 50 l. a Year for her Daughter's Jointure; and accordingly, an Agreement was put into Writing, and signed by her and two Witnesses for that Purpose. The Marriage was to be on Easter Sunday following, and I was to have the 1000 l. next Day. Against the Time appointed the Wedding Cloaths were bought, and I went down with a Ring and a Licence; when Mrs. Shelly told me her Daughter was not to be seen; I was surprized at this, and desired to know the Meaning of it. Mrs. Shelly said it was much against her Will; she was sorry for it, but could not help it, for she fear'd there was a Snake in the Grass, and that her Daughter was either married, or very near being married to her Carter,

            . I am a Merchant in Addle-street, Aldermanbury. In March, 1731-2, I went down with Mr. Risden to his House in Essex. The Prisoner hearing of our intended Journey, desired us to dine with him, at Mrs. Shelly's. We accordingly called, and were received in the Yard by the Prisoner and Yates. They put up our Horses, and then the Prisoner went with us to the Door, where we met Mrs. Shelly. The Prisoner introduced us to her as his Mother. Going into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100015"></xptr> the House, the Daughter appear'd and he told us, she was his Wife.</p>
               <p>King's Council. But that was more than Fact.</p>
               <p>Mr. French. By the Freedom I saw between them, I thought they were marry'd; but at Dinner, some Body ask'd When the Wedding was to be? And it was answer'd, On Easter-Sunday next. Indeed by the Prisoner's Behaviour, I could not tell which he had most Desire to, the Mother or the Daughter.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Was you at the Trial at Guild-Hall?</p>
               <p>French. I was not called.</p>
               <p>King's Council. What Countryman are you? French. An Irishman.</p>
               <p>King's Council. I know not why they call these Witnesses to prove an Intimacy, when we admitted all this an Hour ago. This is the way to make a Cause eternal.</p>
               <p>Mr. Risden. I am a Mercer in St. Martin's. I din'd at Mrs. Shelly's - I have a Country-house about seven Miles farther -</p>
               <p>King's Council. Was you examin'd at Guild-Hall?</p>
               <p>Risden. No.</p>
               <p>King's Council. I suppose you can say nothing more than the last Witness?</p>
               <p>Risden. No.</p>
               <p>- Todd. I am a Farmer at Lowton. As for hearing any Discourse about Matrimony, on the 3d of May was a 12 Month, there was a common Talk about the Parish, and my Wife was uneasy when she heard that Mrs. Shelly had sign'd Writings, and so I went to Mrs. Shelly in the Cow-house, and said, i had heard she had sign'd Writings, and she desir'd me to take no Notice, for she knew what she had sign'd, because she had read it before she set her Hand to it; but for my part, I never saw Scrip nor Scrawl.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Did she say any express Words of a Note of 4000 l. or that her Daughter had sign'd any Writings?</p>
               <p>Todd. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dicks. Last Easter was a 12 Month, I went down with the Prisoner to claim his Wife, Mrs. Shelly gave us a Dram; the Prisoner ask'd her if Mrs. Ann was within? She said there had been some Difference betwixt her and her Daughter, who kept out of the Way, which she herself was not the Occasion of; but was very sorry that the Prisoner had been at the Trouble and Charge of coming down so often, and would make him any Satisfaction, if he'd deliver up the Writings. Then he produced a Note of some Agreement of 50 l. a Year, to be settled on Mrs. Ann, and another Note of 4000 l. and the Wedding-ring, and the Licence; she desir'd him to be easy, and said, she did not care if she gave him 4 or 500 l. if he'd deliver up her Note.</p>
               <p>No, says he, I won't take 1000 l. but I'll put the Note in Force.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Did you read those Papers?</p>
               <p>Dicks. I did not take much Notice of them - he laid three on the Table.</p>
               <p>King's Council. What shape was the Note?</p>
               <p>Dicks. A long slip of Paper; I think it was sign'd by both Ann Shelly's - I don't remember the Substance of the third Paper.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Where were you at the last Trial?</p>
               <p>Dicks. In Leicestershire - At Wickston-Two-Steeples, two Miles from Leicester - I have a small Estate there, of about 30 l. a Year.</p>

            . At the End of April, 1732, I went to the Prisoner's House, in Booth-Street, Spittle-Fields, and found Mrs. Shelly, the Mother, with him. He was walking about very much dissatisfied, and said he had been ill us'd, and she talked very low, and assur'd him it was none of her Contrivance. There was a Gentleman, one Mr. O Brian, and he read a Paper of 50 l. to be settled on Ann Shelly ; and something of a Note of 4000 l. to be paid sometime afterwards by Mrs. Shelly, and Mrs. Shelly said, she had rather give him 1000 l. than have any farther Dispute with him about the Note.</p>
               <p>King's Council. Did you read the Note yourself?</p>
               <p>Bews. No; I can't read.</p>
               <p>Court. It appears plain, that Mrs. Shelly never deny'd the Note, that she was highly concern'd her Daughter had behav'd in such a Manner, and that she was willing to make Satisfaction. The Evidence against the Prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173310100016"></xptr> is only Circumstantial. There's some Suspicion on the Face of the Note; but that is for from being sufficient to convict a Man of Forgery - I don't say the Note is Recoverable for there being no Value receiv'd, perhaps a Court of Equity, may not allow it. The Council open'd that Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter witnessed a Letter of Attorney; but not one Person has been called to prove it -</p>
               <p>King's Council. I don't know what they have done with the Witnesses, I have a great many more in my Brief - where is

               <p>Martha Todd. Last May, was twelve Months, I told him, I had heard, he was to be one of the Prisoner's Witnesses; and he said, No; he knew nothing of their Affairs, and never saw Scrip nor Scrawl - I saw him again, when the Prisoner was committed to Newgate, and ask'd him, If he remember'd what he had said ? And he answer'd as before.</p>
               <p>Court. He might say so, perhaps he was not willing to disclose their Affairs to her.</p>
               <p>Martha Todd. I was at Mrs. Shelly's, when Yates said to the Prisoner, If I was courting a Lady, I'd bring down a Licence, and say, Madam, I must and will have you; and Mrs. Shelly said, I deny that with both my Hands.</p>

            . I liv'd at Mrs. Shelly's, before the Prisoner first came - He lit of them at Midsummer-Fair, and so came to see them, on the Foot of Courtship to Mrs. Ann ; but she made a Rejectment, and said she would never have any thing to say to him that way; and to my Knowledge, she continu'd in the same Mind all along, from his first coming to his last.</p>
               <p>Court. Had she any Lover?</p>
               <p>Gowers. Yes; Mr. Sexton ; the Prisoner reduced him to her, as he told me next Day, and said, he should have got me to a' spoke a good Word for him - and sometime afterwards, he said, I see Miss won't accept of Mr. Sexton, no more than of me.</p>
               <p>King's Council. They have call'd Witnesses we were not aware of - We were prepar'd for the Witnesses he brought to Guild-Hall ; but now he has got quite a new Set, except Yates - and the Agreement is a Piece of Evidence that they did not produce before.</p>
               <p>Court. That might be their Ignorance.</p>
               <p>King's Council. As we are depriv'd of the Evidence of Mrs. Shelly and her Daughter, 'tis impossible to prove the Forgery if Circumstances are not allow'd as Evidence, and I think the Circumstances appear very strong on the Face of the Note - Yates is the only Person we are prepar'd for, and therefore we can only attack his Character. The rest, as we know nothing of them, we must leave to the Jury. Mr. Powel, What do you know of Yates ? - Nay, don't shake your Head, but speak.</p>

The prisoner lodged in the same house, and slept in the same room, in the next bed: another person had slept in the room, but he left at five o'clock in the morning; I always sleep there when I come to town, and did so on the 26th of September - the prisoner had come there on the 22nd, stating that he worked for Mr. Cubitt, and was recommended by Cubitt's men to lodge there; I heard him say that: I got up at seven o'clock on the morning of the 26th, leaving him in bed in the room - he was awake; I asked him if it was not time for him to rise - he said he should get up directly; he had come to my bed at five minutes past five o'clock that morning, and told me it was past six, and time to get up; when I went down stairs I left two coats, a waistcoat, a pair of trousers, two shirts, three neck-handkerchiefs, and four cotton ones, all in a cupboard by the side of my bed - it was not locked; I missed them about six o'clock that afternoon - the prisoner was gone, without paying the landlord, and did not return; I never saw him again till I took him at Pimlico, about two o'clock on the 29th, which was the Tuesday following - I told him I had been looking for him ever since Saturday night; I took him to Queen-square, and gave him in charge to Woodbury, who searched him in my presence, and found three handkerchiefs in his hat, two of which were mine, and what my things had been tied up in the cupboard; I lost a drab great coat, nearly new - I gave 3l. 10s. for it, and have not worn it twenty times; a black coat, quite new, which cost 3l. 10s. not three months before - I had worn it four times; the waistcoat was new, and cost 12s., and the trousers 26s.; the handkerchiefs are worth about 5s. together, and the shirts 8s. at least.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to lodge there, but on the morning the prosecutor went away I got up shortly after him; the waiter was sweeping the door when I went out- I went to look for work; Mr. Cubitt's foreman told me to call on Monday, and when I went he could not put me on - I went to Camberwell, got employ at a coal-shed, and the man gave me a bed at his house.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

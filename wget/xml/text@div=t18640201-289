                  </hi>. I am a potman, at the New Gun, Woolwich—on 2nd January, I saw the deceased and the prisoners there up stairs—there were seven or eight persons in the room—the prisoners and deceased had been playing a game at cards, "twenty-fives"—the deceased won half a crown of Maguire, and then said that he would not play any more—Maguire asked him why not—he still persisted in not playing, and Maguire struck him—he staggered, and then Maguire hit him two or three times more—he did not fall—the deceased did not strike back again—the master and a policeman came up at the time Maguire was striking him—Bowes was present at that time—I afterwards went up to the gas, and saw the prisoners lay hold of the deceased's legs, and hold him up by them in the air—his shoulder knocked on the settle, and his head was down—the money fell out of his pockets—after he got up, I saw some blood on his face which seemed to come from his nose—he touched the settle, but not violently.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer—I saw the prisoners at the New Gun, on 2nd January, playing at cards; they had just finished the last game as I went up—I had hardly been there three minutes when Maguire struck the deceased five or six times, and he fell to the ground to avoid any more blows—the master then came up and the military policeman, and they stopped it, but when the landlord and the policeman went out, the two prisoners got hold of the deceased's legs as he was sitting on a form, and pulled him off on to the boards, held him up, and shook the money out of his pockets—he fell on his backside to avoid the blow—I saw no marks of violence on his face—I saw blows struck.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you see his nose bleed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I can swear to five blows on his face—I am quite sure he was pulled on to the ground—when his money rolled out, they gave him back his own money, and kept the half-crown—the deceased then left the room, went down stairs, and called for a half-pint of beer, but the prisoners went down two minutes before him—I do not know when they left—I left the deceased there when I went home—I left between 9 and 10—there might be another soldier up stairs besides the prisoners when I left, but I am not positive—I know the deceased by sight—I had seen him there about three months—I had never drank with him—I had never seen his wife till the Monday I went before the Coroner.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I was called on to attend the deceased on Monday evening, the 10th, about 6 o'clock—he was fast asleep when I went into his room—his sleep appeared perfectly natural, and I aroused him—he complained of severe pain in the front of his head, and said that on Saturday night, January 2d, he was in a public-house, and had a quarrel—next morning, Monday, between 9 and 10, I was informed of his death—I made a post mortem examination, and found on removing the scalp that the temporal muscle on the right side of the head had a quantity of extravasated blood—I removed the cranium, and found evidence of his having some old disease of the top part of his forehead—on examining his penis there was a cicatrice of an old chancre, from which I was led to believe that he had had syphilitic disease of the cranium, one part had closed up, but at other parts the skull was much thinned—on re<lb></lb>moving the membrane covering the brain, there was a large clot of blood extending all over the right side of the brain—the membrane of the brain was very much inflamed; one half of it, and there was a quantity of fibrin thrown out upon the surface of the membrane, proving that the inflamma<lb></lb>tion was not recent—the vessels on the surface of the brain were much congested, but the brain itself appeared perfectly healthy, and there was no effusion of serum or blood in the ventricles—he was a fine, strong, healthy man, and I think from the history and the post mortem appearances, he may have bad slight concussion of the brain followed, by severe inflamma<lb></lb>tion, and that the sudden bursting of one of the vessels caused a large amount of blood to be extravasated, and consequently the convulsions and death—I think the effect I describe would be produced by a blow, from the condition of his skull, which was not strong enough to receive any amount of force—it is impossible to say whether a fall and striking one shoulder on the ground, shaking his body would produce it—I do not think it would be possible to produce it by a shake if the head was not strong—I think from the post mortem appearances, that a blow with the fist near the eye might have that effect—I did not give him laudanum—his taking ten drops of laudanum could not possibly have affected him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not the immediate cause of death the extravasa<lb></lb>tion of blood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think so—when a vessel is wounded, particu<lb></lb>larly where there is disease, the blood flows out and covers the surface of the brain—if it had been a small vessel the blood would have oozed out slowly—I examined it most minutely, and could not find out the vessel—if it was a large vessel it would cover the surface I saw in a few minutes—the in<lb></lb>flammation had possibly existed for a few days: more than one—if I had not heard any of the evidence, I should say, from the appearances I saw, that the injuries had been inflicted nine days before, and it is possible, and I do not think it was a more recent injury, because a person may receive a blow on the skull and the symptoms of inflammation might not set in for some time afterwards—in some cases it has not occurred for some length of time afterwards—I do not think the vessel might have burst at the time the blow was given—if that large clot of blood had been on the brain when I saw him at 6 o'clock, I think there would have been some evidence of its being</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186402010106"></xptr>
               <p>there, but there was no particular indication of his having had any severe injury to the brain; his pupils acted properly—I cannot say whether there was any concussion of the brain; I was not present when he received the injury—I do not mean to say that the blood was oozing nine days—I think the vessel must have burst some short time before death—I do not think it had burst when I saw him first—I do not think a shock would be sufficient to break the walls of the vessel, and the clot was only on one side—I think the cause of the extravasation of the blood was first the slight concussion of the brain, and then severe inflammation, and one of the vessels having been inflamed, must have given way with the force of the blood, and caused the extravasation—if laudanum is administered in sufficient quanti<lb></lb>ties it produces slight congestion of the brain—it produces heavy sleepi<lb></lb>ness—that is its effect on the brain—I do not think that a small dose would have that effect—I heard nothing of his having laudanum until the inquest—I think I should have recommended it if I had known as much while he was alive as I did after I opened his head.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

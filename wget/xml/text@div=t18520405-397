                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>). On Saturday, 28th Feb., about 11 o'clock at night, I was at Clay-hill, Enfield, near Mr. Bevan's house, which is situated at the road side, with a meadow adjoining, and separated from the road by a close fence about five feet high—there was a haystack in the meadow, about four yards from the fence, and that haystack was on fire, and I saw the prisoner coming in a direction from it—he was about six yards from it, coming towards the fence—when I got up to him he was getting over the fence—I stopped him, and said, "You have been setting that hay<lb></lb>stack on fire"—he said, "No, I have not, nor did I know it was on fire"—I asked him what he was doing in the field, and he said, "I got over there to ease myself"—I said, "Come and show me where you have done so"—I got over the fence, and we went, but he could not show me where—he said it was near the fence—I found no appearance of it, and, took him into custody—I made him assist me to put the fire out—there was a rake by the side of the stack, which enabled me to pull the hay down, so as to stop it from going further, till I got some water—I alarmed Mr. Bevan's servants, and when they came I said to the prisoner, "Now, in the presence of the butler, show me where you have eased yourself?"—he could not do so, and I then took him to the station, and on searching him, found this knife, a tobacco box, and one lucifer match in it that had not been lighted—I also found this cover of a book, on which there are marks of a lucifer having been rubbed—I also produce some leaves of a tract, and this tobacco pipe I found in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Mr. Edward Bevan, of Clay Hill. The stack is his property, and on land he rents—I remember the policeman giving an alarm—I went out, and found the prisoner and the policeman standing near the stack—the policeman said, "The stack has been on fire, and I saw this young man coming away from the stack; and I said to him, 'You have been and set that stack on fire;' and he said he did not see fire, or did not know it was on fire, or something to that effect"—that he then said to him, "What do you do over there?" and he said he had got over to ease himself; and that he asked him to show him the place, and he could not do so—I went and looked, and there was no appearance whatever—the policeman then took him to the station—there had been water fetched before I arrived at the spot, and the fire was quite out—as soon as the policeman had taken the prisoner to the station, I and William Jones, the footman, went back to the stack, and Jones picked up some papers, and handed them to me—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were picked up in my presence, about three quarters of a yard from where the fire had been—there was also a lucifer match found in one of the pieces of paper; it is now broken in pieces, by being pulled about before the Magistrate—I know the prisoner; he lives near—I have compared these papers with some the officer found on the prisoner, and they match, and form part of the same paper.</p>

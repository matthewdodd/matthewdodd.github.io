The prisoner came to live as a servant of all work in my family; she came on the 12th of March, in the evening, and on the 13th, the day following, she robbed me, and was doing so the whole of the day. We first suspected her by her locking herself up in the bed room, where he had no business to be with the door locked. Mrs. Ball went and knocked at the bed room door, and the prisoner made no reply. There are two doors to the bed room, and she went round to the other door, and there knocked, that was locked too; in about the pace of half a minute the prisoner answered yes, malam; that gave me a suspicion, and I sent for an officer in the evening.</p>

            . I was sent for about nine o'clock in the evening, to Mr. Ball's house; there were two bundles produced to me, that they said, had been taken from under the sink in the kitchen. The prisoner was present when they said so. I came close to her person, and felt something, which I thought was under her top petticoat; it turned out to be two shirts, which I took from under her petticoat; I then searched her pocket, and found four handkerchiefs, three caps, four muslin ribbons, but they call them o -hands, a silk ribbon a black lace veil, nine or ten cotton stay laces, and a small tunbridge box, containing two pairs of earrings, a guard ring, and a morrocco box, with a re nt of nett lace in it. I took the two bundles, and going to the Compter, she said her friend lived at Worcester. She had been in the Guard Society, and had come from there to Mr. Ball's place. The bundles coutained the other articles named in the indictment.</p>

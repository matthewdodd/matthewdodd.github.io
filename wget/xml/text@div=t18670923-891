I am clerk in the Savings Bank Department of the Post Office—I produce this bank-book, the warrant, and the notice—the name in this book is William Millett, of No. 9, Orange Street—each deposit is entered in the book—supposing he wanted to withdraw, he would first of all send us a notice of withdrawal, which he could get at any post-office; he would then fill up the amount required and give his name and address—this is the notice (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) used for the withdrawal of this money—he has simply to fold it up and put it in the post-office, and it would be received in our office—when received it is compared with the signature of the depositor made at the time of opening the account, which is on the declaration, and if they agree we act upon them—we then issue a warrant—this is the one issued in this case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and send it to the address given in the notice—this was sent to 52, Galway Street, Bath Street—the depositor would then take that notice to the post-office, and they would pay him, and if the account was closed they would take the book from him—it would not be paid without the book.</p>

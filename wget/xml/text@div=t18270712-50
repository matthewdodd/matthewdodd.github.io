            . I am one of the Presidents of the Inland-office. I was on duty on Saturday, the 10th of February; a letter addressed to the Isle of Man would be assorted to the Liverpool division, or to the Liverpool-road; I had the general superintendance of the whole office; the prisoner was employed that night as assistant at the Liverpool division; letters for the Isle of Man would pass through his hands - he would receive them; after being charged, it was his duty to place them in the box; he would arrive at the office a little before five o'clock, and remain there till the mails were all made up, which would be a little after eight; he had to assort letters into the different boxes on the road - he would be sorting letters first till twenty minutes after five o'clock, and begin sorting again at twenty minutes after six - he would put the unpaid letters into the different boxes - after the sorting was complete he would have to tell up the postage - he would be alone at the division several parts of the evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you say he was alone at his division, you mean nobody assists him at his business? A. The division is against the wall - he is there at times by himself - there may be a hundred and fifty persons in the room; the nearest person to him would not be more than two yards off; three or four persons would be within two yards of him; there are two seats, where two Presidents sit - they have a view of the whole office when in their seats - but they have to go round the office and see that every body is at his post; the taxing-clerk sits about two yards from the prisoner, but their backs are to each other; the prisoner would have to fetch letters from the taxing-table to his own; it is impossible for me to say how many hands a letter may go through, but his is the last hand that they go to. When a letter first arrives, it is put to be faced - there are fifteen or twenty facers - they then go to the stamper; there are three stampers.</p>
               <p>Mr. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Is there any separation between the places in which one clerk and the other sits? A. There is a partition between each division.</p>

            . I live at Ramsey, Isle of Man; Mr. John Culey and I were trustees for Lieut. Fielding On the 13th of February I received no letter containing a 5l. note on account of the half-pay of Lieutenant Fielding; the last remittance I had from Codd and Co. was in October, 1826.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For whose use was this money? A. For the benefit of his creditors, of whom I was one - it was arranged twelve months before, that the remittance should be made to us at his own request; the money was to be applied to the liquidation of his debts; it was part of his quarterly payment.</p>
               <p>Mr. BOLLAND. Q. Did you act as trustee for his creditors? A. Yes; and I am a creditor myself.</p>

            . I am one of the City Marshals. On Monday, the 12th of February, I was sent for to the General Post-office, and directed to search the prisoner; I told him to take all his money out of his pockets, and out of his right-hand small-clothes pocket, he took the 5l. note produced; he said he took it from Mrs. Brooks, of Nelson-square, where he lodged; that he had a bill to pay for her, and had promised to make up the remainder of the money - he parted with the note very readily; this was between one and two o'clock - he was in custody when I first saw him. I did not part with him till between six and seven o'clock that evening, when I left him at the Compter. Mr. Peacock, the Post-office solicitor, Mr. Wood, and I, went with him in a coach to Nelson-square, to search his lodgings. Mr. Peacock stated to him, that the account he had given of the note was false, as Mrs. Brooks had denied that she ever gave it him; he then said, that he had not taken it from Mrs. Brooks, and he would not disclose to the solicitor from whom he had taken it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is Mrs. Brooks here? A. I do not know; I have not inquired for her lately - I know where she lived, it was the second door on the right hand side, after you go from Blackfriars-road.</p>

            . I went to No. 60 or 61, Nelson-square, which in the second or third door to the right; I think it is the second. I could not find Mrs. Brooks there; I inquired in the neighbourhood, and found she had gone away in debt and sold all her things off.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL HURST re-examined. The bag should arrive at the office at twenty minutes after six.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in an exceeding long address to the Court, stated the case to rest entirely on presumptive evidence, and that it was by no means conclusive against him; that he had taken the note in question on the evening of the 10th of February, at a gambling-house, No. 6, King-street, St. James-square; and that the account he first gave of it arose from his reluctance to acknowledge his having been to a house of that description; that on arriving at the office on Monday morning he was informed Mr. Stow had sent repeated messages for him, and on his going to him he questioned him, and told him he should want to speak to him again; as such, if he had come by the note feloniously, he should certainly have destroyed it, which he had ample opportunity of doing before he was taken into custody.</p>

            . I am employed in the Post-office. Mr. Stow is a President of the Inland-office. On the morning of the 12th of February, he inquired for the prisoner before he had arrived; when the prisoner came I told him Mr. Stow had sent for him three or four times - he immediately went to him; he returned and remained in the Accountant-general's office for an hour or more; there was a fire in the office - he was sent for again, and went to Mr. Stow; he certainly might have destroyed any papers if he had chosen.</p>
               <p>MR. SOLICITOR GENERAL. Q. Did you tell him what Mr. Stow wanted? A. I did not know; the prisoner was employed as an extra clerk; it is very likely the President may often want to speak to a clerk.</p>

            . Q. You had some tea and sugar of Stewart - A. Yes; three loaves first, and then some tea. I had one loaf near two months ago; the other two loaves was about a month ago, and two the next time, and a pound and a half of tea I believe at the same time. He came in the stable yard. I drive for Mr. Fincham. The prisoner was carman to Mr. Boot; he brought the sugar to me to ask a young man of the name of Potter to buy it. I did. He bid me ask seven shillings for one loaf of sugar, and the other eight.</p>
               <p>Q. How much were you to ask for the tea - A. Seven shillings and sixpence; there was a pound and a half; I sold Potter these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where he got them - A. No more than the dead; I never asked him; I passed them to Potter.</p>
               <p>- POTTER. I am a porter at No. 10, Marybone-street, Golden-square. I had the sugar of Hodges; the first loaf of sugar I paid eight shillings for, and seven for the other; the last tea I had I paid seven shillings and sixpence. I had no dealings with Stewart at all.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On Sunday morning, the 28th of September, Barrett, the officer, and I were in company together in Thames-street, about half past six o'clock in the morning, we met Potter in Thames-street; he had a bag upon his shoulder with two loaves of sugar in it; we searched the lodgings of Potter. On Monday, afternoon we searched Stewart's lodgings; we found nothing that belonged to his master. This is the sugar that we found upon Potter. We took the prisoner in custody on Monday afternoon; he said, he knew nothing about it.</p>

             was called on his recognizance, and did not appear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding of Council for the prosecution, thus opened the case.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, you have just heard a person of the name of 
               <persName id="t17850112-84-person848">
                  Thomas

             called on his recognizance, he has not appeared; he was the person we wished to get at; and I am afraid that the circumstances of this case are so particular that it will be impossible to affect either the man at the bar, or ultimately to get at the great offender; the person at the bar has been abandoned by the man that has now absconded himself; and I confess I am somewhat at a loss, whether to look at the prisoner with indignation or approbation; with indignation for having committed this crime, by the instigation of the wickeder party, or with approbation for his open confession of it: but however, I can only give evidence of his own assertion; I shall therefore<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178501120099"></xptr> be in the correction of the Recorder, whether that be or be not evidence sufficient to meet that charge; if it be, then I shall proceed to state to you the nature of this crime, and the manner of its being committed, to the prejudice of the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Court. You open this with great fairness Mr. Fielding, and you apply to me; is not the prosecutrix herself a witness in the cause?</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. My Lord, she is an interested witness, inasmuch as there will be a motion for a new trial.</p>
               <p>Court. This prosecution is conducted with great fairness and propriety, and it is my duty to state my opinion in the present stage of the business: therefore, if you have no evidence to disprove what the defendant swore on the trial, except his own declaration that it was false; I am clearly of opinion that the Jury cannot in point of law find him guilty.</p>

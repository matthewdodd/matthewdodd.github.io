On Monday morning, the 17th January last, between 12 and 1 o'clock, I was on duty near Poland Street, and heard a disturbance in Silver Street in consequence of a drunken woman named Mary Murphy—I told her to go away and as she would not I took her into custody—I went through Cambridge Street into Portland Street with her, and the prisoner Murphy attempted to rescue her in Cambridge Street—he got hold of her and tried to pull her away from me, and said she should not go to the station—at the corner of Poland Street he caught hold of me and some more tried to pull the woman away, and I was obliged to draw my staff to keep them away—he let go when I hit him with my staff—when I got down the street a short distance someone caught hold of my coat and attempted to pull me back, and on looking back I saw the prisoner Murphy in the act of throwing a brick, and I turned my head, and it hit me behind the head—he twisted his legs round mine and attempted to throw me to the ground—I struck him, I think on the shoulder or the neck, I cannot say exactly where, with my truncheou—I then fell to the ground, when I was kicked in the back by someone, but by whom I don't know—I then became senseless, and when I recovered I found myself in Charing Cross Hospital—I was removed to King's College Hospital on account of repairs, and was in the two hospitals until the 27th of last month—I was attended by Drs. Head and Fowler at King's College, and by Mr. Cantler at Charing Cross—I gave evidence in Charing Cross Hospital—I still feel the effects of the treatment I received, and have had four fits since I left the hospital—I have not gone back to duty yet—I have suffered very much from my head and back and leg.</p>

On Sunday night, 16th January, I saw a crowd in Silver Street, at about 12.45—I followed the crowd into Poland Street, and I saw the prisoner Murphy with his arms round the lower part of Cross's body, and his right leg twisted round him—I caught hold of Murphy and pulled him off Cross—I saw Cross was much hurt—he could not hold up his head—I asked him what was the matter, and he said he had struck him on the head with a stone—I assisted him and found he could not stand—at the same time I kept hold of Murphy for a couple of minutes or so—Cross had hold of Mary Murphy, and was partly leaning on her—detectives Cave and Shrives came up and assisted me in taking the prisoner—a constable came up after a little and assisted in bringing the woman to the station—I took prisoner Murphy.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. W. SLEIGH</hi>. There had first been a disturbance in Silver Street—I could not say whether it was between two young men fighting—I did not see any fighting when I came up—Cross was not in Silver Street—I don't know whether Murphy was there—I didn't know him then—I followed the crowd; I could not say whether I followed Murphy or not—I did not see Cross with Mary Murphy in custody before I saw prisoner Murphy—I did not hear Cross speak to Mary Murphy—he was lean<lb></lb>ing on her when I came up—he appeared to be taking her into custody—I did not say she was all right, and it was no use taking her—I never used the expression, "It is no use running her in; she is all right"—I never remonstrated with Cross at all, that I swear—he had got her into custody before I came up—I was near and saw his arms round her—he was in a stooping position—his feet were on the ground; I did not see him strike the prisoner with his staff; I pulled Murphy off—Mary Murphy was not charged at the police-station with this assault; yes, she was tried at. the police-court with the two prisoners and dismissed—I did not hear her say when her husband was there "For God's sake take me out of this crowd"—I heard Shrives give his evidence—no name was mentioned to me as to who threw the stone or used the stone—I did not take Cross to the hospital—I left him at the police-station—there were perhaps thirty or forty persons present in the street—I should not think there were 100 at any time—I have seen a man of the name of Barrett, who has been mentioned in reference to this case—I don't know that he is an Irishman—I last saw him on the 27th or 28th' of June last—I have not seen him since—I believe he lives in the district where the disturbance occurred—I don't know exactly; I cannot say; I heard his name mentioned at the police-court—I heard witnesses called for the defence there—Cross was not taken through Little Windmill Street, to the station—I was in Little Windmill Street, myself that night—it leads into Silver Street—Cross first took the woman in charge in Little Windmill Street—I did not see him—I was at the police-station when the prisoners were charged—the woman was there when the sergeant asked Cross who he charged—I cannot say</p>

               <p>what he charged the prisoners with; I remember his being asked—they were taken into the ordinary room and placed at the iron bar—they were not placed at the iron bar when the constable was there—they were in the room when the constable was there—I did not hear the sergeant ask the constable what the charge was; I swear that—Murphy was like a crazy man making such a noise; I had to take charge of him—he would not keep still.</p>

On this night I was in company with Shrives and went to the scene of the disturbance in Poland Street—I went up to the crowd and saw Cross, the constable, holding the man Murphy in his right hand, and he had hold of the female Murphy with his left hand—as soon as Cross saw me he says "Take that man, that man did this" meaning the man he was holding with his right band, "he struck me on the head with the brick"—I then immediately took hold of him—I also took hold of the woman Murphy—after we got a little way up the street Cross fell back, and there was a person there that caught him or he would have fallen down in a fainting state—the female Murphy called out "Cave, come here, I want yon, come to me"—I had hold of her at the time, but I was not close enough—she knew me—I then called Shrives, who was with me, and asked him to go to her, but what she said to him I don't know, my attention was taken up with Murphy—then we went on towards the station—Cross was taken to the station, and subsequently to the hospital—he would have fallen again in Marlborough Street had not he been caught again by a person walking by the side of him—on the way to the station Murphy said "That policeman (Cross) is drunk"—he was shouting all the way to the station that policemen were d-d thieves and liars—I saw Maghan outside the station—he was drunk—at the station Cross kept on fainting off now and then—we could not get anything from him straight off, only a piece at a time—I fetched the doctor.</p>

Cross could give some explanation at the time, but only a piece at a time—I was not there the whole time—I was sent out for the doctor and for a cab to take him in—I didn't hear what he told the sergeant—all he said was that it was Murphy, that it was him that did it—that was at the station and also in the street when I went up—he did not use Murphy's name in the street—he was holding Murphy in his right hand when I got up—Miller was there, standing close by helping to support Cross—he might have heard what Cross said, but there was confusion, and he might not have heard all that took place—I should think Mary Murphy was sober.</p>

               <p>held by Cross—I believe he said "Take that man; that is the man that done it," and some woman in the crowd called out "Yes, for God's sake take him"—I don't know who the woman was—I endeavoured to find her—they were then taken on to the station—in consequence of what Wallis said to me I took Maghan—he was following up the crowd, and when he arrived at Marlborough Mews I took him into custody—I told him he was charged with assaulting a constable—he said he didn't know anything about it—he struggled very violently—with assistance I got him to the station—at the station steps he caught hold of the railings and said he had not done anything, and he would not go—his wife came up to stop me from taking him—I pulled her out of the way, and some other constable arrived and we got him into the station—Murphy was very violent at the station, more like a madman—he was drunk—they were taken in before the acting inspector and put in the dock—he asked whose charge it was, and Cross said it was his, and he was asked to state what it was—he was in a very fainting condition—he was perfectly sensible at the time and conscious, but very faint—he stated that Mrs. Murphy was creating a disturbance in Cambridge Street, the corner of Silver Street, and he endeavoured to get her away, and finding she would not go he took her into custody; that a crowd followed him on the way to the station, and in Poland Street he was hit on the head by a brick by Murphy—the acting inspector asked him how he knew it, was Murphy, and he said "He was sideways to me and I could see him perfectly well"—he said he was kicked on the ground by some other person—he then became unconscious shortly after and had to be conveyed away to the hospital—when he gave his evidence he was quite clear, but faint.</p>

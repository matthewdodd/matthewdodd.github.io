               <p>I was not at home when my house was broke open; I did not lodge in that house at the time; there was a young man in the care of it; I did not lodge there for some months.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you a bankrupt? - I was at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. This was your dwelling house? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you was in possession of these things? - I was, and am still.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Was not the messenger in possession? - He was always in possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Was He in possession under the commission of bankruptcy? - He was partly. But there was a bill of sale, and my brother bought these things in again, and gave them me.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the rent of the house at this time? - The assignees.</p>
               <p>Q. What before this house was broke open? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the assignment made at that time? - It was not; but the sale was, and the goods were bought in for me.</p>
               <p>Court. Who was the tenant of the house? - There was no other tenant but me; my brother was not tenant.</p>
               <p>Q. Under whose right was the man in possession? - He was my clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he keep possession for any body? - He kept possession for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was not employed by the persons for whom this bill of sale was made? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any assignees at the time? - There was. The man that they sent was out of possession long before this. I was in possession, and I employed this man to keep possession for me; I was not in the house, and all that I know is that the house was broke open, and the things taken away.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. How long had you been a bankrupt when this affair happened? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Q. How many examinations had you passed before the commissioners? - I had got my certificate signed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live in the house at the time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you ceased to live in the house? - Three months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay your rent yourself for that house? - No, I did not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110006"></xptr>Q. Who did the landlord of the house look to for the rent? - I suppose they looked to the assignees for the twelve months rent.</p>
               <p>Court. Who did he look to for the growing rent? - To me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mean to come and lodge in this house again? - I did; I am there at this time.</p>

               <p>I keep a shop in Ratcliff-highway. Mrs. Hawkins had this bed to sell in an open shop, and I went in and asked her the price; and she told me six and twenty shillings, and I bought it; she said it was her own. I knew her before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have known Mrs. Hawkins for some time before? - Yes; she keeps a shop.</p>
               <p>Q. This bed was exposed to sale in her shop, the same as her other goods? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been used to deal for beds before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. According to the value of that bed, was it a fair price that you gave for it? - I bought it for myself; I see the distress that she was in, and I gave her what she asked for it without any abatement. She has <rs id="t17930911-3-deflabel18" type="occupation">kept the shop</rs>

             and two others informed me of this robbery; I went and apprehended Young; I went after that to the house of Mr. Hawkins, he is clerk to Mr. Bryant; I found Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins both at home, I asked Mrs. Hawkins whether she had bought a bed? she denied it, she said, no, she had not. I had information at the same time of a shovel, a pair of tongs, and a hammer; and seeing the shovel by the fire side I took it into my possession: I then proceeded to search the house, I found two beds up stairs, I asked if either of those beds was the bed they bought of Young? she said that neither of them were: I was then proceeding to take Mr. Hawkins out of the house, and then she acknowledged that she had, in the absence of Mr. Hawkins, purchased a bed, this shovel, and a hammer, of two men that worked at the same wharf where her husband worked, and described them, but did not mention their names. I know her husband very well, I cannot say that he worked at that wharf.</p>

            . Do you know the wharf? - It is Kendall's Wharf; I don't know whether they worked at that Wharf.</p>
               <p>Court to Dennis. Do you know the Wharf where Hawkins worked? - No.</p>
               <p>Dawson. I went then to Mr. Mowen's and found the bed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. The husband was by all this time that you have been speaking of? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. He was apprehended on this business? - He was.</p>
               <p>Q. The husband is a good deal at home when he is away from his work? - He is. I always took him to be a very honest man.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other conversation with Hawkins besides this? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was nothing said by him upon this business? - No, only urging his wife to tell where the bed was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any promise held out to any of these prisoners, to induce them to say any thing? - I believe Mrs. Hawkins was told if she would produce the things she should be admitted as an evidence, but she never confessed any thing in consequence of that.</p>
               <p>Knapp to Bryant. Can you swear to the bed by any particular mark? - No.</p>
               <p>Dawson. It is necessary for me to mention that Bryant has said that he did not believe it was the bed, and his brother, and this lad said the same before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Court to Dennis. Did you ever say that it was done while you went to get a pint of beer for supper? - I went to get a pint of beer over the way, and when I came back all the things were in the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him bring the things out before you went for the pint of beer or after? - I went for my beer before I see them bring them out, and when I was coming back I tumbled over the bed.</p>
               <p>Court. You said just now that you saw the prisoner Young bring the bed out of the house, and you saw Bocock bring out a shovel and an iron hammer? - No, sir, I said, I saw them bring them on the wharf.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mechanical engineer, of 25, Falmouth Road, Southwark—I have known the prisoner twelve months—he was in the service of Messrs. Michelmore and Reap, engineers, of the Borough Road—they are manufacturers of hinges—I left them at the end of March—I have invented a hinge of a better character than any existing—this is it (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—I lodged to the Patent Office, on 11th April, a specification with respect to it—I paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—before 11th April I spoke to the prisoner about an idea I had which I would work out and show him—my brother showed him the model in my presence, on 8th April—I told him I should</p>

A., 25, Falmouth Road, Borough"—he said he had been round making people acquainted with the nature of the hinge, and that Mr. Mathews, engineer of the North London Railway had given orders to have them tried, and he would get a testimonial from him—he came to me on 18th July, and said they were to be fixed on the following Thursday—he came that day and received wages—he was my servant as a traveller—I paid him a percentage—I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all, for the hinges he sold for me—he came on the Wednesday following, and said the hinges could not be fixed as Mr. Mathews was going into the country—I went to the North London Rail<lb></lb>way and saw Boyell there—I made inquiries at the station—I saw one of my hinges fixed without the top plate to it—I saw the prisoner on the following Saturday—I told him I wanted an explanation, as he had not come to me by appointment—he said "I want an explanation of yours"—he told me the patent was not mine, that I should not have it—he said he had been to the country that week and ordered 1000—I said I would prevent his receiving one of them—I used to meet him in coffee-houses, and talk of other hinges—I have a drawing of a design of his.</p>

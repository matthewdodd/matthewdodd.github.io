               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Kendall; this truss of hay was kept in a loft over the stable in <placeName id="t17940430-96-crimeloc525">Great Portland-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take it? - Yes, about a quarter before four in the morning; it was taken out of my master's yard in the <placeName id="t17940430-96-crimeloc526">New Road</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17940430-96-crimeloc526" type="placeName" value="New Road"></interp>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him when he did this? - No, I did not; he was a <rs id="t17940430-96-deflabel527" type="occupation">carter</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17940430-96-defend971 t17940430-96-deflabel527"></join>, and he was going for a load of turnips, I knew him, he was a servant to Mr. Kendall.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any use have been made of it for the purpose of his master? - Not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this, where he threw it down, from your master's place? - Pretty nigh an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not put there for any purpose that related to his master? - It was not for my master's use, I am certain of that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300154"></xptr>Q.When did you first tell the prisoner of it? - Not till he was taken the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not stop him at the time? Why was not he taken up before? did he continue in the service? - I waited to see who took the hay, I stopped there and let him go for his load of turnips; I stopped there from about a quarter before four, till a quarter past six in the morning, and I kept walking backwards and forwards to see whether any body would come, and I happened to see one of my fellow servants, and I called him, and he came; and just before we got within two or three yards of the door, I saw this Shaw come and take this truss of hay in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr. Shaw put it in this place? - I did not see him take it into the stable; at the time I called my fellow servant, the man came out and it was gone; and I went and I said to Mr. Shaw, that truss of hay that you have got here on your premises, belongs to Mr. Kendall. He did not say a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go on his premises, and see whether the hay was there? - I never see the hay since; the prisoner was taken up the next morning after.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you charge the prisoner with it? - No, I did not; my master charged him with it; he did not say one word, but only asked what is the matter? what have I done?</p>
               <p>Q. To Kendall. I suppose you have never seen this hay since? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what quantity of hay was in your stable, so that you could say what was missing? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was up that morning just as the clock went two; I went down to my stable about ten minutes after two, and fed my horses the same as usual; and I never went out of the yard till the clock struck four, then I was getting my horses out as the clock struck, and I went out for my load of turnips as usual.</p>
               <p>Kendall. He has lived with me as a weekly servant near three years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you impute any thing to him before this? - I should not have kept him if I had not thought he had been very honest; every man I keep I hope they are honest till I find them otherwise.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Jury to Morley. Had there been any dispute between you and the prisoner? - Always very good friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever lent Mr. Shaw any hay, or Mr. Shaw lent your master any? - No, never.</p>

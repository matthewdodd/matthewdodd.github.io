               <p>Isabella Field. I went out early one morning, and the Prisoner desired me to come and see her room, and there were her and her husband; said she, what will you give us? I said I cannot stay: but I gave her some half-pence to get some liquor. I had my master's silver buckles in my pocket, a silver shilling and a silver six-pence.</p>

               <p>Field. His name is

            . If your Lord-ship pleases I'll tell you the story from the beginning to the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the Prisoner's room?</p>
               <p>Field. There she stands</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the room?</p>
               <p>Field. It is in Shoreditch .</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know the Prisoner took them?</p>
               <p>Field. Because there was no body there but her husband and herself. She called her husband to kiss her, and then she stopped the money into his hand. She said, my dear , buss me; and he said he did not want any of her bussing</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had the buckles in your pocket when you went into the room?</p>
               <p>Field . I am sure I had them in my pocket when I gave her the half pence to buy the liquor. I cannot say but I fell asleep, for I was a little vexed in my mind .</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think the buckles were taken from you when you was asleep?</p>
               <p>Field. I don't know but they might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Field. I knew her by seeing her in the street, but I never was in her room before .</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go for then?</p>
               <p>Field. Because she pulled me down the alley.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met her in Shoreditch with a bloody apron and handkerchief. She had been fighting, and I advised her to go home, but she went with me to my lodging. We had two or three drams, and I fell down to sleep, but whether she had the buckles with her, or whether she was awake or asleep I can't tell .</p>
               <p>Q. What is her master?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He keeps a lodging house for all sorts of people. <rs id="t17450911-17-verdict86" type="verdictDescription">

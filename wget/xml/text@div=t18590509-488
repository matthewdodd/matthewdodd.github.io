                  </hi>. I keep an oil and colour shop at 173, Bethnal-green Road—on Sunday, 27th March, I was up stairs dressing; my wife brought me a shilling, which I found to be bad—I went down and saw Davis in the shop—my wife said in her presence that she had tendered that shilling for some soap—I said, "How many more of this sort have you got about you?" she said, "None, I should hope," showing her purse, with about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth</p>

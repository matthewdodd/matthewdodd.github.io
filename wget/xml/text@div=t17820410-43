               <p>Mr. DEACON sworn.</p>
               <p>On Wednesday evening last, about six, I was settling my accounts for that day, in Messrs. Boldero's shop, when the prisoner came in and asked me where Smith, Wright, and Gray lived, I told him No. 21, in Lombard-street, he then put his hand on this bag, which was lying on the counter with many bags of gold, and took it off the counter and ran out of the shop, I immediately jumped over the counter as well as I could, and called, stop thief, I pursued, him down Princes-street, he turned into a court which leads to Lothbury, instead of pursuing him in the court, as several were after him there, I ran to catch him as he came out of the court, I presently saw him seized in Lothbury, I did not see him throw down the bag, he had it not when I saw him seized, I found the bag at our shop when I came back, one of the clerks brought it, I staid to collect part of the silver which had fallen in the street, I do not know who brought the bag back; I picked up about seven or eight shillings, I cannot tell, I put it to the remainder, and found when I counted it, six-pence deficient: the sum I had counted it for was 7 l. 17 s. 6 d. when I counted it a second time, it was 7 l. 17 s. I then put a seal on the bag.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any mark on the bag that enables you to know it was the same bag? - I used it every evening these six months.</p>
               <p>Court. It is a common bag? - Not very common, here are some stripes in it which make it very particular.</p>
               <p>(The bag handed up.)</p>
               <p>Court. No, it is not a very common one, are you sure it is the bag that was lost off the counter? - Certainly, my Lord, quite sure, no doubt at all; I sealed it immediately after, it has been in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday as I came to our house Messrs.

               <p>On the 10th inst. I was going to the mansion house in Lothbury, I heard stop thief, I saw the prisoner coming out, and the mouth of the bag must be downward, for he scattered the money out before he let the bag drop. I took him to the compter, he said it was his first fact, and he said he was a waiter at the Antigallican.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I never did any thing of the kind before, and I hope, my lord, and the gentlemen will do the best they can for me, and Mr. Fountain whom I lived with between five and six months, and Mr. Best that is now here, whom I lived with upwards of two years, will speak for me, I have been intrusted with some hundreds, and I may say a thousand or more; I have been out of employment ever since Christmas, and I have a wife and two children at home, and therefore, my being out of employ, and making away with every thing, I did not know of doing the thing half an hour before I did it; at the time I did it I was not in my senses.</p>

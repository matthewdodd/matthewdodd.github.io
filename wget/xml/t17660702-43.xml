            . Yesterday was a week I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; the prisoner had lodged at my house about a week; he came in at about seven at night, and went, as I thought, up to bed; I went to bed soon after. The next morning, at one o'clock, the watchman came and knocked at my chamber-door, and said my street-door was open; I concluded some lodger had gone out and left it open; I desired the watchman to shut it after him; I still continued in bed. In the morning, the young man that lodged with the prisoner, came and asked me if I had seen him; saying, he is gone, and has stole my coat and a pair of shoes. I then went down into the bar, and missed my tea-chest; I sent for a constable, and went in quest of the prisoner; we found him; he owned to the taking the things, and had the spoons in his pocket: (produced and deposed to.)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pianoforte-maker, and live in Westbourne-tenace, Bayswater, in the parish of Paddington. On Thursday afternoon, the 29th of November, I saw my property safe about four o'clock, and missed it between five and six o'clock, from a room in my dwelling-house, <hi rend="smallCaps">FREDERICK WILLIAM TAYLOK</hi>. I live in Pickering-place, and work for Mr. Pocock. On the evening of the 29th of November I was in his kitchen—I went up into the parlour, and saw some one jump out of the window—the sash had apparently been down before I entered the room—it was thrown up as I entered, and somebody escaped out of it into the garden—I looked out, and saw the prisoner Richardson, with a bundle of clothes under his arm—I called "Stop thief," came out, and ran after him—there was another boy running a-head of him, who appeared like the other prisoner-Richardson was stopped, and taken back to Mr. Pocock's—he objected a little to going back, and said he did not know what he was taken in charge for—that he was running after three other persons</p>

               <p>who were running in the same direction, and was about catching them for me—a gentleman picked up a hat, and gave it to me—it was mine, and had been in the cupboard in Mr. Pocock's parlour, in the same room, the window of which was thrown up—I had left it there on the Sunday pre<lb></lb>vious—I found an umbrella-stick in the garden, placed close to the front gate-Johnson was asked if it belonged to him, and he made a bow.</p>

I am a carpenter, and live in Pickering-place, Between five and six o'clock, on the 29th of November, I saw both the prisoners running, within about thirty yards of Mr. Pocock's house—they were both together, and running in a direction from the house-Johnson was a little a-head—there was no one before them—they passed me—Richardson was stopped by a groom in a gentleman's gateway—I overtook Johnson in Elms-lane—I told him he must come with me—he objected, and asked what I was taking him for—I told him "Stop thief" was cried, and he must come back and answer for himself—he appeared winded, and I should think he was run out.</p>

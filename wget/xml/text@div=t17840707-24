               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, this offence is made capital by an act of parliament; to take a false oath in order to obtain letters of administration to receive any wages or prize money due to seamen; and by which act of parliament you see that which before was but a perjury, that particular species of perjury is converted into a particular felony; but it is incumbent on the Prosecutor to fit the law exactly to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070048"></xptr> fact, and to prove every circumstance which is necessary to bring it within that law, by a clear, precise, and exact evidence, and by the best evidence; now in this case the very jutt of the crime is taking a false oath; and I never remember any instance in fact, where an indictment for perjury has been supported without direct and positive proof that the party took the oath, or where any attempt has been made to supply the defect of proof, in that circumstance by the supply of other proof from which it might be probably inferred; now in this case there certainly is no direct express evidence that the prisoner ever took the oath in question, there is circumstantial evidence; the fact of taking the oath requires distinct proof as well as that of the execution of the bond, and Mr. Shepherd's memory not serving as to the person that took the oath, and Dr. Harris not being here, there is no direct proof of it, and there is a possibility certainly that the prisoner might go through all the rest of the fraud, and avoid the circumstance of taking the oath, supposing he knew the taking the oath was a capital felony; if this was an indictment for perjury, and the evidence was to stand as it does now, I should be of opinion that they were bound to give precise and positive proof, that the prisoner was the person that took the oath; the part where the proof is defective, is the very point on which the indictment turns.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. I wish this case might be reserved.</p>
               <p>Court. There is nothing to save.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. It is matter of law whether the evidence is sufficient.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, if you are satisfied notwithstanding the observations I have stated, that the evidence is sufficient to prove that this man actually took the oath, in that case you will find him guilty; but I am of opinion that unless it is clearly proved he took the oath, you ought to acquit him.</p>

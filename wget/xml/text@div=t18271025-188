            . I am a watchman, and live in Swan-yard, Shoreditch. On the 1st of October, at nine o'clock at night, I met a man in Dorkin's-court, Shoreditch, with two bolts of canvass; this was two miles from Dunbar's - I watched the man into the prisoner's house with it, but I do not believe the prisoner is the man who carried it - I fetched the officer, and we waited some time- we saw a light in the cellar, and I saw the prisoner there; before I went for the officer I saw two persons leave the house, and go round by the coach-yard - the prisoner was not one of them.</p>

            . I am a constable, I met the prisoner coming out; I took him into his own room, and said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182710250077"></xptr>"Have you not had some goods moved in here to night?" he said No - I said, "I think you have" - I took him to the cellar, and told him to open the door; he said he could not - I said I would break it open; he then took a key off a ledge, and opened it, and we there found the canvass.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DUNBAR, JUN. This property is mine; my warehouse had been broken open that evening; the prisoner is the father-in-law of a discharged servant of mine, named Batchelor, who has absconded.</p>

            . I am a carman. I carted these goods by Batchelor's order; he came to my master's yard, and ordered a cart; I went with it to Mr. Dunbar's, and carted away twenty bolts of canvas - this is part of it; I took them first to Mile-end, and then to Shoreditch church, close against the bar, where they were unloaded; they were taken away by three men, and I am sure the prisoner was one of them; I do not know that I had seen him before; each took a load from the cart, and returned for another till they had unloaded it; the prisoner did not assist in loading at the warehouse; Batchelor and another did that.</p>

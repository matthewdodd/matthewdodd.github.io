               <p>EMANUEL MOSES. The prisoner was employed by me at times, and on the 27th of December I sent him to Edwards' auction-room, Vere-street, Clare-market, to fetch these goods, which I had bought on the 26th; I waited at the auction-room for him, but he did not come; I wrapped them in a carpet, and left word for them to deliver them to him if he came - I saw him afterwards, and he said he had not been able to go; I told him to go next day.</p>

            . I am a coachman. On the 27th of December the prisoner hired me at the corner of Dean-street, Tooley-street; he put these things into the coach at the King's Head public-house, to go to Petticoat-lane - when we got there he said he did not know where to go; I thought he was to meet a person there to buy the things - he then told me to drive to Tooley-street again, and when I was in Whitechapel it was between eleven and twelve o'clock at night; I did not know the turning, and asked the watchman the way - the prisoenr told me to go on to Cornhill, and there a man spoke to the prisoner, and got in - they ordered me back to Aldgate again - they got out there, and told me to wait; and in a few minutes a man came, and told me the goods were stolen; the prisoner came up - I asked him about them - he said they were his master's; I told an officer, who took us all to the watch-house.</p>

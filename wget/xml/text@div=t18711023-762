                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Q</hi> 68). On 21st September, I was on duty in New North Street, Shoreditch, about 1.45, and saw the prisoner raise up the window of 5, New North Street, put his hand in, and take some things out, which fell on the floor—he moved about three houses down, looked about him, returned, and put his hand in a second time, and brought out some more things—he put them in a bundle, on his shoulder, and walked off—I crossed the road, and met him—he turned round, and went back—I followed him, and asked him what he had got—he said some things belong<lb></lb>ing to his wife—I asked him where his wife lived—he said "85, Whitecross Street"—I took him to the station, and found on him a pawn ticket for a suit of clothes—he dropped this counterfeit coin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I picked up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my husband, at 5, New North Street—we occupy the front parlour—on 20th September, when I went to bed, the window was closed, and these things were lying under it—I slept in the room, but I was not disturbed—I knew nothing till the constable came—these things belong to me—they are worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

"They were then in a door way. He told the Magistrate next morning that he had been to my house, and could not find it out. As soon as I was remanded he went to my wife and sister, and told them I was charged with burglary, and that a lot of bad money fell out of the bundle. She said "You must have known that it was a made-up thing, if you leave your windows open. It has pressed upon my wife, and taken her reason away. The Rev. Dr. Cox said that he would appear for me, and he has been here all the week. It is all made up by the policeman, because a robbery had been committed on his beat, and he thought he would put it on me. My word is as good as his; he deserves to be in my place. I have a blind mother, and a wife and child. My master is Mr. Chamberlain, a carpenter. If I can raise a little money when I go out, I will try and show you that I am speaking the truth.</p>

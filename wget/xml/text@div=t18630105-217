                  </hi>. About a quarter to 10, on 12th December, I was in Holborn, coming towards Gray's-inn-lane—I had a lady on my arm—I Saw a party of about four or five standing, some on one side of the walk and some against a building—they surrounded me and my friend—one of them sang out "Break," and about a second afterwards, the prisoner came and looked me in the face and said, "Have you money?"—I made no reply—the expression startled me so, that I jumped away from my friend, and then another man came between us, and put his hand in my breast-pocket, snatched my watch from me, and broke the chain and they went down Holborn, and turned into Fox-court—I saw which way he went, and tried to follow him, but was prevented by the prisoner—he got before me, and tried to bother my progress—he was doing that about four or five minutes, as near as I can say—I called out to my friend, and said the man had stolen my watch—I lost the man and the watch—I did not take the prisoner—I gave a description of the men, as near as I could, to a policeman, I think on the same evening, at the station—I had an opportunity of seeing the prisoner's face; he looked in my face when he made use of that expression—I did not see his face after that—I recognised his person after that; he had his back towards me, and pushed against me—I am sure it was the same man; he had not moved two paces—the only thing I heard him say was "Have you money?"—I did not see him again till the following Tuesday—the 12th December was on Friday, and I saw him the following Tuesday—he was</p>

               <p>in a room at Clerkenwell Police-station, with several other persons—I picked him out immediately I entered the room—I heard him speak at the police-court, and recognised his voice—I have no doubt about him.</p>

I received a description of the persons who robbed the prosecutor, from the inspector at the police-station, and in consequence of that I apprehended the prisoner, and took him to the station—he was put amongst a charge of persons who came in at the time—I dare say there were a dozen; the passage was quite full; and the prosecutor picked him out from them—I told him the charge, and he said he knew nothing about it.</p>

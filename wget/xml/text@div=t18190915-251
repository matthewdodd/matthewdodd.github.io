On the 4th of September Dunton came and asked if I had a chariot to let? - I knew him before - I said we had. He said he knew a gentleman who wanted one for four months; I told him it would be eight guineas a month. He said it would be wanted to go into the City every day, for the gentleman had something to do at the Bank. He went away, and came again about four o'clock in the afternoon - he asked if he could have the carriage sent by six o'clock that evening, as the gentleman had a brother very ill at Brighton, and wanted to go down that evening. I said I would get it ready, and asked what name I should book it to? he said to Mr. Concannon. He did not come until about seven o'clock next morning, I then saw the carriage going out of the yard, but did not see the person who came for it. On the Thursday following I saw it in North Harley-mews, in possession of Gregory - it is worth 50 l.</p>

            . I am a coachman out of place, and live in North Harley-mews. I promiscuously went into Chandler's livery-stables, in Great York-mews, to inquire for a place, Dunton and another man were waiting there, I said I had tried to get a hackney-coach - Dunton said,</p>
               <p>"Do you want to buy a good chariot?" I said I would rather have a coach. He said,</p>
               <p>"Master is going abroad, and this will be sold very cheap;" I said I would look at it. He said,</p>
               <p>"If you will wait till I take the horse to the door I will shew it to you. I followed him with the horse<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181909150078"></xptr>to No. 9, York-street, a gentleman came out and rode the horse. Dunton then took me to Dorset-mews, and there showed me the chariot, it was then three o'clock - he asked 30 l. for it, I offered 25 l. - he at last agreed to take it, saying that was the money his master told him to take, but if he could have got more for himself it would have been better. I said I would leave it there until Monday; he said he would take home the key of the stable, and then come back, which he did in a few minutes. I got Hill's horse, and took the chariot to my place - I paid him 25 l. for it. Mr. Taylor afterwards saw and claimed it. I saw nothing of Fitt.</p>

At half-past two o'clock that day Gregory came to look at it - I lent him a horse to take it away. When Dunton brought the carriage Fitt was with him, he said nothing about it.

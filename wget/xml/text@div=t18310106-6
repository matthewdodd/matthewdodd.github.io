On the night of the 21st of December, the prisoner, who slept on the premises during the winter, came in before ten o'clock, as usual; he sat down in the kitchen some time, talking about the fires in the country, and in about a quarter of an hour went up to bed - he came down in about ten minutes after, and asked if there was any body sleeping in the room opposite to his, as he saw a light through the key-hole; we told him there was nobody, but wished him to go into the garden, to see if there was a light from the window; he went, returned, and said there was no light, but he heard somebody rush across the garden - that alarmed us very much: we wished him to call in Hill; when Hill came they went up stairs together - they returned together, and said the door was locked (and the key taken away;) they fetched one of the night Police - they could not force the door open, and got a carpenter, who forced it with a crow-bar; I went up into the prisoner's room, and found my box, which was locked, and the key in my pocket, but the hinges, which are leather, were cut, and the box opened; it always stood in the prisoner's room - I had not seen it since the Wednesday before - this was Tuesday: the prisoner has slept in the house the two last witness - I saw a bag brought into the house; it contained my mistress' property, and some of mine: the house was all closed before five o'clock that evening - every window was closed, and the door double locked; only me and mistress were in the house; neither of us had been out all day - it was a damp evening; I do not know whether it rained - I went out next morning; the earth was damp, but I do not recollect rain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. The prisoner remained in the house all that night? A. He did; he was up stairs for ten or fifteen minutes before he came down - I only know that because he was in the house before ten o'clock, and he fetched Hill before half-past ten; I had been in his room about half-past nine that night, but I had not been into the opposite room since Sunday - I locked the door on the Monday morning as the wind blew, and left the key in the door; it is a very strong door, it is the attic.</p>
               <p>MR. STURGEON. Q. You went into his room at half-past nine o'clock? A. Yes, to turn his bed down; I went out again, and saw nothing more than usual - I locked the door on the landing side.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would the door lock on both sides? A. Yes; I slept in mistress' room on the first floor; the two rooms are on the second floor - nobody slept in the other room on the first floor; the prisoner works out in the day time, and sleeps at the house in the winter, for protection.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Tottenham. On the night of the 21st of December, a few minutes before eleven o'clock, the prisoner and William Hill knocked at my door, and told me there was somebody in Mrs. Waldron's house, and asked me to come and break the door open; I went up stairs - one of the night-constables was up stairs, on the landing-place, with a poker in his hand; the Policeman assisted me in opening the door of the attic - I found the bottom sash up; I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of the sash being up - he said No; we looked round the room, and saw a socket chisel, a small screw-driver, and a small bit of candle - I saw them found by the prisoner and Hill, and there was a razor in a chair behind the door, on the right-hand; I saw a cord hanging out of the window, and a pair of cart or chaise reins attached to the end of it - we searched the other rooms up stairs, but found nothing; we then went on the roof - the prisoner and Hill went on the roof, through the trap-door in the ceiling, which slides back; the prisoner then unbolted the door in the roof leading on to the gutter - we searched the roof, saw nobody there, and came down; the prisoner and I went round the house into the garden - I saw something laying there, and the prisoner said it was a sack; I said, "Yes, it is, and something in it;" I took it into the kitchen, and the property in it was claimed by the servant and her mistress - the trap-door was bolted inside the roof; it is above the ceiling and leads to the gutter - the one in the ceiling was slipped half way back; nobody could have got out on the roof, and then bolted the door - the reins were tied to the window with a kind of single slip noose at each end; I cannot say whether they were drawn tight - the reins hung eleven feet from the ground; there was a pear tree between them and the ground - the ground under the window appeared fresh; I did not observe any foot-marks - I found in the room a chisel, a screw-driver, and a piece of candle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had the window any fastening? A. None - it is about five feet high, and would stand open about half that height; the pear tree would not hinder a man from getting down if the reins were sufficient to carry him down.</p>
               <p>MR. STURGEON. Q. Could a man have got up to the window from outside, without a rope? A. No - he could not have got down from the pear tree without my observing the branches being disturbed; there is another window between the pear tree and that window.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What became of the candle? A. Griffiths, the officer, took it away - I did not observe whether it had been lighted.</p>

            . I am constable of Tottenham. On the night of the 21st of December I received information that Mrs. Waldron's house had been robbed; I immediately went there - it was about ten minutes before twelve o'clock; I went into the kitchen, and saw the bag containing a number of articles, a pair of reins, a chisel, a piece of candle, a screw-driver, and a razor - I examined the house; the lower part was all secure; I went up to the attic - I observed the door forced open; the window was half open - I looked out of window, saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183101060009"></xptr>distance, and consider that no man could make his escape out that way; I went into the next room, saw two large boxes open, and a small trunk which had leather hinges - they appeared to have been cut with some sharp instrument; one of the hinges was visible outside the trunk, as a piece of paper was torn off - I went down into the kitchen, and questioned the prisoner in what manner the party could have made their entrance; he said, "Why jem, I will show you;" I then went out to the back part of the house with him - he said they must first get on the roof of the wash-house, from there to the roof of the kitchen, and then to the roof of the house, and must have come in at the trap-door; I searched the premises to see if there was a ladder, but found none - I examined the trap-door; I went into the kitchen again with him, and asked him to go up stairs and tie the rope in the way he had found it - he went up for that purpose, but I did not go with him; I and Flack took a lantern into the garden, went under the window, and the rope was thrown out; when he hung it out, I could reach up and touch the end of the reins, which were fastened to the rope by tying a noose of the rope to the buckle part of the reins, and there is a noose in the reins - it was not drawn tight; if a man had lowered himself down by them he certainly must have drawn them tight - it was rather a damp night; there was not the least sign of foot-marks on the ground- I have had the reins in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you first see the rope? A. In the kitchen - I do not know what alteration might have taken place in it; I was in and out of the house all night - I left the prisoner in the house, with Mrs. Waldron and the servant; there was nothing to prevent his running away - I have known him five years, and never heard any thing against him; I searched him about eight o'clock in the morning - I did not intimate that I suspected him before that; I certainly said I did not believe any body could get in the way described - there is a society at Tottenham, which offers a reward on apprehension of felons; it is not paid before trial - the amount is according to what they please to give, there is no fixed reward now; the prisoner was not apprehended for the sake of the reward; as I apprehended him I expect to have the reward - I never knew a reward given on an acquittal.</p>
               <p>MR. STURGEON. Q. Did you search the prisoner's lodging? A. Yes, twice - I found nothing of the prosecutrix's there; I examined the harness in his cart-shed- it appeared to be perfect, except a collar and a pair of reins; I then went to him in the watch-house, and asked if his harness was complete - he said No, there was no reins, for he had lent them to a man named Boreham; I sent for Boreham, and afterwards told the prisoner Boreham said he had never borrowed them of him - he repeated that he had lent them to Boreham.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Can you swear the reins belonged to a particular harness? A. No - the collar has not been found.</p>

On the 21st of December Hill called me out of bed - I went with him to Mrs. Waldron's; I saw the prisoner, Mrs. Waldron, and her servant, standing in the kitchen - I asked the prisoner what was the matter; he said there was somebody fastened in the room up stairs -I went up to the door of the second floor room with him; I found it fastened - I tried to break it open with my feet, but could not, and shortly after Flight came with an iron bar, and broke it open: we both went in together - Flight said to the prisoner, "There is that window glass, do you know any thing about it?" he said he did not - the prisoner passed me on the left hand, went to a table near the window, and said, "There has been some one here, for here are their tools;" I went to look at them, and saw a rusty socket chisel, a small screw-driver, and a piece of candle - I did not examine the candle; the prisoner went a little further to the window, which was up, and said,"Here is a rope where they must have made their escape out of window;" the rope was fastened to the foot of the bedstead, which stood up against the wall, the bottom of it within four or five inches of the window - the bedstead did not appear to have been moved - the prisoner went round the room with me, and said, "Here is a razor;" we searched the room every where we could conceive a person could be concealed, but found nobody- I and Flight pulled the rope up - the reins were fastened to the end of it by the buckle; I left the room with the prisoner, and went to the sliding trap door, and along the roof to another small door, which leads to the parapet - it was bolted inside; the prisoner pulled the bolt back, the door then gave a swing as if the bottom hinge was broken - there was no means of unbolting it outside; the prisoner then took the light from me, and went all over the loft - we then went down into the kitchen; I told the prisoner and Flight they had better go and search the outer places, as they knew them better than me; Flight returned with a bag, and said to me, "You said they had got nothing out, but look here;" I opened the bag, the servant looked in, and found her stockings and a silk dress of her mistress' in it - she then shook the contents out: I did not go into the garden.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know what weather it was? A. I believe rather foggy and damp - I do not think the ground was frozen there, it being so close to the wall; I have known the prisoner twenty years, and never heard any thing against him - I left the house between eleven and twelve o'clock, left Flight there, and sent Griffiths there.</p>

The prisoner has dealt with me for the last seven years; I occasionally lent him a bag, as I do other customers - he is a gardener, and keeps a little shop at Tottenham; I have perhaps lent him a bag ten or twelve times within the last three years, but not within the last eight or ten months, to my knowledge - the last goods he had were in a barrel; I cannot say I lent him this bag - there were a quantity of bags sold at a sale seventeen or eighteen months ago: I bought ten or fifteen of them - I believe they were all marked in this way.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live at Tottenham. On the night of the 21st of December I lost no property but what was found in the bag - this property is mine; I had seen it on the Wednesday before the robbery, which was on Tuesday - it was kept in a wooden box in the prisoner's room; I have employed him one day in the week for the last seven years, to garden for me - this is the second winter he has slept in my house, for protection; I was much alarmed on the night of the 21st, at seeing him come down into the kitchen, half undressed, as my servant has stated; the clock struck ten a few minutes after he came in, and he went up stairs about ten minutes after that; in ten or fifteen minutes he came down, opened the kitchen door, and asked if there was any body in the room opposite to his - we said No; he said there was a light in the room - I did not go up: I was so alarmed I fastened myself into the kitchen - the value of my things is 2l. 14s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long did the men who afterwards came to the house remain? A. I cannot say, I was so alarmed; I sat up all night - they all went away except the prisoner at last; the prisoner, I, and the servant were alone in the house, the morning part, and he remained there - my servant had been baking that day, and I had been making tarts; I was sometimes in the parlour, and sometimes in the kitchen - I was in the kitchen till five o'clock; I think it was not quite dark then: my doors were shut at five - nobody could have entered at the lower part of the house, I am certain.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the prisoner been in your house since the morning? A. Not to my knowledge - he was not at work there that day; there is another garden at the back of mine - a person could get over into that and get away: I have never found the key of the room - I saw it in the door on Sunday; the sack was found near the house - I had not been in the garden all day; the prisoner sat up in the kitchen with us all night - I do not know when he was told he was suspected; I was very ill in the morning, and went to bed.</p>
               <p>SARAH STRACEY. I lost the articles which are here that night; also a 5l. note and six sovereigns, which have not been found - the money was in a small box in the same box as these things were taken from; I saw the money there on the Wednesday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you speak to the exact amount of money? A. I am certain there was a 5l. note and six sovereigns; there might have been more sovereigns - my box was not quite emptied - the things were turned upside down: the window is twenty-six feet from the ground; we could not hear a noise up stairs - mistress was in the kitchen when the prisoner alarmed us; we had no clock, but the church clock struck ten - the small box was left, and the money taken out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You had gone into the room about half-past nine o'clock that night? A. Yes, to turn the prisoner's bed down; I saw nothing amiss then - I went into his room after the money was found; the box then stood in its place, and was locked, but finding these things, which I knew had been in it, I examined, and found the lid cut, and the property gone; my mistress' things were in a wooden box, which the key was always left in - if the box had been cut, and the property taken before half-past nine o'clock, I should not have observed it; the room remained the same, except that a large leather box was open, which I did not observe at half-past nine, but it might have been so then - it is very improbable that I should not see it; I had not been into the garden all day; the front door had not been opened all day, except by the prisoner when he went out in the morning; a person to have gone up stairs must have come through the kitchen where I was to go out at the back; I had been all day in the kitchen, baking - the prisoner remained in the kitchen with us all night: he had gone up and dressed himself after the witnesses had been - he left our house in the morning with the constable, between nine and eleven o'clock; I think he remained in the kitchen with us till half-past seven o'clock in the morning, when mistress went to bed, and he still remained about the house - the constable came between eight and nine; the leather trunk contained curtains - nothing was taken out of that.</p>

            . I searched the prisoner at eight o'clock - I had been in and out of the house several times during the night; the prisoner was there all that time - I first told him I suspected him about eight o'clock, and searched him; he said, "You are very welcome, Jem" - I found a small quantity of gunpowder and some tinder on him, a few halfpence, but no other money: I detained him- he might have gone where he pleased during the whole night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As to the powder, it is what I charged the pistol with on the night of the robbery - I used to keep powder and shot in the room in case it was required - the tinder I am in the habit of using to light green-house fires.</p>

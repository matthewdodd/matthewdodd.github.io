Hall the Chairman depos'd thus. I have known the Prisoner these 13 or 14 Years. He clapp'd a Pistol to me, and bade me Stand. I set down the Chair. There was another Rogue with him. My Partner was going to draw the Poles to take them a knock or two; but the Prisoner's Companion perceiv'd it, and stood over him with a Pistol. The Prisoner in his Defence said, that when he was carried before the Justice, the Chairman said that he could not Swear that the Prisoner was the Man, though he Swore it the next Morning. The Chairman acknowledged this to be true, but said that he refus'd to Swear, only because he was a poor Man, and was afraid that he should lose his Time, and be at some Charges in the Prosecution. On the 2d Indictment it appear'd, that about Midnight the Prisoner and 3 or 4 more pickt a Quarrel with the Prosecutor in the Hay Market, upon which they fell to Fighting, and in the Fray Prosecutor lost his Money.

             thus depos'd On Saturday Night my Master (Mr. Reith a Watch-maker,) sent me with his Wig to the Barber's. As I was going along Pall-mall the Prisoner hipp'd after me. I came to him, and another Man was with him. The Prisoner took a Letter out of his Pocket, and desir'd me to carry it for him to Mr. Smith. I went to enquire for the Gentleman at 2 or 3 Chocolate Houses, but not meeting with him, the Prisoner at last sent me to the Gentlemans own House in George Street. - I gave the Letter, to the Maid, and she to Mr. Smith. He call'd me in, read the Letter and asked me if I knew what I had done. I told him I knew of no harm. Why, says he, here's a Fellow threatens to Shoot me the first time he meets me, if I don't send him 20 Guineas by the Bearer. The Letter was produced in Court by Mr. Smith, who Swore that he receiv'd it of the Maid. She Swore that she had it from the Boy, and the Boy Swore that it was the same that he receiv'd from the Prisoner. It was read in Court, and the Contents follow.</p>

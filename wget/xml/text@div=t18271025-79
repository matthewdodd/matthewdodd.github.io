            . On the 27th of August I saw the prisoner come out of the yard, with a collar; he went down Brokers'-row, and returned in three minutes, without it; he worked till eight o'clock next day, and left without notice - I told the foreman of it, but he expected his master home, and did not take him. I knew the collar, as I had worked there once - I had two horses to mind, or I should have taken him; he knew me well, but took it out publicly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. That young man went away ill, and I took his situation; the foreman and him were drinking for three or four hours together, leaving me at work; I complained to the foreman about it - he said he would discharge me - I said I should discharge myself, and get work before the winter came on. I was taken before the Magistrate, and acquitted - he said he would prosecute if it cost him 50l.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Foster, a surgeon, of Mount<lb></lb>place, Whitechapel. On the 19th of September the prisoner came to me, and wished me to come and visit his wife, who was very ill—I accordingly went to No. 4, Buck's-row, Whitechapel—I found a woman lying on a mattress, apparently in a state of insensibility—the prisoner told me that she was a sober woman—I inquired if she had received any blow on her head—he said she had about a month ago, that he had struck her, and pointed to a mark on her left temple, which had healed—I do not think he described how he had struck the blow—he first said she had been in that insensible state from the morning—he afterwards said she had been in the hospital about a fortnight before—he said that the persons at the hospital told her she talked too fast, and he said that she did talk too fast—I inquired as to her health, and found it had been bad since the blow—I tried to arouse her—she threw her arms about, and tried to blow out the candle, and spit at me—she was exactly like a person out of her mind, or as if she had been drunk—that is sometimes a symptom of com<lb></lb>pression of the brain—I acquainted Hughes, the relieving officer, of the</p>

               <p>circumstance—the prisoner first said he had inflicted the blow a month ago, and afterwards he said five or six weeks—she was removed to the workhouse that evening—she lived till about eight o'clock the following evening—it is usual for more serious symptoms to be exhibited some time after a blow is received, than at the moment—there was nothing in the nature of the blow to make it impossible that it was inflicted with a fist—a blow which only causes partial external injury will often produce great concussion of the brain, on the opposite side to which the blow was struck—I think her death might be attributed to a blow with a fist—she had some internal complaint besides, but that was not in a state of progress to have affected life at that time—where there is any thing weak in the con<lb></lb>stitution, it is apt to fly to the part where the blow is inflicted—the blow must have been violent to have produced the consequences.</p>

I apprehended the pri<lb></lb>soner on the 19th of September, and saw the deceased—I asked him how long it was since he struck her—he-said, "About six or seven weeks ago," and then he said, "Five or six weeks ago"—I asked him what he did it with—he said with his fist—on the way to the station he said, "I suppose I shall get a month or two"—as I was taking him to Lambeth-street next day, he said they had had a quarrel, that she bad aggravated him, and he bad struck her with his fist.</p>

On the 24th of July I saw the deceased standing at her window—she had a great deal of blood on her forehead, and appeared to have received a recent wound—I taxed the prisoner with having ill-used her—he told me to mind my own business—I told him I would not allow it—he said as long as he paid the rent he should do as he thought proper—I asked her, in his presence, how it happened—she said, "With his fist"—she repeated it, and he said if she aggravated him he would be her butcher—she got gradually heavy and stupid after that, and quite deaf—she complained of dizziness in her head, and never seemed to rally—at the end of the week the prisoner came home, and asked if I had seen his wife—I said I did not know that she was at home—he said yes, she was very bad with a fever—I asked him if it was catching—he said he did not know, he believed not—I said I wished to see her—he did not offer to let me do so—I went into the back yard, and saw her in at the window—I asked her if she had the fever or not—she said the prisoner knew what her fever was—she always abused me when I called to know how she was—she had not the command of her faculties.</p>

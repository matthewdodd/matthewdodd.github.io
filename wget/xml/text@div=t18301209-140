On the 19th of November, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came in for an ounce of coffee, which came to 2d.; I served him - he offered me 6d., and I gave him 4d. change; he took the coffee away; I put the sixpence into my desk - there was no other money by it; Fawcett, who was behind the counter with me, looked at it, and said it was bad - I then looked at it, found it was bad, wrapped it in a piece of paper, and put it into the till; there was no other money there in paper - I produce it, and am quite sure it is the same; next day, about twelve o'clock or a little after, he came for another ounce of coffee, and offered me a shilling - I looked at it, and found it was bad; I kept it, and sent for Kelly, an officer, who secured him - I asked where he got it; he said he got it in change of half a crown, at a public-house in Cornhill - I said I would go with him to the public-house, and if I found it true he should be discharged; he said if he went the people might not know him, and he would not go - I put the shilling into the paper with the sixpence; they have been kept separate from all other money ever since.</p>

I was present on the 19th of November, when Mr. Grayson took the sixpence from the prisoner, for an ounce of coffee - Grayson put it on the desk, and was going to put it into the till, but I looked at it, thought it bad, and mentioned it to him; he found it was bad, put it into a piece of paper, and into the back part of the till; I was present next day, when the prisoner came and offered the shilling - Grayson came round the counter, as if to tell me to get change, and sent me for an officer; I am certain of the prisoner's person.</p>

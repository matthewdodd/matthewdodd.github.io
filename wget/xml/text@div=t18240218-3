            . I am a clerk in the banking-house of Messrs. Hanbury and Co., Lombard-street. Messrs. Taylor and Lloyd of Birmingham had an account with our house, and make their notes payable there. On the 12th of December, 1821, we made up 4001 l. worth of their notes, which were principally for 5 l. each - they were in two parcels, which I made into one parcel, and delivered them to Sergeant, the guard of the Balloon coach, which runs to Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had the notes been paid - A. Yes, and were sent back to be re-issued.</p>

Taylor and Co., of Birmingham, to whom it was directed. I received the parcel about twelve o'clock at noon - the coach starts at a quarter to five. I put the parcel into a handkerchief, and went to the Magpie and Pewter Platter, public-house, Wood-street, where I lodged; I slept there that afternoon, and gave the parcel to Greeves, the landlord to take care of while I went to bed. I got up a little after three o'clock, asked him for the parcel, and he gave it to me in the same state as when I received it. I then took it in my hand to the Swan with Two Necks, Lad-lane, and put it inside at the bottom of the coach, which stood in the inn yard, by the tap-room window; this was about half-past three o'clock, and in less than five minutes I missed the parcel. I made enquiry for it, but to no purpose. I went and informed the bankers.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You knew what was in the parcel - A. I knew that it was valuable. I gave it to the landlord to take care of while I slept - it appeared in the same state when he returned it. I moved it from the bottom of the coach, and laid it on the seat with my coat over it, and considered it safe, as several people were about. I left it on the seat while I went into the office. I intended to put it into the boot, as it was too large for my pocket, and missed it immediately on coming out of the office. I was not absent above three minutes.</p>

I wrote to Mr. Payne, the keeper of Birmingham goal, and communicated to him what had passed, and in consequence of his direction, I saw the prisoner in December last. I had seen Mr. Bird, the solicitor, and both those gentlemen gave me instructions. Mr. Payne gave me money to make a purchase. I left Birmingham on the 14th of December, and came to the Three Crowns, public-house, City-road, on the 15th - I saw the prisoner near the Three Crowns about one o'clock, and agreed to take nine 5 l. notes of Messrs. Taylor and Lloyd's bank, for 10 l.; he was to bring them to me at the Three Crowns, about six o'clock that afternoon. I bought a crab for my dinner, and took it to the Three Crowns - some horse dealers were there, eating beef steaks. I remained there till half-past five o'clock, when the prisoner and Turnley came in; he said the notes were not ready, but would be ready by six, and at six they both came to the house - Crowder called me out - I found Turnley, Crowder, and

               <p>Q. What was Ward to give you money for - A. He was going to buy some notes as well as me. Ward was to have six notes, and I nine. Ward said he did not like to trust any one with his money. Ward, Turnley, and Crowder went round the corner together - I saw them again in about two minutes, altogether. Turnley pulled a lot of notes from his pocket, and counted them into Ward's hand, and said,</p>
               <p>"I think I have given you seven" - Ward said,</p>
               <p>"If you think so, count them over again," but he did not. Ward went away. Crowder said he thought Turnley had given him seven - Turnley then pulled some more notes from his pocket, and counted them into Crowder's hand, and said there was only eight; they were 5 l. notes. Crowder gave them to me, and said Ward had got one to many. Turnley was going away; I said,</p>
               <p>"Here is the money;" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, stop till I come back." When he was gone, Crowder took the notes out of my hand again, counted them, and said there was only eight. I said,</p>
               <p>"Will you have the money" - he said Yes, and I gave him the ten sovereigns, and said,</p>
               <p>"When shall I have the other note, I hope I shall get the other;" he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, you shall when he comes back." Turnley returned, and said to Crowder,</p>
               <p>"I will be d - d if there is not one wrong somewhere;" Crowder said,</p>
               <p>"Then Ward has got it;" and be would be d - d if he would not sooner be lagged (transported) than done out of one. I saw Ward afterwards; Crowder called him out of the Three Crowns, and said,</p>

             out; they had some words, and I went in and got half a pint of gin, and gave them a glass all round - they went into the parlour, and had a row there, but I went away. I had a glass of wine and water there, and asked for a biscuit; they had not got one, but brought me a slice of bread and butter. I asked for a bit of lemon, as Crowder told me to put a bit of lemon into the wine and water. I delivered the eight notes to Mr. Payne, having first marked them D. G., and informed Mr. Bird what had happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You have not told us what you are - A. A brass-founder by trade; I work for myself. I sell handkerchiefs and all kinds of goods at Norwich, I have not worked at my trade for three years, or longer. I was a journeyman brass-founder at Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you within the last four years worked as a brass-founder - A. Yes; it is four years as near as can be. When I left that trade I went to the coal work, for three or four months, and then got a hawker's licence, and continued at that till the licence was out. I took that licence out about fifteen months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were two years between that which you cannot account for - A. I was at Birmingham, and have done business for Mr. Payne, the keeper of the prison - I was employed for the Bank of England to detect forgeries. They thought me a kind of a sly chap, whom they could depend upon.</p>
               <p>Q. You understand the slang language very well - A. They all understand that at Birmingham; they are all fly there, and all know flash. I was employed by Mr. Payne for three or four months, and then lived on my money like a gentleman - I saved above 100 l. Mr. Redfearn has had 60 l. of mine, and Mr. Payne 20 l.; that was three years ago. Redfearn is an officer of Birmingham.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any one ever make a charge against you about a note - A. There was once a 1 l. forged note, which I was tried for passing, but I was acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not that the occasion of the Bank taking you up as a convenient person - A. No; it was before that; this happened at Norwich. I was never taken up at any other time. I had not lived at Norwich above a fortnight when that happened; I have lived there ever since - it will be three years ago next Summer Assizes. I have been a soldier, and left the regiment after the battle of Waterloo. I knew Turnley before, by a little conversation I had with him on the 3d or 4th of September, at Barnet, when I went to sell my master's horse. It was Turnley who asked me to buy the notes - he said they had got nearly 11,000 l., and fenced them for 2000 l.</p>
               <p>Q. Then they were all gone if they had fenced them - A. Yes; that was a different thing entirely; he said they had bought a good many back on speculation, and sold them. He said that in Crowder's presence.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Turnley to suppose you could put them away - A. I was in the habit of going about selling things. I never had any of them before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you were at Malden did you write to Mr. Payne - A. As soon as I got to Huntingdonshire, where I met my wife, which was in October; it was not many weeks after the conversation. When I came from Mr. Payne, I asked Crowder for the notes. I have gone by the name of Bill; I did not wish them to know my real name. Crowder was a stranger to me till I saw him at Malden - they called me Bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was anybody within sight when you were all four together by the Three Crowns - A. The people came round to see what the matter was when there was a row kicked up; there was a dispute between Ward and Crowder about the note - it was darkish; only the gas was lighted. It was six o'clock; it was dark where we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182402180007"></xptr>stood. I counted the notes when he gave them to me; I could tell by the feel that they were notes, and I looked at them after I got into the house. I counted them in the dark when he gave them to me. I counted them in the passage where the gas-light shone; I went beyond both the doors to a private part of the passage.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When you were applied to to buy the notes, were you a hawker - A. No. (Looking at a letter;) this is the letter I wrote to Mr. Payne; it is dated Huntingdon, 19th of November.</p>
               <p>Q. Having counted your notes, you went into the passage to ascertain what they were - A. Yes. I saw the landlord of the house, and the girl who waits there. Ward was in the house, and Turnley, but he did not stop there. I delivered Mr. Payne the same notes as I received from Crowder, and paid Crowder for them; he counted the notes over to me in the dark.</p>

Gray had been employed by the police, under my direction, and in consequence of a letter from him in October, or November, I communicated with Mr. Bird, and from what passed with the bankers, I employed Gray to buy some of the notes, and in December I gave him fifteen sovereigns to buy them; he left, and about three days after returned to Birmingham, and gave me eight 5 l. notes - this was on the 17th. I saw him put his initials on them before he gave them to me, and I put the day of the month on each of them, and gave them to Mr. Bird. These are them (looking at them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. Some persons have already been convicted at Birmingham, of receiving these notes - A. Not that I know of. Gray was paid his expences liberally for every transaction he had with the police. I have promised him nothing for this.</p>

            . I am servant at the Three Crowns, public-house, City-road. I remember the witness Gray, being there before Christmas; I do not remember on what day it was. I have some knowledge of the prisoner being there with him. I do not know Turnley by name. Gray had a crab for dinner that day; several horse-dealers were there, who had steaks -

             was there on that day. There was a disturbance about notes; one man who was to have had seven had eight, and another who was to have had eight had but seven; the party did not come into the house after the quarrel. Ward was the man who had eight notes instead of seven. I do not remember Turnley having any refreshment. I cannot speak to the prisoner's having been there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PLATT. Q. You came out in front of the house I suppose during the quarrel - A. They were quarrelling outside the door at first, and then in the parlour; my attention was directed to them in the parlour, which is on the right hand side of the passage; the passage goes beyond the door. I do not think that Gray was in the parlour at the time of the row. I was in the bar, and hearing the noise went into the parlour. I did not notice whether any one was in the passage; there was a good light there - I did not see Crowder there. Gray was there that evening. No gin was carried into the parlour. I was in the bar some time before the row, and do not recollect Gray coming for any gin; he came for some wine and water just before the quarrel, and had it in the taproom - I saw no papers in his hand.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What makes you remember the wine and water - A. He said he did not like quarrelling, and would have it in the other room, as it was quiet. It was quite dark, but the lamps were lighted.</p>

            . I entered the numbers of the notes; those produced are part of what were in the parcel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was apprehended coming out of my own door in Goswell-street, and taken to Bow-street, and everybody prevented from seeing me. I was charged with robbing the coach, and told them where I was when this was committed. I was sent to the House of Correction, and my solicitor not suffered to see me. I was sent to gaol on a certificate of being indicted, without any examination. I never saw Gray in my life, and if I had known what the evidence was, I have no doubt I should be able to establish an alibi, or something of that sort.</p>

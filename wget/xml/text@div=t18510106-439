                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, at 10, London-road—we are gold-beaters—the prisoner has been in our employ three or four months. On 16th Dec. I gave him 2ozs. 9dwts. of gold, worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to heat into leaf—none of the men were allowed to take the gold off the premises—he worked that day; and the next day, Tuesday, he was the worse for liquor—I think I saw him on the Wednesday, but am not quite certain—on the 19th, Thursday, at five o'clock, finding the work was neglected, I went and looked, and found the gold gone, box and all, and the prisoner also—I found him the same evening, at ten o'clock, at the Seckford Arms, Clerkenwell-green, and said, "Gilson, what have you done with the gold?"—he said, "It is in the shop"—I said, "It is not there; and if you do not come with me I shall give you in charge"—he wanted to have some more to drink—I said I should give him in charge if he did not come, and he came—on going down St. John-street, Green, who is in our employ, and was with me, spoke tohim, and the prisoner pulled the box from his pocket with the gold in it, and Green instantly handed it to me—it was the box he usually kept gold in—not a grain of the gold was removed while I had it, and on getting home I weighed it, and found it weighed only 16 dwt. 12 grains; being a deficiency of 1 oz. 12 dwt. 12 grains, worth about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—a very small quantity, not half a grain, was found in his pocket—he had no authority to remove it from our premises.</p>

                  </hi>. On 19th Dec. I saw the prisoner in our shop, about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I saw the box there on his bench, at nine o'clock in the morning—I had seen the gold in it at nine the evening before—I did not weigh it, but from my knowledge of the material, and from the fulness of the box, I conclude it was all there—he was tipsy on the 18th, but not on the 19th.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

I was with Mr. Jennings on 19th Dec., and on coming down St. John-street, in consequence of what he said, I said to the prisoner, "Mr. Gilson, give me the box"—he gave it me directly—I kept it two minutes, and handed it in the same state to Mr. Jennings—I took no gold out—I was present when it was weighed; it weighed 16dwts. 12gr.</p>

             were with me in another part of the room: Gibson is a cabinet-maker, he works for his father; Larman is an apprentice to a printer, and Samuel is a cabinet-maker, a journeyman. When the brewers' servants had done singing, I gave some young men two pots of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober? - A. I had been drinking, but I was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300045"></xptr>Q. How came you to be so generous; did you know them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you give them two pots of ale then? - A. Because they were very merry.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you drink? - A. Ale; we had nine pots amongst us all; seven pots in our party with the brewers' servants, and two the young men had; I paid three shillings and sixpence as part of the reckoning, and Gibson paid one shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know the brewers' servants, did you? - A. No; we went in accidentally, from hearing the violin. When we came out this party of young men came out with us; I cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there of this party? - A. I cannot be certain; there might be seven or eight.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to treat them? - A. They sung some more songs.</p>
               <p>Q. You treated the whole of the company? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have been pretty merry yourself? - A. Yes. When they came out, they took me across the road with them; they all came round me, and I went with them; but finding my own company did not follow me. I insisted upon going back to them; one of them held me by the collar of the coat, and asked me why I could not go with them; I said I would not, I would go back to my own company.</p>
               <p>Q. They were pretty merry too, were they not? - A. I suppose they might.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not you tell who it was that laid hold of you by the collar? - A. No; it was dark; then I came back to my own company, and walked as far as Sadler's Wells with them; then another party came round us, I do not know whether it was the same, or another company; when we had got as far as the Quakers' Workhouse, which is a few yards below, they threw me down without saying a word to me; they came all on one side of me, and pushed me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you could not stand very steady? - A. Yes, I could; as I was falling, by the light of a lamp I could see the face of the prisoner, and another that I could swear to if I was to see him; then they all fell upon me together, I cannot say how many there were upon me; I felt a hand in my left-hand breeches pocket, and I put my hand down to endeavour to keep it there; but I could not; I called out for the watch as loud as I could several times, and the watchman came up, and I said, take charge of them rascals in the road, for they have robbed me of seventeen shillings, I said; but upon recollection, I found it was only fourteen, the watchman said he would not take charge, it was out of his beat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before? - A. No; not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner hold of you? - A. No; only I saw him and another as I was falling.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you frightened? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. And you know each of them as well as the other? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What opportunity had you of observing this young man? - A. A very short time, not a minute; I knew the prisoner again as soon as I saw him in Bagnigge-Wells Gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your companions? - A. They were three or four yards before me when I desired the watchman to take charge; the other party all went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they run away? - A. I was in such agitation that I cannot say whether they walked away or ran away, but they were in the road when the watchman came; then we met the witness's father, and I went to Clerkenwell watch-house to tell the case, and to report the watchman for not doing his duty; and I learned that he belonged to Pentonville watch-house. On Monday I went to Hatton-garden, and laid an information, and on the Sunday Brown and I were walking in Bagnigge-Wells Gardens.</p>

               <p>Q. What had you to do with Bagnigge-Wells on a Sunday? - A. Only for a walk: we watched him out, then we watched him into the Blue Lion, he took a glass of something at the bar, and then he went down the passage towards the Wells again; and then we watched him to the Blue Lion again, and I desired Brown to get some more, and we followed him to the Bull in the Pound; we knew it to be a bad house, and were afraid to go in; then there came out twenty or thirty of them, with the prisoner at their head, with sticks; he said, here are two of them, d-n their bloods, it is of no use for them to holloa now.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. Half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have been drinking a great deal? - A. I was quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. A linen-draper.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you served your time to it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before you came there? - A. In Cary-lane, at a haberdasher's.</p>
               <p>Q. You never served an apprenticeship to any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner till you saw him by the light of the lamp, the night you were robbed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, am I to take that as an answer, that you had never seen him before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, upon your oath, was he not in the public house with you? - A. I cannot say whether he was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you believe he was? - A. He very probably might be.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300046"></xptr>Q. Will you swear he was not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you swear you were sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he or not one of the people that you asked to drink of the two pots of ale? - A. I cannot say; I did not particularly notice him.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know his name before this time? - A. I did not say.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you met him at Bagnigge-Wells? - A. The Sunday week after.</p>
               <p>Q. So you haunt public houses and Bagnigge-Wells on a Sunday evening? - A. I do not haunt either.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not the landlord turn you out of the house? - A. No; we went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it threw the half-guinea upon the ground? - A. The landlord chose to swear that; but it is false.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you throw the money upon the ground, and swear that you would have more liquor? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you call at the public house again? - A. The Sunday following, to ask the landlord if he knew any of the party who were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever mention the name of the prisoner at the bar to the landlord, till after he had said that he knew only one of them, which was the young man at the bar, his neighbour's son? - A. I cannot recollect what he said.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. But you must. Were you sober then? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You went for the very purpose of knowing whether the man knew any of the company, and therefore you must recollect? - A. He said he did not know them, and a person in company said one of them was a neighbour's son.</p>
               <p>Q. You left that house without your companions? - A. No; when we came out they took me across the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you able to walk at that time, and were they not capable of assisting you? - A. No, they were not; I could walk as well as I can now.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not been falling in the dirt? - A. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the watchman reprimand you, on your way home, for the riotous manner in which you conducted yourself? - A. No; he said something, I cannot tell what; but I said we did not want his assistance.</p>
               <p>Q. For what was it that that watchman accosted you in the road; did he not offer to assist you, on account of the situation in which you were, tumbling about? - A. I told him we did not want any assistance.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How far from the house was it that you were robbed? - A. It might be one hundred and fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it more than forty? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not swear at Bow-street that it was not forty yards? - A. No; Gibson did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard of a forty pounds reward? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the Magistrate at first reprimand you, and discharge the prisoner? - A. He did not reprimand me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say the prisoner must be discharged; and reprimanded you for your ill conduct? - A. I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you have been at the public house drinking? - A. As soon as I came here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect drinking such a toast as this, may

               <p>Q. Do not you know that the prisoner is an honest apprentice himself, apprenticed to his father, and works for his bread? - A. I cannot tell.</p>

               <p>Court. Q.

             sworn. - I am a cabinet-maker; I work for my father: On Friday, the 26th of July, as me and the last witness, and two more, were going up Islington-road, we went as far as he Angel, and returned as far as the Woolpack; we heard a violin, we went in and had a pot of ale; it was then between eight and nine; soon after being in the house, Roberts and his companions came in; I knew Roberts before.</p>
               <p>Q. And he knew you? - A. He might know me by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. What is Roberts? - A. A <rs id="t17991030-56-deflabel325" type="occupation">tailor</rs>

               <p>Q. Who does he work for? - A. I cannot tell who he works for in particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him? - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Knowing him by sight, I suppose you said, how do you do? - A. I do not know that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were with him? - A. I dare say eight or nine of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make yourself known to him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of men were with him? - A. Young men like himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Balding you knew one in that company? - A. No; after being in the house some time, Roberts's companions began to sing songs; after singing two or three songs, Balding gave them two pots of ale to sing more.</p>
               <p>Q. They were as well drest as yourself, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should not you have been affronted if any body had offered you a pot of beer to sing a song? - A. No, I should not; there were some brewers servants in the house, and they sung likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you to drink while you were there? - A. Nothing but ale; there were nine pots, I believe, in all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them was tipsey? - A. There were two of them, 
               <persName id="t17991030-56-person572">
                  William

            , and Larman. Samuel went home, I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You and Balding were perfectly sober? - A. A. I can answer for myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How was Balding? - A. I think he was 
sober.</p>


               <p>Q. Who came out of the house first? - A. Roberts's party and our party were intermixed; as soon as we came out of the house, I perceived Balding to be in their company across the road; Larman being intoxicated, I took care of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had enough to do to take care of him, I suppose? - A. Yes; we walked a little way on the road, and Balding came over to us; we went on about the length of this court down the road, Roberts's party came up to us again; I got on a little forward with Larman; when I turned my head, I saw them all upon the ground together; I went up to him and he told me he had been robbed; he immediately called the watchman to take those rascals in the road, for they had robbed, him; they were still going down the road, and the watchman said they were out of his beat.</p>
               <p>Q. And the robbery was spoke of loud enough for the man to hear it? - A. It was loud enough for the watchman to hear, that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see the persons of any of them, to know them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you think that an odd sort of robbery without any noise? - A. No; they made no noise.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not rob you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it not struck you as a very odd thing that you should see your friend down, and he should say he was robbed, without any thing being said; did it not occur to you as a very extraordinary thing? - A. They did not know that I had any money about me; but they saw his money. He paid the reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. And you paid a part? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the other shilling? - A. There was no shilling in particular; I gave Balding a shilling before the reckoning was paid, that one might pay the whole.</p>

               <p>- LARMAN sworn. - I was at the public house with the two last witnesses.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been at any other public house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You got rather tipsey? - A. Yes, rather so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know any body in the house? - A. Yes, I knew the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And Gibson saw you speak to him? - A. I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke to him as knowing him, did you call him by his name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to Roberts, come Roberts,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179910300048"></xptr>I will give you another pot of ale to sing again? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it said that? - A. I believe Balding, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Balding upon the ground? - A. No, I did not see him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor you did not see your old friend Roberts there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the next day you told him Roberts was one of the party? - A. I told him that I knew Roberts, and that he was in the house.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman, No. 1, Sadler's Wells: A few minutes after eleven these three gentlemen came down from the Woolpack, I heard the alarm of their coming, they were very much in liquor, and one of them fell down against my box; I went over to help them, and this gentleman said they did not want my assistance. They seemed to me to be all in liquor. They went down the road, and I came back; I heard them call the watch, and I went to them, and one of them called me an old vagabond for not taking charge of those people; I did not see any one but themselves; there was an old man on the other side of the way, and they said he was not one of them; I saw nobody at all about; I saw nobody else going down or up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk at an office at 13, Cheapside—on 31st December last, about 9 o'clock, I was coming down Holbom-hill to my office—it was raining very fast—I had my umbrella up—as I was look<lb></lb>ing in a music shop the prisoner and another boy came up to me, and called out, "Halloo, master" and took my gold pin from my scarf, and threw me down on my back—they gave me a violent blow on the nose, and blood came—I am quite sure that the prisoner was one of the persons—he ran down Fullwood's-rents—I could not tell which gave me the blow—I have never seen the pin since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Kirby, and live at Shackel<lb></lb>well, in the parish of St. John at Hackney. On Saturday night, the 11th of July, my sister fastened up the house—I held the light and saw her do it—I went to bed between twelve and one o'clock—I was disturbed by the policeman between two and three in the morning, who told us the back-door was open—I did not go down till about half-past six—I then went into the kitchen, but missed nothing till I went into the parlour—I there found a blue ribbon which I know was attached to some silver bells the night before—the bells were gone—I afterwards missed Mr. Kirby's silk handkerchief—there were three squares of glass broken in the cellar-window, and somebody had got in at one of the squares—they were large enough for a person to get in—no inner-doors had been opened—the back-door was unbolted, but it was shut—it had been bolted the night before—I missed</p>

               <p>the other articles stated when they were shown to me by the policeman—a handkerchief belonging to Charlotte Gifford was taken—she had been visiting us—it was in my husband's hat over night—the prisoner's parents occupy a little house belonging to us, about one hundred yards off—the prisoner lived with his parents, but had left them two or three days before the robbery—our back-door opens into a garden, which has only a low wooden fence to it—a person could easily get over it—the cellar-window is in the front of the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I was disturbed by the policeman—after discovering the robbery I gave information to the police—the prisoner was taken on the 13th, I think, about three o'clock in the morning, in the cellar of my house—the policeman knocked at my door, and showed me a handkerchief in the prisoner's presence, which he had found in his cap—it was a hand<lb></lb>kerchief which I had lost on the night of the 11th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Monday morning, the 13th of July, I was passing the prosecutor's house, and found his front gate open—I went down the area steps, and found the window open—I ex<lb></lb>amined it, and found a cap and a handkerchief lying in it—I called my brother officer off the adjoining beat—we came to the window and called out several times, "Come out, for I know you are here"—presently the prisoner made his appearance—I asked if the handkerchief belonged to him—he said it did—I asked where he got it from—he said he had taken it from Mr. Kirby's the morning before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 44.) The prisoner was brought to the station-house, on the 13th of July, between three and four o'clock—I did not know him before—I asked him what he had been doing the previous week, (knowing he had been away from his employ, and from his home,) he said during the day-time he was in Shadwell, and during the night-time he was concealed about the prosecutor's premises—I then asked him how he had contrived to live without means during that time—he said, "I did not want, for I lived on the money I took from Mr. Kirby's, which money I spent in victuals and drink"—I then asked what he had got about him; upon which he thrust his hand into his trowsers pocket and produced this brass slide of a window, part of a pair of silver sugar tongs, a brass knob, a brass drawer-handle, a small nut, and part of a gold snap.</p>

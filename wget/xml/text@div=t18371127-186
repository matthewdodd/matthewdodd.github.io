                  </hi>. I am a mathematical instrument-maker, and live in Exmouth-street, Commercial-road. The prisoner Flesch lived opposite to me about five months—I first became acquainted with him about the 20th of September, when he introduced himself to me, by saying that he had lived opposite to me for five months, and stated that he was a general agent for Mr. Brandis, of King-street, Liverpool, and wished to knot if I would like to enter into a small speculation—I understood by his making signs to me, that it was a speculation in telescopes—I let him have three for five or six days—he then returned them, saying that he had letter from Mr. Brandis, saying that he highly approved of them, but was dissatisfied at their not having the maker's name on them, and I got my name engraved—he brought, at the same time, a paper with mathematical and philosophical instruments" written on it, which he said he took out of the dictionary, not knowing the terms, or any thing of the sort—I said 1 had a handled quadrant and microscope—I gave him an invoice of them made out to himself—those are not the goods in the indictment—he called on me again on Tuesday morning, the 3rd of October, and said, that on Monday evening he had been in company with Captain Jackson, at a sort of "free and easy," in Rosemary-lane, who had given him his card, and intro<lb></lb>duced himself to him, and he thought of doing business with him—that he had invited him to come and take tea with him that afternoon, and wished to know if I would let him have a sextant to show Captain Jackson-he had seen a sextant previously—I hesitated, and he felt hurt at my suspicions—I said I was very sorry, but as I had not received the money for the first goods, and (Thursday had not arrived when he said Mr. Brandi would call on me) I felt rather uncomfortable having let him have 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of goods, which were the three telescopes, quadrant, and microscope—I told him he might take the quadrant and show as a specimen, but as I sextant was a delicate instrument, I was afraid it might be hurt—he took the quadrant, and said he would return it in two hours, which he did, and then wished to know if I would bring the sextant and quadrant over to his house together, about a quarter to four o'clock, to show Captain Jackson—I went, and all the prisoners were there smoking their pipes and drinking rum-and-water—I placed the articles on the table—they all looked at them, and said they were very fine instruments—Jackson said he did not understand them particularly, but they pretended to bargain about them—Jackson said he liked it very much—Henochoberg said it was a fine instrument—Flesch said, "Well, I must have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for this instrument"—Jackson said it was a great deal of money—Flesch left the room, and Jackson said to me, "Is Flesch a fair dealing man?"—I made no answer—he said, "Oh, I know him very well"—Flesch returned, and having some misgiving, I said to Jackson, "What are you? "—he said, "I am on the water, or sea." I do not recollect which-he said Mr. Flesch must come with him to the hotel in Leicester-square, which was a subscription-room, and nobody was allowed to enter but sub-scribers, or those who were introduced, and if I would come with Flesch and dine with him he should be glad to see me, and to bring some of n»v cards with me—I said, if it was agreeable, I would go with Flesch with the instruments—he said if I brought my cards there were a number of</p>

               <p>captains there, and two wanted instruments; that he would introduce me I to them, and could no doubt sell some instruments for me—Jackson said I Flesch was to go with the instruments, to have the opinion of a friend there I about the sextant—I said, if it was agreeable to them, I would go with Flesch—Jackson objected, and said he never allowed a third person present when he was doing business—I said, "Mr. Flesch, perhaps you will step over to my house before you go?"—he said he would—I went out and went to their landlady, and then went home—Flesch came over very much agitated—I said, "Mr. Flesch, I feel very uncomfortable about the instruments"—I had left them at his place—he said, "Why do you feel uncomfortable? "I said, "Because I have had no money yet, and you are a stranger to me"—he said, "Oh, I think Jackson won't go to night, for he has taken a glass too much, and you can go in the morning with me and make an excuse for going again in the afternoon, saying you have forgot your cards"—I afterwards went to my bed-room window, and saw Jackson and Flesch go out—Flesch had the two instruments in his hand—Henochoberg followed after—I directly ran down and followed them to Sidney-street—there was a pawnbroker's at the corner—I lost sight of Jackson and Flesch all in a moment, and sup<lb></lb>pose Henochoberg went down a street—I went into the pawnbroker's side door, but they were not there—I ran to the top of the Commercial-road, but could see nothing of them—I ran back to the house, and spoke to the landlady—next morning she came to me, and in consequence of what she said I went over to her house, and a friend went round to all the pawn<lb></lb>broker's with me—we found the quadrant at Fleming's, in Newgate-street, and the sextant has since been found at Mr. Myers's, in London-road—my distinct understanding with Flesch was, that the goods were to be re<lb></lb>turned that night, or the money—I had not sold either of them—I had made out an invoice of them, for he ran over in a great hurry, and said, "Will you make out an invoice and receipt it, for I am in a great hurry?"—that invoice is here—Flesch put it into his pocket in my house—I have never received a farthing of the money—this invoice has on it, "Discount five per cent.; settled, J. Whitbread"—he asked me to write that—he pro<lb></lb>mised to return the goods that night, or the money.</p>

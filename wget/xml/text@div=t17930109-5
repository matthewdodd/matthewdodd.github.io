               <p>Q. Do you know what he did with it? - Yes, digging foundations, where I can hardly say; I know the name of the place it is in Mary-le-bone parish.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know that is the same shovel you bought of the man - I marked it at the Justices, and I know it, by this here mark a T and a figure of 4, I observed these marks when I bought him of Mann; I am sure it is the same shovel, there were four round holes, but I did not take any particular notice of them at the time I bought him of Mann.</p>

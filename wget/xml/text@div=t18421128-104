                  </hi>. I am a blacksmith, and live in King-street, Tower-hill. About eleven o'clock at night, on the 20th of Oct., I was fetched to my work<lb></lb>shop in Glasshouse-street by the policeman, and told that some one had broken it open—I found it nailed up outside—it had been opened since I was there—the loft-door was shut—the prisoner was often employed by me—he was at my workshop that day, between three and four—I went to the premises between eight and nine next morning—I saw my foreman, and in con<lb></lb>sequence of what he told me—I took a policeman to Whitechapel workhouse—I saw the prisoner in the stone-yard there, and I told him I wanted him—he asked what I wanted him for—I said I wanted that copper magazine that he took away last night (this is a model of it) he said he knew nothing at all about it—I gave him in charge—he said he would punish me for giving him in charge—I had seen this magazine in the blacksmith's shop the day before—it had been there for three weeks—it is to keep gunpowder in to take to sea—the prisoner bad been employed to clean it—there were four numbers on the top of it, and a wooden lid that was left behind, which the foreman picked up the next morning, had the same numbers that the barrel had—it was about twenty feet high, and sixteen inches across.</p>

On the 20th of Oct., in the forenoon, I was in the shop in Glasshouse-street—by directions from my master, I took this magazine up into the loft—the prisoner was in the shop from one o'clock till six in the evening when we left—he made him<lb></lb>self very officious in fastening up the place, and in putting up the bar at the window in Glasshouse-street—he placed it upside down—I told him to turn it—the shutter is in the middle of the shop—he was out of the shop a few minutes before me—I fastened up the shop myself, and left it all secure—when I went to work next morning, I found the lid of the powder-magazine outside—it had been inside when I went away—the door was fastened up with a nail and a piece of wood across—I made inquiries, and in consequence went to see if the magazine was safe, and it was gone—the loft-door is about twelve feet from the ground—the door was broken in the smith's-shop, where they got in and got up the ladder to the loft.</p>

On Thursday, the 20th of October, I was in a public-house—I was called out to the prisoner—he said he had got some old copper to sell, and asked me where he could sell it—I said I did not know anything at all about it—I said, "Let us look at it"—he said, "It is up the court"—I went up the court, and it was standing by the side of my door—it appeared to me like an old tar-barrel—I said, "It is an old tar-bar<lb></lb>rel"—he</p>

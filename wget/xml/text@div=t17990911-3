               <p>Q. How much was it? - A. I believe only three<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110012"></xptr>shillings; he then demanded my pocket-book; I told him I had none; upon which he swore that I had; I having no great coat on, I was conscious that he must see the books in my pocket, and therefore I gave them to him, they bulged out in my pocket; there was a Tyburn-ticket in one of them which I was going to purchase; there were two pocket-books, and a small book with asses-skin leaves; I assured him the books were of no use, and requested him, when he had perused them, to send them to my address, which he would find in the books; after that, he insisted upon my standing up in the chaise for the purpose of rifling my pockets; upon going away he waved his hand, and said, upon my honour I will return you your books; in about a week after I had one book brought me by a letter-carrier.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the men? - A. One of them; I cannot swear to both.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before you saw the books again? - A. In a week, they were found in a ditch upon the Heath.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the two men is it that you know? - A. The one next me, John Durham.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that he was one? - A. I am certain, I am not under the least apprehension in the world; I have not forgot the man since he robbed me, he was impressed so forcibly upon my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. On which side was he? - A. On my side of the chaise; the other was so disguised, that neither my friend or I could swear to him; but the man that robbed me had a handkerchief over his face, and when he came up to me he pulled his handkerchief off, and I saw his face as plain as noon day, the sun had not set.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your things after? - A. Yes; my watch was found by one of the Bow-street officer; the watch and seal I can swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You did not know the prisoner at the bar before? - A. I never saw him in my life before.</p>

               <p>Q. How long a time did the robbery take up? - A. I cannot say, but I should suppose three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you were considerably alarmed? - A. Yes; the surprize was great, undoubtedly, being so early in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very much alarmed? - A. I was not so much alarmed as surprized.</p>
               <p>Q. Being so surprized, and considering the short time that the transaction occupied, do you mean to swear positively to his person? - A.Certainly I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long a time was his face covered, and how long a time do you think it was uncovered? - A. I am sure I cannot tell, it was the greater part of the time uncovered, he could not enforce his language without.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Fourdrinier was with you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He could not swear to either of these men? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say more, that he did not believe they were the men? - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CARPMEAL sworn. - I belong to Bow-street, I apprehended the prisoners on the 29th of May, in Oxford-street, they were standing at a public-house door, I believe the sign is, the Man loaded with Mischief, about nine o'clock in the evening; we went after them in consequence of informations that had been lodged at Bow-street, Mr. Reynolds's information was one; Limerick took one, and I took the other, in a coach; Limerick took a watch from Thomas Durham, which Mr. Reynolds swore to, and I took another watch from John Durham; we took them to my house in Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Limerick take any thing from the other? - A. I held Thomas Durham's hands while Limerick took the watch from him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This robbery is charged to have been committed on the 20th, and this apprehension did not take place till the 29th? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I belong to Bow-street; on the 29th of May we apprehended the prisoners at the bar, and upon John Durham I found this watch, (producing it.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. I can swear to the watch, I am sure it is mine, I know it by the number and the name, and also the outside of the case; I had it cleaned but the week before; I got the number and the name from the watch-maker, Mr. Chater, in Cornhill; but, independent of that, I can swear to it by the outside of the case, by the device, doves, and arrows, upon the back; it is a lady's French watch, and I know it by the chain.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. - Q. Have you ever seen a French watch before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you never recollect seeing a French watch with a device like that before? - A. I never saw any like it before; I wore that watch for a considerable time, I can swear to it without any hesitation.</p>
               <p>JAMES LIMERICK sworn. - I belong to Bow-street; I was at the apprehending of the prisoner, Thomas Durham; I took this watch from his sob-pocket, one of the seals belongs to the prosecutor; there are two seals and a key to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Here is one seal I am almost positive came off my watch, it has no particular mark upon it, but I have no hesitation in saying it is mine; there was no device upon the stone, but there has been another stone put in.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110013"></xptr>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. It is of a size and shape that other people might have? - A. Yes; I cannot speak so positively to that as to the watch.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BACON sworn. - I belong to the pastol of Bow-street, I was in company when the prisoner were apprehended: I took a gold hunting watch from John Durham, which I have in my pocket, and which has been sworn to by Sir Henry Every.</p>
               <p>John Durham's defence. The small watch that Mr. Reynolds speaks to I bought, and the seal I gave my brother, it was on my brother's watch, and when this gentleman came to Bow-street, he said the seal belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Thomas Durham's defence. My brother gave me the seal.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called three witnesses who had known them from their infancy till within a year and a half of the present time, and gave them an excellent character;</p>

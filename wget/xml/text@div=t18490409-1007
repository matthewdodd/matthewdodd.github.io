                  </hi>. I am a publican, in George-street, Lisson-grove, St. Marylebone. On 1st April, at a quarter past three o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by my wife, who said she heard footsteps in the room—she jumped up, and I did the same—I looked all round, and saw the prisoner under the bed—I took hold of him and put him on the bed—I sent for a policeman, and he was taken into custody—he said, "I hope you will forgive me this time"—I said, "No, not if you were my own brother"—I knew him to be a hardworking man a year and a half ago.</p>

I was called, and took the prisoner—he had his shoes off—I searched about the yard, and found a ladder against the washhouse—I went up the ladder, and found his shoes on the top of the washhouse—I asked him where his shoes were—he said he had lost them—when he came down he said they were on the tiles.</p>

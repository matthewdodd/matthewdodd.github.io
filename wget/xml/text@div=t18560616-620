                  </hi>. I am a contractor, and live in Millington-street Vauxhall-bridge-road On 27th May I was in the Broad Sanctuary, at Westminster, between 10 and 11 o'clock in the evening—I was walking along the footway—I passed the three prisoners, and two other females—I had advanced some few yards, when Scott came and passed outside me, and put his hand into my right hand pocket, and drew out my handkerchief—I took hold of his hand, and desired him to put it back again—he immediately struck me on the nose, and caused it to bleed—I loosed his wrist, and took him by the collar, and paid him back in return—I do not know whether I gave him a black eye, but he was pretty well scarified before I left him; we had a tumble up and down, and a regular street fight—I was all the time calling for the police—Blackman and Moore were in the mean time assisting Scott, trying to pull me off him; they attempted to rescue Scott from me—there were two other females with them—Scott made his escape from me, and ran into the arms of a gentleman who was following behind me—the females had hold of me—I directly disengaged myself from them, and followed Scott again, still calling for the police.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> They pulled you off Scott, and he escaped? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and the females had hold of me for a minute or two after he got up—I am sure Blackman and Moore were a part of those who did it—I seized Scott, who was in the arms of Mr. Humphreys, and we had an <hi rend="italic">up and dawn</hi> in the street again—I tore the clothes nearly off him—Blackman had a child in her arms the same as she has now, but when I was struggling with Scott</p>

               <p>she gave her child to another person, and she was at me with both feet and hands—that was the second time that I had Scott, but she had hold of me the first time—when I caught Scott the second time, and we were straggling, the women came up again—they called out that I was murdering the man, and a cabman came up, and he kicked me—three of the women got hold of me, and the cabman and a woman got hold of Scott and pulled him away, and I lost sight of him—he ran away—Blackman, and Moore, and another female, held my head up against the rails till the policeman came—I then took Blackman and Moore one in each hand, and handed them to the policeman—I had my handkerchief again once, and a stout woman, not one of the prisoners, took it from out of my hand while I was struggling with Scott—before this commenced I had passed the three prisoners and two other females—I had not interfered with them in the least in any way—I did not strike Scott till he had struck me—I had no occasion to do so.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Eaton-terrace, Pimlico. On the night of 27th May, I was walking in the Broad Sanctuary—I saw Scott and four women—Scott stepped out from the women, and took Mr. White's handker<lb></lb>chief out of his pocket—it is rather a narrow passage, and there were four <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> there—Blackman and Moore were two of the females who were with Scott—when Scott took the handkerchief, Mr. White got hold of his hand, and asked him to put it back, and instead of patting it back, Scott struck him on the nose, or close by the nose, with his other hand—the four women closed on Mr. White, and Scott got away—I caught him, and had a severe struggle with him, till Mr. White got rid of the women and came up—I gave Scott to Mr. White and they had a fall up and down; they both went down against a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> wheel—a cabman came up (there were four cowmen, but one more particularly than the others)—he kicked Mr. White—the prisoner with the child (<hi rend="italic">Slack-man</hi>) said to another woman, "Hold my child," and then she tried to get Scott away—I will not swear whether she kicked Mr. White or not, but she was very busy, and she tried to get Mr. White off Scott—Mr. White got up on his legs, and Scott with him, and three women and the cabman got Mr. White against the railings, and Scott got away—I followed and took him again as he was running down George-street—I had a severe struggle with him—he tripped me up—I had nothing to hold by but his handkerchief, his clothes were nearly torn off.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there nothing said all this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The women cried out a great deal, "Murder!" and, "Let him alone"—the cabman said "Leave him alone" but I do not think he had any suspicion of what had been done—if I had not seen Scott put his hand in Mr. White's pocket I should not have known what was the matter—Mr. White punched Scott, he had him down and laid upon him—they were down over and over—Mr. White was walking steadily, and had his hands in his trowsers pockets—I might be twenty yards from Scott when he took the handkerchief—Scott and the four women were talking before Mr. White came.</p>

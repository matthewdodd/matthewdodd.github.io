               <p>Q. Did you lose three iron shovel pans,&amp;c. all at one time? - I don't know. I was told that he made use of some cranks at a public house, and I went and looked, and there I found them, and I had a warrant to go and search his lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. What public house was it? - The sign of the Phoenix, at Chelsea, kept by one Allen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - At Kensington.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you find these bell cranks at the public house? - Made use at turng the bell with, fixed up.</p>

            You went on this to his lodgings? - Yes; on the 23d of May, Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know them to be his lodgings? - Because I had been there to call him to his work sometimes. And there I found the articles in the indictment; the iron shoved pans have my marks; two pair of hinges, them I cannot swear to, but such hinges were in the warehouse where my pans were. They were locked up in a closet.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present when the closet was opened? - The constable. Three keys are remarkable, that I can swear to by a particular make. I missed keys often, but I cannot swear but to three. I did not know these three were missing till I see them there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the shovel pans were missing? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture, from the observation you have made, to swear that the pans, and the keys are your property? - Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The keys were my own property that I brought out of the country with me.</p>

               <p>I went down with the prosecutor to the prisoner's apartment, and in a closet by the side of a fire prace ( we found the closer locked, we demanded the key, and it was sent for) after we opened it we found these things. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get it opened? - We<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179507010090"></xptr>sent for the key to the prisoner; the prisoner had the key.</p>

            Who brought you the key? - I think it was Mr. Rogers's man. I have kept them ever since in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. On finding these things, did you go home and search your warehouse, and from that search can you say that these things were missing from your house? - I cannot really say, but I know the mark.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever authcrise the servants to take those things, or to sell them for you? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. What is there singular about these keys? - The clumsiness about the throat; I had a dozen let made, and I did not like them at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss them out of the dozen? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You told me that on examining your house and shop, you could not miss any? - I thought you meant the shovel pans. I had only three keys left out of the dozen, and they were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the others? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not some of these keys with clumsy backs be sold in your business? - I don't know but they might. As to the pans we never fell them in this state, we join them to the handles.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The material goods I am accused of I brought up out of the country, being in business for myself, and the keys I brought from Woolverhampton, which I believe there are not such keys made in this part of the country, none of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. Is there any thing in the appearance of the pans that you can say they did not come out of the country? - I am positive, because I bought them in London. He worked with me a twelve month, and I never found any thing amiss before.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness who gave him a good character.</p>

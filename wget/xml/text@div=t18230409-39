I first became acquainted with the prisoner on the 1st of February - he resided at the Steyne-hotel; I believe he was there eight or ten days after I first knew him, and hired saddle horses of me. I went out with him twice myself, and he had a horse several times after that; he borrowed 2 l. of me. On the 11th of February, about nine o'clock, he sent to me for a horse by the person who had been in the habit of coming from him before; I let the person have it, and expected it to be returned in about three hours; it was not returned that day, and in the evening, about eleven o'clock, I enquired at the hotel, but he was not there. I waited till twelve o'clock, and then set off to town, on horseback; I arrived between six and seven o'clock; and met him in Holborn, between ten and eleven, on my horse. I seized it by the bridle, and took him to St. Giles's watch-house, and at a public-house opposite Marlborough-street Office, he proposed to pay a bill he owed me and my expences, to be liberated. I went to the office, and returned to him - he said he would pay, and Furzman asked what means he had of paying; he said he had a bill that he would send to the Bank - he produced a bill; it was given to Furzman to send or take to the banking-house of Jones, Lloyd, and Co., to see if they would honour it. I saw him write on the back of it. Bartlett took it to the bankers'; he was detained till he returned, and said it was a forgery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. He had hired horses and returned them - A. Yes; but never kept them beyond a day. He knew he was to remain in custody till the messenger returned from the bankers'.</p>

I had asked what means he had to settle with the prosecutor; he said he had no cash, but a bill on Jones, Lloyd, and Co., and he had no doubt they would accept it, and he could get it cashed, and then he would settle with Mr. Mann. He asked if I could send anybody with it, who I could trust. I gave it to Bartlett in his presence, to take to Jones, Lloyd, and Co.; he brought it back. I marked it before I gave it to Bartlett.</p>

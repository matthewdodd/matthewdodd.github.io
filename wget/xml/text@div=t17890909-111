               <p>I live with Mr. Beauchamp, pawnbroker; a person came to the shop door, and asked if we bought old watches; I said, if they suited us, we did; upon that, he came in with it, and asked a guinea and an half for it; I told him I could sell him one cheaper; he said his name was George Brand; I lent him sixteen shillings; I do not recollect the prisoner was the man, not I cannot say he is not the man that pawned it.</p>

               <p>RICHARD SHAW sworn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner was my servant; when Burrows, who is my apprentice, had dined, he went up stairs; I followed him; he immediately told me he had lost his watch; I went to look after him, but could not find him; then advertised it; on the Saturday following, the prisoner came into the neighbourhood; I sent another apprentice to the house where he was; I went to him, and asked him what he had done with the watch? he said he was very sorry for it, but he would find it at Beauchamp's the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Turner. I have the watch. (Produced; and deposed to by the prosecutor, by a private mark on the case.)</p>

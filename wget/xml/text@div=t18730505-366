                  </hi>. I live in Well Street, Stratford, and am a charwoman—the prisoner and I had apartments in the same house—I do not know whether her husband is dead; I believe she left him in Ireland—on 18th April I saw her in the middle of the day, when she came home very much the worse for liquor. Mr. Hitchcock's shed is at the back of our house, about 8 feet from the back-door—about 3 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon I saw the prisoner in the yard, coming from the corner of the shed near the end—she came into the house and ran up stairs, and directly afterwards I saw the shed in a flame—it is a wooden shed, and there are gaps in it that I could put my finger in—about a quarter of an hour before I saw the flame the prisoner said that she would set fire to the bed and the house, and to Mr. Hitchcock's shed, and Shamus should not have a place to lie his head down—Mr. Hitchcock is the landlord of the house—the prisoner had not gone up stairs five minutes when she came down into my room and said, "Mary, you did not see me in the yard, did you?"—I said, "Yes, Mary, I did; I have seen quite enough; go but of my room"—she then appeared to me very much <hi rend="italic">soberer</hi> than when she came into the house—she had been lying down asleep—she was looking for her lucifers when she said that she would set fire to the bed and the house—she was not sober, and she was not very drunk, but she went and lay down on the bed—I went down and called Mr. Hitchcock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There are children who play in the yard—she was in her room and complained that she could not find her matches, and some<lb></lb>body had taken them—that was about a quarter of an hour before the fire—she remained in her room till she went to the shed—I saw no matches in her hand, when she came from the shed; you cannot see the shed door from our house—I believe the shed has been a refuge for outcasts, and Shamus used to go there—I don't know whether she was in the habit of going there to see him—he was living with her—I do not think she knew what she was saying or doing, but if thought it was spite—she seemed very much excited; that was before she laid down to go to sleep—Shamus was not in the shed, he was in the house, he was in her own room before this occurred—he was in a beer-shop at the time of the fire, I saw him come out as I stood at the street door, before I saw the flames—I did not go and tell Mrs. Hitchcock that the prisoner had threatened this, but I said that she had done it after I saw the flames—when I saw the flames I said "Oh my God, she has set the stable on fire!" but I did not accuse the prisoner of setting fire to the shed—as I saw the prisoner come away, I saw the shed flame; I was then standing at the back of the house, by the kitchen—it was about five</p>

               <p>minutes before that that I was standing outside the front of the house, and saw Shamus come out of the beer-shop at the bottom of the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am sure Shamus was not in the shed at the time the fire broke out—I did not see any children in the yard at the time—there was only me and the prisoner in the house—it was after I had been to Mrs. Hitchcock's, that the prisoner said "You did not see me in the yard, did you?"</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Fire Brigade at Stratford—on 18th April, about 3.30, from information, I went with a fire engine to this shed, and found it on fire, the straw in it was on fire, and the wood work as well—I found two lucifers hardly a foot from the shed, between the shed and the prisoner's house—some portion of the shed is open, and there is no door to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The shed was not burnt down, but most of it was destroyed on the side where the prisoner lives—a piece of timber work about 4 feet square was burnt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor, and live at 1, Northampton-terrace, City-road. On 27th Dec, at half-past 9 o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner at the corner of Chiswell-street—as I passed him lie looked after me, and followed me rapidly up the City-road, past Bunhill-fields, and when we came to Nelson-street, I heard his feet spring from the ground, and he struck me on the right side of the mouth, and felled me to the ground—I had two parcels—he snatched one from under my arm—I lost the other, but cannot say what became of it—this one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the parcel he took—it is mine, and is worth 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he ran across the City-road, into Windsor-terrace—I followed him immediately, calling "Police!" and I did not lose sight of him—I struck him at the back of the right ear, he fell, and as he fell he threw the parcel on the pavement—Dowling came up—I picked the parcel up and gave it to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Sydney-place, Com<lb></lb>mercial. The prisoner was in my service as salesman, for about six or seven months—I had told him, two months before I charged him with this, that I did not require his services, and he might look out for another situation—he had several times been out for that purpose—in consequence of information on Tuesday evening, I sent one of my boys to Ray's coffee-shop, and he brought hack the coat and waistcoat now produced—this coat is mine, and had been in my shop for sale—the selling price would be about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it cost me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—after I had got the coat back, the prisoner came to me, and said he had come to explain about a coat which I had sent up to his lodging for—I said nothing to him, but gave him into custody im<lb></lb>mediately, as the officer was there, and my shop was crowded with people, I was obliged to send him away—I had never sold him the coat, nor had he ever asked me to sell it him—to the best of my belief it has never been sold out of my shop—I have never received the money for it—if the pri<lb></lb>soner received money, it was his duty to give it to me or to my foreman—he had no authority to put it into the till—he said before the Magistrate, if I produced my sale-book and a satin waistcoat, he could show he had paid for the coat; and he pointed to an entry in the book—I have it here—here is entered, "Coat, cost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., sold for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—that does not refer to the coat produced—I do not myself know what coat it refers to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to the prosecutor. I know this coat belongs to his stock—about two months ago the prisoner brought it to me, said it fitted him, and asked what would be the price of it—he said he would not mind giving 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I told him to speak to Mr. Vesper about it—he never said any thing about it to me afterwards—the coat cost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at our sale—I am confident it has never been sold from our shop—the pri<lb></lb>soner never told me he had bought it, or that he wished to make any entry about it—if he had bought it, it was his duty to tell me or my master of it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you ever have any quarrel with the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never; quite the reverse—he had spoken to me about one or two things in the stock before, and I gave him leave to take them—he never had credit for any thing without first mentioning it to me or my master—I have seen this waistcoat—the prisoner was indebted to the stock at that time—he bad no wages due to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am errand-boy to Mr. Vesper. The day before the prisoner was taken into custody, he asked me to take something for him to Ray's coffee-shop, and told me to be sure and make haste—it was wrapped up in a handkerchief—he did not say what it was—I took it to Ray's, and brought back a green coat—I afterwards told Mr. Vesper, and he sent me for the same parcel which I had taken there on Monday morning—I got a parcel from Ray, but it was not wrapped up in the same hand<lb></lb>kerchief—I gave it to my master—I saw him open it, and there was this coat and waistcoat in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop in the Commercial, about twenty doors from Mr. Vesper's—the prisoner lodged with me from Au<lb></lb>gust till January—he then went to reside in his master's house, and used to come every Sunday morning to dress—I have seen him with a coat of this colour and description of button—I cannot swear it is the coat, but I believe it to be—Spencer came to me on Monday morning with a parcel, which I took of him—I did not see what was in it—I threw it on the banisters where the prisoner's clothing was usually kept, since he left lodging at my house, as he had no room—it remained on the banisters till about ten o'clock, when he came in and went up stairs—I did not follow him up, and do not know what he did with the parcel—next day when the boy came for the parcel, I took this coat and waistcoat which I found thrown over the banisters, supposing it to be the coat he had brought—I wrapped it up in a handkerchief with the waistcoat, and gave it to the boy—the prisoner afterwards came and asked whether Mr. Vesper had sent here for him—J said, Yes, there had been a fine fuss about a coat, and Mr. Vesper had got it—he said, "I will soon see about it," and flew out of the house down to his employers.</p>

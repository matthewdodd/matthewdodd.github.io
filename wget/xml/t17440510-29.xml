               <p>Q. Do you remember the Prisoner being with you upon any occasion?</p>
               <p>Major. I do remember the Prisoner very well, I am certain to her. On the 18th of November last she came to my office with a woman, who went by the name of Frail, and who had proved a will three days before. She said she had brought another woman whose husband was dead in the same ship that hers died in, and the Prisoner produced this will, and I wrote what we call the jurat upon it, and she was sworn before Dr. Chapman. She said she apprehended the effects did not amount to twenty pound, and I think she obtained a probate for six shillings, because the fees when the effects are under twenty pound are very low in the office. She had a bruise on one of her eyes, and she accounted for it in this manner: that she was lately come from Worcester, and by the waggon being turned over she had got that bruise. I told her I had lately been at Worcester, and that it was my mother country, and upon that we had some discourse. I told her as she was a stranger in town my clerk should go with her to the office, and I believe I sent my clerk with her, and the wages due were 42 l. 16 s. 5 d. and she did obtain the second probate on the 28th of November, 1743, before Dr. Chapman, and then the former probate was brought in and declared null and void, and she was resworn as the widow of this man, and sole executrix. She said she had not money for the second probate, by my bill there is due to me 2 l. 12 s. The last time I saw her at my office, she said she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174405100033"></xptr> could not get the money, it being paid to another person. When I take a probate out in the Bishop of London's office, I enter it in the Prerogative to prevent a forged will being brought in.</p>
               <p>Q. How come the money to be paid to another person?</p>
               <p>Major. There was a probate granted in some inferior court, either at Deptford or Greenwich, &amp;c. but not at Doctor's Commons.</p>

He wrote the probate, and got her sworn; and she telling him a story of her coming from Worcester, that she was overturned in the waggon, very much bruised, and forced to lye by a month, and not knowing the town, Mr. Major desired I would go to the Navy Office with her. She had at first sworn that the effects were under twenty pound, and when I came to the office I was informed there were upwards of forty pound, and they would not pay it upon that probate, so I was obliged to get another probate. When that probate was made out which was the 28th of Nov. I went again to the office, and after a great deal of trouble in going several times to the Pay Office and Navy Office, at last I found by Mr. Turner that the money was paid to one

               <p>Q. How long has she gone by the name of Rochead?</p>

               <p>Q. How long has she been married to Rochead?</p>
               <p>Rawlinson. About two or three years (but I call her Wollin frequently before her husband.) I cannot be certain how long she has been married; for I have a very bad memory - I don't know what business her husband was of; I never was much within the house only as to speaking or drinking, with her - I did live in the New Street in Goodman's Fields, and she lived in Ashffe Street; I had now in Cobb's Court in Black Friers, and have these two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Mary Hall?</p>

               <p>Rawlinson. I have seen her more than a dozen times, and have drank with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Now as you were so little acquainted with her, how came the name of Wollin so much in your mouth, that you cannot think of the name of Rochead?</p>

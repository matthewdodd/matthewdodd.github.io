               <p>JOHN ANGSTROM. I am a Swede, and live in Margaret's-buildings, New Gravel-lane. On the night of the 17th of May I went across the water, and took out my money to pay the waterman; I dropped a sovereign in the boat, and the waterman pushed me into the water; I could not swim to catch the boat, and so I got to shore. I came across the prisoner in the street, and he took me to a countryman of mine, to get something to drink; I sat by the fire, and dried myself, and sent a man to get me a pair of stockings; I wanted to come to this side of the water again with this man, and he put his hand into my pocket; I said, "What are you about?" and he said, "Never mind, I will go with you to the other side of the water," which he did - when we came here we went into a public-house, and I gave him something to drink. I had had five sovereigns, and the waterman took one; I then found I had but one left: the prisoner went away, and I told the people of the house what I had lost; a man took my part, and went to get the prisoner back again. I was very drunk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were about a hundred persons round, and the prosecutor was standing with some money in his hand; my master said to me, "Take this man home with you;" as we were going along he asked me where he could go to dry himself, as he was wet - we went to a house, and he called for rum; he said then to me, "You had better take this money, and give it me in the morning" - he gave me two sovereigns. He would not go home, and I said I would take it to his brother. Witness. I did not give him my money at all.</p>

The prisoner left the house shortly afterwards - an account was then given that the prosecutor had lost his money; I went after the prisoner, and told him to return - he refused at first, but I threatened him with an officer, and then he came back. As he was returning into the public-house he stooped down to his shoe, and I saw three sovereigns roll out of his hand; I picked up two of them, and he picked up the other.</p>

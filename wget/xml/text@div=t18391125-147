                  </hi>. I am a widow. I lodged in the same room with the prisoner, in Salmon's-lane, Nelson-court, Limehouse, for about three months—on the afternoon of the 11th of October, she hit me with her closed fist, first on the eye, and then asked me for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which she had lent me—I put my hand into my pocket to get it, and she hit me with a quart<lb></lb>pot on my right eye, called me a b—w—, and said she would take my life—she was not intoxicated—she had never told me to go away from the lodging, but she wished me to go—I had four blows with the quirt-pot over my head, and one over my eye—it was a pewter-pot—I bled very much, and tried to getaway, but she shut the door, and fastened it, and I threw myself out of the window—the room is on the ground-floor—after giving me two wounds with the quart-pot, she put her hand on my neck, and threw me down on the bed, and struck me twice with the quart-pot while I was on the bed—when I threw myself out of window, she followed me, and hit me as I was going across towards a person's door to save my life—she hit me with her fist when I was out of doors, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> a bucket full of water alongside of me—the policeman then came to my as<lb></lb>sistance, and I gave her in charge—Catherine Downey came in at the time she began to jaw me, and went out again—she told the prisoner to keep quiet, but she said she would not, she would take my life away—I had not had any quarrel with her, except about the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she did not give me time to give it to her—it was in halfpence—Idid not strike her at all, nor</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. On the 11th of October the prosecutrix was brought to the London-hospital, between five and six o'clock in the afternoon—she had several wounds on the left-side of her head, and the upper and back part of her head—they were wounds of a serious description, and were dangerous—there were two on the left-side of the head, of nearly equal size, about an inch and a half long, dividing the flesh from the bone—they were such wounds as might be made with a quart-pot—she is not yet discharged from the hospital—I do not consider her perfectly out of danger now—she was not senseless when she came in, but she seemed stupid—she seemed to have been drinking, but was not in liquor—her breath smelt of liquor.</p>

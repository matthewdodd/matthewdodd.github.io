            . I am the wife of Colville Brown. The prisoner had been my servant for twelve months; I called her into the parlour, and told her what I had heard - she stood for a minute, and then asked who told me - I said the barmaid - she did not deny but that she had taken the money; I then asked to see her box - she went up and opened it; I found the cigars, the rum, and the money in it - the table-cloths, the handkerchiefs, and other things were found on her person; my husband had missed halfpence from time to time - I have every reason to believe the cigars were ours - these napkins are mine, and were on her person.</p>

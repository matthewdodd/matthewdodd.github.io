                  </hi>. I am shopman to Jabez Balch, a linen-draper in Shoreditch. On the 22nd of April, about eight o'clock, I was in the shop—Cave and her mother came and gave me information—I looked at the window, and observed a crowd of people—I went outside, and the people were gone—I observed the corner of the glass of the window was cut, and a piece of velvet taken away—there was a large hole, sufficient for an arm to be put in—a roll of silk was also removed from its place, and laid opposite the hole, but was not taken away—I had seen the velvet, between six and seven o'clock, just opposite that square of glass—there was no hole in the window then, I am sure—the velvet had a private mark, on a paper tacked to it——I have since seen that ticket—about nine o'clock the same evening, I saw Lingford come and stoop down and look at the square that was cut—I went out of the door, and she went off directly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mrs. Harris. About seven o'clock, in the evening of the 22nd of April, I was passing Mr. Balch's shop, and saw the three prisoners and three young men standing round the window, and one of them, who is not in custody, was cutting the window with a glazier's diamond—the prisoners were all standing still by the window—Lingford stood next to the young man who was cutting the window, and Stokes was standing on the other side—I stopped to see what they were doing—the man not in custody shoved the piece of glass in, and they all ran away—I went away also, and went home—I was sent out again directly after to Mr. Balch's shop, and when I got there I saw them all six standing around the window—I went into the shop to ask about some-thing—I did not tell Mr. Balch of it—I was not there above two or there minutes—when I came oat they were still there—I said nothing about it to the people in the shop—I went home and told my mother, Jane Bowman, and she and I directly returned to the shop—the prisoners were all there still—I waited outside the shop—my mother went in—she came out again, and we both went away—the prisoners were there then, and the three not in custody also—it was about eight o'clock—I was not there when Jones came out.</p>

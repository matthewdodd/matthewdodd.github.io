I have lost a tambour waistcoat; it was taken from a drawer in the parlour; I saw it there the 24th of July; I missed it on the 25th; the prisoner called twice on me on the 25th for a little money; I was not at home, but I found a letter left dated the 25th July; I had no suspicion of the prisoner; the maid was suspected and turned away: on the 26th of August I was out of town, I returned on the 28th, and saw an advertisement in the paper of a spoon the prisoner had stolen, which a little surprized me; I went to Sir

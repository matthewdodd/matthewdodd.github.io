                  </hi>. I am a farmer, and live at Hillingdon. On the 7th of September I was at a beer-shop near the turnpike at Hillingdon, and saw the prisoner there—I never saw him before—he was inquiring if any body had a horse to sell—I told him I had—it was about twelve o'clock in the day—the pony was at my house about a mile off—he asked if he could see it, and I fetched it—it had a bridle and saddle on—I rode it part of the way up Hillingdon hill in his presence to show it to him—there were a few</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183810220089"></xptr>
               <p>people present at the time—when I came back from riding it he asked me the price of it—I told him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would give me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him I would not sell it at 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then asked if he might ride it a hundred yards to try it—I told him he might if he liked, and I let him—he rode it a little way up the lane, and got off to tie or fasten the girth, I cannot say which—I went to walk towards him—he mounted the horse again, saying he should be back again directly, and rode off—I never saw him again till the policeman took him a month and a day after—there were others with me at the time he rode away—he went as fast as the pony could go—he started at a gallop—I gave information to the police—the pony was worth something less than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never seen it since—it was about thirteen or fourteen hands high—I thought I had seen the prisoner before at Uxbridge fair, but I had no conversation with him—I do not know what be it or where he comes from.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Hillingdon. On the 7th of September I was with Smith at the beer-shop—the prisoner came in while I was there, and inquired if any body had a pony to sell, as he wanted one—Smith said he had one to part with—the prisoner asked where it was—Smith said he could soon fetch it, and he fetched it—Smith tried the pony up the hill, and rode back again to the beer-shop—the prisoner wanted to know the price of it—Smith asked 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—the prisoner said, "I will give you 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—they stood awhile, and he asked Smith if he might ride him 100 yards—he said he might—he mounted, rode up the lane, and away toe went—I was almost close to them while they were bargaining—I did not see him get off, as I was then at the bottom of the lane—Smith was nearer to him than me—I did not see him after he started—it is a public lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I saw the loss of the pony in the "Hue and Cry," about the middle of September, and made inquiry to endeavour to find it out—on the 6th of October I went to No. 6, Praed-street, about a quarter after eight o'clock in the morning, it is the residence of the prisoner's mother—I went down into the kitchen and saw the prisoner—I said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi>, I want you—you are just the man I want"—he said, "What about?"—I said, "About that horse you rode away from Hillingdon"—he said, "That is all right enough—I bought that"—I said, "You must go with me to the station-house"—I told him what the charge was in the "Hue and Cry"—he said the prosecutor had let him have it till he came from Ledgley fair, at two months' credit—I asked what had become of the bridle and saddle—he said he had left them at Northampton, the bridle at one place, and the saddle at another, and he had sold the pony—I asked who to—he said to some gipsy—the prisoner is an assistant to horse-dealers—to any body that will employ him—I have known him seven years, living in London.</p>

On the Wednesday I found the prisoner on his coach-box; I asked him where he drove the fare to on Saturday afternoon, he said to Temple-bar; I asked him if he did not drive a fare to Hoxton-square; he said yes, he drove two ladies there; he admitted he had the bundle, and said the person should have it; he went to his father, who was at a stand of coaches, and had some conversation with him; then he took the glass of the coach out which had been broke, and said he would go and fetch the bundle; he went away; I waited a great while, till I heard there was a bustle at a pawnbroker's, and the prisoner was stopped offering the things to pawn.</p>

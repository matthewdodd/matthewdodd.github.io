                  </hi>. I live at 13, Exmouth-street, Clerkenwell, and am a compositor—between eleven and twelve on Saturday night, 29th July, I met the female prisoner opposite Weston's, in Holborn, after some conver<lb></lb>sation she induced me to go to a house with her—we went to 44, Charles-street, up to about the third floor—I was perfectly sober—as soon as she got into the room she made use of some slang term and went down stairs—two men then came to the door—I took the candle and had a good look at them, and recognised the prisoner Scott—they wore <hi rend="italic">billy-cock</hi> hats—I bolted the door, ran to the window, and called "<hi rend="italic">Police</hi>"—the two men said that if the door was not opened they would burst it in—as Boon as I opened the door they said, "<hi rend="italic">Douse the glim</hi>" or something like that, and I got the candle in my face, and we were in the dark—one of the men then hit me in the stomach with his head, and turned me over like a board, and I laid on the ground—they then put a rug round my head, and I was speechless for a minute or two—they then got hold of my throat and gave me two or three knocks on each side—as soon as I recovered I heard the female say, "Kill the b——"—they had almost taken my clothes off me then—they tore my pockets out and took my purse and comb and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which were safe when I Went into the house, and the girl must have known where I put the purse, for I treated her to a glass of ale, and she saw the contents of my purse, and I also told her—after that I got another knock, and then they decamped down stairs—as soon as I came to I put my hand out, and found a lucifer, got my hat from the corner of the room, and went down stairs into the street—when I got about 40 yards from the door I recognised Scott amongst five or six men, and about five women, one of whom was Ann Griffin—they saw me, and watched me till I spoke to a constable, and then disappeared—about an hour after I saw Griffin coming up, and the constable took her—she said, "I am the girl that you went with to the house in Charles-street"—she said she did not know anything about the men—two days after I saw</p>

On Sunday morning, 30th July, between twelve and one, I was in Drury-lane at the top of Charles-street—I saw the prosecutor—he took me to 44, Charles-street—he was perfectly sober—his clothes were much torn—I went into a room there and found a hat, and just outside the door I found this hat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which I believe to be Scott's—I saw a candlestick in the room and this rug—I marked this hat inside in the lining, and left it there—the room looked as though it had been upset—the prosecutor and I were afterwards standing in Charles-street, and he said, "Policeman, there is the woman"—Griffin was then about twenty or thirty yards off—she came up to me, and said, "I am the woman who took this man to the room"—she could see us standing together—nothing was said to her before she said that—I think she had had a little drink—Scott was apprehended on Monday night, the 31st, in the Sun public-house, just opposite Charles-street—he was wearing this hat, which I had marked—I told him I should take him for being concerned, with two other parties, in a robbery in Charles-Street—he said he did not know any<lb></lb>thing about it—he was placed with seven more men at the station, and was identified by the prosecutor.</p>

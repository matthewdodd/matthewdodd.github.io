                  </hi>. I am cellerman in the employ of Mr. Richard Lill<lb></lb>wall, a wholesale cheesemonger in Lime-street—the prisoners were in his employ, Smead as warehouseman, and Putman as carman. On Friday, the 7th of January, I assisted Sraead to load a cart from the lower ware-house in Lime-street—six Cheshire cheeses were put into the cart from the lower warehouse—the cheeses lay in separate dairies—three of those came from one dairy, and three from another—while assisting in the loading I observed another cheese standing on an empty packing-case in the Cheshire cheese floor, about ten or twelve yards from the door—it was not a proper place for it to be standing—all the other cheeses were in the cart—at the</p>

               <p>distance I was I could not see exactly whether it was the same sort of cheese which were being loaded—Smead gave me the cart-note to go op stairs, for the men up stairs to put the goods specified in the note down into the cart out of the loophole—it was not usual for me to do that in so small a transaction—it was usual in large orders—this is the order Smead gave me to take up—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—all the goods that were to be packed from the lower warehouse were then in the cart—I went up into the Dutch cheese warehouse with the order—there is a loophole there, which com<lb></lb>mands a full view of the door of the lower warehouse—Putman was at the door with his cart—I looked out of the loophole, and saw Smead roll the Cheshire cheese into the cart, Putman being in the cart at the same time, and he must have put it away in the cart—I did not see him do so—Putman received the cheese, and he was in the cart at the time the cheese was rolled in—the cart had a tilt to it, but I saw him in the cart notwithstanding the tilt—I could see his legs and so on—I had seen him before with the cart—the packing below was completed when I went up stairs—the cheeses that were up stairs were Dutch—I then followed the cart, spoke to a policeman, and gave Putman into custody—this is the cheese that was taken, (<hi rend="italic">produced,</hi>) and here is one each of the other two sorts—they are all out of separate dairies—the one taken is thicker than the others—there was more coat on it at the time than there is now—it has been shifted about a good deal lately—it was found about the middle of the cart, but on the side—the person driving the cart could not avoid seeing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am head warehouseman to Mr. Lillwall—this delivery order is my handwriting—our course of business is this—the goods are first got ready, the order is then made out, and delivered to the person who is to load them, whose duty it is to load exactly what is</p>

               <p>contained in the order—it was Smead's duty to do so on this occasion, and it was Putman's place to see he had those goods in the cart—we have likewise a check weighing-hook, in which it was Smead's duty to enter the weight of the articles which come within his department—he mostly weighed the cheeses—it was his duty, on the 7th of January, to enter what goods he delivered from the lower warehouse—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the book</hi>)—the entry on the 7th of January is Smead's hand-writing, and agrees with my note—there is no mention of a seventh cheese—when Putman was taken, I asked him for the note, and he gave it to me.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it the regular weighing-book? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is the weighing-book for that department—it was Smead's business to see that he had the things to deliver which are mentioned in the note I made out, and to deliver, by that note—and when he had done so, to hand it over to the carman—we have a fair book, in which we enter it afterwards—when the cart is loaded, the carman ought to look to what he has in the cart—he is invariably told to do so—if he had too much in the cart, I should expect he would find it out before the day was out—the book I have produced gives the weight of all the articles he enters in the book after weighing the goods—if he had weighed that seventh cheese, it ought to have been en<lb></lb>tered in the book.</p>

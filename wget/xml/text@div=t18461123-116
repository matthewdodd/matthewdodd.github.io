                  </hi>. I live in Norfolk-street, Strand—at half-past ten o'clock at night, on the 24th of Nov., I was in a cigar-shop—I put my purse into my pocket, and went on to Cockspur-street, near the National Gallery—I was looking into a shop there—I had my umbrella in one hand and a cigar in the other—I found some one had hold of my arm—I looked round and saw it was rather a low-looking woman—I shook her off, and passed on ten or fif<lb></lb>teen yards to another stall, and looking in at that window I found the woman had followed me, and had hold of me again—it was the prisoner—I shook her off rudely the second time—I passed on—she still followed me—I rather suffered her than otherwise—she walked by my side and talked to me—I was hardly thinking of the woman—I recollect her asking me to treat her—I told her I had no change—I put my hand to my pocket, and my purse was there—that aroused me from my reverie, and I was about fifty feet out of the thoroughfare—as I looked round my purse was whipped from my pocket—no one was with me but the prisoner—she ran and I ran after her, but a man ran from the thoroughfare into my arms and pinioned me down—I afterwards took the prisoner myself—the purse was not found—she had an opportunity of passing it—I am sure she was the only person near me when it was taken—she was the only person within ten feet of me—it contained twenty-two sovereigns in one side of it, and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the other—it was a long travelling-purse.</p>

               <p>then went and stood looking in at a shop window in Cock spur-street, then went and looked in at another shop window—the prisoner came to me at the first window—she staid with me then, only long enough for me to shake her off—she came up and passed her arm round me, as thousands have before—I can<lb></lb>not say how long she staid; say a minute and a half—I went on to another shop—she came to me again, and staid about the same time—I cannot speak to the conversation—she wished me to go home with her, and passed her arm round me very indecently—I pushed her off again—she then walked about 100 yards—I did not talk to her—she did to me—I was sober—I never was tipsy since I was born—I had not drunk anything but water—I saw her and another woman together—I caught hold of the other woman.</p>

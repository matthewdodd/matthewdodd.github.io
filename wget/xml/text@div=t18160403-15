On the 26th of March last, I went out at six o'clock in the morning to washing; I left my three children at home; I left them in bed. I locked the door, and threw in the key through a hole in the window. I returned again at half past twelve o'clock. I then went to the school for the key of the house, and the school-mistrees delivered it up to me. Then I went home and found that the door was entirely forced open. I saw my cupboard was open as soon as I entered; it was broken; I missed my purse, containing three one pound bank of England notes, three three shilling pieces, a silver tooth-pick, and a duplicate of a ring. It was a green silk purse. I had seen the property the over night. I locked the cupboard, and put the key over the top of it.</p>

               <p>SUSANNAH SMITH. I am nine years old, pretty nigh. I know my catechism, I know that it is a bad thing to tell a lie. I left my mother's house between nine and ten in the morning of the 26th of March last. I locked the door, and lifted up the latch, and pushed it, and found it was fast. I then took the key to school, and gave the key to my school-mistress, and she laid it on the mantle-piece. I have two little brothers, and they went to school with me. When I and my brothers went to school, nobody was in the house. After school I returned with my mother, and found the door broke open; and that door I am sure I had locked in the morning, and given the key of it to my school mistress.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner on Tuesday the 26th of March, about one o'clock; I apprehended him at the Nag's Head public-house, in Kentish Town. I searched him, and he had got the purse clinched in his left hand; I then asked him where he got it? he did not make any resistance then. He said he got it at Finchley for work. I then emptied the money out on the table; there were two one pound notes, six three shilling pieces, a tooth-pick, and a duplicate; they were all in the purse. I then proceeded to bring him out of the public house, and the moment he got to the door he ran off. I pursued him and overtook him. He hit me very hard, and I knocked him down. I then se<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030020"></xptr>cured him and marched him nearly halfway up Kentish Town. There we had another bustle, and then I managed him again; then we went a little higher up, and he got away again; and there we had several rounds of blows, and at last I knocked him down and hit him twice across the leg with my staff, and then he could not run any more. I at length secured him, and I had a horse and cart and put him in it, to take him to Hatton Garden. As we were going along, Mrs. Smith followed the cart, and he saw her, and he said, Mrs. Smith need not have done this to me, for I would have paid her every farthing. I had told him what I had taken him for. Mrs. Smith came into the Nag's Head and owned the property before him. He had not another farthing about him, beside this money.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. To witness. You called me a bloody thief and knocked me down several times, did you not - A. Yes, I knocked you down, but not till you knocked me down first.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am not a person who would do such a thing.</p>

               <p>In addition to this, the prisoner put in another defence to the effect following.</p>

               <p>My Lords and gentlemen of the jury, on the 26th of March, as I was going home, after I had been with some food for my child at school, I picked up a green purse, which contained the top part of a silver pencil-case, a duplicate, and three bank notes. I got one of the notes changed at the Nag's Head, and when Mrs. Smith came home, she went to the constable and charged him to take me into custody. He took me and called me a bloody thief, and said I wanted to get away from him, and I was very innocent, and did not try to get away at all. Mrs. Smith has since told a person in Kentish Town, that she lost the purse out of her pocket, and she offered to make it up if she got the money back; but the officer told her there was a reward of forty pounds, and she would have ten pounds of it.</p>

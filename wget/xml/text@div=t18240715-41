The prisoner was in my employ for eight months, and <rs id="t18240715-41-deflabel233" type="occupation">used to carry fish about the country, and receive money from the customers</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18240715-41-defend408 t18240715-41-deflabel233"></join>; I had taken him without a character. Phoebe Shaw was a customer of mine, and used to have fish of the prisoner. On the 15th of April, when he returned in the evening he said Mrs. Shaw had had fish to the amount of 6 s., but it was not paid for. In a few days I found things were not going on right, and sent down to Mrs. Shaw, and heard of this circumstance; he had then left me, without giving me notice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had known something of the man before - A. Yes; he was a neighbour of mine; he had been begging of me for work, and I took him out of charity.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you some misunderstanding with him before he went away - A. No, not a word; I am sure of that. He always gave the money to my wife; every payment he made was entered in the book.</p>
               <p>PHOEBE SHAW. I live at Enfield. The prisoner used to supply me with fish; I knew him as the servant of Mr. Simmons. On the 15th of April I paid him 6 s. for fish I paid him in shilling pieces, to the best of my belief - I am quite sure some was in shillings; it was for salmon. I am cook to Mr. Strange.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This is a good while ago, and can<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150016"></xptr>you swear as to what coin you paid him in - A. I cannot say, but to the best of my recollection I paid him in shillings. I cannot swear that I paid him one shilling piece.</p>

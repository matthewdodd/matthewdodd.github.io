            . On the morning in question I saw a person standing opposite the prosecutor's, at half-past six o'clock - I walked a little further, waited a few minutes, and the prisoner passed me with a box on her head; I said, "What have you there?" she said, "My clothes, and you know where I brought them from;" she said she had lived at Mr. Martin's - I let her go on; I saw something running out at the bottom of the box - I found it was gin; she then said if I would go with her I should see where she was going - I took her to the prosecutor's; she then said her sister gave them to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it was gin? A. I tasted it; there was one bottle of brandy, two of rum, and a broken bottle with some gin remaining in it - there was also some soap and sugar.</p>

I went to the prosecutor's, and he said she had done nothing that he knew of, but the Policeman brought her back - at my wedding there was a great deal of liquor - when the row began, and they were breaking all the bottles; I said to her, "Save what you can, and keep them;" I think I was married on the 23rd of May.</p>

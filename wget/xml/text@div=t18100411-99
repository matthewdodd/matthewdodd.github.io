               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Kind Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope you will take my sad misfortune, which I now labour under, into your consideration, as I am left alone in the wide world, and I am the mother of ten children, and brought here to answer the faults of my deceased husband. My husband in his life-time rented an apartment in Mrs. Deamer's house; after living there some time, he was out of work; he made use of these things, and meant to return them when he got work again. Mrs. Deamer received of me a variety of duplicates for the rent; and as soon as she found he was buried, she sent me here, and threatened to transport me. I beg for mercy, as my husband made me pledge them.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It is almost all false.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew she had a husband - A. There was a man there sick; he got his illness through her taking the things off the bed; he said so; she is a shocking drunken woman.</p>

On the 4th of September, about ten minutes past seven o'clock, I found the back door open on coming to the house, and on going further I found the warehouse door forced open. Some carpeting which I had left there a few nights before was scattered about the place, and about 12 l. worth gone. The warehouse does not join the dwelling-house, but is enclosed in one fence with it. The carpet belonged to the house.</p>

On the 12th of June, about a quarter before ten o'clock, as I was coming through a field, near the New road, from my brother-in-law's, where I had been to measure him, I saw two men standing at a stile before me; they walked leisurely on, I walked on. When I came up to them, they each stopped on one side; I passed between them; I looked at each of them, and went on; they followed me over the next field; I thought they walked faster than they should do, upon which I mended my pace: then one of them ran, and overtook me; he seized me by my throat; threw me down, and then held me by my throat; the other put his knee upon my belly, and risled my pockets of what is mentioned in the indictment. Then one said to the other, Damn your eyes! come along; and pointed to shew me where my hat lay: they ran away. The prisoner held his hand to my throat, and his face was over me all the time they were rifling me. I had a better view of him than the other, but I should know the other if I saw him. I saw the prisoner next morning in a street in Ratcliffe-Highway . I went back that night, after I was robbed, to my brother-in-law's; we went to the field I was robbed in; we saw a man walking there; we asked him who he was: he said he was a friend; there was he and some more of Justice Sherwood's men. The next day we searched about, and saw a great many, but none answered the description; at last we saw three men walking on the other side of the street; they were all taken up; one I had no knowledge of, he was discharged immediately; the two others were carried before a magistrate; one of them was discharged, because I said I did not know the man. It was a light night; it lightened much: I could see distinctly the face of the person who stood over me; the prisoner I am positive is the man.</p>

               <p>I live at No. 3, Stepney-causeway. My husband is a rope-maker. The prisoner is a rope-maker, and was in my house, in the same room with me, on the 12th of June, from a little before nine in the evening till the watchman went eleven. I have known him upwards of six months, and never heard any thing against his character.</p>
               <p>Court. Is your house near the New road, where this robbery was committed? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>A Spectator. It is about half a mile.</p>
               <p>Are you sure as to the time he came to your house? - It was at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>What makes you able to fix the time? - Nothing in particular.</p>
               <p>What did he come to your house for? - To ask how my husband did; my husband being sick a long time, and upon the sick book of the rope-makers: he was a-bed up stairs, and we were down stairs.</p>
               <p>How long was he at your house? - From nine till the watch went eleven.</p>
               <p>Was any body with the prisoner? - Yes; Mary Street, a gentlewoman who lives next door to me, at No. 2, but nobody else: she is an acquaintance of mine: her husband and mine worked together in the same ground. The prisoner spent the evening, and had a pot of beer; he eat some cold leg of mutton; then we had another pot of beer, which my little girl ordered at the King's-Arms; and we passed the evening: by that time the clock went eleven, then he said he must go.</p>
               <p>Who came in first, Mary Street, or the prisoner? - West came first, and went out first; and Mary Street went home to bed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178207030030"></xptr> immediately; she was up till eleven o'clock with us.</p>
               <p>What were you talking about all this time? - Nothing but concerning work; they were talking whether my husband would be able to get up at six next morning to go to work.</p>

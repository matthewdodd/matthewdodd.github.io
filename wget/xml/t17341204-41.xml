            . The Prisoner brought another Man into my Master's Shop, and said, I'll give you a Dram Will; and then put out a Half-penny. D - your Blood, says Will. What do you bring me here for, if you have no more Money? and so they both went out. A 6 Gallon Cask of Brandy was then standing by the Counter near the Door; I saw it there after they were gone out.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173412040019"></xptr> They came in again in two Minutes, and then the Prisoner had got a Penny, and so they call'd for a Quartern Will (as the Prisoner call'd him) drank first, and while my Back was turned went out; the Prisoner then drank, and went out too. I presently mist the Cask, and pursued the Prisoner, and took him within three or four Doors of our Shop. There was no-body but these two in the Shop, from the time I saw the Cask, to the time I mist it.</p>

            , Constable. As I was conducting the Prisoner along. he squeez'd me under the Arm, and said, If you'll let me go I'll make you satisfaction. He deny'd at first that he knew the other Man, but afterwards own'd that he was acquainted with him in Ireland, and said, that he frequented the Black Boy in Newtener's Lane. I and some others went thither to look for him; but there we found about thirty shabby Fellows, who begun to mob us, so that we were glad to get away.</p>

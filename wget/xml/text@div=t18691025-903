                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did you first hear that your little sister had been to Mr. Knox? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> One of my sisters came to me one Saturday, I could not say the day of the month, it was in August, and she told me about it—I think that was about a fortnight afterwards; after Mr. Risley was in custody—I had had no communication with my sister before that, I did not see her till the 12th of this month—I heard that she had been examined at the Police Court, and I borrowed a newspaper to se if it was true, and I saw it in the newspaper; that was the first I saw of it—I had not seen any letter in the newspaper—I had not seen anything of my mother—I have only been confined three weeks—I had no conversation with my little sister before the last Session—I did not know that an application was to be made to postpone the trial, in order to get me to attend; I was here in the other Court, last Session—I know there was a medical certificate—I was subpoenaed to come here last Session—I had had no conversation with my sister at that time, and had not told Mr. Poncione anything—up to the 12th of this month, I had had no conversation with my sister—I had no idea why I was here last Session, or that the trial was to be postponed on account of my confinement—I Was afraid of my confine<lb></lb>ment coming on—I have seen my sister Caroline outside to-day, I believe she has had a subpoena for Mr. Risley, the same as me—we are not the best of friends—my little sister had been to me on the Monday, about a pledge ticket—I knew she was to meet my other sister on the Tuesday, to say that I would not send the pledge ticket—I have not been talking with Caroline about the matter—I did when she came to me on the Saturday, that was when I first heard of my little sister being followed by Mr. Risley—before I was subpoenaed to come here in September, I had not seen any legal gentlemen about the matter; I did not know why they wanted me—I suppose it is three years ago since I heard of Mr. Ernest—I knew of my sister living with him—I never had any proof that they were married—I can't say that she lived with him as his wife—it is not very long ago that I knew Roberts, I should think six or eight months—he does not live with my sister—she does not do anything; she was a prostitute, but she is not now.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was your husband present on 12th October, when Maria came? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—he came in to his tea while she was there—she came with my other sister, and waited outside, and my sister fetched her in—last September I was about being confined—the doctor thought my attendance here might bring on a miscarriage—he told me so—it was with my consent the certificate was used—I came here then because I thought I should like it all over first—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my husband's writing, I knew of his writing it to Mr. Poncione.</p>

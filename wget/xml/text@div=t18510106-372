                  </hi>. I am a nurse, in St. Luke's Workhouse. In consequence of information, I went with two policemen to a house in Blue Anchor-alley, St. Luke's—the prisoner lived there—the officer asked her if she knew a person of the name of Joyce; she said, "Yes"—he said he had brought a person to search the house for some property belonging to the Guardians—she said he was welcome to do so—I said</p>

On the evening of 2nd July, about a quarter to seven, I was on duty in. the Waterloo Road, and saw a large crowd at the top of Tower Street—from information I received, I went to the house of Trotman, the father of the deceased child—I then went to Tower Street Station, and saw the prisoner there—he was under the influ<lb></lb>ence of drink—I could tell that by his excited manner, nothing else parti-cular, only the way that a man in liquor generally has—I did not perceive the smell of liquor—he was charged with being drunk, and with furious driving—I was afterwards informed that the child was dead, and he was then charged with causing its death.</p>

               <p>attention was drawn by a lot of people hallooing, "Stop him! stop him!"—I came to my shop, and saw three men in a horse and cart coming from Waterloo Bridge at a furious rate—the prisoner was one of the three—I should think they were going about twelve miles an hour, that was my idea—there was no obstruction in the road—I looked down the road, and saw nothing, except a little child coming across the road—it was a very short distance from the horse and cart, about the same distance that I am from his lord<lb></lb>ship—at the time I heard the cries it was about thirty yards off, as far as my recollection goes—it was crossing the road to the side where I live—I did not see the slightest slackening of the horse's pace—I believe they were going rather faster—they were whipping the horse at a most tre<lb></lb>mendous rate—I saw the child knocked down—it passed the horse and came in contact with the axletree, and caught its head and turned a som<lb></lb>mersault—the horse went on, I should think, about 150 yards before it was stopped—I did not see it stopped.</p>

I am a clothier, of 75, Waterloo Road—between seven and half-past in the evening of 2nd July I saw the prisoner driving a dogcart, with a pony in it, at a furious rate—there were two gentlemen with him—I heard some men screaming, "Stop!" which drew my attention—I looked up and they were about thirty or forty yards from the child—I had not seen them until then—I am no judge of pace, but the horse was travelling as quick as it possibly could—it was going much faster than it ought to go, and than I had ever done—it was coming down the road at a zigzag rate, first on one side, and then the other—the road was quite empty—the horse was not slackened in its speed—it was being whipped at the time I heard the screams by the prisoner—I saw the child in the road, and then the horse got within about a yard of it—it either shied, or was pulled on one side—my eyes were fixed on the child—the horse passed the child, and the wheel and the axle struck it on the head, and it revolved round—there was plenty of space to have avoided the child—there were six yards on one side, and seven on the other, and there was time to have got out of the way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller—I have been in the prisoner's service nearly a year—I am not at present—I live at 15, Caroline Terrace East, Surrey Grove—on the evening in question I went in the dogcart with him and his brother from the stores towards the stables—I was sitting behind—the horse was not going at a furious pace, at a mode<lb></lb>rate pace—I did not see the accident take place—I first heard cries to pull up—I just turned my head round, to see what was the matter—both the prisoner and his brother tried their utmost to stop the cart—I think they succeeded in stopping it before any one came up—I have driven the horse many times—it is not a particularly fast horse—it requires a good deal of whip to keep him on at all—he generally goes a little faster in going home—I have only been in the dogcart a few times when the prisoner has been driving—he is not in the habit of driving furiously—he is generally a very steady driver—he was perfectly sober on this evening—I have never seen him the worse for drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you go with him in the cart to the warehouse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had been with him about half an hour—we had been to collect an account, and we had a cigar and one glass of beer each—that was all—</p>

               <p>no spirits—I had brandy and water instead of beer—the prisoner had a glass of stout—the place we went to was Mr. St. Aubyn's, a cigar manu<lb></lb>facturer, about three-quarters of a mile or a mile off—that was about twenty minutes before we got to the warehouse—we did not go anywhere else; we did not go fast—the horse was not whipped—it might have been touched up—I did not see it touched up as we came from Waterloo Bridge to where the accident happened—I turned round to see what was the matter—I thought we were very nearly running into a cart—I did not know what was the matter—I saw the prisoner trying to pull up—I did not see the child at all—it was run over before I turned round—I did not hear anybody cry out before we got to the child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller's clerk—on this evening I was walking in Waterloo Road with my little boy, on the oppo<lb></lb>site side of the way to where the prosecutor lives—I heard several women screaming, and saw a child lying in the road—the prisoner had passed it at that time—I did not see it knocked down—I should fancy the cart was going six or seven miles an hour, or it might be eight—from the spot where the child was lying to where the prisoner pulled up I should think was about thirty yards, it might be a little more—I saw him in the act of pulling up, and his brother had the reins as well—that was instantly after the accident—I afterwards saw the prisoner taken to the station he seemed excited from the accident, but it did not seem from drink.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am with a firm in the city, where I have been twelve years—I came forward voluntarily, hearing the prisoner was committed for trial, and spoke of what I saw, and had a sub<lb></lb>poena served on me—I believe the prisoner stopped the horse as soon as he eould—he is an entire stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Redcross Street, Borough—I knew nothing of the prisoner before the accident—I saw it happen—I was coming down the Waterloo Road, and saw the prisoner driving down the road, and I saw him try all his endeavours to stop the horse this side of Webber Row—I did not see the child in the road—he was going about five or six miles an hour, going towards where the accident happened—the horse was not stopped by him—I saw two or three persons run towards the horse's head as he was endeavouring to pull up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Bromley, a carrier, of 13, Webber Street, Blackfriars Road—I saw the dogcart before the accident, and I saw the child in the road, but did not see it fall—I was seven or eight houses off at the time—the horse was going at a rapid pace, and it seemed to me that the prisoner could not control it—that was after the accident—as far as I could see, he was trying to control it—he was in front of me and some distance from me—I saw him afterwards molested and ill-treated—he was not tipsy—he might have had a little, but he was far from being intoxicated.</p>

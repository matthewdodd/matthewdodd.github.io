            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the 28th of February I was in Grub-street, about four o'clock, and saw the prisoner, with this chest on his head - I followed and saw him turn into a court in Haberdashers'-square, and going into the back door of a house where greens and fish are sold - I knew the house before; he was almost on the step of the back door when I said "What have you got there?" he said "I don't know, a man gave it me to carry from Turnstile;" and he was to have 1s. 6d. for it; I detained him, and found Messrs. Coopers' out by the Excise mark - I returned them the tea, and have the chest here.(Chest produced and sworn to.)</p>

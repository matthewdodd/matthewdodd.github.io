I am in the service of Mr. Lyons—on 24th July last, I saw Gower coming out of the shop—I came into the shop as she was going out—the last witness, from something I said to him, showed me a half-crown—I said something to him—I saw Bowen about five minutes after Gower went out—I saw him give Cope a shilling—Cope gave it to me, and asked me to give him two sixpences—I bent the shilling between my teeth, threw it on the counter, and said it was bad—Bowen picked it up, bent it with a weight, said it was quite a mistake, to be sure, and that nobody else should have it—he put it in his pocket, paid with a good shilling, and left the shop—I had seen him in the shop on the Monday before, when I was serving—he asked for two eggs, and gave me a two—shilling piece—I said I had not change, and then he left the shop without being served—he did not take the eggs—I saw what sort of money it was that he put on the counter, for took a half—crown five or six minutes before of a young man—I had change to give, but I said I had not, because I had no one in the shop—I should</p>

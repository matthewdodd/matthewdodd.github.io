On the 16th of September, a little after nine in the evening, she had first shut in the shop, and was shutting the door, when she screamed out thieves! Mrs. Perry being nearer the stairs than I she went down. I went down when the people were gone from about the door. I saw my show-glass was broke, and five of my watches were taken away, all silver. One of them was a new skeleton one, which opens at the back, and shows all the work. I never recovered any of them again. The prisoner was taken, and brought in: his hand was cut and very bloody, done, I suppose, by breaking the glass. I had been gone out of the shop about ten minutes, the watches were there when I left it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Perry. I had just put the shutter on the door, and shut it, when a man pushed the door open, and asked me if my master was at home. I said he was. He came in, and another came in sideways. The first that came in said, I need not call my master. He held a pistol to me, and bid me not to speak a word. The other kept his face towards the show-glass. When my mistress came down, the man left me, and went and held the pistol to her. The other man smashed the glass, and they soon made their escape out of the shop. As soon as I recovered myself, I went up stairs. I should know the first that came in, could I see him; but the other kept his back towards me all the time. By the prisoner's dress, and his size, he resembles that man. They had both blue coats on. The prisoner was brought into the shop in less than three minutes, I believe. He kept his hands in his bosom all the time he was in the shop, which was the best part of an hour.</p>

            . I live next door to Mr. Perry.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176910180018"></xptr> The-clock had just gone nine. I was standing at the door, and saw the prisoner and another man loitering about our window-shutters. I saw the other man go into the prosecutor's shop, and the prisoner follow him. In a minute or two I heard a glass smash, and heard the cry, Stop thieves and robbers! by Mrs. Perry and her servant. I saw the two men run out: the prisoner was the last. One ran down Holborn, and the prisoner ran down Leather-lane. I pursued him. He was not got above thirty yards from Mr. Perry's shop, before I laid hold of him: he was never out of my sight. The street at that time was very clear. He was running as hard as he could. When I laid hold of him, he struggled several times to get away, till assistance came up. I am sure he is the man that I saw at our door, and went in last, and out last, at Mr. Perry's door.</p>
               <p>John Green. I am constable. I saw this young man bringing the prisoner back again. He said, Green, you must take charge of this man. I took him into Mr. Perry's house. The mob was so very great, I could not examine him there, so I took him into my own room, which is just by. I found nothing upon him. I observed from two or three of his fingers the blood run down. I said, If you are innocent of this affair, how came your fingers cut? He said the man took hold of him, ran him up against the wall, and rubbed the skin off. I looked at them. There were four, five, or six different places, all fresh done. It was his right hand. Here is a pistol, (produced in court) which was found loaded about four yards from the place where he was taken.</p>

            . I live close by the prosecutor, and having heard there was a pistol presented to the girl, I asked the young man that took the prisoner, where was the place he took him; he went and shewed me, and about a yard or two from the place, where he shewed me, I picked up this pistol. It lay up against a dead wall.</p>
               <p>Clark. It was found within two or three yards from where I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The watches did not hang above four inches from each other. The show-glass was locked: I had the key in my pocket. The glass was broke in a thousand pieces.</p>

               <p>When I was before my Lord Mayor, I asked this young man whether I made any resistance; he said I did not. I was taken into the house and searched, but nothing was found upon me. Then I was taken into a public-house, and in about half an hour a man brought in a pistol. I am <rs id="t17691018-14-deflabel84" type="occupation">a waiter</rs>

I was coming from an acquaintance, and going along I observed a crowd about the door: they called, Stop thief! I turned round, and was immediately seized by the collar. I asked what he accused me with. He told me for robbing the shop. Then I went back with him.</p>

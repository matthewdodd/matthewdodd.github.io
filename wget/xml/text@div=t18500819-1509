                  </hi>. On 14th Aug., I was in my brother's shop—the pri<lb></lb>soner came in, and presented this seaman's note, and requested me to cash it—I remarked that it was badly written—he said the captain was a good scholar, but a bad writer, and he had known him some years—he selected some clothes—I said on account of imposition I should like to know where he lived—he said he lodged in Tooley-street—I asked where his clothes were—he said, on board a vessel in the London Dock—he asked me to let him have the clothes, and the balance in cash—I did not let him have it, I only let him have a shilling—I wanted to go on board the ship to make inquiries—he said his brother was a housekeeper, and rather than go on board the ship with me, he would call on his brother—I agreed to take his brother's security instead of going on board the ship—the prisoner said he would call on his brother to ascertain if he was at home, and would return in half-an-hour—I waited con<lb></lb>siderably above the half hour, and then I went on board the vessel that the prisoner told me of; I saw the captain, and showed him the note—about ten o'clock that night the prisoner came again and said his brother was out, and he wished me to give him the note back—I sent for the police.</p>

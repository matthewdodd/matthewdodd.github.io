               <p>On the Thursday after the riots were over. at about six o'clock in the evening. I saw the prisoner take the iron range, an iron crane, and an iron back of a grate, out of the kitchen of Mr. Wilmot's house.</p>

             some time.</p>
               <p>How many other people were there? - I believe about twenty. I saw the prisoner getting the range up.</p>
               <p>With what instrument did he do it? - I did not see any instrument; he said he did it by strength. He carried the range away on his head, and the crane on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>There were a number of other people there? - Yes, a number of other people; but they were all against me.</p>
               <p>Did you know any of them besides the prisoner? - I cannot punctually swear to any body.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - I never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Did you see where he carried it to? - No.</p>
               <p>Where was you? - I was above stairs; I heard a wrenching, and went down into the kitchen; I asked him where he was going to carry them; he said to the proper owner.</p>
               <p>He did carry it away, did he? - He did, he offered it for sale on the Friday night, as I am informed.</p>
               <p>Are you sure this is the man, because you say you never saw him before? - I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Do you know if there is any reward, if this man is convicted? - Justice Sherwood said there was forty pounds reward, if the man was convicted.</p>

               <p>- SWEETMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a smith and farrier, in Whitechapel-road; I keep a shop there; the prisoner came on Friday night, I was then in bed; so he came again in the morning, I saw him at about seven o'clock; he pitched the things down in the shop; I said, I am afraid you do not come honestly by these grates; he stood by them when I first saw him; I asked him whether he came honestly by them; he said he did; I told him, I thought he did not; he said he was going a hay-making; I bid him call again at night. I went to Justice Wilmot's, to enquire if they belonged to him or the ruins.</p>
               <p>What did he want to do with the grates? - My man asked him the price of them.</p>
               <p>Was that in your presence? - Yes; he said about three halfpence a pound; I bid him no money for them.</p>
               <p>These grates were brought to your house the night before? - I imagine they were; they were in the shop: when he was gone to hay-making, I went to the justice's, to know if they belonged to him or the ruins; when I came back, the grates were gone to the justice's; he came back at noon, while I was gone to the justice's; my man secured him, and took him and the grates to the justice's.</p>
               <p>What time did you go to the justice's first? - I suppose it might be about ten o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>When you found he was gone, did you go back to the justice's again? - No.</p>

               <p>I am a white-smith; I am servant to the last witness; the prisoner came about seven o'clock on Saturday morning, the 10th of June.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No, never to my knowledge; he brought the grates to the shop about seven o'clock in the morning, and offered them to sale; he asked me if I thought they were worth three halfpence a pound; I immediately told him they were stolen; he said he found them on Tower-hill; I asked him whereabouts on Tower-hill; he said at the fire; afterwards, he said he brought them from Mr. Wilmot's, that he took them out of the brick-work, and likewise three or four more stoves, which he had disposed of; he said, Do not you think they are worth three halfpence a pound? my master said he would have them left till night.</p>
               <p>Was your master present at this conversation? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The whole of it? - Yes; he went up to Whitechapel church, and my master and another man went up to Mr. Wilmot's to know if he had lost a pair of grates; when my master was gone, the man returned either for the money or the grates.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - About half an hour after twelve, I told him my master was not at home, but if he would sit down a little while, he would be in; he went away immediately. Three gentlemen came up, I informed them of the affair; they told me if I did not take the man, I was liable to lie under the same condemnation as he. I went after the prisoner, and brought him back to the shop, and returned to Justice Sherwood's, opposite Whitechapel-church, with the back, crane, and grate. Justice Sherwood told me to mark the grates immediately, which I did.</p>
               <p>Did you mark the crane and all? - It is all a fixture together, I did not mark the crane and back.</p>
               <p>Where is the grate? - At Justice Sherwood's office.</p>

               <p>To Benny. Did you see the grate that was marked by James Wales at the justice's? - I did not see them marked, because I was about other things; I was ordered by a search-warrant to search the prisoner's house; I knew the grates from the parts that hold the brass together. I have been at the fireplace at Justice Wilmot's many a hundred times. I could swear to it among five hundred.</p>

               <p>I was going a hay-making. I heard that Justice Wilmot's house was burnt. I was very sorry to hear it. I went and saw these things lying in the road. I told this smith there was a grate lying in the road. I asked him to let me bring it, and leave it at his house till I could hear of the right owner for it. Benny had hold of the grate; he could not manage it; he asked me to carry the grate, and helped me up with it. I carried the grate, and then he desired me to fetch the back. I carried them home to my own house on Friday, and went and enquired for Mr. Wilmot; a woman told me he was in the country, and would not return for two or three days. As I am a sinner to God he helped it on my head. I carried it to this good man's house at eight o'clock that night; he would not take it in. I carried it back to my own house; my wife was vexed at my bringing it home, and in the morning I carried it to that house. He said it was a valuable grate, and could not come from the fire. I said I did not know, it lay before the house. I thought I had as much right to take this grate as others had to take old iron.</p>
               <p>To Benny. Is it true that you desired the prisoner to carry away the grate, and helped it on his head? - No; I asked him what he was going to do with it; he said he was going to carry it to the proper owner.</p>
               <p>Jury. You saw him pull it out of the brick-work? - I did; at the same time I was in danger of having my brains knocked out by the mob.</p>

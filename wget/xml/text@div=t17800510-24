               <p>MATTHEW THOMPSON sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 7th of April, at about seven in the evening, while I was sitting in a back room adjoining to Mr. Mashador's shop, I heard a window break (he <rs id="t17800510-24-viclabel132" type="occupation">keeps a pawnbroker's shop</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17800510-24-victim292 t17800510-24-viclabel132"></join>). I ran out to see what it was, there was nobody there; but I observed that the window was broke by the plate board. I went in again and told Mrs. Mashador that her window was broke; and I thought there were some thieves about; she desired me to shut up the shop. I said no, I would watch them if I could; I went and stood in a publick-house opposite; the prisoner and two more came by the publick-house; they were in discourse; they looked at our house. About a minute after I saw the prisoner looking at the plate in the window by himself; he looked about on one side and the other, and then put his hand into the hole and drew something out; I could not see what it was; as soon as he had done so he held his hand down by his side and walked two or three steps, and then fell a running. I ran across the way and catched hold of him about three doors from our house; we had a struggle together; and one of the men, who were with him came up and swore at me, and asked me what I had to do with the man? I got hold of him by the collar. I said, I had him safe and would not let him go; he threw the spoon into the highway. I took up the spoon and carried him to a publick-house.</p>
               <p>(The spoon was produced in court and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

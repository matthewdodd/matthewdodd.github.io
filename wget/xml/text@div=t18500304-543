                  </hi>. I live in Lamb's Conduit-street, and am head waiter at Freemason's Tavern. I have known the prisoner eight or nine years—I did not know Mr. Adlard till about the middle of last year, when he came to a dinner at the Tavern—I had dealings with the prisoner—I considered I was dealing with him on his own account—in July there was between 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due from me to him; and in consequence of receiving a letter from him, I allowed him to draw this bill for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on me—this is my acceptance to it—the amount owing to him was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the remainder was to be made up, as I expected to have some more things of him for the boys—I have looked for the letter, and have not found it—he said in it would I allow him to draw on me at six months after, date for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the account was enclosed in the envelope—I sent one of the boys to the prisoner, and he got one suit and one other jacket, making the whole amount 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but his wife owed my wife something, and the bill was drawn for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left the money with my wife to pay this bill on the 4th of Jan.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Adlard's employ—the prisoner was his foreman. In July last I received two pieces of cloth from him in the shop—I did not see him cut them off—by the prisoner's desire I took a jacket home,</p>

               <p>made it, and took it to Mr. Banks in Lamb's Conduit-street next day—I made up a second jacket, by the prisoner's direction, and took it to Banks—I received the trimmings at the time I received the first cloth, they were in it—I was paid for the making them, on the Saturday night—the prisoner paid me from the till—these are the two jackets—I cannot tell whether the cloth was Mr. Adlard's, or where the trimmings were taken from—I saw the sleeve-lining of the second jacket cut from the piece—the padding and lining were Mr. Adlard's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and draper, of 254, High Holborn—the prisoner was my foreman upwards of ten years—he had no right to do any business on his own account—his wages were 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—if he received any orders it was his duty to enter them in the order-book which I have here—in July here is an entry of a suit to Mr. Banks for Master Banks—the price is two guineas—if any articles were delivered and not entered in the book I should have no means of knowing that they were supplied—I have no entry here of another jacket—if the prisoner had been paid any money on account of any of these things, by bill or otherwise, it would have been his duty to tell me—all cash affairs are balanced the same day—he had no authority to draw any bill on Banks, to my knowledge—he has never paid me any money on account of these jackets, or for this bill—I believe them to be made out of cloth on my premises—I have a piece here to compare with them—the prisoner was dismissed on 19th Jan.—on looking over the order-book I spoke to him about Banks's account—he said, "It is all right. Sir; Banks will settle that at Christmas."</p>

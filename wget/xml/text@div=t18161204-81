               <p>Q. Which way were you going-A. I had got half-way down the street. I was coming form Piccadilly into Swallow-street, then across Hanover-square, Bond-street, into Grosvenor-square. When I was in the square, S. Bond came up to me, and asked if I had got any money? I said, No; she then took my neck-handkerchief. The prisoner Smith took hold of my hands, and told Bond to look for my money. I called out to the watchman, and he came up; Bond ran away, but I took hold of Smith, and gave her in charge; I had lost my handkerchief, and 1s. 5d. in money, which was in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Bond. Did you not give me the handkerchief - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Smith. Did you not give me the 1s. 5d. - A. I did not; I was quite sober at the time.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GAFFER. I am a watchman; I heard a cry of watch, about a quarter past eleven o'clock; I saw the prisoner, Bond, run round the corner of Grosvenor-street, into Bond-street, shortly afterwards I saw the prosecutor come out of the Half-Moon Coffee-house, which is three doors from Bond-street, he had hold of the prisoner Smith; he told me that she had taken 1s. 5d. from him, and that another girl had taken his handkerchief. I told Smith to give him the money, she said she had not got it; I took her to the watch-house; she did not say he had given it to her. It was after eleven o'clock. Smith was not searched; she said that Bond had got the handkerchief and money. I found Bond, in Bond-street.</p>

            . I belong to the watch-house; Smith was brought in by the watchman; when the prosecutor came in, he said, that she was not the girl who took the money, but he charged her with assisting the other girl. I could not understand him. Bond was brought in afterwards. They were put into the lock-up-house, in which there is a water-closet; it was a cold night, and I ordered them up to warm themselves, when I found this handkerchief in the water-closet. I do not know which of them put it there.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you must have been an hour going from your master's to Grosvenor-square-A. I know it was ten o'clock. I had to call first by St. George's Church, Hanover-square - I did not stop there.</p>

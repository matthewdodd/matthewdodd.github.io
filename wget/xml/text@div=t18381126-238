                  </hi>. I am a bugleman in the first battalion of the rifle brigade. I had a watch and key safe on the 16th of October—I had it in my pocket at the Two Brewers at Maid stone, at a quarter before ten o'clock at night—I got drunk, but was sober enough to know that I had it then—I went to sleep at the Two Brewers—I awoke about eleven o'clock, my watch, purse, and other things were gone—my watch had been in my pocket—this is my watch and key—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

I have a brother in the rifle brigade—I went into the Two Brewers that night—the prisoner and another came in—I know the prisoner—he was in there drinking—they were talking one to another—I asked him for a piece of tobacco—he gave it to me, and I fell asleep—when I awoke he was gone, and the prosecutor's watch was lost.</p>

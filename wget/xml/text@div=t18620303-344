I live near the National School at Hanwell—on 21st February, I left my house, about 8 o'clock, to go to work—I locked it, and left it quite safe—all the windows and doors were fastened—I locked the outer door—about 12 o'clock in the day, I was fetched home by my neighbour, Charlotte Borrows—I went first to the police-station, and then to my house, and found the outer door broken open—I missed a black cloth coat, a pilot jacket, a pair of trousers, a brown cloak, a black shawl, a black cap, two pairs of stays, two pairs of stockings, two shawls, one scarf, two brass candle sticks, and other property—these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are all mine, and my husband's—they were all safe in my house when I left that morning—they were in drawers and boxes, not locked—I had last seen them on the day before—I saw the two prisoners about half-past 10 that morning, before my house was robbed—they passed the yard where I was at work—they saw me—that was not the yard attached to my house—it is a yard about ten or twelve minutes walk from my house—I watched them to the top of the lane that leads to my house—they were then about three or four minutes walk from my house—I was attending a sick person—I had seen the prisoners on the Tuesday morning before that—I knew them again, and am sure they are the men.</p>

                  </hi>. I live near Mrs. Cheasley, at Hanwell, and am the wife of William Thomas Burrows—about 12 o'clock, on 21st February, I saw the two prisoners in Mrs. Butler's garden, a garden adjoining Mrs. Butler's house, which adjoins Mrs. Cheasley's—I am sure the prisoners are the men—Mrs. Butler's and Mrs. Cheasley's are the only two cottages there—the men had two large bundles in their hands, and one had an umbrella—I spoke to Thomas Chapman who was near—the prisoners saw that and they ran and jumped over into Mr. Baker's market garden—I ran up to the village to give the alarm, and then returned home—I had seen those two men on the Tuesday before—they came past my house—I am quite sure they are the men—they ill used my dog on that occasion—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the kind of umbrella that I saw.</p>

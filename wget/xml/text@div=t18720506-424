I keep the Bricklayer's Arms, Chelsea—on Sunday morning, 7th April, I was aroused by a policeman about 3 o'clock—I had closed the house at 11 o'clock, and made every thing fast—I found all the pulls of the beer engine part of the way down—I missed two boxes of cigars, some tobacco, some glasses, a tea canister, two bottles of cordial, two pictures, and a beer can—I found the back window partly open—I saw the beer can in the hands of the police—it has my name on it—I have seen the prisoners in my house.</p>

On this Sunday morning, at a few minutes past 3 o'clock, I was on duty, and saw the two prisoners, and a man not in custody—Collard had this can, full of beer—they went into No. 35, where Collard lives—there had been an altercation in the garden, and Collard shammed drunkenness and fell down, and Cannon pulled him into the house—I said "Where did you get this beer?"—he said "From my mate's house"—the other man escaped—I took the prisoners, and sprang my rattle and got assistance—I then went to the rear of the house, and found it had been broken into—I searched Collard's house, and found a quantity of cigars, this can, these cigar boxes, and other articles, which the prosecutor identifies.</p>

On Mon<lb></lb>day night, the 8th of February, I lost a bundle of things from a cart, in Great Prescott-street, where I had stopped to inquire about some harness which I wished to purchase—I went to different pawnbrokers, and among others, to Sowerby's, in Cable-street, Whitechapel—I went to No. 10, Lambeth-street, on the Friday, and there found the prisoner and another person, named Williams, in the same room—the officer took them both—we took the prisoner to Sowerby's, and on leaving there, a woman called to me—when I got back to the shop I saw a piece of flannel and a towel in the hands of a boy belonging to the shop—I held it up in prisoner's pre<lb></lb>sence, and said I could swear that flannel was in the bundle I had lost—the prisoner said she never had it, and they would swear her life away—the shop-boy said the prisoner was the party who redeemed the article the day after it was pawned—I know this flannel by the way it is made—it was in the list of articles in the bundle—the bundle was handed to me in South-street, on Monday—I did not miss it till the following morning, but I never left the cart, except in Prescott-street, on my road.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at Greenwich fair, on Tuesday evening, the 21st of April—I lost my handkerchief out of my coat pocket—I did not feel it taken—the officer tapped me on the shoulder, and asked if I missed it, and I did—he produced it at the office at Greenwich—the prisoner was taken up immediately, and admitted taking it out of my pocket—he appeared very agitated, and said hunger compelled him to do it.</p>

I was on duty at the fair, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening—I watched the prisoner, and saw him feel in the prosecutor's pocket—after some time he walked away—I asked the prosecutor if he had lost any thing—he said yes, his handkerchief—I went after the prisoner, and drew his hand out of his pocket, with the handkerchief round it—I asked him what handkerchief it was—he said it was his—I said you have just picked this gentleman's pocket of it—he said he had not—the prosecutor said his handkerchief had been bitten by a dog, and had two pieces torn out and darned; and there were those marks—the prisoner said next morning, that he was induced by some boys to do it.</p>
               <p>(Charles Bethell, the prisoner's brother, a cabinet-maker; George Jacques, fancy cabinet-maker, Old-street; Henry M'Donald, and Francis Farren, French-polishers, gave the prisoner a good character.)</p>

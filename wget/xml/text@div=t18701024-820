                  </hi>. I live at 3, Kepple Mews, North, and assist my father, a livery stable-keeper—the prisoner was in his service, and has been so, I believe, nearly two years—there has been an intimacy between her and me on two occasions—on 3rd August I went to bed about 12 o'clock, and after I had been asleep, the prisoner came and said "Let me get into bed," or words like that—I told her no I did not wish to have anything to do with her, and told her to go away—I had not had intimacy with her for twelve months, not since the end of September, or the beginning of October, last year—she asked me if I had seen a girl at Margate, but I gave her no satisfactory answer—I told her to go away, and went to sleep—I left no light in the room, but I always draw the blind up and there is a gas<lb></lb>light outside—I awoke about 6 o'clock in the morning, and found myself very</p>

               <p>weak, and saturated with blood, and my head was wounded in several places—the bed was covered with blood—the prisoner was in the room, and I said "What have you done"—I forget what she said; I told her to go and call my sister—she said "Don't call your sister, let me go down stairs and open the door and say some one has come out of the street and done it"—I said "No" and she went up to her own room—I got out of bed and rang the bell till my sister came—a doctor was fetched and I was under his care about a month—my bands were also injured, I could not use this one for several weeks, and one arm was much bruised—I am now going to be married—the prisoner said to me about three months previous to this "You shall have no other girl but me, I would do for you first, I would not mind being hanged"—I went to live at my father's house last September twelve months—I have seen this hatchet before, it was kept in the kitchen—I saw nothing in the prisoner's hand when I awoke—there was a large wound on my head, which I think must have been struck several times; a cut here and there on my forehead, and my eye-brow was laid pen—I have the scars now—she was partially dressed, she had a dark coloured skirt on, and I do not know whether she had her night dress or not—I had said nothing to her about coming to my room that night, I had scarcely seen her for three weeks—I cannot tell how long before I became conscious the attack was made, but the blood had partially stopped.</p>

Q.</hi> What age are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Twenty-nine—I did not seduce the prisoner, she came to me—that was at the end of September last year, it was a mutual arrangement—she came to my bed for me to seduce her; I had told her that she might come if she liked, and she came—that was the first time—I had taken liberties before and she did not resent them, that began a few days after I went to live at my father's—she ran up stairs and I knocked at her door and asked her to let me in, and she refused—I do not know whether it was locked, but I would not open it—I do not know whether I had seduced her before that, but it was most likely before—I was in the habit of going into the kitchen when she was alone, and taking liberties with her—she did not constantly refuse me—she only ran away that once—I was not constantly trying to seduce her, but I was playing and larking with her—I did not promise her marriage—I was only intimate with her twice—I do not know the dates, the first time was when I allowed her to come into my room—I had told her some months before the wounding that I would have nothing to do with her, and I may have repeated it—a young lady visited me and the family—I did not tell the prisoner that I was going to marry that young lady, nor did she intreat me not to do so as I had promised her marriage—I never promised her—when I told her to go out of my room I do not suppose it was in a very agreeable tone—my father and my two sisters lived in the house—the prisoner was the only servant.</p>

I am the prosecutor's sister—I live at 3, Kepple Mews—on the morning of 4th August, I was awoke by the ringing of the bell in my brother's bed-room, but I thought it was the front-door bell—the prisoner, who slept in the next room to me on the second-floor, called to me "Some one is ringing the bell, Misa" (my brother slept on the first-floor)—I went down to my brother's room, intending to answer from his window; I asked</p>

               <p>him if he heard the bell, he said "I rang it"—his voice was scarcely audible, he was too weak to speak—he said that his head was cut open—I saw some<lb></lb>thing black on the bed, I drew up the blind, which the prisoner must have drawn down, and then saw that the bed was covered with blood, and that there was a wound on my brother's head and hand—I had no light—I called or father and my sister; and some time after, as I was going up stairs, I met the prisoner, who appeared to be dressed and washed in the ordinary way; her hair did not look as if she had been in bed—I said "Mary, what do you think of yourself now?"—that was in consequence of something my brother told me—she said "I could kill myself"—I found this hatchet in a cellar in the kitchen, it had a great deal of blood on the flat part of it, and a few hairs—my brother slept on an iron bedstead—there was a great quantity of spote of blood on the paper of the room, and blood in all directions.</p>

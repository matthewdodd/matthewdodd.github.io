               <p>Jones. I am a shoemaker, a master; I keep a shop in White Lyon-street. On Monday the 8th of July, a neighbour came to me, and desired me to go and see after a bullock that had strayed that way, and to disperse the mob; with that I went up and went round the street, past Mr. Potter's house, with that I went across the way to the lare, and the bullock was got up, locked up; when I got there, there was the mob, and I stopped to see what became of them, and this lad and some more went on to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110134"></xptr>Angel, and then they turned back; and went up White Lion-street, and past my door; I followed the prisoner at the bar about fifty yards behind them; when he got to Mr. Potter's door he made a stand; with that I made a bit of an halt likewise, and he looked himself a little about across the way; there is a public house opposite, and I see him take up the handkerchiefs, a bundle however, which were laid in a sopha at Mr. Potter's door, where there were other articles put out at the door; after that he took the bundle, and he put it under his great coat, then he made off as quick as he could, and I after him, and I hallooed stop thief! then he turned the corner into Banner-street; I never lost sight of him till I took him; he dropped the property in Banner-street, about the middle of the street, I saw him drop it, but I did not stay to see him pick it up; the lad picked it up and brought it me while I had the prisoner in custody. (The property produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this you went round and took this man? - About four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court to Potter. When did you last see these at your door? - That day about three o'clock in the afternoon; it was then laying on the sopha before the door; I know them to be mine by my own mark, of my own hand writing, 2 s. 3 d. 2 s. 6 d. 2 s. 9 d. and 3 s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was that day asked out to dinner at Cannonbury House, turning up White Lion street, I heard the cry of stop thief! with that I ran, and I was taken running, and Mr. Jones said that I was the person that took the property, which I am as innocent of as a child unborn.</p>

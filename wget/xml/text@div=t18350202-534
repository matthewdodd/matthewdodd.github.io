                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Risley. We live in Sandford Cottages, at Hackney—we have a water-butt in our front garden—on the 2nd of January I was at work in the evening, and heard a rush of water, about half-past six o'clock—I went out, and found the cock was gone from the butt—this is it—I know it by the marks on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who made these marks? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My husband did, with the pincers, when we could not turn the cock—it was safe about five o'clock in the evening—the house stands alone—I saw the cock again on the Wednesday after I lost it—the Coach-and-Horses public-house is at the top of the lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Coach-and-Horses when the prisoner came in with this cock—he put it on the table, and said he had it for sale—I looked at it, as I had known him fifteen or sixteen years, and said I would try to sell it for him—I went to look for my landlord, who I thought would buy it, but he was gone—I took it in again—the prisoner said he wanted something—I told him I had no money, but I would borrow 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I did; and when my landlord came, I showed it him, but it would not do—it was for sale in my place—Mrs. Risley heard of it, and came there for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you not left out part of your story? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I know of—I did not want the cock—the prisoner made no secret of it—he said he had picked it up.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 144.) I took the prisoner on the following morning—I had been in the habit of meeting him with the work-people every night, but that night he did not come, which gave me suspicion that he had done wrong.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

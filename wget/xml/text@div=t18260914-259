            . I am an officer, and was in the watch-house when Mudd brought the prisoner; he thought at first he had one shilling more, but he recollected afterwards he had spent a shilling; the prisoner said she had had good luck that night, and would soon show what money she had; she pulled out two half-crowns, five shillings, and a sixpence, and said that was all she had; I said, "Come, now I must have a search;" she put her hand into her pocket again, and pulled out 3d., and between them was the sovereign, which she said she did not know she had, but gentlemen were in the habit of giving a sovereign, instead of a shilling, in the dark.</p>

This man was in the company of two women - he left them and came to me - he took me up a court and offered me a shilling, which I took, and put into my pocket; he wanted to take very indecent libertles with me - I would not let him, and he gave charge of me.</p>

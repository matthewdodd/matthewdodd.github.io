This day week, being the 15th of May, about three or four o'clock, the two girls at the bar came into my shop to cheapen some things: I was out; but after the robbery was committed I was call'd home; there were the two prisoners; I asked them what they knew nothing of them: they were searched, and only a single halfpeny was found upon them.</p>

            . I am wife to the prosecutor: the two prisoners came into our shop, and asked the price of a wax necklace; I reached some down, and while I was shewing them to Arthur, Kinnaston went to another drawer in another part of the shop, and asked the price of other things; I bid her let them alone: there were two mock-garnet necklaces lying in that drawer, with several other things; they staid about eight or nine minutes; they bought nothing: after they were gone, a gentleman came into the shop and asked if I had lost any thing: I then looked and missed a mock-garnet necklace which Arthur had asked the price of. I miss'd two bead-collars, three bunches of mock-garnets, and a garnet knob that belonged to a three drop ear-ring. The gentleman said they were gone down the next alley: I sent

Bringing them back, Kinnaston made a sham to tie up her garter, while the other stood before her to hide her with her petticoats. I saw Kennaston drop something into the kennel, and put her foot upon them. A gentleman coming by, tuck'd up his russles, and took up these bunches out of the dirt.</p>

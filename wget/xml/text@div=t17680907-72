               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>From what I had conceived and collected from discourse between my father and mother, this was mine upon my coming to age; my father is at these years reduced to a degree of insanity, he cannot recollect one half hour what he spoke the last; I am fully persuaded if my mother and sister were here, they would coincide perfectly in what I advance in every respect; as to the transfer, I signed nothing but my own name; if I had been conscious I was doing wrong, I should have made but one transfer, and took all the money at once; I did not act with any view of defrauding, therefore I most humbly hope you will take it in the most favourable consideration and construction; I am not particularly desirous of calling my father.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a plate layer, of 28, High Street, North Woolwich—on 28th July I was at the North Woolwich public-house, and the prisoner, Henry Shadd, put his hand on my shoulder and asked me if I was going home—he then snatched my watch from my waist-coat pocket, struck my mouth and made it bleed, and passed my watch to one of his mates—I got hold of him round the arms, held him till a policeman came, and gave him in custody—I did not see the other prisoner then, but after Henry had been remanded by the Magistrate, William came to me and said that he knew where the watch was, and he would give it to me if I would not prosecute his brother—I said that I would not, and he took the watch out of a white pocket handkerchief and gave it to me—I was afterwards told that I should get into trouble if I did not prosecute, so I told the sergeant, who took him in custody—this is my watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Henry Shadd.</hi> I was not lying asleep on a chair at the Three Crowns—you tried to get away from me, and your mates tried to get you away—you stayed on the stairs with me, and said "You had better search those who are behind and send for a policeman"—the landlord turned me out and said that I had no watch on me—when we got outside you were free, you did not attempt to run away because a policeman was there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman K</hi> 46). On 1st August, Smith pointed out William Shadd to me and I took him, and said that he very likely would be charged with receiving a watch and chain, knowing them to be stolen—he said "I know different to that, last evening a man came up to me in Albert Road, who I do not know, and gave me the watch and chain and asked me to have them passed back to the prosecutor, and said that he wanted a little recompense, but I did not give him anything"—I took him to the station and charged him with receiving—I found the broken bow of another watch on him—I was present on the night of the robbery, Smith appeared sober, the prisoner Henry accused him of being drunk—I said he is not drunk; he smelt a little of drink; he appeared to know very well what he was about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">William, Shadd 'produced a written defence, stating that on the night after the robbery a man gave him the watch, stating that he picked it up under one of the tables at the Three Crowns, and asked him to restore it; to release his brother; who was his only support, and that he picked up the watch bow some months ago.</hi>

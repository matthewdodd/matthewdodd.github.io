            . I am shopman to Mr. Gibbins. On Saturday, the 31st of December, somewhat better than half past five in the evening, about half an hour after I lit the candles, I was at the desk, and heard a noise at the window, some thing similar to an umbrella going against the window; I took no notice of it at first, until it was again repeated; I then went to the window, and saw a persons arm in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the window been cracked - A. It was a little cracked about ten minutes before; it was a large square, and two large pieces were taken out, the two pieces were taken clean out, and another strait cut down the center of the glass remaining, it did not appear as if broken, it appeared cut, half of it appeared to have been cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon seeing the arm in, did you make to the party, and seize the party - A. Yes, I seized him in the act of taking the cloth in his hands; that person is the prisoner now at the bar; I took him into the shop; the cloth was in his hands, which I took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cloth removed - A. Yes, it was out of the window, whether the whole of it was out of the window I cannot say, but the most part of it was clearly out of the window; it had been removed from the spot where it lay; that I am clear in.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you think it laid from the window - A. We have a show board, the cloth was laid out spread on the show board, it laid away from the window, it could be got no way but by putting the arm in; he could have got it by putting the arm in about seven inches I should suppose. I sent for a constable, and had him secured.</p>
               <p>Q. You seized him outside of the shop, of course - A. Yes; at that time the light was quite gone; there was light enough from the shop window to discover the countenance of a man, but not day-light; day-light had been gone some time. I delivered him over to the constable; he was committed. This is the piece of cloth, I have kept it ever since; it is worth eight or nine shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing when you laid hold of him - A. No, not till I brought him into the shop, the substance of what he said was to let him go, he would not run away. The cloth is my master's property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am quite innocent of the crime that is alledged against me; I went up to Mr. Pollto's, it took my whole attention to look at the gass-light; a young man said, he should like a piece of that scarlet cloth; two little boys came running along, and throwed my arm in the window; I am quite innocent.</p>

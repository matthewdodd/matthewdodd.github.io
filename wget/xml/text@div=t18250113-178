On returning home, about half-past one o'clock on the morning of the 13th of January, I was told by my brother that some fowls were missing. I went to look, and found nine were gone. I cannot say when I had seen them all together. Suspecting persons were in the lane, I took a different route. Hearing some voices, I returned, and placed two patrols at the end of the lane. The prisoner and another were together. I secured the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182501130066"></xptr>prisoner myself, with two of the fowls hanging on his shoulder - they were quite warm. I gave him to the patrol, but he got away from him.</p>

            . I am a patrol. Last Thursday morning, at half-past one o'clock, I met Brewin - he told me if I should see any persons to stop them. He returned and told me some persons were in the lane, and to stand at the corner and he would go down and meet them. He went down and met the prisoner, and secured him. I tried to stop the other, but could not.</p>

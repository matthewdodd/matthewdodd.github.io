               <p>Q.When was the money put into the cupboard - A. About an hour before we went to the club. The prisoner, me, and my husband, went to the club together.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you put into this cupboard - A. Four pounds five shillings in copper, in five shilling papers put up; my husband put it there in my presence, and in her presence; she took two pounds five shillings in halfpence and pence both.</p>
               <p>Q. You went together to the club, and came home together - A. Yes, and a man of the name of Powers came home with us from the club, but he had never been at our place before.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home from the club did you miss them - A. No, me and my husband had some words, and she went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her open the cupboard - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you find that any thing was taken - A. In about half an hour after we came home.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you saw her open the cupboard did you miss it - A.About ten minutes; we found it out by seeing a handkerchief with the remainder of the halfpence that she did not take away. She took the handkerchief with the four pounds five shillings from the cupboard, and those that she did not take away laid on the floor where she had been sitting.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found the handkerchief in which the whole four pounds five shillings had been in, and in which there was two pounds in five shilling papers - A. Yes, the prisoner quitted her lodgings the next morning quite early; she lived near me, within a few doors. She came to my house last Monday five weeks, and my husband sent for an officer and she was examined at Queen-square office.</p>

               <p>Q. There were none of the halfpence found on her - A. No, we did not see her until we took her up.</p>

            . I came from the club with Mr. and Mrs. Myler. I saw the prisoner go to the cupboard; she took out a bundle from the cupboard; I saw her put five shilling papers into her pocket; the bundle was wrapped up in a handkerchief; I saw her put it down by her; she was sitting on a stool. I saw her three times take something out of the bundle and put it into her pocket. After she went out of the house Myler complained of being robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Myler. Have you got the halfpence here that remained - A. No, none of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they good halfpence or bad - A. They were passable halfpence, new and old together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is all malice; on this day this woman came to me to pawn a petticoat for her; I did, for three shillings and sixpence; she asked me to go to the club with them; we were all in liquor; she was not able to stand. I had always a suspicion that she went with my husband, and when my husband informed me that she accused me of taking two pounds worth of halfpence, I went to her and said I would have it settled; I know nothing of the halfpence; she lodged with me all the time my husband was abroad. I never saw her with a halfpenny.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Myler. Did she pawn any thing for you to raise three shillings and sixpence that day - A.She did, for the purpose of lending it to her unknown to my husband. I dare not to have touched these halfpence.</p>

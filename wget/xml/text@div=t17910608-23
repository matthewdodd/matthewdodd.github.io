               <p>I keep the Salisbury coffee-house; the last witness is my sister-in-law. On the 20th of last month the prisoner came to me to be hired as a <rs id="t17910608-23-deflabel138" type="occupation">cook</rs>

I saw Mrs. Hooper afterwards, and it was a fiction. She had given her no order, she had lived with her. On Saturday the 28th, the day week after I hired her, she went out, and returned much the worse for liquor; she went out the second time, and did not return till near eleven o'clock, very much intoxicated, and went to bed: about one o'clock my wife came down to me to inform me that her sister had been robbed; I went up to her room and enjoined them silence; accordingly I recollected the Brown Bear in Bow-street, and went there, and staid till Croker came in; I then went with him to my house, and opened the business to my waiter, and had him examined, and had his box opened, and nothing was found; we then proceeded up to the prisoner's room, she was locked in and in bed; after some time we got her to unlock the door, and let us in, and then seized the prisoner's pockets; and in one pocket we found some silver and some copper, and in the other four guineas and two half guineas, and the paper and rush-box, and the bank-note in it.</p>

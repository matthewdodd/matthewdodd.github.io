                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Wellesley beer-house, at Woolwich—on Monday, 21st January, the prisoner came in there about half-past 11 in the morning, and called for half a pint of porter—he put down a fourpenny piece—I saw that it was bad, marked it, and gave it back to him, telling him it was bad—he asked me what I meant, and then put down a shilling, which I thought was bad—I told him I did not like the looks of it, and gave it him back—he then gave me a good shilling, and I gave him a sixpence and 5 d. in copper—upon that, he took off his coat and wanted to fight; he was very abusive—he left my house about five minutes after that—in consequence of what had happened. I followed him—I saw him sort his money and put something, which I suppose was money, into his mouth—after that I saw him go into several shops and public-houses, one after the other—I saw him go into the Royal Albert—after he came out, I went in and asked a question—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the fourpenny piece and shilling that he gave me—here is the mark that I made on the four-penny piece.</p>

I am the landlord of the General Havelock beerhouse, Woolwich—yesterday week, between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in there and asked for a pint of half-and-half—I drew it for him, and, upon that, he threw down a fourpenny piece—I supposed it to be bad, the moment I saw it, and prevented him from drinking the beer—the prosecutor and a constable came in in less than three minutes—I gave the prisoner in custody, and gave the policeman the fourpenny piece—it passed through no one else's hands.</p>

               <p>General Havelock—when he drank his porter, he put down a fourpenny piece—I put it in the till, and gave him, in change, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I had no other fourpenny piece in the till, when I pat that one in—the prisoner went out at one door, and Mr. Chown came in at the other—I then examined the fourpenuy-piece, and discovered it to be bad—I gave it to the constable, who is here.</p>

Mr. Chown called upon me to take the prisoner into custody—I went into the General Havelock, where I received this fourpenny-piece, and took the prisoner into custody—I also got this fourpenuy-piece (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mr. Wickham—after I got the prisoner to the station, I searched him, and found this bad shilling, one good shilling, and 5 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.

                  </hi>. These two fourpenny-pieces are bad, and from the same mould—the shilling is a farthing altered into a shilling; ground down, and then flattened out; afterward malted, and then washed over with silver.</p>

I had a half-sovereign, a sixpence, and a peony-piece when I went out that day; I changed the half-sovereign at a public-house; 1 went on further and stood six-pennyworth with a potman at another public-house; I went across to Woolwich with a party to have something to drink; I then bad 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket; I went into a public-house, and called for half a pint of beer, and they gave me two fourpenny-bits, and a threepenny-<hi rend="italic">bit</hi>; I had been drinking rather freely; I said, "I don't like this little fiddling money, can't you give me copper?" the landlady said she had no other money than that; I walked about first into one house and then into another, and found I was rather on the drink; as to knowing what money I had. I knew nothing about it scarcely; as to the shilling, I know not where I took, it; I get my living honestly enough.</p>

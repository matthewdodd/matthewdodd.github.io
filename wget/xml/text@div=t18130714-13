             I saw him when he came on board the hulks, I think it was in the year 1801. One morning he was told out with the gang to go to work; he escaped from the gang and got away; he was absent from the morning before dinner until the next day, the whole of the night; he missed the muster three times. I was on board at the time; I saw him brought back by the persons employed to look after them when they escape.</p>

               <p>Q. What was it about - A. I do not think any thing particular passed that I can speak to. The papers produced were to copy the same as the others, but they were never made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you took any refreshment upon that occasion at the Swan tavern - A. Yes, I think some tongues and wiches, and some sherry.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, in the month of September, had you any meeting at the Horn tavern - A. Yes, we met both on Friday the 4th, and Saturday the 5th.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these drafts received previous to that time - A. Yes, they were received on the 3rd of September; the money was received for them genuine checks on the 3rd of September, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you present them together or separate - A. Together, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. How was you paid for them - A. I think I received a twenty-pound note, and some small notes in payment.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Hill in town at that time - A. No, I think not; I understood he was out of town, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. When he gave the checks was any thing said - A. Not by Hill to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, you say you had a meeting at the Horn on the 4th, you were there then - A. Yes, Badcock, Cook myself, and I think Brady was there. Brady was there on the 5th I am sure; I am not positive as to the 4th; I am positive Badcock was on the 4th.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done on the 4th - A. There were some forged drafts sent out for payment then; the check in question was presented on the 5th. It was agreed on the 4th that the whole should be sent for payment; the mode was settled, Badcock was to send them by a porter for the bankers to pay them.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you say they should be sent, you mean the forged checks - A. Yes, a number of them. I was to go and see if they were paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. You met again on the 5th - A Yes, at the Horn tavern; there were myself, Badcock, Cook, and Brady, on the 5th; we four were present. Soon after I went there Brady and Cook went away; I saw them no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing been agreed on before Cook, and Brady, went away - A. There were other people in the coffee-room, little could be said; we were to send the check to the house of Robarts and Company, which we did do; Badcock delivered them to a porter; Badcock and I went together; we went to several places, and sent several checks. The check of Burchall and Company that was sent from the White Bear in Basinghall-street; Badcock delivered it to the porter to take to the house of Robarts and Company for payment; I followed the porter to the house of Robarts. I kept him in sight all the way; I followed him into Robarts's house; I saw the check presented; it was received and paid. I had some country notes payable at Robarts's house at the same time; I obtained the country notes for that purpose of having something to do when the check was presented, the plan was my own entirely; it was well understood by them that I should go in under that pretence.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the check actually received - A. I did; I followed the porter to where he was sent off, to near the White Bear; I think he came to him in the street; I saw Badcock receive it. The moment the check was paid I went and informed Badcock of it; I had but little way to go; he was in the neighbourhood; I came out of the house with the porter and got a little way before him; I went and told Badcock that the man had succeeded, before the porter saw him and that evening I accompanied Badcock to the Bolt and Tun Bouvierie-street, there we divided three thousand eight hundred pounds. Badcock retained three fifths, and delivered me two for Cook and myself; the other three were for Hill, Brady, and himself, as I understood. I saw Brady on the following Monday that something was done on the house of Ladbroke. I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the month was Monday - A. I think the 7th; I never saw him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay him any money then - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Pell. You have been on board the hulks, have not you - A. Yes, for seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen during the period of your life that you have been tried for any other felony, and punished besides that which you have told us - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Cook - A. About three years.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is he - A. A hosier, I have heard.</p>
               <p>Q. He has not been an hosier since you have been acquainted with him - A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. How has he got his living since you have been acquainted with him - A. That has already been explained in court.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Brady - A. I have known him some years, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Hill when he kept a public-house in Whitechapel - A. No, I did not; Hill kept a house in Newgate-market. I have seen him once there about two years ago. It may be rather more.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you to say, Richardson, the plan for putting off the forged bills was determined on the 4th of July; it was agreed that Badcock should send them to the bankers; you were to go and see that they were paid; that part of the plan was your own - A. Certainly, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done on the 4th of September was, that Badcock was to send the bills by a porter; it was determined that Badcock should send them by a porter - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. By any person that Badcock knew - A. I think not, a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it at that meeting on the 4th that it was determined by you, that you were to be at the bankers and see them paid - A. I agreed to be there to see them paid, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stay at the tavern in Sloane-street, where you had the sandwiches, and sherry, that you have told us - A. Not long. It might be half an hour.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140014"></xptr>Q. What was the longest time that any of you might have staid at the Horn tavern - A. I never kept any account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay half an hour. Most likely a waiter came to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where you sitting in an open box - A. Yes. It was daylight.</p>
               <p>Q. You were at the Horn tavern various times and had refreshment there - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I understand you to say when the three drafts were put into your hand you were sure these were those that were delivered to Cook, or you only believed them to be the same - A. I have reason to believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. There is nothing about them that makes you sure them are the same - A. I have reason to believe one is the same, because there was the name of Magnay and Pickering on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. At Sloane-street Brady was not there - A. No, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th of September, when some of them met at the Horn, Brady was not there, only on the 5th - A. I am not sure he was there on the 4th, only on the 5th.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the day that you and Badcock left the Horn to go with this note - A. Yes: Brady and Cook went away; I saw no more of them. Badcock and I went about this transaction with ourselves. I did not see Brady again till the following Monday; we met upon another transaction, and after that time I never saw him until he was taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. At the division of the money he was not present - A. There was no person present at the divideing of the money but me and Badcock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bosanquet. From whom did you receive the three genuine drafts - A. From Cook. The three drafts that I received payment for were the very same that I received of Cook I have no doubt.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the object of these meetings - A. To commit forgeries, sir.</p>

               <p>Q. By what means were you to be enabled them to be forged - A. By genuine checks, which I understood were to be procured by Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember, in the month of August, receiving any checks of Hill - A. I believe I received three at the <placeName id="t18130714-13-crimeloc78">Horn tavern, Doctors' Commons, Godliman-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. Who was present when you received these three from Hill - A. Richardson, and I believe Brady.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these three, and tell me whether you believe these to be the three - A. I would not swear to these three. They were checks upon Robarts's house.</p>
               <p>Q. From the three that were presented to you did you effect forgeries - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the draft for five hundred and sixty pounds; did you forge that from the check of Burchall of nine pounds ten shillings - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had done that to whom did you give them three genuine checks - A. I gave it to Richardson for the forged one for five hundred and sixty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. You have mentioned that you received the three from Hill; did you know at the time from whom Hill received them - A. I understood from Richardson. Hill obtained them from a man of the name of Parsons. I was informed of that by Richardson only.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember meeting Hill at any other place besides the Horns tavern - A. We met at the Swan in Sloane-street. I cannot recollect the time. It was about the time that we met at the Horn tavern.</p>
               <p>Q. How many met of you at the Swan in Sloane-street - A. Richardson, Hill, and I think Brady was there once.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Brady with Hill - A. I cannot say for certainty. We met once with Hill, and once with Brady. I do not recollect their being together. When I met Hill there we had some sandwiches and some sherry wine. That was when Hill was there.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did Hill give you those genuine checks - A. It was understood that I should commit forgeries from them. That was the subject of the conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it all settled what should become of Hill when you had done this part of the business - A. I understood he was to be out of town. He was not to be in town when they were presented.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him again until after they had been presented - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember that day on which they were presented - A. Yes; I think it was on the 5th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 4th do you remember meeting at the Horn tavern - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day in which it was presented do you remember who you met that morning at the Horn tavern - A. Yes, Brady, Badcock, and Richardson.</p>
               <p>Q. Either on the 5th, or on the preceding day's meeting, was it engaged in what manner this and other drafts were to be uttered - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and these persons various meetings - A. We had three or four.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the mode that you arranged for uttering of the draft; do you remember whether that was talked on that day or the preceding day - A. On both, the 4th and the 5th. It was planned that Badcock should hire a porter, and give him the forged check, on purpose to receive the money at the bankers. Richardson was to see that all was safe. Brady and I left them at the Horn tavern, and went to Moorgate coffee-house, and left them to do the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on that day, or the next day, receive your share of the business of that day - A. I did, from Richardson. The notes were sold at twenty pound per cent. discount. I received the product after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140015"></xptr>Q. to Richardson. When you had got two-fifths for yourself and Cook, what did you do with them - A. I sold them at a discount of 20 per cent to Birkett. He knew what we were about; he was to dispose of the bank note, the immediate produce of the forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Birkett - A. The man that was convicted last sessions.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was he - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cook. You say you received the produce of the forged check after the discount - A. I received the produce after that. I received the money at two or three different times. I received from Richardson two hundred pounds at different times.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you taken up - A. On the 1st of January last, on suspicion of forgery; and when I was in custody I made a disclosure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Pell. How long were you connected in this business - A. I decline to answer that question.</p>
               <p>Q. You are a hosier - A. Yes; I carried on a little business in the honest way.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you keep a shop six months ago - A. I kept no shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry on the business of a hosier - A. At my house. I have no shop in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep the goods in the house, and people come there - A. No, not altogether. I sold them to my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this house that you carried on the business, such as it was - A. In the King's-road. I lived there a twelvemonth. I lived in Sloane-street before that. I have not had a shop for twelve or fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you live in Sloane-street carrying on the business of a hosier - A. I believe about a year and a half. I lived before that in Sloane-square. I lived about a twelvemonth there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live before that time - A. Upon my oath, I cannot recollect. I lived in many places.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you where you lived four years ago - A. I think at Pancras.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that for the last fourteen years you have obtained your livelihood by hosiery alone - A. No, I do not, but by these depredations now before me, or nearly.</p>
               <p>Q. How long, sir, has Hill the misfortune of knowing you - A. I believe about two years: he may not have known me above one year. I have known him about two years. I have been at his house in Newgate-market. I do not know that he knew me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that you executed the forgery - A. At my house in King's-road, Chelsea.</p>

               <p>Q. In the month of August, last year, do you remember being possessed of a check of Burchall and Company, Magnay and Pickering, and Walker and Son, for hay you had sold - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these checks, and tell me whether you believe them to be the same - A. I have seen them before. I believe them to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. About a month afterwards you were taken up and examined - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Mr. Hill - A. I do. I knew him before, and at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in the habit of taking the checks that you received in business, and giving you cash for them - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever part with your checks to any other person besides Hill - A. Yes, to Mr. Nash, the clerk of the market; to no one else besides.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of August, last year, do you remember Hill taking of you some checks one day - A. It might be two, three, or four, or five. I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not able to speak to these three checks - A. No, not exactly. They may be the checks. I have no doubt but they are the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Pell. You have had some little doubt whether these are the three drafts; whether you gave these these drafts to Hill; you now have no doubt - A. I have no doubt particular whether they are or are not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the habit of receiving drafts for which you sell hay, and taking the drafts into the city to get cash - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Hill and Mr. Nash has taken them of you. It is more convenient for you to give them to them instead of your going into the city - A. Yes. Sometimes I have given them to farmers.</p>
               <p>Q. When you have given drafts to Hill it was for your accommodation - A. I thought so. I have given four or or five drafts to a farmer at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. You deal very largely - A. In a middling way; as much as some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are indebted to Hill - A. Yes; there is not much likelihood of my paying it. I am losing my connections.</p>
               <p>Q. Hill lived in Newgate-market, did not he - A. Yes. He used to ask me for drafts when he was going to pay his brewer or distiller; he used to say, have you any thing in the city. I used to say, I have a check or two, if you will take them I will thank you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. At the time this transaction took place where did Hill live - A. He had left Newgate-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he apply to you or you to him - A. I never applied to him, except in saying are you going into the city.</p>
               <p>Q. Look in your account book the 17th of August; do you find any entry in your account book of the receipt of these checks - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day did you receive them - A. I believe the day after the hay was sold.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140016"></xptr>Q. Burchall and Company; what day did you receive that - A. I think I received it on the 15th of August, and Magnay and Pickering is on the 15th.</p>
               <p>Q. When you pay the check to the farmers do you or not make an entry in your book - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason respecting these drafts for saving that you gave them to Hill, except your receiving them. Is is it your belief that you did give these three checks to Hill - A. They might be some others. I cannot say any further than that.</p>

May it please your lordship, Gentlemen of the jury, you are assembled for the purpose of trying a mere question, in point of fact the prisoner at the bar has been indicted at this sessions of being concerned as an accessary before the fact in a forgery; he has been convicted of that crime, that is a crime not punished by death the law allows the benefit of the clergy, but the law does not allow the benefit of the clergy twice; it has been pleaded on part of the crown that he has had that benefit of the clergy on a former sessions, that in the month of October, in this place, in the year 1795; the prisoner was convicted of a clergyble felony; he was convicted of assaulting a person with attempting to rob him; the sentence of the court was to be transported for seven years; having been convicted of that offence he prays the benefit of the clergy. Gentlemen, all that will be requiste for me to prove will be to introduce the record of his former conviction; he denies that he is the same person. I will call to you Mr. Kirby, who was the clerk of the papers, who remembers his trial, his conviction, and remaining in Newgate three years in execution of his sentence; I have the police officer who gave evidence against him. The single question to the jury is whether he is the same person.</p>

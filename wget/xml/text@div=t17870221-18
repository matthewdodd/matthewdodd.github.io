               <p>Did you at the time believe it was him? - No, my brother told me of this man when he saw him go through the taproom.</p>
               <p>Then you did not know him, only from what your brother said? - Yes, Sir, I had an idea of him, but not so much as he had; Ellt called all the company together, and separated them into four different rooms, and we went into these rooms, before we went into the room where the man was; and when we went into the room where the man was; we picked him out.</p>
               <p>How many were there in the rooms? - I cannot say; there were three or four in each; I knew him again then; I went before the Justice, and the Justice asked me if I would swear to the man, and I told him I believed he was the man; my brother was with me; the other prisoner was with him at the time when he knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you know him? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Where did you see him? - At the Rotation office, in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Did you know him again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time of day or night was it you was robbed? - At six in the evening.</p>

               <p>Jury. How near was the light of the lamp to you? - It may be twenty yards; the shop windows were lighted; it was on a Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Court. In short, by the shop windows, or the lamps, or the snow, or whatever it was, was it so light that you could distinguish him? - Yes, Sir, it was not dark, the snow was on the ground, a little snow.</p>

               <p>You was going to see for work, you was pretty rich, had not you been drinking pretty freely with your companion? - I had been drinking, it cost me about eight-pence; I was at the public house about two, and set out between five and six.</p>
               <p>You had been pretty jovial, had not you? - No, Sir, I cannot say I was.</p>
               <p>How many were in company? - There were twenty in the tap-room, all the brick-layers that were working at the buildings; there were thirteen houses; I was drinking with them; they were no acquaintances of mine; I am sure I was robbed this night.</p>

               <p>Upon your oath? - I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you drunk at the time? - No, Sir, I cannot say I was drunk, I had been drinking; I cannot say I was clear of liquor.</p>
               <p>What did you drink? - Porter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then your share of the porter came to eight-pence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much porter will eight-pence buy? - Two pots and a penny over.</p>
               <p>Have you never expressed to any body that you was so much in liquor that you did not know whether you lost your watch, or was robbed of it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Ellt at first would not bring the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not he tell you upon your calling for the watch, that the man would appear next morning at Justice Staples's if you wanted him? - No, Sir, he promised before Justice Staples, that he would find the man, he said he could not say he could find him the next day, but as soon as ever he could find the man, he would bring him to Justice Staples, and I should have two or three lines to come to the Rotation-office, which he never did.</p>

               <p>I am a taylor; I am brother to the last witness; I was with him at the time he was robbed; I was before him; I turned back to find him, that we might not lose one another, as we were going home together; so when I returned back, there were three men beating him on the ground; then I saw the little man, that is Walker, take his watch out of his pocket, and the prisoner Evans struck me directly when I offered to assist my brother, and when I turned round to look at him, there was another, his name is

            , and he struck me over my nose, and made my nose bleed; I am sure Walker is the man that took the watch out of my brother's pocket, and I really believe that Evans is the man that struck me first, and Coleman is I believe the man struck me second; they went away, and we came home.</p>
               <p>Had they any arms? - None that I saw.</p>
               <p>This was done by force, and without any arms? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see these men afterwards? - I saw Walker on a Friday, almost three weeks after.</p>
               <p>Was your brother with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who shewed him to you? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him? - We saw him first in the tap-room.</p>
               <p>You know Walker immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see him afterwards? - On the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Where did you see him then? - At Mr. Staples's office, that was John Walker, I saw him at the Rotation-office; I knew him again then.</p>
               <p>You went through two or three rooms? - Yes, me and my brother; my brother picked him out; I told him to pick out that man.</p>
               <p>Who did he pick out? - Walker was the first man he picked out that day.</p>
               <p>Did your brother know him again as well as you? - Not so well, but he had some knowledge of him.</p>
               <p>Are you very sure from what you was capable of seeing that night, that these two men are the men that robbed your brother? - I am very sure that Walker is the man that got his watch, and I am pretty sure that Evans is the man that struck me first.</p>
               <p>What sort of light was there when your brother was robbed? - There were the lamps and shops lighted, just opposite where he was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Were these lights near enough to see distinctly? - Yes, Sir, so far as to know them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Had you been with your brother spending the day? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Walking out in the morning? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Afterwards went into a public house to refresh yourselves? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long were you in the public house? - I cannot say how long, we had but two pots of beer between us.</p>
               <p>Was you half an hour there? - Yes, that if not more, not an hour, I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Was it half an hour, or three quarters of an hour? - May be it might be half an hour, or may be three quarters of an hour, not to exceed an hour.</p>
               <p>However, you was with your brother all the time? - Yes, but we were at two public houses; I suppose we might be there three hours.</p>
               <p>Which did you come away from last? - That close by the buildings in the City-road.</p>
               <p>How much might you drink at the last place? - I cannot say how much we drank, because the master he was seeking the job of work was there, and he drank along with us; it came to each a pot of beer, or four-pence, I cannot tell which.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210046"></xptr>Then you had not been drinking there largely at all; they would not charge you eight-pence for a pot of beer? - No, some paid four-pence, some a pot of beer, and some more; my share was either four-pence, or a pot of beer; my brother's was seven-pence or eight-pence; I do not suppose them that drank most paid most; we got there about two, and I suppose it might be a little after five when we came away.</p>
               <p>Who was with you besides your brother? - I do not know the people; there was one that I knew, but there was no more; and there was another that my brother knew, but I did not.</p>
               <p>Who was with you when these two men men came up? - Nobody but our two selves; I was twenty yards before my brother; there were a deal of people going about, but not at that spot where we were, not that we saw, but there might be.</p>
               <p>Were the shops open near that place where your brother was knocked down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you make any application for assistance? - No; there was one man particularly that I remember said, we had better go home, and think ourselves very well off we got off so; I made no application.</p>
               <p>Did your brother? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>But at the time you was struggling with these men, did not you think it necessary to call for assistance, as the shop was so near? - It might have been necessary; we did not know what to do for the best; if we had thought of that certainly we would not have spared ourselves to have called out.</p>
               <p>In fact you did not call out or give any alarm at this time, how long might your brother be engaged in the scuffle? - He got up with my assistance; I do not suppose the scuffle lasted a minute, because one of them struck me as soon as I came up, and another gave me a blow; they walked to Old-street turnpike-gate, and we came up the other way.</p>
               <p>How long might they be in your sight after they quitted your brother? - Not a minute.</p>
               <p>You desired your brother to pick Walker out at the Justice's? - Yes, I had told my brother before, that I could know him; I said so at the Blue Anchor; there was a man there threatened my life if ever I said a word; that was the reason I would not pick him out; my brother said, he supposed that was the man; and I told him I was sure that was the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Then your brother pointed him out as the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How near were Nash and the other person to you? - Pretty near.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How much will your brother and you get if these two men are convicted? - Upon my oath, Sir, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard if these two men were convicted there would be eighty pounds reward? - No, Sir, nobody told us so.</p>
               <p>Did not you know it? - I never did hear that there was a halfpenny for taking a man up.</p>
               <p>Do you know it now? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>You swear that? - Yes, I can, and I will if you please.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you expect any thing at all by the prisoners being convicted? - No, Sir, I do not; I do not want any thing; I had not seen them between the robbery and the time; here is the watch which

               <p>Do you know him by sight? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him at your house? - It is possible I may; if not in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Have you seen him with the other prisoner? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Have you ever seen him on this occasion? - No.</p>
               <p>Then you know nothing at all of him concerning the watch? - No; the prosecutor offered to make it up; the prosecutor offered to swear to my own brother; that is the gentleman, I do not know his name. (Pointing to Matthew Stephenson.) We were disputing about this matter of the watch, five or six; and some proposals were made by the prosecutor to settle something of this matter about the watch, which I refused; if I would have made their loss good, the prisoners would not have been here; accordingly I asked him if he should know the person that took the watch from him if he saw him; he said, he should; accordingly one said, he should, and the other said, he should not; and that other said, he was so much in liquor, he could not know any man, nor know how he lost it; accordingly I says to Matthew, you have lately seen the person that found the watch; if he was the thief why did not you take him; he said, if he saw him, he was doubtful of laying hold of him, least he should have ill treatment; I immediately engaged myself that my life should be at stake, that no man should ill treat him, in the matter, on the premises, or where I was; I desired him to look about; he looked about and saw my brother Thomas Ellt, and he said, you I know well, he said, this coat I remember well, though in the dark; this wig I remember very well, though it was dark; I put my hand on your shoulder in Old-street-road, such an hour, such a night; I sent for an officer to secure my brother till they decided the matter; but the officer did not come; and he bugged my brother's pardon, and treated him with something; accordingly that passed on for sometime; he acknowledged himself that he had aggrieved my brother, and wrongfully accused him, when he found my brother had sufficient proof where he was that night at that time; after that I was subpoened before Justice Staples on account of the watch; Mr. Staples sent for me, and I went up; he did not send a warrant, nor a summons; he asked me, if I knew the man that took the watch out of pawn; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178702210048"></xptr>told him, I believed him to be an honest, industrious, young man; and I believed he would not be absent when he was wanted; that went on for I suppose three weeks and better; the prosecutor applied to me, two or three different times; I had seen the person who is now prisoner, two or three different times; about the latter end of the session, I received a fresh order to come up to Mr. Staples's, and the prisoner

             hinted it to him.</p>
               <p>Why do you believe Walter Underderwood hinted it to him? - Because the man knew him not before, and saw him different times.</p>
               <p>Did you see Underwood point him out? - No, not positively; I believe it because he came into the room to insinuate the purpose; and the prosecutor knew not the man before, but then he knew him, when he saw him in a different dress to what he was in before.</p>

             said, how can you accuse this man, who has lived so many years in the neighbourhood, and never had a blemish in his character in his life, when I can prove where he was that evening till ten at night; I was in the Fleet-prison upon business, from three till ten that night; I was doing some business with a prisoner that was there; with that, he rather then began to draw his words in, and he said he was sorry, he believed he was under a mistake, he was sorry he had charged me with it, and if I would forgive him, he would treat me with any thing I would drink, and he would make up every matter, and give me a guinea and a half out of the reward that was offered for the watch, and he would have the watch, and make it all up; with that, I told him it was a very hard case to have my character, which had never been blemished, where I lived twenty-five years on the spot, taken away; but if he would ask my pardon, and confess before the company I was not the person, I would make it up.</p>
               <p>Did he do it? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>He confessed before the company that you was not the person, though he had charged you before? - Yes, and he was going out of the door, and we had shook hands, and he said, says he, I cannot help thinking still but you are the man; I saw no more; my brother and he, and another man went together, I believe to get the watch from the pawnbroker's, and I saw no more of him till we went up before the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know the prisoner Walker? - I have seen him several times; I believe eight or ten times, but I have no acquaintance with him.</p>
               <p>Where does he lives? - I cannot say, I have seen him at my brother's; when I came before the Justice, I told him how I had been used, and I asked the prosecutor to give me his name, and place of abode, and he refused it; I applied to Mr. Staples; he said it was proper that he should, and he asked him for it, and he wrote it down on a piece of paper; I live at the Gentleman and Porter, in Bell-lane, Spitalfields; I have only lived there about a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Where did you live before? - In Petticoat lane, next door to the Coach and Horses; I have lived there much about a twelvemonth.</p>

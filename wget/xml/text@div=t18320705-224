             (Police-constable C 78.) I saw the prosecutor asleep on the step, and the prisoner standing by him - he said he knew him, that he was a friend of his, and he wished to take him home; I tried to arouse the prosecutor - he said he had lost a hat and a handkerchief, but his hat was by his side - I asked if he had lost any thing else; he said a watch - the prisoner then took this watch out of his pocket, and said it belonged to him; I asked the prosecutor if he could swear to it - he said Yes, it was a silver watch, and had a pinchback chain and a key, but no seal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DONNE. Q. Was no one else near the prosecutor? A. There was a watchman on the opposite side, and some girls were near the prosecutor, but they went away - the prisoner took the watch from his fob, and said it was his own; he did not put it into the prosecutor's hand - he gave it into my hand - he had been drinking.</p>
               <p>ANDREW MILLER. The prisoner was no friend of mine- I had not seen him before; I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you remember any girls there? A. No-when I awoke the officer was by; I do not recollect that I saw the prisoner give up the watch - this is my watch; I had not trusted the prisoner with it, to my knowledge - I suppose I went to sleep at twelve or one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the prosecutor on the step of a door, with three girls, and one of them had this watch in her hand; I said, "That is not your watch;" she gave it to me, and they ran down a court - I was ten minutes trying to arouse the prosecutor, and then the officer came; the prosecutor said he had lost his watch; I pulled it from my trousers pocket, and said, "Here it is."</p>

I saw the prisoner near the prosecutor - he pulled out this watch, and said it was his own; he was drunk, but knew what he was about - I asked him to go to the watch-house; he said he had no objection - he then said he took the watch from the prosecutor, because no one else should, and he wished to take him to his own house for protection.</p>

            . On the Sunday morning, I saw the prisoner about a quarter or twenty minutes past six; I saw him come out of the house that is being repaired at the top of Sydmouth-place. I saw a sack at the top of the area, where they were getting it up. I saw the prisoner lift that sack on the other man's back; they looked back several times, and in cousequence of that, I thought it was lead that came off the house. I went through a different way through Sidmouth-mews, and I saw the prisoner following a cart, in which was the other young man and a woman. The moment I stopped the cart, the two men took to their heels, and ran as fast as they could. I pursued after them; I followed the prisoner close into a field, and he was stopped before I lost sight of him. The springs were afterwards taken out of the cart.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went behind some bricks, and saw the man with this sack, and I helped him up with it on his shoulder by his request, and then I ran down the field, and the witness laid hold of me, and said what, have you been robbing my master's house, and I said, no, I was not, and I said I was very willing to go with him whereever he liked.</p>

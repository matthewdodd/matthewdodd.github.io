                  </hi>. I live in Woolwich, and am in the Royal Artillery. On Saturday, the 1st of November, I placed my jacket on the prisoner's bed, which joins mine, while I made my own bed—it was about a quarter before eight o'clock in the evening—I left my jacket there, when I got into bed—I had in it three half-crowns, one shilling, and one fourpenny-piece, in a wash-leather purse—I missed it the following morning, about half-past six o'clock—twelve or fourteen persons slept in the same room—they would have an opportunity of seeing where I placed my jacket—I asked Mills to look for my jacket, after I got to bed, and then Small flung it on my bed, off his own bed—Mills doubled it up, and put it on the top of the saddle-bags—I have never seen the purse since—it could not have escaped from the jacket when it was thrown—it was thrown but a little way, and if it had</p>

               <p>I should have seen it in the morning—it was about five minutes past eight o'clock at night when Small threw it to me—I did not miss the money till half-past six o'clock in the morning—my jacket was on the saddle-bag, at the head of my own bed—there was nothing to prevent any one else getting at it in the night—I was a little the worse for liquor the overnight, but was capable of doing my duty—I did not mention to the prisoner my sus<lb></lb>picions till the next morning, after the sergeant-major had told him of it—his showing some money to the men in the room, the night he took it, gave us suspicion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the Royal Artillery. On the 1st of November I left the stables about eight o'clock in the evening, and went to bed—I saw Small sitting on the outside of his bed, not in bed—he had his jacket off as he came from the stable—the prosecutor was sitting on his bed—he got up, and came towards the fire, with his jacket in his hand, then he went back to his bed, with the jacket, and laid it somewhere—I do not know where—my bed was next to Small's bed, and Stokes called me to get his jacket for him—I went to the fire to look for it, and could not find it—I was coming back to tell him, and I saw the prisoner, with the jacket in his hand, and his right-hand was in the pocket—I saw the buttons on the sleeve of the jacket—I was coming to the prosecutor, and Small called out, "Here is your jacket, Stokes," he then threw it on his bed and folded it up—I saw Small stoop and take up his own jacket, and put his hand to the pocket of his own jacket, and I heard something jingle as it was falling in, which I thought was money—I got up about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning.</p>

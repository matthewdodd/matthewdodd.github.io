            . On the 7th of October, I was coming from Sloane square, between seven and eight in the evening; my way lead <placeName id="t18141130-4-crimeloc20">near the Five Fields</placeName>

After I had passed the chapel, I met the prisoner, I am quite sure of the prisoner. I met him, I was alone, and he was alone; as far as I saw he was dressed as a military man, but not quite so well as he is now. As soon as I passed him, he fetched me down immediately. He gave me a blow with a stick that he was walking with; he hit me upon my head, that blow knocked me down; a very little thing will knock me down, I am in years, I was perfectly sober, I had taken nothing to drink since I had porter at my dinner. When I was knocked down he kept hitting me; I was sensible. I got hold of his stick. I said to him, now what use is your hitting me, when you have got all my property. I had a bundle in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took the bundle out of your hand - A. I fancy when I was knocked down the bundle fell out of my hand, I did not see my bundle again after I had been knocked down. When I laid hold of his stick and said, what use is it of your using me ill, when you have got my property, he made me no answer, he got the stick away from me, and hit me two or three times on the head after that; I believe somebody came by, he went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any person assist you to get up - A. Yes, that person is here. I was so disordered I could not speak; that person is here; he took me to a Mr. Marr's, a green-grocer, in Five-field row. When the prisoner was with me, I could see this house by the light of his shop; it was not a light night, there was a moon, but it did not shine; he took my hat away too. The prisoner took my hat; he said I will have his hat, I saw him take up my hat.</p>
               <p>Q. After the prisoner came up, did you look about on the ground for your bundle - A. No.</p>

                  <persName id="t18141130-4-person105">Q. </persName>
            Did your hat fall off when you fell down - A. Most likely; at the green grocer's a constable came in by chance; I was taken to St. George's Hospital. I continued in the hospital a fortnight; after I was taken to the hospital, the prisoner was brought in the next morning; then I could not speak at all through the blows I had. Before this happened I had a good speech; I could speak better than I can now. When he came to me my sight was perfect; I knew the prisoner perfectly well; I am sure he is the man. I was so bad from the blows I could not speak.</p>
               <p>Q. When this happened, was there light enough to distinguish the countenance of a man - A. I certainly did take notice of the man, he met me, I was going one way, and he the other. There was light enough for me to be quite sure of him. I saw him once or twice in the hospital; I continued to be certain he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was you able to speak that he was the person? - A. The nurse at the hospital is here, she can tell you better than I can.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you in this bundle - A. I had two shirts, two white neck handkerchiefs, and two coloured ones, and a pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. What business are you - A. I have been a hatter; my eyes will not let me work at my business, I now live at home with my family in Jermyn-street; I have not seen any of my things since; I always said I was satisfied he was the man.</p>

            . I live at 24, Sloane-terrace, Sloane-street, Chelsea. On the evening of October the 7th, between seven and eight, as I was coming over the fields, I found Mr. Larkum in the road lying; there was a person by him like a watchman; Mr. Larkum held out his hand to me; he could not speak; I lifted him up, and led him to Mr. Murrell's, a green grocer; I was coming towards London, the same way as Mr. Larkum was, until I came up to him; I met nobody at all; I found him bleeding; he was not able to speak. I took Mr. Larkum to the house of the green grocer, and there I left him. I did not go to the hospital with him; I had no thought of a robbery until I got him into the green grocer's; he was not able to speak; he had a pen and ink, and wrote what he had lost; that is what he has already stated here; that is all I know. I observed the bruises upon his head, a blow behind the ear, and a violent blow on the temple. It was near eight o'clock when I first saw Mr. Larkum; he had no hat on, nor did I see any hat on the ground.</p>
               <p>MARY HENDERSON. I am a nurse in St. George's hospital; I saw Mr. Larkum when he was first brought into the hospital. On Friday evening, a quarter past ten o'clock, he appeared to be very bad indeed about the head; there were three violent blows about the head; he could not utter a word; he continued several days so as not to be able to speak, so as to understand what he said. On Saturday morning the prisoner was brought to me for him to look at;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300007"></xptr>Larkum saw him; he could not speak a word at that time that I could understand of him; he did not wish to be bothered; he snook his head, and appeared not wishing to be troubled, and the man was taken away. I saw the man brought; there the second time. I believe the next Wednesday; he was a little better; he was perfectly sensible the whole of the time; he could speak then, but not perfectly; directly the man came into the room, he said that was the man. Larkum was in the hospital a fortnight.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 7th I was out on duty; I went to the green grocer's, and there I found Mr. Larkum; they were rubbing his head with brandy. I went to the York hospital for a doctor; I could not see any. I then got two men to carry him to St. George's hospital; I did not go with him; I went to look for the man that had robbed him; I went all round the Five Fields; I found nobody that night. The next morning I went to St. George's hospital; at that time the prisoner was brought into the hospital by one of the Bow-street officers; he had some books in a green bag and a hat; the prosecutor was asked whether that was his hat, and he was asked whether he was the man; he shook his head, and made no reply; he held his head down the whole time. On the 18th I received information that Mr. Larknm was going to leave the hospital, and that he wished to see the man that had been brought in before. On the 19th I went to the York barracks, Chelsea; I asked the colonel to let me have him; he granted me liberty; I took him to St. George's hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the first time - A. The first time was about the 8th he was taken; this was on the 19th, twelve days after. Mr. Larkum was sitting by the fire; he turned round and saw the prisoner, and exclaimed, that is the man that robbed me, and nobody else. I then took him to the watch-house, and from there to Marlborough-street; I told Mr. Larkum there were many men alike; he was positive to the man; Mr. Larkum did not come to Marlborough-street office for a week or ten days afterward,</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street office. I apprehended the prisoner on Saturday the 8th of October, between six and seven o'clock in the morning; I saw him in the Five Fields, Chelsea, near the Crown and Anchor; it is called Chelsea, but it is in the parish of St. George's; he was coming to town. I knowing him to be a soldier in the 21st regiment of foot, and seeing him in a state of intoxication, I asked him where he had been, and why he was so far from his barracks; he said he had been to town; he had a green bag in his hand; in the green bag was a dictionary, grammar, and school books; he had also a hat in his hand, besides the one he had on his head; I recollecting what had happened on the night of the 7th, I took him in custody. That hat was shewed to Mr. Larkum in the hospital; he signified that was not the hat, nor was the prisoner the man; he could not speak so plain that I could understand him; but by the motions of his hand, by all his motions, I understood that he was not the man, and that the man was taller than the prisoner, I know that night was a very dark night; I can hardly recollect a darker night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence I had neither art or part in robbing that man; he might as well swear against a man in France as to swear against me; he has sworn false. My regiment is in America; I have been between four and five years in a French prison.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor and clerk to the guardians of the Holborn Union, and have been so since March, 1838. In consequence of the over-crowded state of the workhouse belonging to that union, in Oct., 1847, I entered into an arrangement with Mr. Drouet, to send the pauper children to his establishment at Tooting; that was by the direction of the guardians, and consent of the Poor-Law Commissioners—I have here the letter containing the approval of the Poor-Law Commissioners—I first had a personal interview with Mr. Drouet, that was in the beginning of Oct., 1847—I had received directions from the guardians to seek a place for the children, and knowing that Mr. Drouet farmed children, I requested that he would call upon me at the Union Workhouse the first time he came to town—I saw him, and then obtained from him the terms upon which he received children, what he did for them, the price, and all the particulars; and when he went away, I said, "Now, Mr. Drouet, I cannot undertake to state to the guardians everything that has passed between us to-day, when you get home be kind enough to commit it to writing, and let me have a letter"—and in consequence I received this letter—I know it to be his handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—" 16th Oct.</p>

               <p>1847. To Mr. James. My dear sir, my establishment is for children only, and I have spared no expense to make it second to none; there are five schools con<lb></lb>ducted by competent teachers, and the Chaplain; various trades are taught by well-conducted masters, on a large scale, so that we are enabled to fit boys for all kinds of servitude—the girls being carefully instructed in needlework, laundry, washing, and the general household work. I can take the number you may require to place out at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per head per week; this includes every charge, as also conveying them to and from the establishment."—I laid that letter before the board of guardians, and a resolution was come to by the Board, that the children should <hi rend="italic">go</hi>—I have here a letter which I sent to Mr. Drouet embodying the resolution—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"The important matter of the removal of our boys has been determined in the affirmative, and you are to have them; but it is still thought by some of your best wishers, that you cm afford to take them at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per head per week; they are earning us, and will be earning you, very considerably. It is thought that the past ought not to be taken by you into consideration; it is not the same as asking you to lower your charges for children you have had during the hard times; we have hid them during those times. I am sure that in the whole you would be a greater gainer at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week, than you would at 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that is if you prefer a greater number. So strong is the impression of a great part of our Board; at present about ninety will be ready to be handed over to you at our workhouse, on Wed<lb></lb>nesday next, at two o'clock. I will take care that they shall be decently clad, and you will take care to be prepared to receive and carry them off our premises at that time. I will thank you just to drop me a line acknowledging the receipt of this communication, and saying you will be at the workhouse at the time I have named."—This was written on 4th Nov., and on 5th Nov. I received this letter from Mr. Drouet:—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Dear sir,—I will arrange for the children coming away as appointed, on Wednesday next. I feel confident of arranging the price to the satisfaction of the Board, after I find the children can render me any assistance, as I only want a fair return for my attendance, &amp;c."—Eighty-one boys went on the Wednesday; the deceased boy was not one of them—we endea<lb></lb>voured to send none under six years of age—they were between six and twelve, thirteen, or fourteen, as far as we could ascertain their ages; but some children at fourteen are younger than others at eleven or twelve—abort thirty more boys were sent between that and the beginning of Dec.—I bare the returns here from week to week—perhaps six or eight had been dis<lb></lb>charged during the same period—it was a debtor and creditor account of children—at the time the first number of children were sent I understood from Mr. Drouet himself, that there were about 800 or 850 children in the establishment, and that he could well receive 1200—I had myself visited the establishment, and it was there that I received the information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go over the wards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—in my capacity of clerk to the guardians, I have been in the habit of going occasionally to the workhouse, and seeing the accommodation there—from my inspection of Mr. Drouet's establishment, it appeared to be quite sufficient to contain 1200 children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>him that we found it necessary to send our girls, and asking if he could receive them—I have his answer to that letter.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the guardians inquire what dietary these children, should have? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh, yes; on 25th Oct., 1847, it was determined that the guardians should go down and inspect the place, and make all inquiries—the chairman, and six guardians, with myself, went to the establishment, and by direction of the deputation, this report was drawn up to the Board (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The committee desire to report to the Board, that they, this day, visited Mr. Drouet's establishment at Tooting, and inspected every part thereof; they were present at the children's dinner, witnessed the mode of instruction adopted in the different schools, and also the industrial training of the chil<lb></lb>dren, and they desire to report their entire satisfaction at the whole of the arrangements. There are at this time about 850 children farmed at the esta<lb></lb>blishment, and there was scarcely one so ill as to require medical aid. The soil is gravelly, and appears to be dry and healthy, and those members of the com<lb></lb>mittee acquainted with the Norwood establishment"—that is, where some of the children formerly had been—"consider that the one at Tooting is, by no means, so bleak, or so exposed <hi rend="italic">to</hi> cold and cutting winds as that is"—that is the report that was presented by this committee to the board of guardians, and upon which, in fact, it was determined to send the children—annexed to this report is the printed dietary of the establishment—it was given to me by Mr. Drouet at the time the guardians were there (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Surrey-hall, Toot<lb></lb>ing. Dietary.—Breakfast:—The breakfast every day is the same, namely, pottage composed of flour, rice, and milk, with water and salt in sufficient proportions;—this is for the strong children—the infants, those newly-ad<lb></lb>mitted, and the weakly, have boiled bread and milk—the allowance of bread to the healthy children is according to age, being 6, 5, and 4 ozs. to each.—Dinner:—There are three meat dinners in each week, viz., Sunday, Tuesday, and Friday—the quantity of meat, free from bone, to each child is regulated according to age, being 5, 4, and 3 <hi rend="italic">ozs.</hi> each, with 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4lb. potatoes; if with cab<lb></lb>bage, unlimited: on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, soup, made from the liquor in which the meat had been boiled, assisted with legs and shins of beef, peas, and a proper quantity of vegetables, pepper, salt, &amp;c., each child one pint, with bread; on these days the same quantity as at breakfast: on Thurs<lb></lb>day, suet-pudding, the quantity being 12,10, and 8ozs., according to age, &amp;c., to each. Supper:—the suppers every evening are either bread and butter, or bread and cheese, sometimes treacle with milk and water; should milk be scarce, which sometimes may be the case, then the children have good broth. Little children are dieted in the best way I can, as no fixed diet can be adopted—some have meat and porter daily. In sickness, the diet is regulated by the doctor." There is something written on each aide of this, which was written at the time, "Licensed for 1200—In: 800 or 850, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per head per week—clothes"—that was put there, because there was nothing said in the printed particulars with regard to clothes, and it was to put that out of doubt; the children went fairly clothed, and they were to be clothed by Mr. Drouet—for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week; they were to have lodging, food, raiment, and every thing.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many girls went? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sixty-one the first day, and then it was really a debtor and creditor account throughout the whole year—some weeks there might be five or six, or a dozen discharged—in other weeks there might be a dozen sent, and only five or six discharged; therefore, at the end of the year the balance would be much about the same as at the commencement—the boy James Andrews was sent on 28th Oct., 1848, and remained until 5th Jan., 1849—he was then brought from there to the Royal</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there any set day for those visits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No set day; it was to be once a month—Mr. Drouet could not be aware of the time when the guardians would come—they would come upon him on a sudden?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On 4th Jan., 1848, after the monthly visit on the part of the guardians, did they make a report? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first was on 30th Nov., 1847 (<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Holborn Union, 30th Nov., 1847. The undersigned guardians of the Holborn Union, in company with Mr. White, one of the medical officers of the Union, this day, visited and inspected the establishment of Mr. Drouet, at Tooting—they find four children confined with an attack of measles, at present doing well—the general appearance of the other chil<lb></lb>dren is healthy and satisfactory, and those that were sent in a weakly state from previous disease much improved—they attended during dinner, and found the food wholesome and sufficient—they found the premises very clean and well ventilated, the bedding clean, and well arranged, and the esta<lb></lb>blishment appeared to be conducted in a satisfactory manner"—that is signed by Stephen Peason, William Hunt, and Richard Hurst, three of the guardians; and by Edward White, one of the medical officers of the Holborn Union. The next is, "Jan. 4, 1848.

The next was on 9th Feb—that is a report in the form of a let<lb></lb>ter to the board; some are in the shape of a formal report, and others in the shape of a letter—the gentlemen generally subscribe the reports, only it so happens that this one is subscribed by only one of the three, instead of by all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came these gentlemen and the others to have gone down to the establishment more than any other of the guardians? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They were on what we call the rota for visiting the workhouse and other places during the week; there was no particular resolution appointing them to go, only appointing the gentlemen on the rota, not naming them in particular; there was a general resolution come to in Dec, 1847, that the gentlemen who were on the rota should visit the establishment at Tooting during each particular month, and these were gentlemen who ought to have visited the establishment in that month.</p>

We find that the cold cholera prevails very extensively amongst them in its severest form. We suggest the general use of flannel as an under garment, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, Welsh flannel shirt. We also recommend that each bed should have four blankets, three for a covering, and one to lie upon. We also recommend that fire places be introduced instead of the stoves, wherever they are in use. We also advise that instead of the suet-pudding, rice-pudding be substituted, and that the pease-soup be changed for Scotch barley-broth. We advise also that the children have meat four days in the week, beef and mutton alternately, and we would much prefer it roast. (Signed,) W. B. <hi rend="smallCaps">WHITFIELD</hi> &amp; J. C. <hi rend="smallCaps">LEWIS</hi>.")—I do not know who Mr. Lewis is—I did not subscribe that report—that was not a visit of the guardians, but of the medical officer after it was reported that the cholera was there—there was a visit of the guardians on 9th May, 1848, of which no report was signed in Mr. Drouet's book—the visiting guardians on that occasion were Messrs. Winch, Rebbeck, and Mayes—this is the report which they made to the guardians after that visit—(read—"We beg to report to the Board our having, on Tuesday, the 9th of May, visited Mr. Drouet's establishment at Tooting, to ascertain the state of the children's health belonging to this Union. We were there at the time of dinner being supplied, and are of opinion that the meat provided was good, but the potatoes were very bad. We visited the school rooms, dor<lb></lb>mitories, and workshops; everything appeared clean and comfortable. Yet we are of opinion that the new sleeping-rooms for the infants on the ground-floor has a very unhealthy smell. The girls belonging to the Union looked particularly well. The boys appeared sickly, which induced us to question them as to whether they had any cause of complaint as to supply of food or otherwise. About forty of them held up their bands to intimate their dis<lb></lb>satisfaction; upon which Mr. Drouet's conduct became violent. He called the boys liars, described some that had held up, as the worst boys in the school, and said if he had' done them justice, he should have followed out the suggestion of Mr. James, and well flogged them. We then began to ques<lb></lb>tion the boys individually, and some of them complained of not having suffi<lb></lb>cient bread for their breakfast. While pursuing the inquiry, Mr. Drouet's conduct became more violent. He said we were acting unfairly in the mode of inquiry; that we ought to be satisfied of his character without such pro<lb></lb>ceedings, and that we had no right to pursue the inquiry in the way we were, and that he should be glad to get rid of the children. To avoid further alter<lb></lb>cation, we left, not having fully completed the object of our visit."—I was not in attendance with the guardians on that occasion—that report was presented to the board by Mr. Winch, through me, and was ordered to be taken into consideration that day week, which it was, and then a special deputation was directed to proceed to Tooting, to make more particular inquiries into the circumstances—no intimation was given to Mr. Drouet of the period when that special deputation was to attend, certainly not by me,' and I do not think by any one of the guardians—I cannot conceive that be knew anything about it—those gentlemen were desired to invite the three members of the committee, who had made the immediately preceding report to accompany them on this special visit, Mr. Winch, Mr. Mayes, and Mr. Rebbeck—they did so, and this is the report—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" Holborn Union, Tues<lb></lb>day, May 30, 1848.—We, the undersigned, the committee specially appointed to visit Mr. Drouet's establishment at Tooting, to examine into the state., condition, and arrangements of the children belonging to the Holborn Union,</p>

We inspected the bread, meat, and potatoes, and desire to state that in quan<lb></lb>tity served out, and in quality, we were perfectly satisfied, and that with respect to the lodging and other domestic arrangements, we cannot speak of them bat in terms of commendation and satisfaction. We witnessed some scholastic examinations of the children, which were quite satisfactory; and, on the whole, we desire to report that we were well pleased with our visit. We desire specially to report that with respect to the particular circumstance stated in the last monthly report of the committee, Mr. Drouet expressed his regret that any exhibition of warmth of temper on his part should have occurred at that meeting, and the guardians then attending expressed themselves satisfied with this acknowledgment."—Signed by the vice-chairman Mr. Sou thee, Mr. Wrench, Mr. Winch, Mr. Rebbeck, Mr. Mayes, Mr. Hurst, and Mr. Sheppard, and countersigned by myself—I was in attend<lb></lb>ance on that occasion—no inquiry was made of the children in my presence whether they had received any punishment for having held up their hands—one or two of the guardians were in one part, and others were in other parts—I an not aware of any such inquiry being made—on Monday, 1st Jan., about one or two in the day, I received a communication from Robert Aldridge, the master of the Union-workhouse, as to the state of the children—in consequence of which, I, on the following day, 2nd, sent a person to Tooting to inquire into j the circumstances; and on the Wednesday I received a message from Mr. Drouet—the board met that evening; not in consequence of that message, because it was their regular time of meeting, but that was one of the matters of business at that board, and directions were given to Mr. Whitfield, one of the medical officers of the Union, to proceed to the establishment—the entry in Mr. Drouet's book of 4th Jan., which has been read, is the one which Mr. Whitfield and the other gentleman then made, but of that I know nothing—in consequence of the state in which the children were found to be by Mr. Whitfield they were removed to the Free Hospital—I should tell you that the other gentleman had nothing to do with our Holborn Union—I be<lb></lb>lieve he was met on the spot by Mr. Whitfield, and being two medical gentle<lb></lb>men met together, they thought proper to unite in their report—I went down on 5th Jan., but not before—I did not then learn from Mr. Drouet how many of the children were ill, of what, or how long they had been ill, but Mr. Whitfield on the Thursday, Jan. 4th, attended a special meeting of the board, and in consequence of the report he then made, I was sent on 5th with the proper and necessary persons to remove the children—I certainly saw Mr. Drouet on that occasion, but I saw that he had about a dozen medical men round him, and guardians from a great number of the Unions having children there, and I had no opportunity of having any conversation with him—the medical officer contented himself with examining the children he intended to remove, and gave a list of those children to me in order that I might provide conveyances for them—Mr. Whitfield had examined them the day before, and found that a good many were bad—I should say of the Holborn Union child<lb></lb>ren, I found about fifteen or sixteen attacked with cholera, perhaps twenty cannot tell—I cannot tell how many in the whole establishment were attacked with it—I brought away 155 of our children; four or five of them died before they got to the hospital—the boy James Andrews was one of those who</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were the guardians in the habit of visiting the Infirmary? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They visited every part of the establishment, everything was thrown open to them—the weekly reports which I have spoken of refer only to our own Union—there were children there belonging to thirteen parishes, we had nothing to do with any but those belonging to our own Union—I had not seen Mr. Drouet's establish<lb></lb>ment before I went there prior to the contract being entered into—I knew Mr. Drouet by sight, but I knew nothing whatever of his establishment before that time—I rather think that the dietary was submitted to our medical officer before the agreement was entered into, but I am not speaking with confidence—I never had anything to do with any workhouse but our own—in some respects I think this dietary is superior to that of our workhouse, and in other respects I think it is inferior—I have one of our own dietaries here—our dietary has not been altered lately; after the cholera broke out there was an alteration in it: more solid food was given; but I am com<lb></lb>paring Mr. Drouet's dietary with our former one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you consider that this is a proper dietary, a proper quantity of food for the children sent to the establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it is; and I have shown it to the medical officers, and they have thought so—there are some things not quite defined as to quantity which is open to observation—I think from Oct. 1847 to Jan. 1849,1 went to Mr. Drouet's establishment about five times—the other parishes were also in the habit of visiting it at different times—I have repeatedly, wheu I have been there, seen the guardians from other places—there was no particular day fixed beforehand when we might be expected to be there—the gentlemen whose duty it was to go down settled it among themselves, and I myself did not know the day they were going.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On these visits were very minute inquiries made; an inspection of the establishment, and an investigation as to the condition of the children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The gentlemen who went professed to do all that, and I believe did it-whenever I went I know that I attempted to the full extent of my power, to get all the information that would be serviceable to the guardians—when the guardians went, they had the opportunity of inquiring from the children apart from any control of Mr. Drouet, or anybody else, as to whether they were satisfied with their situation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at any time, upon any visit which you made, ever see any<lb></lb>thing which you considered improper in Mr. Drouet's establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was one little matter; as you put the question so, I must answer it; in the early part of the year, I think it was in Jan., 1848, Mr. Mayes, who it a builder, and who was as a builder looked to for anything about the pre<lb></lb>mises, ventilation, or anything of that sort, on going along the play-ground observed that the range of new buildings were built very close to the ground; that is to say, they were not sufficiently elevated to have a draught under<lb></lb>neath for ventilation, and he said, "You ought to have had air gratings in the skirting of the building"—Mr. Drouet looked, and said, Why, I ordered them, and I believe that they are here;" and on searching it was found that the sweeping of the path had entirely closed them up, and Mr. Mayes said, "Now this is a degree of carelesness that I should not have expected in this establishment; do get them cleared out"—I observed afterwards that they were cleared out—I did not myself know anything of the boy Andrews; I only knew that there were two brothers of that name, James and Joseph, and their father was in the workhouse at the same time—the children, who were removed when the cholera broke out, were those considered to be untouched by it—that was for the purpose of separating them from those who had been affected—they were taken to the Free Hospital, because we had not room for them in our workhouse, and we were glad to get them there—the book from which extracts have been read of the reports of the guardians of the Holborn Union, also contains reports from a great many other Unions.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is a book kept at Mr. Drouet's establishment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, as far as I am a judge I think if the dietary were adhered <hi rend="italic">to</hi> in point of quality, that in quantity it is good—the quantity in some respects is uncertain—in looking at it with our own, it occurred to me that ours was su<lb></lb>perior in some respects, but I cannot tell in what, without again comparing them—it was principally in the dietary for the sick—ours was a very foil dietary, it had been prepared entirely by the medical officers.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then the inferiority of which you speak, applies only to the dietary for the sick? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is all.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is in sickness, is it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, that is in general dietary—there is a larger allowance to the children at the workhouse—the reports to the board were generally drawn up by the gentlemen who visited, but when I attended I generally drew them up.</p>

               <p>they were all standing up very crowded: there were no forms or benches, or any means of sitting down to their meals—I looked at the potatoes, and cut open from one to two hundred—I did not find one good one; they were watery and black diseased potatoes—I spoke to Mr. Drouet about them—he told me he gave 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per ton for them—I said, "Very possibly you might; the pota<lb></lb>toes are very bad, I think you ought to change the diet"—he said if we paid him better, he could do it—I spoke to him when we were alone with him, not before the children—we then went over the establishment—we went over the whole of the dormitories, and over the new buildings on the left—the whole of them struck me as being badly constructed, but more particularly the lower ones; they smelt very unhealthy, and Mr. Drouet's attention was called to it by myself, and Mr. Mayes more particularly, who is a builder—there was no ventilation at the back, only windows in front, and they smelt very bad indeed—I mentioned it to Mr. Drouet—they were sleeping apartments I presume, but it was impossible to know, as there were no beds there—I was given to under<lb></lb>stand they were sleeping apartments for the younger children—I think the nurses told me so in Mr. Drouet's presence—Mr. Mayes remarked that it was a pity he had not built the rooms higher from the ground, and Mr. Drouet replied, that he should have enough to do if he paid attention to everybody—we went through the sleeping rooms that were in use: no particular fault struck me there—I did not go through the whole of the establishment, because I was aware from the nature of our own establishment, that it is not worth while to go through all the bed rooms—I afterwards saw the boys in the school-room; Mr. Drouet was there, his brother, the schoolmaster, and, I think, the drill-master,—when the boys were mustered, Mr. Rebbeck said, "Well, boys, do you all belong to the Holborn Union?"—they said, "Yes"—he said, "Well, have you anything to complain of, want of food or anything else; if you have, hold up your hand," and I think thirty or forty at least held up their hands in Mr. Drouet's presence—my attention was particularly di<lb></lb>rected to the look of the boys; I had seen them daily before they went from our workhouse to Mr. Drouet's, and their altered condition was very visible to me—they looked thin and pallid.

I was at Tooting fifteen months—I came with the other boys to the Free Hospital—while I was at Tooting, I used to scour the little boys' bed-rooms and make the beds, and I had to empty the slops—I know the attic where James Andrews slept—I used to make the beds there, and empty the slops, and scrub the room—I have been there early in the morning—there were thirty-three beds there—there is only one attic at the top of the house, that is where the little boys slept—they are kept separate from the bigger ones—there were two or three rooms where the little boys slept—I recollect one where there were twelve beds—I used to clean the other one, and I have been in that one—I knew James Andrews; he slept over at the other side—I knew him to sleep in the attic—there were fifteen or twenty beds in the attic where he slept—I do not know where he slept when he first came—he slept in the attic with the fifteen or twenty beds a good <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> before he left—I cleaned that room once every morning—the beds were close together—they used to sleep two in some of the beds and three in others—I used to empty the tub every morning—we had to take it down two flights of stairs—there was a smell from it—when we had emptied it we took it up again and put it under the bed—we used to use that tub to put water in to scrub the floor—it smelt in the day time as well as when we took it out—the room was about as big as this Court, but not so wide—the windows looked out into the</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the way you have usually done your business in the guardiaps'-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, on that occasion it was; we <hi rend="italic">do</hi> not usually have papers to sign—as far as regards the quality of the food stated in the dietary, it appeared very satisfactory, except the potatoes—this was on 9th May—I never found fault with any of the food, except the potatoes, that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you desired the boy to cut the loaf in the usual way, did you tell him whether it was for the young children, or the big boys? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Drouet's brother told him to cut their bread up in the usual way, and when it was cut up, I said, "Is this the allowance the boys have?"—he answered, "Yes"—I said "<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> you not weigh it?" because, as a guardian, I knew it was very unsatisfactory in our house if everything is not weighed out, and in nearly all establishments it is usual.</p>

I was one of the guardians who accompanied Mr. Winch to Mr. Drouet's—I was present when it was suggested that those boys who had not enough, or were not satisfied, should hold up their hands—between thirty and forty held up their hands—Mr. Drouet was present, and expressed himself very strongly, saying, the boys were of bad character, and if he did as he had been recommended by Mr. James, the clerk to the guardians, he should have flogged them well—several of the boys were asked questions after that—Mr. Drouet was close by, and heard the answers—they stated they had not enough bread to eat, and many other things, that they were dissatisfied with their food; and I went myself into the room where they were at dinner, and I saw some of the younger boys leaving their food, and covering it over with potato-parings—I drew some of the boys on one side, and went down to look at it, and I saw some of that which was so covered over, and instead of being meat the greater part of it was gristle—we only examined as to their food—there were only four or five boys examined—Mr. Drouet lost his temper, spoke very harshly, and stated we were not fit to examine the boys; that we did not know what we were about—he became very angry indeed—before we went in to examine the children in private, I had viewed the new building at the bottom part of the establishment, where the younger children slept, and I said to Mr. Drouet, privately, "This room smells very earthy, or very close; you require some better ventilation here, Mr. Drouet; this floor must be very Bear the earth"—he said it was—I said, "You might improve it by having some air-gratings put in, to make a draft under the floors"—he made rather an impertinent answer, and said, "If I was to attend to every one's sugges<lb></lb>tions I should have nothing else to do"—I was offended at that, and turned round, and said, "I shall have nothing more to say to you."</p>

I went to visit Mr. Drouet's establishment,—I found a great number of the children ill—I went to report upon the state of the children—I went over the part devoted to the sick, and also over some other parts—there were a number of rooms devoted to the cholera cases—I made some suggestions in Mr. Drouet's visiting-book that I wished him to adopt—those are the suggestions, which have been read—Mr. Lewis was with me—I was not in Court all day yesterday—I did not hear the description of the attics in which the children were—I went into the attics on a subsequent occasion—on the 4th my inspection was confined to the ward where the cholera cases were, with the exception of some of the halls in which the children took their meals—in consequence of that visit I made a report to the board on the 5th—it was in consequence of ray recommendation that the children were removed—I went down again on the 5th, and waited for the vans that went to fetch the children home—before the vans arrived I examined all the children of the Holborn Union, and I believe James Andrews among the number—I did not go into the part in which he was sleeping at that time—I went into the hall, and the children were brought there for the purpose of being examined—I think 156 were in a fit state to be removed-a great number of them at that time were under the influence of cholera.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090083"></xptr>
               <p>cholera attacks one place, and spares another close by—I have heard of its attacking one side of a ship and not the other, and one side of a street and not the other—I have read of its ravaging apparently healthy and well venti<lb></lb>lated places, and sparing those that are crowded and in a filthy condition—I do not know that that is the case—sometimes a regiment on its march will be attacked by cholera, and when the camp has been broken up, and they have removed a few miles, the cholera has disappeared entirely—I heard it the workhouse that the cholera broke out with violence at the same time at Wandsworth, which is the adjoining parish to Tooting—it commenced there before it did at Tooting, but it was prevailing at the same time—I do not know the Hackney Refuge, or Mr. Warburton's Asylum—I did not ascertain whether the treatment and improvement of diet which I directed on the 4th Jan. was attended to, because the children were removed the next day—I think cold is a great pre-disposing cause to cholera.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe it is well known that rapid atmospheric changes or vicissitudes will predispose to cholera; rapid changes of the atmosphere, from dry to wet, and wet to dry? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appears in some instances it has had that effect, but it is not quite certain—I have read Mr. James Ansley's book; he shows that cholera sometimes follows rapid atmospheric changes, but he has not shown the necessary connection; he has not shown them to be predis<lb></lb>posing causes, because I have known instances in which it has had no effect upon disorders—I did not attend the children, after they came back, at the Hospital or Union.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have stated that insufficient food will not generate cholera, and you were about to add something? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It might pre<lb></lb>dispose to it; being warmly clothed one day, and insufficiently clothed the next, would be a predisposing cause, supposing the disease to be attacking the place at the time—if the children are closely crowded in a school-room, so as to become hot, and are turned out into a cold damp play-ground, and kept there late at night, that would be one cause of depressing the system.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What extra clothing had these 150 children on when they were brought away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Caps and cloaks were sent down from the work-house to cover them—I believe they all had cloaks—when I examined them, to see whether they were fit to be removed, I thought some were under the in<lb></lb>fluence of cholera—I did not observe whether James Andrews was one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not think it necessary to look after those children that night, who you saw influenced by, or predisposed to, cholera? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was expressly precluded doing so that night; it was the condition on which they were admitted into the Free Hospital that no medical man should attend them that night; the medical men of the hospital should attend them, and I was not to go there—I am the officer of the Union—my office was superseded as soon as I got them there—I did not make a report to guide the officers who were to attend them; I had no time, I had other business to attend to; and I was certain that as soon as they were in the hospital they would be attended to by the medical men at once—that was the understanding, I took that for granted—I knew it was an evil for the children to travel in these vans at ten o'clock at night; but it was the lesser evil—it was no doubt injurious to remove them at that time—it might be a predisposing cause equally with the change of clothing—Mr. Ansley lays down in his book that parties living in marshy situations are more liable to cholera—he states it is by reason of the marsh miasma—in my opinion it does not; his opinion is otherwise—it is also considered that terrestrial exhalations, which</p>

               <p>affect the purity of the air, or its electrical state even, will predispose to cholera—I believe it was indispensable to the preservation of their lives to bring them up that night.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090085"></xptr>
               <p>teeth had fallen out, and there was a slight lividity, which is the case with boys of infirm constitutions; it betokens weakness of constitution—the body was very slightly livid, and the akin on the hands and feet was slightly shrivelled in appearance, which you frequently find after death from cholera—on dissection it was found that the layer of fat was exceedingly spare—where there is usually considerable deposition of fat it was almost absent—most of the organs were healthy, with these exceptions, that the lungs were slightly congested; the bronchial glands were slightly enlarged—I noticed that <hi rend="smallCaps">OP</hi> account of their being frequently enlarged in scrofulous and ill-conditioned children, the mesenteric glands were much enlarged with slight deposition of tubercular matter—the external surface of the small intestines was rather pink, and of the large intestines grey; that is a contrast that has been noticed as frequent in cases of cholera—these were indications that death resulted from cholera—the internal or mucous membrane, both of the upper and lower intestines, was congested in patches, and contained some thickish matter, somewhat similar to boiled rice, a gruel-like matter, without any yellow appearance—this matter, carefully examined with a microscope, presented all the appearances which you find in the thick portion of the evacuations in cho<lb></lb>lera—the blood throughout the whole of the body was of a very dark colour, and of a tar-like consistency, yet not coagulated; that was contained chiefly in the large vessels of the body—the large vessels were generally filled with blood throughout the body, but the small vessels were in general empty, and the tissues of the body bad a dry appearance on dissection—the arterial blood was almost as dark as the venous blood—upon analysis it was found to be very peculiar in its composition; that is to say, it contained very much 1<hi rend="smallCaps">M</hi> water, and therefore a much larger quantity of solid matter than is contained in the blood of adults, and excessively so as compared with the ordinary blood of children dying of other diseases—these appearances altogether perfectly satisfied me that the child must have died of Asiatic cholera; I have no doubt about it—the dark appearance of the blood is universal, when a patient has died in a state of collapse, but not afterwards; for when they recover, and then die, that condition is sometimes considerably altered—the heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys, were all healthy—I have no doubt that part of the emaciation of the body would arise from cholera—I should think that that appearance of shrinking might be produced in forty-eight hours, but not the absence of fat; I cannot account for such a state of emaciation, by the progress of cholera only, within forty-eight hours, upon a healthy child—I consider that this must have been rather an unhealthy child; it might bare been hereditary, and it might hare been produced doubtless by being improperly brought up, fed, clothed, and lodged; the appearances were con<lb></lb>sistent with that—I do not know Mr. Drouet's premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon—I have been qualified more than two years, and have been in practice more than two years in the country—I was at Hatfield before I came to Mr. Drouet's. On 81st Oct., 1848, Mr. Drouet engaged me to go to his asylum, at a salary, to attend to the sick—were were about 1100 or 1200 children then there—I saw no medical book for the purpose of recording the state of health of the children—I kept one—I think nearly 200 children were added to that number about the end of Dec., from St. Pan eras' parish—I have memorandums of the number of tick children that I attended—Mr. Drouet never consulted me as to the extent</p>

               <p>of accommodation afforded to the children in the establishment, or with regard to the ventilation of the rooms, or as to their being over-crowded and having too many beds in them, nor as as to the number of children in a room, nor as to their clothing—when I arrived there was a place called the Infirmary—it was a room in the building—there were healthy children in some parts of the same building where the infirmary was—there were a few patients in the infirmary when I went—three or four weeks after I arrived another sick ward was formed—some of the patients I found there bad been seriously ill—there were some cases of opthalmia—there were a few children not in the infirmary affected with the itch—I can give no precise number—there were several affected with cutaneous diseases of some kind or another—there were not many affected with pure itch—there was a separate ward for those who had cutaneous diseases, so as to prevent their contaminating the others—I tried to get rid of the disease, but I found it very difficult indeed—Mr. Drouet did not object to receiving children with the itch—they were received whether they had it or not.</p>

James Andrews would hare anything I chose to order for him, even porter, or any other support I thought fit—the establishment was generally healthy when I went there—there were very few ill in the boys' ward eight or ten; and in the girls and in the infants' ward there might have been an equal number—I cannot tell the exact number, but it was few compared with the number in the establishment—after I went there many children came with the itch upon them—I did my best to get rid of it—I cannot tell whether I succeeded, on account of the cholera breaking out, and the removal of the children—there were four rooms for the infants, boys and girls—the girls were separate from the boys, except the very little ones—they had the same room by day—the cholera broke out very suddenly indeed on 29th, without any preparation at all for it—I saw no premonitory symptoms—there bad been several cases of diarrhoea in Dec. as well as Nov—there are always some in the establishment—they had recovered from that before the cholera broke out—it then became ne-cessary to remove those who were attacked from the healthy ones—that necessarily created a confusion in the establishment—we had great difficulty in procuring nurses; they objected to come, after having agreed to do so—many failed to fulfil their promise—from 29th Dec. to 5th Jan. I did all in my power to arrest the progress of the disease—I was up night and day the whole time—Mr. Drouet was very axious to do all he could—it is plainly proved by experience this last winter, that congregating together is a pre<lb></lb>disposing</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

Chapman, surgeons at Tooting, and surgeons to this establishment as well, were called in—they came in the day—I did not myself personally apply for nurses, I only heard it from those who went that none could be got—I believed it at the time—I have no memorandum of the number of cases of diarrhoea there were when I first went—there were forty-two during the month of Nov., and forty-five in Dec.—it is doubted whether diarrhoea is a premonitary symptom of cholera—some say it is, and some that it is not—I do not think it is in every case, not as a general rule—It was not at Tooting, because it did not exist—very few indeed of those who had had diarrhoea were attacked with cholera—I cannot give the exact number of the forty-five who were attacked with cholera.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say that in the first month forty-two cases arose, do you mean that they were different cases which occurred in that month, or that you had forty-two cases, the same cases throughout the whole month? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Forty-two cases throughout the whole month—the majority of them were cured in the month—they generally lasted only a day or two, and then we had fresh cases, which filled up the number—in the next month we had forty-five; the majority of those were cured—a few of the forty-two were included in the forty-five—some had a repetition, and it was counted as a fresh case—perhaps fifty or sixty different children were attacked by diarrhoea in those two months—very few indeed of those were afterwards affected by cholerar—I could not find a dozen cases, therefore diarrhoea was no premonition of the cholera at all.</p>

                  </hi>., M.D. I have been in practice for several years—I am one of the medical professors of King's College—I accompanied Mr. Grainger to Mr. Drouet's on 25th Jan., at the request of the Board of Health, to examine into the condition of the remaining children—on 20th Jan. I examined the whole of the children of the Holborn Union that were at toe Free Hospital—I think 120 were presented to us for examination; their state was very various; the girls were in better health than the boys, which is almost always the case with children in workhouses—some had very tail limbs, and were pot-bellied—the complexion was pale, and the flesh soft; others, an appearance of health, such as I have generally seen in workhour I children, was observable—about two-thirds, or rather more, had some disease of the skin—the greater number of those being cases of itch, some in the wont or pustular form; some were suffering from broken chilblains, they decidedly differed from the usual appearance of workhouse children, that difference I consisted, in the first place, in the great prevalence of diseases of the axis comparing the condition of their skin with that of children in workhouses, a very remarkable contrast was observed—I never saw so large a number of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184904090092"></xptr>
               <p>children affected with diseases of the skin, chiefly itch—I think I saw more itch in the eight days on which I examined these children than I have seen for three years past in the hospital to which I belong—forty-five per cent. was the entire number of cases of all the children examined that had either itch or some disease of the skin—that was the most striking feature with regard to their condition that I observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it unusual to see thinness and pot-bellies in workhouse children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; by no means unusual; it is a common appearance—the prevalence of itch in workhouses depends entirely on the mode of treatment to which children are subjected—I believe it is quite possible to prevent it in establishments for poor children—if a number of children are sent in with the itch, I should prevent others catching it, by keeping them in separate wards, and subjecting them to a treatment, which cures the disease generally in four or five days, but always in less than ten days, and not allowing them to go among the other children till they were perfectly well; I should, also, keep a strict watch upon them afterwards to detect the commencement of the disease, and to keep them perfectly clean.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your opinion, what was the cause of the appear<lb></lb>ance you observed about the generality of these children? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In the first place, with regard to the prevalence of skin diseases, the neglect of those pre<lb></lb>cautions to which I have alluded, and which ought to be taken in all esta<lb></lb>blishments for poor children, because it would prevent not only itch, but other diseases common to children, which are not only communicated from the hands of one child to another, but also by the clothes; indeed, I believe it is more difficult to cure the clothes than it is to cure the disease—this disease being contagious if you once introduce a child into an establishment, it will spread from that child to a large number, perhaps, to the whole, therefore, the cause of this disease most be traced in the first instance to that introduc<lb></lb>tion having taken place—I judge very much from the state of the skin of a child more than from any other part of the body, and the skin of these children certainly showed that they had not been well managed; they had not received that attention they required as to cleanliness—many of them were in a condition produced by a diet not suited to children, too much fluid and too little solid—a diet which is too fluid, where too much broth is allowed and too little meat, generally distends the belly and produces pot-belly—the usual allowance of meat to pauper children is three times a week, I think—a good deal will depend upon the management of children as to how often they re<lb></lb>quire meat—if a child is much exposed to the air and takes a great deal of exercise it will require more meat than one who is kept in a sedentary posi<lb></lb>tion—a good deal will depend upon the mode of management; some require meat more than three times a week, with others it is sufficient—I think if these children had received a proper diet both in quantity and quality, they would not in so large a proportion as I observed have presented the pot-belly, the wasted limbs, and the flabby soft flesh—the flesh of a child should be firm, and the skin clear and healthy, and not rough as it was in many instances—I attribute this condition to insufficient diet as well as to a want of cleanliness—as far as the prevalence of the akin disease was concerned I attribute that in a very great degree to a want of cleanliness—I believe if they had been attended to, not one-fourth of the quantity of the diseases of the skin which I observed would have existed—I presumed from what I saw that the diet was not satisfactory, that it was unsuitable in point of quality and quantity—the skin of a child shows the nature of its feeding as well as the skin of an animal—you know by the skin of a horse whether it is well</p>

               <p>fed, and you know by the skin of a child whether it is well-fed—I judge more by the skin than by any other part of the body how a child has been treated—with regard to the effect that ventilation, and those other matters which have been alluded to, would have on the state of the children, I offer no opinion—I think I ought to confine myself to the want of cleanliness and proper diet; my opinion is almost entirely confined to that—I think it possible that other circumstances may have been in operation to assist in producing the appearances, but I attribute them principally to the want of cleanliness and to unsuitable diet—the condition of the children improved as my visits became later—the state in which I first saw them would undoubtedly, in my opinion, have rendered them more subject to any virulent disease which might be prevalent—it would have predisposed them to cholera, typhus fever or any other disease that might be prevailing at the time—Mr. Grainger and I examined the children together—I did not go over Mr. Drouet's establish<lb></lb>ment with Mr. Grainger—I entirely confine my opinion with respect to the children to a want of cleanliness and allowance of food.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR FREDERICK THESIGER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you first examine the children of whom you have been speaking at the Free Hospital? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Those belonging to the Holborn Union I saw on the 20th; I saw 120—I do not know what had become of the rest—I examined the whole of the 120—there were sixty-five girls—I think about twenty of the boys passed through my hands—thirty-four of the girls had the itch—they all had cuta<lb></lb>neous disease, and in five cases out of six that disease was the itch; in others it was interigo—that is not allied to itch—almost all cases of itch may, under proper care, and with every facility for curing it, be cured in four or five days, and many in three—these children had been at the Free Hospital, I believe, nearly a fortnight when I saw them—I do not think many of them could have caught it in that fortnight from the form in which I saw it; because many of them had pustular itch, that is large collections of matter formed on the hand, which takes many days to form, and on other parts of the hand were the scan produced by the healing of those sore places, and many of them had evi<lb></lb>dently had the disease for a month or two—there would have been no diffi<lb></lb>culty in the doctors at the Free Hospital seeing those complaints in the form I am describing—it may be called itch in a chronic state, but we hardly apply that term.—we hardly draw a distinction between acute and chronic as applied to that disease; it is in one sense chronic—the advanced stage of that disease has no distinct appellation—pustules form and heal, and others form and heal, and so it spreads over the whole body, and may go on for months—I do not know how many doctors there are at the Free Hospital.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see anything on these children which might not hare been cured in a fortnight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The majority of them, I think might, with proper appliances, baths, and other means for cleansing the surface, separate rooms, and proper attendance, with those appliances, it might be cured in four or five days in the greater number of instances—I do not say that each patient should have a separate room, but a separate bed and separate linen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital—I was there when the children were brought belonging to the Holborn Union—I examined them on 6th Jan.—I examined the boys more particularly—I have some memorandums which I made as to their appearance and state of health—they were examined on 6th, and re-examined again on 9th—a very large proportion of them, sixty-six I think in number, were passed in review, thirty-four of whom had eruptions, and six had sore feet—of those thirty-four having eruptions, the greater proportion were cases of <hi rend="italic">scabies</hi>, others were doubtful, and others were what are termed <hi rend="italic">cachetic</hi> eruptions, or cases depen<lb></lb>dent upon a low condition of the system—the larger proportion of them had pot-bellies and relaxed muscles—some were very healthy—they came under my care on 6th Jan.—they were not under my care especially—I saw them from time to time—I could not form any judgment at all whether previously to their coming to the hospital they had had an insufficiency of food—I should say from my observation of them that the quality of the food was not what it ought to have been; because taking them generally they were not in a good state of health—I can say nothing with, regard to lodging, because I know nothing of Surrey-ball, but they were certainly not sufficiently clothed when they were brought to the hospital—I am speaking more particularly now of the clothing of the boys—Dr. Farr and Mr. Grainger only saw 120 of the children, because some of the boys were ill in bed, and they did not see them—some of them also were in a part of the regular hospital, as we termed it, at that time, removed away, and I do not think they saw them—those they saw were able to walk—they were brought into the room to see them—they were medical cases—young Mr. Wakley had nothing to do with them.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

I found out that several of the children had the itch—I took no method whatever of curing it at that time—I began to treat them after the confusion had subsided, and the urgency of the disease was relieved—I cannot exactly say when I began—I have no memorandum—I thought it important to cure them of the itch, but I thought they would be removed back to the workhouse immediately after the disease for which they were admitted had subsided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But what was there to prevent your beginning to work on the itch that very day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You must recollect that the great number of children brought into the hospital paralyzed us—they were brought into us at three hours' notice—the treatment of the itch is very simple; rubbing with sulphur ointment, cleanliness, and isolation of the patient, and attendants to rub the ointment in—you cannot depend on the children doing it themselves—in cases like that we depend upon the nurses—I do not know whether the clothes they came to the hospital in were the same in which they had gone to Mr. Drouet's—they kept those clothes on at the hospital until they got new ones—we have not at this moment, in a ward of twenty-eight persons,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see the children arrive? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw them get out of the van, and gave orders about getting the rooms ready, the fires lighted, and so forth—the van seemed a proper thing to convey them in—it was perfectly closed in all round like an omnibus, from what I recollect.</p>

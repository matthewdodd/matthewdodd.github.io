                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">city-policeman</hi>, 360). On 4th April, at 7 o'clock, I was in Bridge-street, Blackfriars, near the premises of Messrs. Gilson—I was watching those premises—I saw Ramsey go in at the front-door at a little after 7 o'clock—Holden was standing close by—Ramsey came out again in five minutes—Messrs. Gilson's place is at the corner of William-street—there is an entrance from Bridge-street, and a side-entrance from William-street—Ramsey came out at the side in William-street—he then went into Tudor-street, which is the next street, and I followed him—when he saw Holden he held up his finger, and both went off the pavement into the centre of the street—they were in conversation a short time, and I then saw Holden put his right hand into his waistcoat pocket, and pass something over to Ramsey, who went back into his masters premises in Bridge-street—Holden stood opposite the gas-works, at the corner of Dorset-street—I followed Ramsey to his master's premises; he went in, and remained about four or five minutes,</p>

               <p>and he brought oat this parcel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) under his arm—here is also one parcel of broken pieces which were on the top—when he came out he had two square pieces of glass under his arm, outside of those—he then went into Tudor-street, and he there met Holden—he handed to him the two square pieces as well as the parcels—Holden then turned up Dorset-street, and Ramsey went back in the direction of his master's premises—I followed Holden—just before we came to Salisbury-square I stopped him; he then had the parcels under his arm—I asked him what he had got in those parcels—he said, "What is that to you)"—at that time I had an officer in uniform with me—Holden turned round, and when he saw the officer, he said, "Well, you can see I have got glass outside"—I said, "I suppose you know what is inside; where are you going to take it to, and where did you get it from?"—he said, "I got this parcel from a man of the name of Joseph, and I am going to take it to a man in Fleet-street"—"Joseph" is Ramsey's Chris<lb></lb>tian name—I asked him what the man's name was to whom he was going to take it; he said he did not know—I asked him, "Does the person you are going to take it to, know your name?"—he said, "No"—I said, "How will that person know you, or you know him"—he replied, "Joseph said he would know me by the two pieces of glass under my arm"—I then told him it was stolen property, and I should take him into custody for receiving it, knowing it to be stolen—I took hold of him by the collar, and he imme<lb></lb>diately threw down this (<hi rend="italic">the broken pieces</hi>) with the expression, "Take it, you b—"—a great deal of the glass was so broken—I then took him to the station—I afterwards weighed the glass, and found it was 56 lbs.—it is all plate-glass—I found 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—after lodging him in the station-house, I went and took Ramsey—I asked him if he had taken out any glass that morning, and he asked "Why?" and made, two or three remarks—I then told turn, "I have stopped a person of the name of Holden, with some glass in his possession, which he said you gave him to take to a person in Fleet-street"—he said, "No; Holden is a customer of ours, and he has been here for some glass this morning"—I then said, "I shall take you into custody for stealing that glass; you are here on the premises nearly an hour before your proper time unknown to your employers—he then closed the door in William-street, and went up stairs, and just as he was passing through the passage he fell down in a fit—I took him to the station, and searched him, and found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—afterwards, while going to the police-court, I told him I saw something pass from Holden to him, and I asked him what that was—he said, "It is a half-sovereign in my snuff-box"—I examined the snuff-box, and I found the half-sovereign with the snuff.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glass-merchant, of 25, New-bridge-street, in partnership with other persons—Ramsey was in our employment for two years, or two years and a half, as under cutter—he had no business to be at the warehouse on that particular morning before 8 o'clock—I</p>

               <p>recognise Holden as having had three or four parcels of goods—I should think the whole would amount to about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Ramsey is not the man who would have served him with that description of glass—he would be in the same warehouse—he had no authority to sell glass at that time, or in this way, to that man—he sold glass occasionally; but at that hour in the morning, he had no business whatever—he would not sell that description of glass without positive instructions either from myself) or from the principal cutter—it was left to him to sell that kind of glass.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi rend="smallCaps">ORRIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is this glass out in the usual way for plate-glass? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If any one came to us with an order for that glass, we should not cut it out of stock, because we have to pay 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sheet, and we only get 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a sheet, and as the waste in cutting would average 15 per cent, we should be losers by the transaction—unless we had some small pieces we should have to get it—this was not in small pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner Ramsey's statement before the Magistrate put in and read</hi>: "I met Holden on Saturday morning between 7 and 8 o'clock; he told me he wanted to buy some patent plate. I inquired what size; he said 13 by 8. I said, 'How many do you want?" he said, 'Two dozen or two dozen and a half.' I then left him, and went into the warehouse, and cut twenty<lb></lb>eight. I asked him if he was going to pay; he said, 'Oh yes, by all means.' I said it would come to 22. He said he had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and would get it changed, and believing him to be an honourable man, I cut the glass and put it in a paper parcel, and delivered it to him with a promise that he would be in in half an hour, and pay for them. By that time our clerk would be there—I left him and went back to open our warehouse, and a police-constable came and took me into custody. I have nothing more to say."</p>

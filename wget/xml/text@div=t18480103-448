                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 78.) About eleven o'clock at night, on 14th Dec., I saw the prisoner near Cheapside—he was intoxicated—I took him to the station—I took his Wellington boots out of his pocket, and found in his pocket these two spoons and fork—in the morning when he was sober, he said he knew nothing about them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am waiter at the York Hotel, Covent-garden, kept by Mr. John Green. On tuesday evening, 14th Dec., about five o'clock, the prisoner came—I am sure it was him—he ordered two kidneys—he had them paid and went away between six and seven—he had nothing to drink there—he was perfectly sober—I did not miss anything till I came to court the plate—then missed these two spoons and this fork—these are them.</p>

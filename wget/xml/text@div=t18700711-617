                  </hi>.

Todd, whom I had been serving with hay, I went to London to make inquiries—I went to 64, Sun Street, Bishopsgate, that being the address given me by my correspondent of the name of Quarry—I found what ap<lb></lb>peared</p>

Todd," to "G. Anderson, Esq.," which I sent—I received another order, but in consequence of a cheque being returned that morning, marked "Not sufficient," I did not execute it—I had sent two trucks, but I telegraphed at once to Wim<lb></lb>bledon to stop the hay—I at once came to London—this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for the two trucks that were on the line at the time—I went to the Birkbeck Bank and made inquiries there, and also to Baalzephon Street, Long Lane, Borough, where I found a shop with the shutters up; a woman answered the door, but I could not find anybody there—I was induced to part with the hay to Quarry on the understanding that I was to receive money in return.</p>

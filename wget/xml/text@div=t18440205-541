                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Edwin Leaf, silk warehouse<lb></lb>man, Wood-street, Cheapside, in the parish of St. Alban. I have the charge of the warehouse—I secure it at night, and open it in the morning—on the 10th of Oct. I secured the warehouse at twelve o'clock at night—I went round the premises, and saw all the bolts and fastenings were secure—I observed the counting-house window was perfectly secure—I went into the ribbon-warehouse—the ribbons remain on the counters at night, with paper covered over them—the handkerchiefs are secured from being soiled by wrappers and papers—part of them were on shelves, and part on the counters—they were perfectly safe that night—I went down to the warehouse at seven next morning, entered the counting-house first, and found a drawer in which I keep cash, had been broken open since left it the preceding night—my desk was also forced open, and there was a ladder placed against a shelf in the counting-house, on which books are kept, that would enable a person to get up to the counting-house window, which is a sky-light, very easily—that sky-light had a square of glass taken from it, which would enable any person outside to get into the counting-house—they might get there from a court at the back of the premises on to the flat leads—there are three shelves, which they might use as a ladder to get down from the sky-light—I found a screw<lb></lb>driver on the desk, a taper, and a box of lucifer-matches—there is not the slightest difficulty in getting from the counting-house into the warehouse—it is on the same floor, the ground-floor—I entered the handkerchief depart<lb></lb>ment of the warehouse first, and found the wrappers which covered the shelves had been lifted up, and remained in that state—I did not miss any<lb></lb>thing from there myself—I went into the ribbon warehouse, and found the papers which had covered the ribbons thrown on the floor—I saw some ribbons were gone—I could not tell how many—the locks, and bolts, and everything remained as I had left them the night before, except the sky-light—about thirty young men reside in the warehouse, and sleep in the house—the warehouse forms part of the house, and is under the same roof.</p>

I was in the prosecutor's warehouse, and William Waller, who lives in Bridge-street, Southwark, and is a customer of ours, came there, about eleven o'clock in the morning, and brought ten pieces of black figured satin ribbon for sale—there were twenty rolls—our black ribbon was undressed—I knew them again when he produced them, and detained them—I afterwards produced them to Mr. Leaf.</p>

I went to the warehouse of Mosenden, a general dealer, in the Minories, to make a purchase—among other things, he produced to me twenty half-pieces of black ribbon—in consequence of what he said to me, they were sent home to me, with other goods—they were the same as he had showed me—in consequence of directions I received from him, after keeping them a day or two, I took them to Mr. Leaf's, and produced them to White—I offered them to be dressed, or for sale—the sale was effected—an explanation then took place—a price was agreed on, and he kept the ribbons, but did not pay me for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Camomile-street, and am a merchant, entirely in drapery and haberdashery goods, not in the general line. I have known Hirt seven or eight years, as a commission man—he once kept a warehouse in Gutter-lane—he frequently came with samples of goods, and also has taken samples from my place—he produced a quantity of black and coloured ribbons to me three or four months ago—part of the black was undressed—I have since seen ribbons in possession of the police, which correspond in appearance with those produced by Hirt—they are precisely the same—he asked me if I would buy them—I said, "No, they don't suit me"—he then said, If u you do not think proper to buy them of me, I will introduce you to my principal"—I said, "They won't suit me"—he said again, "Are you fright<lb></lb>ened to buy them? if so, I will introduce you to the principal, to whom they belong"—before he made that observation, I said to him, "Hirt, you are getting on in trade; I never saw you with a parcel of goods before"—he said, "They don't belong to me,"and asked, if they did not suit me, would I re<lb></lb>commend him to a customer—I said, "You know the ribbon trade as well as I do"—he mentioned several names, asking if they would suit so and so, and, among them, Mosenden—I said, very likely they would, as I had seen Mr. Mosenden that morning, and sold him a similar lot of goods—he then left, as I supposed, to go there—he had left the ribbons in my passage for a quarter of an hour or so before I saw them, and said be would go and get a sample of ban<lb></lb>danas,</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a lodging-house, No. 10, Wellington-Street, Kingsland-road. On the Thursday after last Shrove Tuesday, Mrs. Rob<lb></lb>inson, who took our lodging, came there—I saw the prisoner Robinson the same evening—he stopped at my house till the Monday night that he was liberated from the Compter—he was sometimes out at night, and for three or four days together—I knew Davis by the name of James—he was in the habit of com<lb></lb>ing to see Robinson often—sometimes not for a week, a fortnight, or month, but sometimes frequently.</p>

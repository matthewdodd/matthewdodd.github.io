               <p>Soho. On Wednesday, 5th April, the prisoner came to redeem a waistcoat, which was in pawn for a shilling—he gave me a bad shilling—I saw it was bad, and I asked him whether he knew it—he said he did not, and he would take it to where he took it—he said he had received seven shillings from a sister of his, who was a laundress, and that was one of the shillings—he asked me again for it—I refused to give it him, and I cut it in two—there were two young men in the shop, who told me in his hearing that they had seen him at Marlborough-street on a previous charge of uttering a bad half-crown—the prisoner said it was not him—I sent for a constable and gave him in charge—before the constable came he attempted to go away, but I detained him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was not going away, but one of the men behind the counter said, "You had better go and fetch your sister." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No one said that at all—I only walked from the counter to the box, which the prisoner was in to detain him—if that had been said I must have heard it.</p>

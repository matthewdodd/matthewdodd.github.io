                  </hi>. I am a labouring man, and live in Ann-street, Coburg-road. I was at the Hop Pole at eleven o'clock in the evening, on the 29th of May—the two prisoners came in with the prosecutor—he was rather the worse for liquor—they bad two or three pots of ale—Seele sat on the left side of him, and Crawley opposite, on the other side of the table—the prosecutor had a parcel of butter tied up in a handkerchief, in a basket—I saw Crawley take it oat of the basket while he was asleep, and put it into his own basket—I saw Seele's hand in the prosecutor's left-hand breeches' pocket once or twice—his frock was up and her hand underneath—I went and spoke to Mr. Walker out in the skittle-ground, and when I came in again I saw Seele put her hand into the prosecutor's pocket again—Walker came in in consequence of what I told him, and he sat down—I then changed my seat—I came before the prisoners—I kept a look out—in consequence of that Crawley got up—he called me a piper and a noser, and said if I wanted anything I could take it out of him—he had not known me before—I went and spoke to the landlord, and when Crawley went to the bar the lundlprd spoke to him, but I did not hear what it was—I went into the tap-room with the landlord—we awoke the prosecutor, and asked him if he had lost anything—he said, "No"—we told him to feel, and he said he had lost his money, bag and all—he said he had bad 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I and two others went out, and saw the two prisoners, and stopped them till the policeman came—I asked Crawley what he had done with the butter, and he hove it out of his basket into the street—while the prisoners were in the public-house I saw Crawley make signs to Seele, and I saw she nodded her head.</p>

I took the prisoners to the police-court on the following morning after they were taken—I have known Seele for years—I know her husband, or the person who passes as her husband—I saw him in one of the avenues of the Court, and as Seele and I passed close to him she said to him, "Say you gave me 27<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," or 20 something, I could not say what.</p>

               <p>Seele's husband got very much intoxicated, and gave his wife some money; she was returning home; the prosecutor followed her, and they went into the Rosemary Branch; the prosecutor purchased some shrimps and some perri<lb></lb>winkles, and they had some bread and butter; they asked me to have some; they called for a pint of beer and some gin; the prosecutor took the money out of a bag, which appeared to contain 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he was a little in liquor, and asked where he could get a lodging; I recollected the Hop Pole, and said I thought Mr. Smith might accommodate him; he said, "If you will go with me I will treat you with what you like to drink;" on the road I sold two lobsters for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; when we got to the Hop Pole the prosecutor called for a pot of ale; he took out his purse and paid the landlord 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he sat some time, and thought he would like to have something to eat; 1 said if he liked a lobster I would fetch him some bread; I fetched 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of pickled cabbage; he took out his purse, which contained a sovereign and some shillings; I said, "Never mind changing the sovereign, as I have been eating and drinking with you, I will take this butter, and we will cry quits;" I sat at the side of the table; I did not get up to put it into my pocket, bat I put it into his basket; about ten o'clock the landlord called me out and said, "Crawley, a party told me you want to rob the man:" I said, "You know me; God forbid I should bring a man to your house to rob him;" he said, "I hope there is nothing of the kind;" I said not to my knowledge, and it should not be done in my company; the prosecutor was then asleep, and I said, "Smith, I have left the man asleep, you take care of him;" I got a little distance and the policeman came, and in taking hold of my arm he knocked the basked off my head, and the butter fell out; I had no idea of the man being robbed; if he did lose his sovereign it must have been after I left the premises.</p>

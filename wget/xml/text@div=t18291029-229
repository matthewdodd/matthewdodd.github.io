               <p>MARGARET WARD. I am nine years old, and live with my father, James Ward, in <placeName id="t18291029-229-crimeloc1301">Whitecross-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18291029-229-crimeloc1301" type="placeName" value="Whitecross-street"></interp>

On the 14th of October I was alone in the house, I shut the street door, left it on the latch, and went out into the back yard; I remained there about a quarter of an hour, then came back, and saw a little boy run out - I did not see whether he had any thing, now hear any noise; I had time to see him; I had never seen him before - I missed some Delphware from the cupboard, and some halfpence in a little bag, which was in a mug - I went and told my mother almost directly; she was in Whitecross-street, selling fruit: I then got a constable, and went to Moggeridge's father's house, which is next door but one to us - the constable knocked at the door; it was not opened - he got in at the window, and let me in; this was within ten minutes of the time, but nothing was found - the prisoner is not the boy who ran out; he was much less than him: he told the Magistrate the door was kept fast because his father expected an execution; I am quite sure he is not the boy, for I knew the prisoner.</p>

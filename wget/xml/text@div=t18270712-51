I lived there in September, but not in the same house; on the 11th of September I was on my business in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel, and in the way home from the last patient I called on, (which was in Pugh's-row, Elliott-street, Brick-lane) I arrived at <placeName id="t18270712-51-crimeloc293">Fleet-street-hill</placeName>

I was then surrounded by about twenty men and boys; several of them had sticks in their hands - my arms were tied behind me, and one of them, whom I believe to be the prisoner, called out, "If the b-r speaks knock his b-y brains out." I begged of them not to ill-treat me, and the man who held my right arm, said I should not be hurt - that man's name was Boyce; they were all close to me. Boyce was on my right, and rifled my right-hand pockets - from my right-hand trousers pocket was taken a case of surgical instruments, and two cases of lancets; from my right-hand waistcoat pocket, two or three keys, and a piece of ass's skin - from my left-hand trousers pocket, two sovereigns, three shillings, and a sixpence, and a pen-knife, with a broken point; and from my left-hand waistcoat pocket, a small velvet pin-cushion; they next untied my cravat and took that; the prisoner then came up to me, and took my hat off my head with both his hands, it was a fine starlight night. I cannot exactly say whether the moon was up; I am certain of the prisoner's person - he had a blue or dark coat on, with gilt or polished buttons and light trousers. I believe it was a blue coat; I am not able to speak to any other part of his dress. I saw West, the officer, that evening, and described the prisoner, and some of the others to him.</p>
               <p>Q. After having taken your cravat and hat, what next occurred? A. The prisoner called out, "Now give the b-r a rum one;" before my hat was taken Boyce had rubbed my trousers down, feeling for my watch; and when my hat and cravat were taken off Houghton, who was one of them, came up to me and unbuttoned the flap of my trousers, and Boyce cried out, "The b-r has got no toy." After that - they were about to run away I asked Boyce to give me my keys, as they were no service to him; he returned me one, saying, "You b-r, there is your key;" they ran away, and I after them, calling Stop thief! it was immediately after my hat was taken that the prisoner said, "Now give the b-r a rum one;" and Boyce said, "Don't hurt the poor b-r."</p>
               <p>Q. Now, look at the prisoner again, and say, on your oath, have you any doubt that the prisoner is the man who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182707120032"></xptr>did the acts you have stated? A. I have no doubt whatever; I am certain of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How often have you been here before? A. In September and October Sessions; I indicted seven persons, Henry and James Boyce, Houghton, Hackman, Ore, Bishop, and Downes; I have seen Hackman and Ore since the trial - four in all have been acquitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear as positively to their identity? A. I did. I was out of the Court during part of their trial; I heard part of the defence made by the prisoners - several persons came up to prove that they were not on the spot at the time of the robbery. I have been on a trial at the Sheriff's Court, in Red Lion-square; I was tried at Clerkenwell, for assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty - but I did not conceive him to be on his duty; that was after the trials happened in this Court, I never said, "If any person came to take me up for a debt, that I would shoot them." I was found guilty of the assault and went into custody; I was brought up on the Saturday for judgment, and paid a fine of 1s., and the law expenses - my solicitor settled the expenses for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been on the day of the robbery? A. I had been attending my patients the whole of the day - I am certain of the prisoner. I did not say I believed he was the man, but that he was the man; I saw him just before he called out - I believe he is the person who first called out. Hackman, Bishop, Ore, and Downes were present at the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. You state your arms were tied behind you, and one cried out, "Knock his b-y brains out;" have you always stated this to be so? A. I have; he also said, "If the b-r speaks, "I stated on the former trial that a man on my left-hand side used that expression - I did not name him. I did not swear that Boyce said that; nobody collected round till after I cried Stop thief! which was two or three minutes. I saw nobody come up till then, except the men who robbed me; but it is impossible for me to say that nobody did come. I was much alarmed at first, but Boyce promised I should not be hurt, and I looked about at them - some had sticks in their hands; I swear to the prisoner from his person, not from his dress - from his person and dress also. I believe he was examined four times at Worship-street - the first examination was Saturday fortnight, and the last on Monday last; he was committed on the third examination. I did not attend the first, being unwell; I was not able to produce sufficient evidence on the second, and was allowed till Saturday fortnight, on account of illness. I believe Garton was in the office; I do not recollect his being desired to leave the office. I never said I did not know the prisoner, or that I only believed him to be the man - I spoke positively to him in the first instance. I know Mr. Turner, who keeps the Rein Deer, public-house, on Bethnal-green - I do not recollect speaking to him that night, but I might; his house is a mile and a half or two miles from where I was robbed. I spoke to several people.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you a perfect recollection of the person of the prisoner? A. I have; I never entertained a doubt about him - the moment I saw West I told him I should know the person who took my hat, and described his person. I have always declared I should know the person who took my hat; Boyce and Houghton, were convicted - Boyce was executed.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bethnal-green. I apprehended the prisoner on the 19th of June, at a place called Botany-bay. I had been looking for him ever since the robbery - I did not threaten or promise him in any way whatever. I said I apprehended him for a highway robbery, committed on Dr. Fuller - he said, "I wish I had given myself up at first - it would have been all over before now," and when we were waiting next door to the Police-office, before the examination, the same morning, I asked him what he had been doing with himself, as I had been after him to different places, full two hundred miles - he said he would be hanged sooner than come it - come it means impeaching against an associate - it is a term well known. On the evening the robbery was committed I saw the prosecutor about twenty minutes to eight o'clock, in the shop of the churchwarden, in Bethnal-green-road - he had no hat nor cravat; I went for assistance to the Bladebone public-house, which is about five doors off; there is a window in the passage, which shows the public house clock - I saw the clock, and it wanted about two minutes of a quarter to eight - that enables me to speak with certainly to the time I saw Mr. Fuller - he gave me information of the person of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Botany-bay by no other name? A. No; it is situated in Hare-street-fields; I do not know it as Granby's-row; I never looked up to see if it has any name - it may be a mile from Mr. Fuller's; I have stated accurately what the prisoner said; I have related all the conversation as near as I can recollect.</p>

             keeps a lodging house; I am a single man; I was coming home to where I live, I live in Norfolk; I met this woman at the top of Tottenham-court-road on the 29th of July, it may be about eleven o'clock at night, it was a Monday, I was drunk, I was walking up, and she catched hold of me, and whether she spoke to me first, or I to her, I am not positive; I asked her if she could take me any where, where I could lodge that night, as I was quite a stranger? she told me that she could take me to a house that she knew very well, where I could have a very good bed; she took me to a lodging, <placeName id="t17930911-87-crimeloc483">No. 4, Church-lane, close by Bloomsbury, it is in St. Giles's parish</placeName>

               <p>Q. What were you so drunk you don't recollect? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you about you when you went into the house? - Four pounds ten shillings. I paid a shilling for the house, and I gave the prisoner something to drink; I had four shillings and six-pence I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay for what you gave the prisoner to drink? - I don't know; I had four guineas and about two pennyworth of halfpence in my waistcoat pocket, I saw them when I was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any silver? - Yes, when I went in I had four or five shillings, I cannot tell which, besides two very remarkable six-pences.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss your money? - In the morning about half after four o'clock, and the woman was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the woman in the room when you missed your money? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not sober enough to know whether she left the room? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any of this money been found? - The two six-pences she gave me out of her own pocket the next morning. When I awaked I got up, and went and searched the houses where I could find any body, and I went into a public house, called the Running Horse, and there I found the prisoner, the best part of a furlong from the lodgings; with that I saw her, and I said are you the person that took me to the lodgings last night? she said, yes; said I, what have you done with the money? then she said, she had got none; I told her she certainly had, and she had best give it up to me without any further ado; she said she had not got it, and the woman that keeps the public house said she knew better, that she had got it; that was in the presence of the prisoner, and the woman that kept the house told her if she had not got it then, she had given it to an old woman that she had been treating that morning; there was another girl also there, and she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110141"></xptr>told her that she should be well rigged out in two or three days time; with that I saw a person there that I knew, and I slipt out for the officer; he came and searched her; before he came she gave me these two six-pences, and she said she had not any more but them, and the officer searched her, and he could not find any more about her; Mr. Sanders, the officer, has the six-pences.</p>
               <p>Court. How came you not to put these six-pences in the indictment?</p>

               <p>Q. Had you recommended her to confess? - I had recommended her to confess.</p>

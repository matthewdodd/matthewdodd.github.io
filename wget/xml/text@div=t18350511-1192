                  </hi>. I live with Mr. Green, in Lisle-street, Leicester-square, On the 5th of May, the prisoner came to my master's house, she asked for a lodger on the first floor, named Morgan—I asked her into the parlour while I went down to take some eggs off the fire—I heard the back door open, I went up, and the prisoner asked me if she might go into the yard—I said, "Certainly," she soon afterwards went away, saying she would wait no longer—my mistress was ill, and did not come down that day till two o'clock—she then missed her cap and shawl—I went out in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner with the shawl on—I asked her to come back, she said she would not—I brought her back by force—she beat and kicked me, and it was with great difficulty I got her along—she said she had pawned the cap—I had never seen her before.</p>

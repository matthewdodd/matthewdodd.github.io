On the 8th of July, at half-past eight o'clock at night, there were seven sheep penned within the hurdles in his field - I missed them at six the next morning, and found three or four of the hurdles had been taken down, and laid flat on the ground; they were Southdown sheep, marked H. in a circle; they were brought back on the 11th or 12th; I had seen the prisoner about a month or six weeks before, in the long grass, very near to where these sheep were, but we had none then; I asked why he was trespassing there - he asked if I never walked round fields myself - I told him to walk out; he said he should go when he pleased. Mr. Heygate's premises join Lord Mansfield's, and are about a mile and a half from Somer's-town.</p>

            . I am a drover. On the 8th of July, at night, I was by the Elephant and Castle, going to Smithfield; I saw the prisoner with seven sheep, marked with a round O on the rump, and an H within it; I walked with him for a quarter of a mile - he asked me to let him mix the sheep with mine - he did not say why; he did not appear to know how to drive them; they were Southdown sheep; I parted with him at the end of Skinner-street, Somer's-town. I was informed he was in custody on the 11th; I went to Kentish-town watch-house, and saw him, but did not recollect his person then.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you speak to him now? A. Why, I did not own him at the watch-house, because the officers had had me in custody, and so I would not answer them - I have been several times in custody, but only for rows.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Repeat your last answer - did you say only for rows? A. No, Sir - I was once in trouble about a smock-frock; I do not know whether I was charged with stealing it. I was in gaol two months after being tried. I have not been in custody fifty times, nor twenty-five, nor half of that. I am not going to satisfy you.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been in gaol? A. About eight times - I will not swear to ten; I was only tried once - that was about the smock-frock. I described the man who had the sheep to Brown, as a country looking man, and said I could swear to him among five hundred - that he was a stout man, with a red face. I did not, to my knowledge, say I should get 20l. if I convicted this man; I will not swear about it; I do not want to convict the man; I said it was a much stouter man, but I have explained my reason for that. I never said I should not swear to him if Dr. Owen had not threatened to lock me up, or any such thing. My life has been threatened outside the gate. I have only been in custody once on a charge of theft.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW, not being able to support this witness' testimony, withdrew from the prosecution.</p>

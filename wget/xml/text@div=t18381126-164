                  </hi>. I am agent to Mr. Marchant, an iron-merchant, near Walsal. There was an assignment of pig-iron to me from him—it was received in November—it was marked with the letter "M"—it was the first of that mark that ever came into the London market—it came by the <hi rend="italic">Fanny</hi>—the mark was made expressly for Mr. Marchant—I heard him give the order when I was in Staffordshire—this was to be taken to the Regents'-canal, by Mr. Covington—I saw it after it was barged, and had it weighed—the weight was 42 tons, 6 cwt., and 1 qr.—I made this memorandum at the time—the weight consigned was 40 tons, long weight, which would make 42 tons, 17cwt.—I saw some pigs of iron in the custody of Fogg, at the Thames police-office, on the 8th of November—that was part of the consignment—it was marked with that particular letter "M" upon it—the price of iron of that description, in large quantities, would be 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a ton-in small quantities it would be more—that would be 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per cwt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames Police Surveyor. On the 8th of November, I saw the prisoner Squires's cart in Whitechapel—I then saw him with his cart in Wapping—I stopped him, looked into the cart, and saw some pig iron—I asked where he got it from—he said, "Oh, I bought it at a sale"—I said, "Well, perhaps you can show me the catalogue"—he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a book, and said, "No, I did not buy it at a sale; I bought it of a man who did buy it at a sale"—I said, "Well, then, you can tell me who that man is, and I will go with you"—he said, "Yes, his name is Smith—he is a smith, and keeps a marine store-shop in Dog-row"—I examined the iron, and the mark "M" was on it—I then took him to Joseph Smith, the prisoner, and asked Smith if he had sold any pig-iron to Squires—he said, "Yes"—I told him there was a large square weight, with a mark on it—he said, "Yes"—I then asked Joseph Smith where he bought it—he said, "It is all right; I bought it of a man at the canal"—he said, "I bought it of the lock-keeper of the Old Ford Lock"—I said, "I will go there," and in going I said, "Perhaps he will deny it," and Squires said, "No, he cannot deny it, because we were all three together"—when we got to the lock, we found there James Smith—he was the lock-keeper—I asked him if he had sold this man any iron—he hesitated some little time, and said, "Yes, I did"—I said, "It is pig-iron; there is a large square mark, with R. C. C. on it"—he said, "I picked some of it out of the canal, and some fell out of the barge, on to the quay"—I said, "It is impossible for it to have fallen out in that way"—he said he hoped I would not let Mr. Golding know any thing about it, or else he should lose his situation—I then left him there, and desired him to attend the next day—I weighed the iron, and found there were thirteen</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver, of 7, Southampton Street, Pentonville—on Friday evening, 1st December, about 6 o'clock, I "put on" at Fullwood's Rents, Holborn, about 6 o'clock—I went into a coffee-shop to have some tea, and Anderson, another driver, came in and had some tea—I then had a short fare, and came back again, and heard that the cab had been lost—I had a fare to Islington, at 8.30, and saw Anderson's lost cab going up the Essex Road, driven by the prisoner, who I have known some years—I told a constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Red Lion public-house, Basinghall-street. On the 1st of March, the prisoners came in about half-past twelve o'clock, one after the other, as close as they could be—Johnson was first—he asked for three halfpennyworth of gin, and Jefferey for three halfpennyworth of gin and spruce—Jefferey gave me a good sixpence—Johnson put down a good half-crown—I did not give him change—he called for the good half-crown back again, and I gave it him—he said he had got halfpence, and he gave the half-crown to Jefferey—he put it sily under the counter, that I should not see it, and Jefferey went off immediately, like a shot, with it—Johnson then said, "I have got no halfpence, mistress, I must have change," and he threw me down a counterfeit half-crown—I said, "What is this you have gives me?"—he said, "A half-crown, to be sure"—I said it was a bad one, and I called my husband, who went outside after Jefferey'—I said to Johnson, "Why did you come to me, you know the last time you were here I turned you out of the house?—I kept the half-crown in my hand till my husband brought a policeman, and I gave it to him—I am certain Jef<lb></lb>ferey had left when Johnson gave me the bad half-crown—he gave it me less than five minutes after Jefferey left.</p>

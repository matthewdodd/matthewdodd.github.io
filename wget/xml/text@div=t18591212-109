                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 466). I know the prisoner, Carruthers, by seeing him standing about Hamborough Wharf, Upper Thames-street—on the morning of 8th December I went to his house—he was not at home—I commenced searching; his wife and children were there—he afterwards came home, and I asked him where he had got that paper from that his wife had taken to Hamborough wharf—he said that he should not tell me—his wife said that she took it there by his orders—I had been watching her—I saw her take a parcel of paper there, and I fetched it from there, took it to the station, and ascertained that it belonged to Mr. Robinson, a wholesale stationer, of 79, Upper Thames-street—I took the prisoner to the station and showed him the paper which was there—he told me that he should not tell me the man's name who had left it there—the prisoner Low was then brought in by Mr. Robinson, and he said in Carruther's presence that Carruthers had pressed him to take some paper, that he took four packages yesterday morn<lb></lb>ing, and had taken four packages on the Wednesday morning previous—Carruthers made no reply—I had seen the prisoners together the night before coming out of a public-house opposite Hamborough Wharf.</p>

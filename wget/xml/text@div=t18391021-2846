                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live at Dockhead—the prisoner was in my service. I received information on the 10th of October, which led me to go to him—I said, "Button, I believe you are doing some work for Mr. Vine?"—he said, "Yes, he was doing a little job for him"—I said, I think you have some of ray stone using on his premises"—he said, "Certainly not, none of your stones I am sure"—I said, we would go and see—I went into one of the rooms of Mr. Vine's house, and saw some loose chimney-pieces partly prepared—I turned them over, and saw some Portland and some Bath—I said, "I think part of this is mine"—he said, "No, certainly not, I have had it some time"—I went into the par-lour, and there saw two marble chimney-pieces, one finished and the other not—the shelf was not on—I said, "This looks like mine"—he said, "No, certainly not, it is some I have had by me"—I then discovered a piece of Bath stone—I said, "This looks like mine"—he said, "No"—I said, "It</p>

               <p>looks like it, and to ascertain it we will go and fetch Millidge"—Millidge came and turned the stones over, and he said he thought the piece of York was mine—I said to him, Fetch the piece that it was cut from my premises," I compared it, and they corresponded—I then said to the prisoner, "Now are you satisfied that this is my property?"—he said, he was very sorry to say that it was mine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's service. I missed stone from his premises in Belvoir-square—I went to Mr. Vine's premises and saw there this piece of York stone, which is my master's—we have com<lb></lb>pared it with a stone that is now in Court—they tally exactly—the pri<lb></lb>soner at last confessed that one stone belonged to Mr. Smith, but said he did not bring it there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> State the words that you think the prisoner used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said he must confess that that piece of stone belonged to Mr. Smith, but he did not bring it there—I will not swear that "confess" was the word I made use of in the first instance—I cannot say exactly—it was to Mr. Smith and me that he spoke—Mr. Smith had said that he thought it was his stone, and I fetched the other piece to match it—the stones are here—they match, in the edge—I am a stone-mason—I missed this piece from my master's premises—I am employed to use the stone when it is wanted, and so was the prisoner—he was the managing man—I missed stone about three days before he was taken—it was lying about the pre<lb></lb>mises in small quantities—Mr. Smith was building four houses and a church just by, but what was used for that was a different sort of stone—Goodhall was taken, but it was not on my charge—he is sometimes a labourer, and sometimes a stone-sawyer—I was not called on to account for this stone—when we wanted a piece of stone we took it and used it.</p>

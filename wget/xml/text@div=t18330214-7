               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you tell us how much you drank at the Windsor Castle? A. No, I had some porter - I cannot tell how much I paid for; I will swear it was not two or three quarts - I do not recollect what I drank next; I had a glass of gin, I believe there, and a pint or two of porter - I will not swear I did not drink four pints of porter; I might have a glass of gin or two - I do not know how much; I cannot recollect whether I had any thing else there - I do not think I had any wine, but am not certain; I believe I paid the man for what I had - I do not know whether he waited on me all the while; I may have paid a man and a woman - I paid for every thing as it was brought; I believe the last thing I had was gin - I was not drunk when I left the Windsor Castle; I saw the landlady at the City Arms - I was rather fresh when there, I believe; I was sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps then you recollect Turfrey requesting the landlady to give you a bed there, as you was so drunk? A. I cannot recollect it - I do not recollect seeing him there at all; I do not know at what time I left the City Arms - I do not recollect being taken out of that house by Harding in his arms; I recollect nothing till I found myself walking upon the bridge, which is forty or fifty yards from the house - I do not remember being outside the house by the shutters and falling down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tumble into the cellar yourself? A. No, when I awoke at the station-house, I was surprised to find myself there - I do not recollect saying I knew nothing about Harding.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Windsor Castle, City-road. On Saturday, the 2nd of February, I remember the prosecutor coming there, about six o'clock - he staid there and had a pint of beer, and went out again; I know Turfrey - he came in about half-past five o'clock, and was there when Bodle came in, and remained there; they were in the same room - Turfrey offered some seals for sale, while Bodle was there; he remained there all the time - Bodle came back about eight o'clock, had a pint more porter, and remained there smoking his pipe till about half-past nine o'clock, and was singing, and then he had a quartern of gin and some warm water; he sung several songs after that, till about half-past ten o'clock - then he had a glass of rum in some warm water, then he sat till about a quarter after eleven o'clock, and wanted another glass of rum in warm water - master said it was too late to serve, and would not serve him with any more; he paid for the liquor as he had it, except for the glass of rum - master told him it was half-past eleven o'clock, and it was time to go out; I told all the people it was time to go - Bodle was going out without paying for his rum; master called him back and he stood talking in the passage while I let Turfrey out, and when I opened the door to let Bodle out Turfrey stood at the door, and they walked off together - the prosecutor was not drunk; he was capable of knowing what he was doing - he was not sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the Macclesfield Arms from your house? A. One hundred yards.</p>

            . I keep the Macclesfield Arms. Bodle came into my house on the 2nd of February, a little before twelve o'clock, alone - Turfrey was there; I will not be certain which came in first - Bodle certainly had been drinking; he was not sober, but I think knew what he was doing - he had a glass of gin put into some cold water; he paid for it - I saw 8s. or 12s., in his hand when he paid me; he held it open in his hand for a minute -Turfrey was standing close by him, and saw it; the prosecutor asked me if he could have a bed at my house for the night - I said he could not, but I dare say he could get one in the neighbourhood; Turfrey told him he would give him a bed if he would go to Paddington with him -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140018"></xptr>I told him he had better not go to Paddington, but get a bed in the neighbourhood, and desired him to have nothing to do with Turfrey, as he was a strange man; Turfrey did not like what I said, and got insolent to me - I ordered my servant to put him outside the door; and again told the prosecutor to have nothing to do with him; my servant took Turfrey by the arm, and rather lead him out of the house - Bodle stopped about two minutes, and then he went; I saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About what time did the prosecutor come to your house? A. About five minutes to twelve o'clock - I thought before he went that he had had quite sufficient; I served him as I should another customer - I was preparing to clear my house; he had a glass of port wine almost immediately after the gin - he mixed it all up together - I did not say any thing to him about it; he did not walk out of my house like a tipsy man - he was not very drunk; the City Arms is about one hundred yards from my house.</p>

            . I keep the City Arms. On the night of the 2nd of February the prisoner Turfrey came to my house - I never saw him before; it was about ten minutes or a quarter after twelve o'clock - he came into the house, and had half a pint of ale; Bodle came in five or ten minutes after - he staggered in, and the moment he got in he sat down on the bench by the bar, and said to Turfrey,"Old fellow are you here, you shall have a glass of something to drink," naming gin; Turfrey said he had rather not, he had got his ale, and would not take any thing more - Turfrey then came to me, and said, "I have been in company with this man before this evening - he wants a bed;" Bodle was sitting close to him, and was awake then - I said nothing to that, and Turfrey said, "He has got some money about him, I know, and if he will leave it with you, I will take him to Paddington to sleep;" I recollect nothing more - I made no answer about my taking the money, but some man at the bar said it would be as safe as if he had got it with him, if he left it with me, but I said nothing, he being a stranger - he fell asleep, fell under the bench, and laid there about twenty minutes, till I was about to clear the house; I requested somebody to go and take him up from the bench - Harding was the man who took him up - he was there when the prosecutor came in; he took him up several times, endeavouring to awake him, but could not - he was quite in a state of insensibility; I recollect nothing else - they took him outside the door, and I saw nothing more; this was about a quarter to one o'clock - it was some time before I could get him out of doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At the time he left your house was he not in such a state of drunkenness that you would not rely on any thing he either said or did? A. I would not; I never saw a man more drunk in my life; I am sure Turfrey desired him to leave his money with me - I have known Harding four years - he is married, and has two children; he gets his living by working at the wharfs, or any thing he can get to do - I never heard any thing against his honesty; he frequented my house with a set of hard-working men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When this happened was he in work or not? A. He had been at work that day at Green and Barrett's - I heard the men say so.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Saturday night, the 2nd of February, I was on duty in Wharf-road, City-road - part of my beat was in the City-road, near the canal-bridge; I first saw Bodle between eleven and twelve o'clock that night, it was nearer twelve; Turfrey was walking about three feet from him - he and Bodle were walking up the City-road about three feet apart; I did not observe any other person - they went over the bridge, and I lost them; I saw the two prisoners and the prosecutor, about half-past two o'clock, just coming out of the City-road into the wharf road - Harding had hold of the prosecutor's right arm, and Turfrey his left arm, and as they went past me, Turfrey said to him, "You make yourself drunker than you really are;" he said, "You know I am your countryman and your friend, why don't you walk as you ought to do;" by his saying that I thought it was not all right, and watched them; I went a little way from them, then turned back, followed them, and observed them in the yard of No. 33 wharf, all three together, but what they were doing I cannot say - Harding looked back, and then I popped behind a gate-post for them not to see me, and in about a quarter of a minute I looked again, and the prosecutor was missing; I did not know where he was gone to - the two prisoners were coming down the yard; Turfrey came out first, and Harding followed - Harding said to Turfrey, "Are you going home?" Turfrey said Yes - Harding said, "Good night," and they parted; Turfrey went one way and 
               <persName id="t18330214-7-person205">Harding</persName>
             the other - Turfrey had not gone above ten yards before he turned and came back, and wanted to make me believe he was as drunk as he could be to walk - I went and met him, and he said, "Have you seen any thing of a boatman?" I said No, I had seen no boatman, and as I told him that Harding came up (they at first were both going in a direction from me) - Harding said, "Have you seen him?" Turfrey said, "No, and the Policeman has not seen him;" I then walked towards the City-road, a few yards away from them - they went towards the wharf No. 33 again together; I went and concealed myself behind a cart opposite the wharf gate - they came out of the yard again, looked about for a quarter of a minute, and Harding said to Turfrey, "Let us go and see if we have done for the b-r;" Turfrey replied, "If we have not, we soon will do;" they went back up the yard again - I observed my brother officer Cook coming up; I called for his assistance, and told him my suspicious; we were going towards the gateway, and met the prisoners just out of the gate - we went up to them, and I asked Harding what business he had up that yard - he told me he had not been up the yard; I told him I had seen him go up; he said he had not been up - I asked him where the countryman was - he said he knew nothing about the countryman, he had not seen him; I said."Then let us go back, and see if we can find him;" he said very well, and we all four went back, and Cook, looking into an unfinished house, with a cellar under it, said, "Here he lays;" I turned my lantern on, and saw him laying flat on his back in the cellar- I thought he was dead; we then got the two prisoners down to assist him up, for I did not like to go down myself, for fear they should escape - Cook said,"Here is his pocket inside out;" it was his right-hand breeches pocket; I looked, and it was so - I then got the prosecutor up; I laid him down, sprang my rattle, and got more assistance - I said to Harding, "It is my opinion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140019"></xptr>you have robbed this man, and meant to murder him;" he said, "No, I have not;" I said, "I shall search you;" he said, "You may search me, I have nothing about me;" I then searched him, and found six shillings, five sixpences, and 1 1/2d. - I asked him how he came by it; he said he earned 1s. 5d. that day, and afterwards that he had earned 1s. 7d.; I asked him how he got the rest - he said he should not satisfy me; we took them to the station-house, secured them, and then fetched the prosecutor - he could not walk; we were obliged to get a truck; we could not make any sense of him - I could not tell whether it was with liquor or from his fall; my brother officer searched the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw the prosecutor, he was walking as if he was drunk? A. No, not when I saw him between eleven and twelve o'clock, but when I saw him near the wharf; I afterwards saw the two prisoners alone - they separated, went different ways, and then both came back to me.</p>
               <p>Q. If conscious of having done wrong, was there any thing to prevent them going away? A. No; I should have taken care that Turfrey did not go away - I was about five yards from him; he turned back and came to me.</p>

               <p>Q. After that they were looking about for him? A. They were looking for somebody - the cellar is six or eight feet deep; it is an open cellar - a drunken man might very readily tumble into it; he appeared to walk as if he was very drunk - he had the prisoners with him; the place is near the water - he might have fallen in if left alone. I thought it my duty to watch them, and not to go and inquire where he was going; the prisoners went down the cellar readily to help him up'; Cook did not go down with them, he took hold of him as they lifted him up.</p>
               <p>Q. If they were conscious of robbing him, might they not have put his pocket in before they lifted him up? A. We should have seen it; Turfrey did not appear drunk when we got to the station-house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How far from the cellar did you last see the prisoners with the prosecutor? A. Right opposite, about four yards, or not quite so far; I saw them all three together there - I did not see the prosecutor alone at all, till I found him in the cellar; they were all three standing still, opposite the cellar, when I last saw them, they were in the middle of the cart road, and after I had seen them together there I missed the prosecutor - the prisoners were then coming towards me; they could not get out without coming to me - I had lost sight of them for about a quarter or half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. When they returned and asked if you had seen the boatman, are you aware whether they knew you had overheard them? A. I was close by them - they were not aware that I had seen them go up the yard a second time - they saw me going, as they thought, up the City-road; they both went down towards the yard; they were not aware that I overheard their conversation - it did not take half a minute to get behind the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If we understand you right, they separated once, and went different ways, neither of them then coming towards you? A. No, but after that, Turfrey turned back and came and spoke to me - while he was talking, Harding also came up, and asked if he had seen him; I then turned from them and they went towards they yard - they could not then tell that I could see what they did, as I went and concealed myself behind the cart; it was moon-light.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you saw the three standing together, how near were you to them? A. About five yards; it was moon-light - the wind blew very much, I could hardly hear any thing - it was a very boisterous night indeed: but I was not above two yards from them when I heard them speaking, and close to them when Turfrey said to the prosecutor,"You are making yourself drunker than you are;" they could not avoid seeing me then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near were you to them when they said, "Let us go and see if we have done for him?" A. About four yards.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the Sunday morning, between two and three o'clock, my brother officer called me; I went with him to 33 Wharf, and when I was within nine or ten yards of the gate I met Harding, I walked up to him, and asked what he did up that wharf at that time in the morning; he said he had not been up the yard. I told him I saw him come out; while I was questioning him, Turfrey came out, and when he saw me, he asked me if I had seen a countryman of his; I asked him what countryman; he said, "A boatman that he just took up the yard;" he said, "We have been to look for him, but cannot find him." I said to both the prisoners"Go up the yard, and I will see whether I cannot find him;" we proceeded up the yard, about half way, and there is an unfinished building, and in the third opening there is a place dug out for a cellar, between five and six feet deep - I looked down, and observed the prosecutor laying on his back; I turned round to Harding, and said, here he is; he said, "So he is;" my brother officer turned his light on, and I thought he was dead at first - I desired Turfrey to get down, which he did, and we sent Harding down - they lifted him up, I laid hold of his arms, dragged him up, laid him on the ground, and his right-hand breeches-pocket was turned inside out; my brother officer said he had been robbed - I said, "Yes, it appears so;" I sprang my rattle twice, and another officer came up. I desired him to stand over the prisoners, while we laid the prosecutor in a shed - then we took the prisoners to the station, returned and fetched the prosecutor in a truck. I searched Turfrey on the spot, and found 1 1/2d. on him. I searched the prosecutor's pockets - he had no money at all, I did that when I came back to fetch him - in going to the station-house, Turfrey said he had nothing to do with leading the prosecutor down the Wharf-road. Harding turned round and said, "Don't tell a falsehood, speak the truth - you know you was with me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you both the prisoners in charge at the time? A. No; I had Turfrey, Epps and another officer had Harding on a-head of me, he might hear what Harding said - I should think he could not avoid it. Epps said the man had been robbed; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140020"></xptr>not hear him say, "In my opinion you have robbed the man first, and then intended to murder him." I was not paying attention - I was three or four yards from him; I paid attention to some part of what he said, but might not hear all.</p>
               <p>Turfrey's Defence. Gentlemen, I hope you will look into it; I am myself really as innocent as a new born babe, of either word, deed, or action, but kindness to the man, to get him a lodging.</p>
               <p>Harding's Defence. I have had the distance measured from where the Policeman stood watching; it is fifty-eight feet from the hole - he was behind a cart which is across the road-outside the wharf; it is eighteen yards from the cart to the waggon inside the wharf, where he says we stood and made the expressions to each other.</p>

            . I am a coalheaver. I was on Sunday night with Harding's wife, and went with her on board the prosecutor's boat, and saw him - I asked him who was the gentleman that the row was with last night; he said, It "was me;" we asked him if he was much hurt - he said No, he was not much hurt, and if he could get his money again, he would say nothing about it; I said "What is your money?" he said, "Why, I want 9s., but bring me 8s., and I will not go up again" - I said the poor woman had not got 8s. then; he said, "Well, bring me 8s. to-morrow morning, and I will not go up again" - she pawned her bed next morning for 8s.; I took it to him - he then said "No, I will have a sovereign before I go any farther, and then I will give it up;" the prisoner's wife's sister was present when he said he would not take the 8s. - she not is here.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You took him 8s. in the morning - where is he? point him out. A. That is the gentleman; I know the cellar of the unfinished building - I work just by: it is as near as I can say forty yards from the gate.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Turfrey a good character.</p>

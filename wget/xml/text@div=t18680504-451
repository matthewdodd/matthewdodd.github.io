                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and live at Poplar—about 8.30, on 27th April, I was in High Street, and saw the prisoner and some other persons there—when I came up to them one of them gave me a above against Donovan, and he caught me, by the collar—I was thrown on my back and my handkerchief was taken by one of them—I cannot say who—a con<lb></lb>stable came up and I gave him into custody for knocking me down—he said he would break my jaw, or something like that—I was not drunk—I had had a pint or two of beer—I always have three or four pints a day, and am not the least effected by it.</p>

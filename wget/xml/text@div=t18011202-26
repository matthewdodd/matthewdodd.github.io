               <p>Mr. Aldus. When they were before the Magistrate, Ward said the other woman had nothing to do with stealing the watch; and she was to give her a pair of shoes for helping to dispose of it.</p>
               <p>Murphy's defence. This young woman, about half past eight, met me, and asked me where I used to pawn, as she had got a watch, and would give me a pair of shoes if I would pawn it for her, as she was not known; I always used Mr. Aldus's shop, and took it to him.</p>
               <p>Ward's defence. I wish to say that this woman knows nothing of the watch; I will take it all upon myself; I had the gown and apron on me, and I gave the watch to her to pledge; she knew nothing of it,</p>

On the 10th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was coming down Orchard-street, and saw the two prisoners coming along—M'Carthy had a bundle—he crossed the street—I crossed—then he crossed again, and the two prisoners ran off, throwing the bundle down—I caught M'Carthy by the neck, and brought him back—the bundle contained this lead—he said some man give it him, and he did not know the other man—I asked where he worked—he said no where—I took him before the Magistrate—he then said he brought it from Tottenham-court-road, where he worked, and that Conden gave it him—I went next morning to Lincoln's-inn-fields, where I took Conden, who was at work—I asked him where his coat was—he said, "At home"—I said I knew better, for I had it at the station-house—I took him there, and he said it was his coat.</p>

               <p>I keep a fruit stall, in New Castle Street, and go on errands; the prisoner about three weeks ago, I believe, I cannot justly say, brought me some seals to buy; I sent him away, and then he came again another day, and I bought them then for 2 s. they were three dozen, or three dozen and a half; I did count them then, but I have forgot now; some polished and some not; Mr. Wilde came to my room, and asked me if I had any back seals to sell; I told him I had got half a dozen, and shewed them to him; he asked me if I had got any more, and I said no; he told me, these are my property; my shop has been broke open; I told him then I have got some more, and I shewed him all. (The seals produced.)</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner a stranger? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How did you offer them to sale? - I sold three or four for 3 d. apiece; I believe they were some of the rough ones.</p>
               <p>(The violin produced and deposed to, and the seals being made by the prosecutor himself, and as he had never sold above one or two of them polished in his life, and a few unpolished, but never half so many as found.)</p>

               <p>As to the violin; (I am a poor man; I keep a stand at Piccadilly, opposite Devonshire-house:) a man came and offered me this duplicate for sale, and asked me to buy a violin in pawn; I gave him four-pence for the duplicate, and went to the pawnbroker's myself for it, in order to put it up to sell, and the pawnbroker told me it was owned, and sent after the man, and he was not at home, and he gave me liberty to go out of the shop, and I told the pawnbroker, if he would tell me where the man lived, I would go to him myself; he directly took me up to Bow-street, and committed me to prison.</p>

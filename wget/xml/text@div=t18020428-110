Charging that he, being an officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280089"></xptr>and servant of the said Governor and Company, was entrusted with certain effects belonging to the Governor and Company, that is to say: a certain paid note belonging to them (setting it forth as before), and that he, being such officer and servant, and so entrusted, did feloniously secrete, embezzle, and run away with the said paid note.(The indictment was stated by Mr. Giles, and the case opened by Mr. Garrow.)</p>
               <p>EDWARD BENTLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Fielding. Q. You are the chief clerk in the Accomptant-General's office, in the Bank? - A. I was; I know the prisoner; he first came into the Bank employ on the 1st of January, 1799, and was employed in the Bank on the 26th of March, 1801, to post into the ledgers, or to read from the cash-book, Bank-notes paid on the 24th of March, of certain denominations, of 100l, 200l. and up to a 1000l. it appears he read from the cash-book that day, for I know his hand-writing, and he had access to the file on which the notes were placed on that day: On the 24th of March, 1801, No. 6528, for 50l. came in; the 25th being a holiday, the notes paid on the 24th were posted on the 26th, and he put it on the file; the entry is made from the folio of the cash-book, previous to its coming to our department, and a clerk calls over from the cash-book, who, on this day, appears to have been the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Explain slowly and shortly what is done with a Bank-note that comes into the Bank for payment, as to its stages, and its cancelling? - A. It is cancelled by being punched; the cashier's name is taken off by the inspector before it comes to us; it then goes to the entering clerk, who enters it into the cash-book, and then punches it; after the balance of the evening is made, the files are locked up in Mr. Newland's strong room, and delivered out to the Accomptant's office the next day; when the note is so punched, it is our evidence that the note has been paid, and the entry in the cash-book corresponding with it.</p>
               <p>MANOA SIBLEY sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What are you? - A. I am clerk in the Bank: On the 24th of March last, there was a Bank-note of 50l. No. 6528, entered by me in the cash-book, (looks at the cash-book); the whole page is my writing; after I enter the notes, I punch them; this number was punched, and put upon the file.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note - do you recollect it? - A. No otherwise, than by knowing there was such a number, and such a date, (looks at several notes); with respect to these notes, they appear to be entered before they were cancelled, which sometimes is the case in the hurry of business; the name of the cashier has not been torn off this note, yet it is punched.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you explain how it happens that it is punched through the white part, instead of the proper part? - A. We punch a quantity at a time, and if one happens to be reversed, the punch goes through the wrong part; after the notes are punched, they are put on a file, and taken to the Treasury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Best. Q. You are the person who punched this very note? - A. Yes; those punch them who enter them.</p>
               <p>Q. And it was put on the file on which cancelled notes are? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Though you have not struck the puch through the proper place, do you consider it a cancelled note? - A.Certainly.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your only reason for saying you know it was entered, is because of the entry before and after? - A. It is, and no other.</p>

Yes: On the 11th of February, I attended a committee at the Bank; the prisoner was in an adjoining room; I went to him, and questioned him, without making any promise whatever, as to his connection with Hayley, who, he admitted, he had known sometime, but denied having any money transactions with him, except as to a sum of two pounds; I then stated to the committee what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280090"></xptr>the prisoner said, as to his connection with Hayley; I had been in the committee-room but a short time, when the prisoner was admitted, and he suggested to the Gentlemen present, that he wished to explain himself; I then took a minute of what he said, which was this - "That in March or April last, 1801, some notes were taken from the file, with a view to shew they might be re-issued; I did not attempt to pass any till I became acquainted with Hayley; I took them off the file; the whole which have not been passed, are in my possession; 750l. have been passed; the notes (meaning those which had not been passed) are at No. 18, Bride-lane, at the house of Mr. Browne, an attorney; I erased the Ledger, no person was privy to it; I have 400l. in cash, Mr. Hayley has a further sum." I then accompanied the prisoner towards Bride-lane, and in the way he suggested that the notes were not in Bride-lane, but in a house in Salisbury-court; we went to a house in Salisbury-court, where he delivered a packet to me, which contained the whole of the notes, taken off the file, which had not been issued; I then accompanied him to the house of Mr. Browne, in Bride-lane, and he there delivered to me a tin box, containing good Banknotes and post-bills to the amount of 370l. he said there was 400l. but that he had taken out 30l. the day before; in a pocket-book, which he gave me, there was a paper containing several receipts, signed by

               <p>"Gentlemen,</p>
               <p>"From the present mode of conducting your great and momentous concerns, it is in the power of your servants to injure you to a very considerable and serious amount, without your being able to discover the delinquents; this is a fact which can be proved to your entire satisfaction, as the thing has been already done to the amount of some hundreds of pounds, but without the smallest intention to defraud. It has been for some time observed, the very serious consequences which might ensue to you, in case your servants should be inclined to take the advantage in their power; and the great importance it would be of to you to-have this defect remedied, which, although it could not be done, but at the hazard of all that is dear, and at the hazard of being detected, yet has there been one, who, from a desire to convince you of the truth of it, to find out a plan to prevent it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280091"></xptr>doubtless with a view to benefit himself, has conceived he would be intitled to a handsome remuneration, and has been bold enough to hazard the event, which of course he must abide, not doubting, but when you are convinced of the truth, you will think him fairly entitled to the reward he asks for his upright intention, and for the perilous situation he has put himself into in case of discovery; but, Gentlemen, it has never been the intention of the writer to wrong you of a single shilling; neither will he, for in case you shall not accede to his proposal, he will return you the money, and you shall not be able to know from whence it comes; on the contrary, should you agree, he will make it clearly appear to you the amount of the property he has taken. If the person alluded to does make the discovery, and likewise points out a plan, which will, in future, render the same attempt vain, and sure of detection, he previously claims for himself, and all concerned, a free pardon, and promise not to be in the least molested, and also 5000l. and an annuity of 500l. per annum during life, or 10,000l. without an annuity. Your answer, through the medium of the Morning-Post, is desired; and if the requests of this letter are complied with, the party will come forward and give every explanation; should it be the wish of the Governor and Co. to see the party, the following from is humbly submitted.

               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, that is the case for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. I submit to your Lordship there is no evidence in this case to affect the prisoner; this is a prosecution grounded upon the Act of the 15th of

            . which says, "That if any officer, or servant of the said Company being entrusted with any bill, dividend-warrant, bond, deed, or any security, money, or other effects, belonging to the said Company, or having any bill dividend-warrant, bond, deed, or any security, or effects of any other person or persons, lodged or deposited with the said Company, or with him, as an officer or servant of the said Company, shall secrete, embezzle, or run away with any such note, bill, dividend-warrant, bond, deed, security, money, or effects, or any part of them, every officer or servant so offending, and being thereof convicted in due form of law, shall be deemed guilty of felony, and shall suffer death as a felon, without benefit of clergy." - My Lord, I submit in the first place, that the prisoner at the bar was not entrusted with the possession of this note; your Lordship will see what this note is - it is a Bank-note of 50l. that is the Bank-note he is charged with embezzling; and an embezzlement, within the act, must be of something of which the person was in custody - if you will look at the evidence of the first witness, you will find the prisoner never was entrusted with it; on the contrary you will find, that the only notes with which he was entrusted were notes from 100l. up to 1000l. that being the case, I submit, upon the evidence for the prosecution, that this note of 50l. was not such a note as the prisoner was ever entrusted with, and that therefore the allegation in this indictment, to being it within the Act of Parliament, cannot be proved; on the contrary, it must be negatived, for, in order to be within the Act of Parliament, it must be a Bank-note with which he was entrusted, which, in this case, it appears he never was.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I submit also, that this is not any one of the things described by this Act of Parliament; the words of the Act are "any bill, dividend-warrant, bond, deed, or any security, money, or other effects." I submit that this is neither of those things; it is, as the last witness has said, that which was once a Bank-note. I submit to your Lordship, it ceased to be a Bank-note. I submit to your the embezzlement was made; and in order to support the indictment, it is necessary it should have been a Bank-note. I submit, it ceases to be a Banknote the moment it is paid into the Bank. It is admitted, by Mr. Garrow, that it was a paid and cancelled note. I do not know what is meant by a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280092"></xptr>cancelled note, except it is that which was once a note, but by the act of cancelling, ceased to be a note - it cannot come within either of the words mentioned in the act - the meaning is, a note of value, whereas, this was of no value to any person; it had performed its office, and was by them deposited upon the file, from which it was never again to be issued to the world; it was compleat wastepaper.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I am aware that you will find, at the end of the clause, the words "or other effects;" I conceive the meaning of this is, other effects, which we enumerated before; it will be therefore to say, when it has complemed its office, and has returned again, whether it is one of those other effects. I will trouble you with no further observation at present; but as there is no decision on this Act of Parliament, and Mr. Garrow has stated that it is a most important question, not only to the unfortunate man at the bar, but to the public at large, I humbly hope your Lordship will respite the judgment till it has been considered.</p>
               <p>Mr.Garrow. My Lord, I entirely agree with the concluding observation of my learned Friend, that this is a most important Act of Parliament; and I agree there has, fortunately for the public, been no case that has called for a decision on this point; but I should be extremely sorry it should pass, as admitted by me, that there is any thing in the objection, because it might produce serious inconvenience; therefore, I think it my duty to give the answer that occurs to me to the objection, feeling by no means any inclination to press your Lordship to a decision of the case, it there is any doubt which may make it a fit subject for further consideration.</p>

               <p>Court. Looking through the Act, I think it is proper, as there has been no decision, to get the opinion of the twelve Judges. I think it ought to be considered, as there has been no decision upon it, though I have very little doubt on the subject.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I am perfectly satisfied, and have no with to answer the objection; but it does appear to me, that the answer is so obvious, it might be more convenient that I should do it, than that it should be supposed there is more in it than appears upon the face of it. I have no wish to argue the point, but if your Lordship will permit me, it will be more satisfactory to say a word or two.</p>
               <p>My Lord. with regard to the first objection, a fact is proved in the case, which does not warrant my learned Friend in his objection; for he supposes that the prisoner, in the course of his duty, as clerk at the Bank, had no trust with regard to the fifty pound Bank-note; but there he misconceives the evidence; the evidence is, that he had the duty of entering the notes in a book, and that they are all put on a file, and being bound to take the file into his possession, he is necessarily entrusted with the file that contains them. That objection has nothing in it, for I state this difficulty, and it is sitting it should be understood, that every person employed in and about the Bank of England, are, for the purposes of a criminal prosecution, liable to the extent of answering, with their lives, if they embezzle or secrete any thing which, in the discharge of their duty, comes to their hands; that is a distinct proposition, which I will state once more, for the purpose of being corrected in it if I am mistaken; having considered it with more able persons than myself, that every person, as an officer or servant in the Bank of England, who, in the course of his duty, has the means of obtaining any Banknote, bill, deed, or other thing, or which may be entrusted with him, is for the purpose of criminal prosecution, liable to suffer death, if he embezzles or secretes any part thereof.</p>
               <p>My Lord, to bring this to the business of common life, I will suppose it to become a question, whether a gentleman's under servant has stolen a silver tankard, and is liable to punishment. - No, because he is not entrusted with it, but the butler is entrusted with it, according to my learned Friend's argument, and therefore, he cannot be found guilty. Put, I say, if this man is entrusted with a file of cancelled notes, which having performed their duty, are filed, and he takes a 50l. Bank-note off that file, I say he is guilty of a breach of duty, and of embezzling and running away with effects, within the meaning of the Act of Parliament. Your Lordship will take the cause, which I think extremely proper, but it does not appear to me, that there is a great deal in the objection. My learned Friend should be apprized of what are the Counts of this Indictment. The second Count states it to be a paid note, that is to say, that the prisoner, being an officer and servant of the Bank, and so entrusted, with force and arms, did secrete and embezzle the said paid note. Are these words in this Act of Parliament, which can embrace a paid or a cancelled note? I don't insist upon the first Count, that this is a Bank-note, but I certainly, by the bye shall say, as against the prisoner, it is out of his power to say it is not a Bank-note, when he puts it out again. The Legislature meant to do something more than to protect the then-existing Bank notes; all their deeds, and all their bills, demandable, supposing them to be notes which might be embezzled, and all the effects of the Bank of England. Is it not a part of the effects of the Bank of England? Is it of no value? Is it not of importance to the Bank of England? I stated, in my opening, that these notes are not put into the fire when they are brought in, which would be a ready receipt to prevent offences of this fort, because it cannot be done as long as the commerce of this country is so extensive, for there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180204280093"></xptr>may be a thousand instances occur, in which some particular note may be to be resorted to for the interest of the public. It is a part of the effects of the Bank of England, for the purpose of being evidence of it having been paid, and to trace it through the different hands, if it should be necessary to be inquired into. I submit it is a part of the effects of the Bank of England, of the description of a paid note; but as this is to be the subject of further inquiry, I shall not waste any more time. I thought it my duty to say thus much, as it might be an inconvenience to the public, that the objection should be thought to stand unanswered.</p>
               <p>Court. He is charged with secreting and embezzling a certain paid note, which certainly comes within the meaning of the Act of Parliament; the servants of the Bank are so very numerous, it would hardly be able to reach them if it was not so; however, the case shall be reserved.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I beg to leave my defence to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Bentley.) You told us the cancelled notes are put upon a file? - A.They are put on a file promiscuously, without distinguishing fifty-pound notes from those of a larger denomination; they are intermixed as they are paid; a five-pound note may be next to a thousand-pound note, and a fifty-pound to a hundred-pound, and so on; there were fifty-pound notes, and notes of every description on the file.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Best. Q.Several people had access to the file? - A. Yes, twenty different people, whose duty it is. GUILTY, <rs id="t18020428-110-punish585" type="punishmentDescription">

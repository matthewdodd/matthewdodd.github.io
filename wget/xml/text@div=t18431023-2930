                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder, and live in New North-street, Finsbury. In the morning of the 5th of Oct. I saw the prisoners and another in the neighbourhood of King William-street—I afterwards saw them at the corner of Pairs-chain, in St. Paul's church-yard—I then saw them all three, Stand<lb></lb>ing opposite the prosecutor's warehouse-door—they looked at me, then went back, and stood there again—there was a cart standing in front of the door, and I lost sight of them—shortly after, I saw Jacobs and the one not in cus<lb></lb>tody, turning down Paul's-chain—I then went up, and saw Jacobs carrying these goods—they turned down Little Carter-lane, up to a gateway, and there Richardson took off his coat, spread it out, and made a wrapper of it—Jacobs put the goods in it, and folded it up—the other stood looking out—Richard<lb></lb>son then went on to the end of Carter-lane—Jacobs followed him, and when they got to the end, Richardson seemed to be looking up and down, and made a sign to Jacobs to turn to the right—he went, and put the parcel in at a door<lb></lb>way in Old Change—Richardson then went in a different direction—he came back, went and spoke to Jacobs, who went away from the passage, and left Richardson at the doorway—Richardson took off the coat, put it on his back, a person then went up this passage, and Mr. Spear came out of his door—Richardson looked very hard at him—I was in a house below, and sent for a policeman, but could not get one—I went and told Mr. Spear, and begged permission to put the goods in his door-way—Richardson saw me take the goods out of the passage, and went down Distaff-lane—Mr. Spear and I turned another street, and saw Richardson and Jacobs walking together—we followed them to Gracechuruh-street, and gave them into custody—they were quite strangers to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hair-dresser, in Old Change. About eleven o'clock, on the 5th of Oct., I was standing at my private door—I saw Richardson standing right opposite me—I cannot say whether he saw me—Kennerly came up to me, and left some goods at my house—I left them in the shop, and went after the prisoners—I found them in Fenchurch-street—they were given in charge—I, Kennerly, and the officer came back to my own house—I gave these goods to the officer—these are them—I saw Kennerly bring them from behind a folding door in Old Change, about fifteen yards from where Richardson was.</p>

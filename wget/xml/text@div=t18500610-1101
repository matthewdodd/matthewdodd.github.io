                  </hi>. I live at 13, Vine-street, Hatton-garden. The pri<lb></lb>soner has been in my service since last Michaelmas—on 19th April, I came home in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and in the morning she said, "You did not bring your hand<lb></lb>kerchief home"—I said, "That is very strange; I know I did"—she said, "No you did not"—on 26th May, I went to the theatre, and when I came</p>

               <p>home she said, "You have lost another handkerchief"—I said, "I have not"—I sent for a policeman and had her boxes searched—she then said she would bring an action against me for defamation of character—he then looked between the palliasse and mattress, and found the two handkerchiefs pinned up in a pocket—she said, "Oh dear! I did not mean to keep them."</p>

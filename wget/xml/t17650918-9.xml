I was knocked down again, and my cane and watch were taken from me; they beat me very much; the second blow was given me on the back part of my head; I cannot swear to any of the men: my watch is No. 168.

            . I happened to be at a house in St. Giles's, where the prisoner was drinking; he haul'd the watch out of his pocket; he said it was his father's, and he had fetched it out of pawn; he offered to sell it to a man for thirty-five shillings: he delivered it into a man's hand, and that man delivered it to me. I took the prisoner to the Round-house; the next morning when I went to take him before the justice, he said, Mr. Wright. I told you a lie, I found the watch just by where you live, in Charles-street, by the stand of coaches.</p>

As soon as I awaked, I asked who had got my watch? they had picked my pocket: I was told Blinkey Bourn had got it.

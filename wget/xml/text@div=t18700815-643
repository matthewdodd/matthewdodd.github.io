                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, at Bexley Place, Greenwich—I am concerned for Mr. Chattell, the prosecutor in the last case—judgment was obtained against the prisoner on 5th April for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was exe<lb></lb>cuted and lodged with the Sheriff the same day—I saw the prisoner Lewis on that day, after having received a telegram—he asked me to hold over the execution—I told him I could not do so unless he made some proposal for the payment of the amount of the execution and the book debts and accounts, and also that I was to be satisfied what had become of the bill of sale of Mrs. Tenant for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then told me he had paid her 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. off the bill of sale; that he had received 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the house in Welbeck Street, from the lodgers, and had paid back 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., part of the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he had received from Mrs. Tenant—he left me to see my client, as he told me he would arrange with him—I had several interviews with him and his wife after<lb></lb>wards,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187008150014"></xptr>
               <p>and negotiations took place with reference to the liquidation of the debts, and it was finally arranged that the execution should be held over, provided 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week was paid on account of the accounts and book debts and the judgment, until the whole was liquidated, and on 12th April both the prisoner and his wife came to me to sign a letter, and brought with them the receipts for 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also for the last quarter's rent—next day, the 13th April, the prisoner called by himself, and signed this letter at my request—previous to that I asked him for the receipts—he stated that he had forgotten the one for the rent, but he produced a receipt signed "Mary Ann Tenant"—he told me he must take it away again, and I made a copy of it.</p>

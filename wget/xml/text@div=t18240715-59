               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you do all you could to hinder the deceased from fighting - A. I did, and several tried to prevent him - he was obstinate, and would fight; he drank at the public-house.</p>

I saw the prisoner strike him on the left ear - he then fell against a cart-wheel; he got up and held by the wheel to support himself, and could not speak for a second or so - time was called, but he said he would fight no longer.

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Globe-place, Portman-square. On the 28th of June, at eight o'clock in the morning, I was called to see the deceased at his house. I found him labouring under a violent pain in his bowels, which I considered to proceed from inflammation. He was in bed, and in extreme pain. I sent him opening medicine, not having been informed of the fight. I called again in about four hours, and was informed of the fight. I then examined his body; he had several blows on the upper part of his face and body, but none on his bowels. I found that he had a rupture, which he said he had had a long time; but I was satisfied that was not the cause of the pain. I bled him very copiously; he was extremely ill till evening, and was then getting better, till Saturday morning, when I called, he was then dressed, and wished to take a walk, which I strictly prohibited. I was sent for in the evening, and about one o'clock in the morning I found he had just expired. I examined his body, and consider that he died from inflammation and mortification of the bowels; the fight no doubt caused his death. I am perfectly satisfied that none of the blows on the upper part of his body occasioned it, for it was caused by inflammation in his bowels, which terminated in mortification. There was no blow on the stomach; he might have received one, and I not perceive it. I should have treated him the same, if I had known of the fight at first. He said he was not conscious of having received a blow in the bowels, but supposed he had received an injury from falling, while he was fighting.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You could not discover that any blow he had received caused his death - A. No; after death I opened his body, and found his bowels much inflamed, and considerably mortified. I have not the slightest doubt but the inflammation existed from the Tuesday morning - if it had existed before, he would have felt great pain.</p>

            . I am a pianoforte-maker, and worked for the same master as the deceased. I was present at the three last rounds of the fight; I saw him hit the prisoner in the stomach in the second round - the prisoner struck him once and sent him down senseless, with his head against the cart-wheel, but his body came down gently; he received a blow in the left side of the cheek at the last round, and another on the right side, near the hip, and another on the left. He was at work the night before, and in good health.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150022"></xptr>MR. NORTON re-examined. Q. Could a blow on the side of the head produce a mortification in the bowels - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. If he had been drinking over night, might not that have caused the inflammation - A. Certainly; I am certain that the marks I saw were not the cause of his death. Bleeding often relieves the inflammation, and the patient often feels better; but inflammation still goes on, and may terminate in mortification. He was very sick the two first days, which is usually the case in mortification of the bowels. What he brought up had some appearance of blood.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Might not such a blow as the witness has described produce mortification - A. Yes; it had taken place near the hip, on the right side: he said he was not conscious that he had received a blow there.</p>
               <p>A JUROR. Q. Suppose a man ruptured, and under the violent exercise of the fight was to retire and take cold porter, might not that occasion his death - A. No doubt of it: his rupture went up with ease; he was then laying down. The parts near the rupture were in a less state of mortification than the rest.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning from the stables; the deceased stood at the door and challenged me to fight. He struck me, and we went across to fight.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's father. Watkins lodged with me. He came home between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, and was in liquor then; I saw him and my son go to the public-house after the fight; they drank one shilling's worth of cold gin and water together.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know of the fight before it happened - A. No; he challenged me to fight, and said he would fight some of the bl - y family before he left the premises. I had distrained him for rent about three weeks before, and wanted him to leave, as I could get no rent of him.</p>
               <p>MR. THOMAS BUSHELL. I am a surgeon: in consequence of the deceased's family not being satisfied, they called me in. I examined his body, with Mr. Norton, the day after the inquisition: my opinion is, that he died from inflammation and mortification of the bowels.</p>
               <p>Q. If he was drunk over night, and went out to fight, and after that took cold gin and water, would it bring on an inflammation - A. Certainly, it might. He had a rupture, and if the rupture was to come down, a man in the habit of drinking would be particularly liable to inflammation in the bowels; but from Mr. Norton's statement of the rupture, that certainly would not be the cause of inflammation. The exertion of fighting might bring the rupture down, and that would increase the inflammation.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did Mr. Norton call your attention to his side - A. Yes, that part was a shade darker than the rest, but the whole of the bowels were in an extreme state of mortification: a blow there might occasion that, or it might result from the rupture. I should hesitate a long time before I attributed it to blows, but it might be the cause. I consider that there was a great deal of doubt as to the cause of inflammation - whether it was from a blow or the rupture. I have known a very bad rupture go up of its own accord.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I was called in with Mr. Bushell, after the Inquest had examined the body; the intestines were inflamed, and there were symptoms of a rupture; the inflammation might arise from that, with intoxication, and the exertion of fighting.

               <p>- WESTON. I saw the deceased about one o'clock, on the Sunday morning, just before he died. He pressed his hand very much to the lower part of his body. He appeared very much ruptured, and just before death I heard a rattling noise, but cannot tell from what part it proceeded.</p>
               <p>MR. BUSHESL. A guzzling noise is generally admitted as one of the chief symptoms of the return of the rupture; it had returned when I examined his body. I believe the rupture must have had a great deal to do with his death.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. I would not allow him to go out on Saturday, considering that the least exertion might have brought back the pain, and increased the inflammation.</p>

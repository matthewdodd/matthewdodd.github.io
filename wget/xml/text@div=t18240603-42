            . I live in King-street.

I described her to him, but he could not find her; we watched some time, but she did not come out; I saw the watch again at the office; we did not go to any place together.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I met him in Oxford-street, not in Fitzroy-street - Witness. I have seen her in Oxford-street, but not on that night.</p>

            . I am a constable. Between one and two o'clock in the morning of the 9th of May, Schroeder said he had lost his watch, seal, and key; that he had been in company with a female under the piazzas of the market, and she had snatched it and ran into one of the houses - he was not certain whether it was No. 7 or 8. I got under the piazzas and saw a light, and heard people talking in one of the rooms, and while we were talking, the light was put out. Two people came out of the house, and I desired another watchman to go round and meet them. Schroeder had described the person of the woman. I met the prisoner in Grafton-street, and she appeared to answer the description. I told her she was accused of robbing a gentleman, which she denied. I saw the watch at Mary-le-bone watch-house, in the possession of Howard.</p>

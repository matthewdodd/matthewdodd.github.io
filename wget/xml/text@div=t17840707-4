               <p>Court to Pritt. What passed at the time between you and the prisoner Gardner? - Atkins belonging to the office rushed in, and found the mode on the table, with Mrs. Gardner, and Moore, Stokes, and Partridge standing all round the table opening it; she was also treating them with some liquor of some sort, this was about twenty minutes or half an hour after I lost it.</p>
               <p>What was the conduct of the prisoner on your coming into the house? - Very bad.</p>
               <p>What did she say or do? - She insisted on knowing our authority for searching her house, and rather hindered us from sending for any other assistance, by stopping the door; we got more assistance from Bow-street, and I let one of them in at the window to assist us to search, there were four of them.</p>
               <p>Court. What, she would not let you open the door? - She was not willing.</p>
               <p>In what way did she hinder you? - She went to the door herself and insisted nobody should go out.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what she said about the goods? - She could have no other cause but to suppose they were stolen, they could not have come honestly by them.</p>
               <p>Did you know from any thing that passed whether the other three women lodged in the house or not? - I believe they did not lodge there, they went there directly. my young man traced them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do not tell us what your young man did? - Sir, I came here to tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord will tell you, that you are not come here to tell us what any body else said or did, but only what you did yourself? - I saw the goods in her possession.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Prosecutor. You went about twenty minutes or half an hour after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you found this congregation of women and the things laying on the table? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you go in with Atkins or did he rush in first? - Yes; he saw it with the same eyes I did.</p>
               <p>Did he see it with your eyes Mr. Pritt; how many of them were there? - I believe there were four belonging to the office.</p>
               <p>Four men belonging to Bow-street office against four women! and I believe the prisoner and Mrs. Stokes were within a few hours of their delivery? - I believe you are mistaken.</p>
               <p>Was not Mrs. Stokes brought to bed that night? - I do not know, it is not my business to enquire when women are brought to bed.</p>
               <p>There were four men belonging to Bow-street office, and you thought it necessary to let in some more at the window; which of you was it that knocked the prisoner down? - Not a soul, no more than I knock you down just now.</p>
               <p>What account did this woman give of her acquaintance with the people in the room? - She pretended she knew nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070007"></xptr> of them, she said they came there, and she gave them some refreshment, and she knew something of the husband.</p>
               <p>So seeing Mrs. Stokes was very much like herself, very big with child, and very much wearied, she ventured to give her a little refreshment? - She said so.</p>
               <p>Did you break open all the drawers? - All that were locked then.</p>
               <p>Why I believe Mr. Pritt they attempted to break some drawers open, but she opened them herself? - Yes, the officers searched the other women.</p>
               <p>What was the value of this piece of mode? - About 9 l.</p>
               <p>How much money did you find on all the women that were there except Mrs. Gardner? - I cannot be positive, I did not search them, I do not know what the officers found, this woman behaved very bad, she insisted on knowing our authority.</p>
               <p>The mode was laying on the table publickly and openly, was not it? - Yes, as if they were in treaty.</p>
               <p>Why Mr. Pritt is there any thing more particular in mode when people are in treaty for it than at another time? - It was open and the folds taken out.</p>
               <p>That could not have happened, I suppose by their saying we have been purchasing some mode, what do you think of it, is it good? - Mighty unlikely.</p>
               <p>Could it not Sir? - It was impossible it should.</p>
               <p>You say it was quite impossible, very well Sir, after that I will not ask you a question more.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe you know that the prisoner was bailed on account of the advanced state of her pregnancy and that she surrendered these two sessions to take her trial? - Yes.</p>

               <p>What did the prisoner do or say to you? - She insulted me very much, and called and abused me; I shoved the boy out at the door, she said I should let nobody out; after the boy was out, she flew into a bigger passion still, and said I should let nobody in.</p>
               <p>What did you let the boy out for? - To fetch more assistance, for there were so many women I did not know whether we should keep the mode safe or not; when the officers came from Bow-street, she kept me from opening the door, and one of the men threw up the sash and jumped in at the window; the officer got in, and then we took them away and searched the house; then she consented at last to have her house searched.</p>
               <p>Court. She refused at first? - She did, either to open her door and let us out, or to let any more in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You are a good deal in the habit of apprehending thieves? - Yes, but I would rather face so many men than so many women, because I could handle them in a different manner, I searched one woman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178407070008"></xptr> and found half a crown, I do not remember what was found on the other.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect Mrs. Gardner giving any account of these people coming there? - She said they came to refresh themselves, they were drinking brandy.</p>
               <p>Did not Mrs. Stokes say she knew nothing of Gardner? - Yes she did say so.</p>
               <p>Did not she say so when she was tried here for her life? - She did.</p>

               <p>I am an auctioneer in Westminster-market; I have known the prisoner about fourteen of fifteen years, she has a very good character, or else I should not have bailed her; I have attended here two sessions before this she has about seven or eight children, I have the same; I went as one of the bail to Mr. Pritt, and told him I was one of the bail, and I had a very great family, and asked him why do not you bring on this trial; says she I am very glad to hear you are one of the bail, I shall fix you and the rest, and I shall get the thousand pounds.</p>
               <p>Pritt. I never said such a word in my life.</p>
               <p>Freeman. You are the man, I swear to it.</p>
               <p>Pritt. You swear a great falsity.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six other witnesses, who all gave her a very good character.</p>

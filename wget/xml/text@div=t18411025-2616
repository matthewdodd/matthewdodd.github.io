The pri<lb></lb>soner was brought to the Marylebone station on the 13th of October—I said I wanted to see what she had about her—she said she had nothing—I said, "You must pull your cloak off"—she lifted it over her head with the boots and shoes inside it, and laid it down by her side—I asked what those were—she said she had been buying them, and was going to keep a shop—she then said one pair was for her little girl.</p>

I kept a linen-draper's shop, and a shoe-shop adjoining—these shoes and boots are mine—we had very little stock left in that shop, No, 85, having moved the principal part to No. 90—those left were soiled goods—these boots are very little soiled, but the shoes are much soiled—I was in my shop all day myself, and we sold one pair of boots and two pairs of shoes together that day to one person—one pair of shoes are our own make, the others I bought of a manufacturer.</p>

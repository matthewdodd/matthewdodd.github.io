             sworn.</p>
               <p>To the best of my knowledge, the prisoners came to my house about a month ago, and said they would get such things for me, I was in the back room, and I laid down twenty-four shillings; I do not know which of them took it up; we agreed for four half guineas for twenty-four shillings, and they laid them on the table, and I laid down the twenty-four shillings; I did it for information to find out the makers.</p>
               <p>Did you suspect them to be bad? - I did.</p>
               <p>Did you give information to Bow-street? - Yes, before that, I gave the four half guineas to the people in Bow-street, four or five days after I had them; I am not sure of the prisoners, but to the best of my knowledge they are the men.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt about it? - Yes, I have a great deal of doubt, they were not in the same dress, I saw them but twice, and they were in slouched hats, I could only see their chins.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. So, this was a trap contrived by you and the gentlemen of Bow-street? - It was.</p>
               <p>Did you know it was a felony to buy bad<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178410200139"></xptr> money, at a less price than it imported to bear? - I did not buy it for myself.</p>
               <p>Who has paid you the money again? - I have not been paid it again, but they told me I should not lose it.</p>

               <p>What other houses have you kept? - A good many.</p>
               <p>How long have you had your licence for your last house? - After they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Was not your licence stopped by Sir Sampson at the usual time of licencing? - Not this year.</p>
               <p>It was not stopped for any good, I take it for granted? - Not for any harm.</p>
               <p>Was not this trap to lead to your getting a licence? - No, my licence was not grumbled at, why should it.</p>
               <p>Do not argue with me, but answer the question. - Not to my knowledge, I did not know that my licence was to be stopped.</p>
               <p>Was not it an inducement held out to you by the officers? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not they tell you, that your licence was to be stopped, and that this would be a recomendation to you? - May be they thought so.</p>
               <p>Did not they communicate that thought to you, Sir, upon your oath; now mind what you are about? - They did.</p>
               <p>Then why did you hang back so long from that? - Because I should be sure of what I say.</p>

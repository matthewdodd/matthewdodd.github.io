I am certain the prisoners were the persons I saw in the garden; it was star light, and the light was very good; I could very well distinguish the persons and their dress. An alarm being given one of them said somebody was at the door: then immediately I heard a voice at the door say bush, if you don't open the door I'll blow your brains out; then the same voice bid us all go into bed; then a man came in with a dark lanthorn; the two persons that I saw in the garden were the two Youngers; the youngest sat by the side of the bed and the other at the bottom of the bed.</p>

            . I was waked, and desired Miss Mortimer to get up for there were thieves in the house; Miss Mortimer got up and said there was a man at the door and two men coming up the yard; they said bush, open the door, or we will blow your brains out; I opened the door and they came in, and bid us get into bed and cover our faces. As they were coming up stairs I reached out of bed to hide something, and saw Grear's face as he came up stairs; I imagine he lighted his candle by the lanthorn and put it in the chimney; he demanded the plate; Miss Mortimer said there were six silver spoons in the drawer; he came from the drawer and said to his companion, take this silk; I then thought I heard some more voices in the room; the sheet was off my head, and he said if I did not cover up my face he would blow my brains out. When there was light in the room I saw the shade of a man take down some gowns from a rail; one of them asked for a handkerchief; Miss Mortimer said they were in a drawer; Grear got on the bed and trod on my hand, and never left the bed but to go to the door of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it so light that you could distinguish his person?</p>
               <p>Creighton. I saw him come up stairs with the light; I reached out of bed to get a piece of sattin out of the drawer, and Miss Mortimer pulled me back; he called for a chissel to wrench open the drawer, and his companion brought him one; when he had got it open, Grear said you did not tell us there was some money here, we have found it, and there is more in the house, and we must have it or we will cut your heads off, and blow your brains out; he called to the other and bid him charge the other pistol; then one that is not taken said don't kill them; they asked what business we carried on, and one said a milliner's; then they asked where the laces were; Grear said they were Jackson's gang and seared nobody; the boy said blow their brains out, and then they cannot tell tales or give information. Before they went away he said there were four above stairs and four below stairs; that they should be there two hours, and if we got up to alarm any body they would blow our brains out. Grear asked for my pockets; I slid my pocket book out of them and gave him my empty pockets; I knew them again when I saw them at the Justice's. When they were gone, we got out of bed, between three and four o'clock, and locked the door, and threw up the window; Miss Mortimer saw a man walking along with a pitch fork, and said she was sure he was one of the men that had robbed us; that was the eldest of the Youngers.</p>

               <p>Whitefield. Yes; it was the same night they were taken up in the morning.

            . I live in the same house; the two Youngers lay in our house the night before they were taken; I saw them in bed at ten o'clock; one of them got up at four; it struck four just as he got out of doors; the other got up a little before eight when the woman called him up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say to him then?</p>
               <p>Burn. She said Tom what are not you up yet to go to market?</p>

               <p>Burn. Almost twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. What part did you lie in?</p>




               <p>Burn. The middle room; there are two rooms upon one floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did Mrs. Whitefield lie?</p>
               <p>Burn. In the fore room.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be up so late?</p>
               <p>Burn. My husband was in liquor, and I dare not then disturb him till he has had his first sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any search warrant coming to the house?</p>
               <p>Burn. I saw men there, I do not know whether<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177307070006"></xptr> they had any warrant; they never found any thing there; I have been there a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they been several times searching the house?</p>
               <p>Burn. Once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the house at the time?</p>
               <p>Burn. There were several at work at stop work; Mrs. Whitefield, Mrs. Phene, and I, were sitting together, when they came to search the house.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sherwood. One of them was loaded, and I

             the shot out of it myself; the other was not loaded.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. When the ladies came to you upon the information, were there any other prisoners produced besides the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. Several more; the lady immediately pointed to this man; I recommended her to be very cautious and look round; she immediately fixed upon Grear; many had passed in irons by, and she immediately fixed upon Grear, and I think said she had a full view of him in the garden, and at the door of her chamber.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the character of any of these women that appear?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. Yes, by hear say.</p>
               <p>Q. What character have you heard of them?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. That old woman that was upon her evidence when I came in (Whitefield) is one of those that are very remarkable for receiving stolen goods, along with that boy's mother, who is now under sentence of transportation.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the character of any of the rest?</p>
               <p>Sherwood. I do not know any of the rest.</p>

               <p>Q. to Pagett. Do you know the character of the other two women?</p>
               <p>Pagett. I have seen them in the house at divers times; I know no more of them than seeing them in that house. I have found chissels buried under ground there: the house comes almost to the back of the lady's garden.</p>

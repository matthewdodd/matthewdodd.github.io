I missed my purse and ten guineas: I never saw my purse since.</p>
               <p>- DALEY sworn.</p>
               <p>There was a dispute between the prisoner and the coachman; and the coachman called me, and gave charge of this woman for flapping the door of the coach, when she went out: I took them both to the watch-house: I put her into the coach: the prosecutor was in the coach, rather intoxicated in liquor: I took them all to the watch-house. The prisoner took some silver out of her pocket, and looked at it; then she put her hand into her bosom, and took out a purse, and looked at it, and what was in it; then she put back the purse, and took some silver out of her pocket, and paid the coachman; and gave me sixpence to drink her health; I suspected her, and told the constable; and he sent for them in; I brought in the woman, and the gentleman: the constable asked him where he had spent his afternoon; he said where; and that he had ten guineas in his pocket; but he could find only one half guinea; the prisoner was searched, and in her pocket was found nine guineas in gold, four shillings and sixpence, and three halfpence; I said there is a purse in her bosom; she was searched, and it could not be found; we took her backwards, and stripped her of her outside clothes; then we shook her under petticoat, and out of it dropped the purse.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was constable of the night. I produce the purse. What Daley has said is true. The prisoner said, the prosecutor had got his money again: and as she was a married woman, her husband should enter an action against him, for cuckolding him. The prosecutor swore to the purse that night; we shewed him two others, he described his own.</p>
               <p>(The purse deposed to.)</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On Sunday evening, the 8th of November, I was going to suppet, in Holborn; and just as I came out of my own house I met this gentleman, near Wood-street; he asked me how I did; he asked me where I was going? I said, to Holborn; he said, it is a very cold evening; he said, you shall have something to warm you; we had four sixpennyworths of brandy and water; he said, he would see me safe where I was going; we got into a coach; he ordered it to drive into Holborn; he said we should have something more to drink; and we went into a house; and he called for eighteen-pennyworth of brandy and water, and then for another eighteen-pennyworth of brandy and water; then he called this hackney coach, and ordered the coachman to drive to Whitechapel; and from thence to the Bagnio, in Goodman's-fields; I did not chuse to go in there; then we came back to Holborn, in the coach; we fell into discourse; I told him I had lived in a publick-house, and failed in business; and he seemed to take a great liking to me; and he said, that twenty or thirty guineas was no object to him; and I went with him in the second coach; and he made me a present of a couple of guineas: in the second coach he would have given me his watch for security; and he offered me twenty or thirty guineas; he said, he wanted just such a woman as me for a long time: the gentleman knows in his own heart and conscience that I did not rob him, nor take any thing from him; I neither meant to leave him: the gentleman knows what passed in the coach.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Had you any watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That was safe? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen this woman in your life? - Never, nor I should not know her now, if it had not been for the other witness.</p>
               <p>Bristow. When I was searching her, she said she was a married woman; and then afterwards she said that this was her master, and she had had three children by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179001130052"></xptr>him: she came out in her shift, in the watch-house: she said, she was a married woman; and her husband should bring an action against the prosecutor, for cuckolding him.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner called two witnesses to her character.)</p>
               <p>Court. What is her way of life? - Her husband is a master chimney sweeper; he carried on a great trade: she and her husband are separated.</p>

Holloway brought the prisoner into my room—it was mentioned that she had represented herself as Ann Lee, who was dead—I asked her how it was she came to receive the depositor's money who was dead, without mentioning the fact that she was dead—she said she had not mentioned it, she did not think it was necessary; she was a poor, ignorant woman, and had no one to consult with; she was not aware she was doing wrong—I asked why she had not consulted with somebody at the Bank as to the death—I said we should have been very happy to have given her direc<lb></lb>tions, and asked her who had given the notice the week previous—she said she had done so herself—I asked her why she did not then mention the death—she made no answer—v asked if she was married, and whether her husband had not advised with her—she said no, she had not spoken to him, because he was addicted to drunkenness—v said she had got herself into a serious scrape by having signed the name; that I should detain the book, and she must attend before the managers on the following Tuesday—she mentioned that the depositor had given her up this book during her lifetime, to re<lb></lb>munerate her for the trouble she had had with her—she left, and came again on the Tuesday, the 9th, accompanied by a woman and child, and she attended before the managers—she said the depositor was a very old lady indeed, and had died in her house very suddenly, and that she had some time previous upset some vessel of boiling water over her child—she mentioned that as a reason why the deceased had left her the money—she said she had been at no ex<lb></lb>pense for her funeral, she had been buried at the expense of the parish of Marylebone—the managers considered it a case to be investigated, and she was given into custody.</p>

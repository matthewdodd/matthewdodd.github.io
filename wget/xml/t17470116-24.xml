            . On Saturday before Christmas-day, Mr Heyman , my Neighbour, sent for me to a publick House, and said he believed he was robbed by some of his Servants, and we marked Money, we marked three Six-pences, and a Brass Six-pence, which I marked myself with a Pen-knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look into the Till, and see what was missing?</p>
               <p>Cross. I sat up that Time along with my Neighbour, I saw him heave the Till up, and take something out, which I believe was Money.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the Prisoner open the Till?</p>
               <p>Cross. He listed it up with his Hand, I would have seized him, but Mr Heyman believed he would spoil his Batch of Bread, which was just about to be put in; we ordered the Constable to search him, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174701160017"></xptr> he found 3 l. in Silver, and three Guineas, with that he owned the whole, and said he was guilty.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say, did he own he had done it?</p>
               <p>Cross. He said his Master might take all the Money, and he would go into the Country. When I first charged him with robbing his Master, he said he did not rob him, till I told him of the marked Money.</p>
               <p>There were Mr Gardner, Hornby , Hart, and Baxter appeared on the Behalf of the Prisoner , and said they had known him for a Term of Years, and he bore 2 very good Character.</p>

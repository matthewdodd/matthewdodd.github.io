He said he should want some silk handkerchiefs. On the 19th of September he bought some flannel, and said he had no money but would send it in the afternoon, instead of which he sent a note, desiring I would send the flannel with some silk handkerchiefs the next morning, by my boy, which I did, and told the boy not to deliver them without the money.</p>

Hopkins gave me the parcel to take to Manchester-street, to show the gentleman. I met the prisoner at Charing-cross, he asked if I came from Mr. Jackson's, I said Yes. We walked as far as Lancaster-court, Strand. He then said I must give him the handkerchiefs to show to his aunt, who he said lived up the court. He took them, and told me to go to 24, Exeter-street, and inquire for his mother and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181810280022"></xptr>wait there till he returned. I went and inquired for Mrs. Williams, as I had known the prisoner by that name. I could find no such person. He never brought either the goods or money. He was taken some time after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was dark. I am certain he is the man. I was told not to give him any thing in the street. I should not have delivered them to him without the money.</p>

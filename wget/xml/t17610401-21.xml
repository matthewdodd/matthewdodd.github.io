He desired leave of my wife to be in the shop, to eat his victuals; saying, he was not used to beer-houses. I lost four perukes, but I had missed but three at first, and two locks of grizel hair mixed up, and three locks of brown natural curl. I went to the person that had recommended him to me, and he gave me information where the prisoner lodged. Then I went to justice Fielding, and got a warrant, and took him up, about nine at night, and in about three quarters of an hour he confessed he had three perukes, and the hair; they were all cut perukes. I then had only charged him with taking, Gibson's, Nicholson's, and Harwood's; I had not then missed Harding's. He said, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176104010017"></xptr> had sold them in Middle-row, Holbourn. That night he was put in St. Martin's Round-house, and I told the constable, I would meet him at Mr. Fielding's, about 11 o'clock. I went there, they were not come; then I went to the Round-house, there I found an agent for an independent company, that was going to Germany. He asked me if I would consent to his going to serve his majesty; I said yes, the prisoner has taken money in order thereto. Then the constable and I went to Middle-row, and we found two perukes at one house, one of them was Harding's, which I had mis sed, we had the prisoner with us. Then we went to the other place, where he said he had sold the other two, and the hair; the man said, he had bought them of him on the Monday, but had sold them on the Tuesday; this was the Wednesday morning. When we came to justice Fielding, he granted me a search warrant; I went and searched, but I found nothing.</p>

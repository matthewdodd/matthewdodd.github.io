On Saturday night, 5th, October, about twelve o'clock, I was in Blackwall, at a waste piece of ground about twelve yards from my residence, between the City Canal and the West India Dock—I had a loin of lamb under my arm—I turned aside to relieve myself, and four or five men came up to me—the prisoner is one of them—"he said, "We saw you; what were you doing with that woman? "—I made no insurer, but attempted to pass on—the prisoner said, "No, we are not going to let you go like that; what are you going to give us? "—he then took bold of my parcel—I seized him—he struck me in the face with his fat, knocked me down, and took the meat from me, but I afterwards picked it op—I went after him and seized him, but he got away—I ran after him and seized him again—his companion knocked me down and kicked me—I followed them to the Eastern Gate, where one of our watchmen is stationed—I then seized the prisoner, and called for assistance—Montague, a watchman, who is not here, came and assisted me to drag the prisoner in it the gate—he locked the gate, and the prisoner was given in custody—there was no woman near me, and I was within ten years of my own resi<lb></lb>lience—I was kicked all over my body, which was very much contused, and then (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my hat, which is spoiled—I was disabled, and could not go to business next day—I could not get up—I understand that a drover Bitted Windsor came to my assistance, but I did not see him.</p>

"—I went to the spot and saw the prisoner and Douglas struggling—I called to the watchman to open the gate, went inside, and said, "I will take the man; what has he done? "—he said, in the prisoner's presence, "Assaulted me and stolen a piece of meat"—the prisoner made no reply, but referred me to a wound in his neck and wanted to" make me believe it was bleeding—Douglas's face was smothered with blood from a wound on his nose, and the prisoner's trousers had blood on them—I saw Windsor, who said, "That is the man who assaulted the gentleman, and I struck him with my fist, and he struck me with his fist with all his might"—I took the prisoner through the dock and out at the other end, and with assistance took him to the station—I saw several other men outside the gates.</p>

Chetwind's House, to case his Foot by loosening his Shoe; sitting there about 3 Minutes, while he he was stooping, he felt a Hand about his Pocket, and miss'd his Watch; upon which he immediately started up, and seeing the Prisoner close to him, he collar'd him, charg'd him with taking of it, and call'd out to the Centinel for Assistance; upon which the Prisoner call'd out to

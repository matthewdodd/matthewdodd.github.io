               <p>Q. Had you your pocket picked lately. - A. I had, on the 10th of February, between dark and ten in the morning; I cannot say exactly the hour, I was in liquor. I laid my head down on the table at <placeName id="t18070218-58-crimeloc304">the Eight Bells in Ironmonger row</placeName>

               <p>- I am a soldier. I was sitting at the same table with Younger and the prisoner; Stanhope lent Younger his coat for him to go and get his pension. I saw Stanhope take a box out of his own coat pocket, and put it into the coat pocket that he wore at the time, and when he went up stairs he missed the box out of his pocket.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Wednesday the 11th of February, the prisoner was brought to the office by Harper, who is at this time unwell; he had been searched by Harper; Harper delivered to me a pound note in the presence of the prisoner. I searched the prisoner after that in the office, and on him I found two seven shilling pieces; he told me he got them from the Three Tuns in Ironmonger row, in change of a one pound note. I told the prisoner there was no such sign there whatever; before Mr. Moser he said he was drunk, and he was sorry for what he had done.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In the course of the evening I asked him for some tobacco; he gave me some. I took the box and took some; he laid his head on the table; I did not return the box to him, but I laid it down upon the end of the table, and when I wanted some tobacco, as he was laid down asleep, I took the tobacco box and took some. I put it in my pocket; the room was full of people.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

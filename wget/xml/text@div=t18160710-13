On the 1st of June last, I was sitting facing a large looking-glass in the parlour at my dinner, and in that looking-glass I could see a great part of the shop. I happened to look into the glass, and saw a woman in the shop. I went to see what she wanted, and it proved to be the prisoner at the bar; she was about a foot and a half into the shop; she had her face towards me, not as if advancing farther; she stopped, and I asked her what she wanted; she asked the way to Westminster; no other person was in the shop at that time; I told her the way. She left me; I then turned round to go into the parlour again, and perceived a piece of flannel was missing off some wooden steps, which stood about three feet and a half within the shop, quite within. I had seen that flannel when I went into my dinner. On missing it, I went after the prisoner; I overtook her about four doors from our house; I took hold of her arm, and I thought I saw something under her clothes; she had no cloak, and I found this piece of flannel there. I got hold of her, and in leading her back, she said, don't push me, and I told her to deliver up the flannel, and she did so; she gave it me just before we got to our house. I have the flannel here; there are six yards; it cost above eighteen pence a yard; it would sell for a greater price.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the flannel, and there was another woman coming out at the door when I picked it up.</p>

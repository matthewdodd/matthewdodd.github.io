               <p>RICHARD PONMAN (Police-constable H 181.) I was in Bethnal-green-road about eight o'clock that evening, and saw the prisoner take this table from the prosecutor's shop; I went towards him - he threw it at me, and ran away; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He stated before the Magistrate that I went to it six or seven times. Witness. No, I said you carried it twenty or thirty yards; he did not give me time to take him before he threw it down; a shopkeeper picked it up, and I pursued the prisoner - he was taken in George-gardens, nearly a quarter of a mile off.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you lose sight of him? A. Yes, at the last turning he took, but I saw him running again.</p>
               <p>JAMES HALES. I am a cheesemonger, and live in Bethnal-green-road. I heard a noise, ran out, and saw this table in the middle of the road; I took it into our shop - I saw the officer running after a man; I cannot say who.</p>
               <p>HENRY DELLER (Police-constable K 200). On the evening of the 27th of March I was in Bethnal-green-road, and heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running, pursued him, and took him in George-gardens; I was within ten yards of him during the whole pursuit - I cannot tell whether he fell, as the place was dark in George-gardens - I had lost sight of him in turning the corner; he was out of breath - he said he would come with me, and that he had been nicely knocked about; I suppose he meant that he had fallen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You told the Magistrate you did not know whether I stopped, or any person stopped me. Witness. You were up when I came to you; I cannot say who stopped you - I think you had been stopped by some one.</p>

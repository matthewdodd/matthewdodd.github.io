                  </hi>. I am a wholesale tea dealer, in partnership with Mr. Hopcraft, of 40, King William Street—we carry on business as the Metropolitan Tea Company—the prisoner was a carman in our employ—he was in the employ before I became a partner, which is about twelve months since—his duty was to deliver goods, take orders, and take money on delivering the goods—the goods he had to deliver were always entered in a small delivery-book, and he had a list given him of the moneys he had to collect—it was his duty to account for the moneys he collected on his return, either the same evening, or if it was late, the next morning—he invariably accounted to me—I produced the book in which I took down the accounts—on 1st May there does appear to be a sum entered of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from H. Turner—there is no entry on 21st May of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from F. Chapman—I have never received that, nor 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 22nd May from McLaren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I asked him to explain his deficiencies on 15th June—I think he said he had a quantity of goods in the stable which would make up for them—I did not receive a guarantee from him to make up the loss—his father handed us a guarantee, which we took on the supposition that the goods in the stable would cover the whole of his defalcations, but they did not—instead of being 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. short it was nearer 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they were our goods—I did not know the guarantee that it was to cover any deficiency—I did not intend to compound a felony—a signed security was brought up to me by the father, which we did not accept—we did not mean to accept any guarantee—I did not make inquiries to see whether the guarantee was worth the money, nor did anyone authorized by me—it was a guarantee of his aunt—I did not know until the other day that any inquiries were made about it—I know it now—it was not done by my sanction—I don't know by whom it was done.</p>

                  </hi>, I am in partnership with the last witness—on 15th June I spoke to the prisoner about a deficiency in his accounts, and asked him the reason—he said he had a large quantity of goods, which would be found in the stable—I said "Then we will send for them," to give him a chance—we sent over to the stable, and found about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of tea, and sugar, all covered over with straw—there were two cart loads—I said it was a very serious charge, and there were a lot of accounts outstanding, that ought not to be—he said "You will find the goods completely cover the outstanding accounts"—he was not authorized to take the goods to the stable—I said to him "We will send for your father, and as we have found our goods in the stable, it may be a much lighter matter than we suppose"—we sent for the father—the prisoner said "I lost 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of my pocket some months ago, and I have tried to make up the deficiency by getting orders"—I said "You had better go away with your father;" but before that the father gave a guarantee that if there was any little defi<lb></lb>ciency the amount should be made up by him—I made Inquiries next day, and on 20th June I told the prisoner I had found he had been taking money from every customer, and not handing it over to the firm, and I should give him in charge—my partner sent for a constable, and gave him in charge—at the time I accepted the guarantee from the father, I had not discovered that the sums of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Henry Turner, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Chapman, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from McLaren, had not been paid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was on 15th June I accepted the guarantee; the day I first discovered the goods—I had not then any suspicion that there were other deficiencies—I afterwards found they exceeded 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">The guarantee being put in, was a guarantee to pay any deficiency arising in the account.</hi>)</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Alger's lodgers; I was in the cellar between eight and nine o'clock, sitting on a tub as it was warm weather; I went there to cool myself; I could see into Mr. Alger's cellar; I saw the prisoner come down a trap hole, drop on a bench, and take at lest six pairs of soles; he then cut a piece of leather off a large piece - he then threw them up the hole, and got up himself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the cellar under ground? A. Yes - it was dusk; I mentioned this about three weeks afterwards, when he was leaving, as he was suspected; I quarrelled with him once; I never said he only took two pairs - I said he put two pairs down his trousers at another time.</p>

               <p>Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Why did you not mention it before? A. I did not like - I had only been there three weeks.</p>

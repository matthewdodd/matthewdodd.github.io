Lewin deposed, that as he was coming with his Master from the Round-house with another Prisoner, he was told by a Boy that Sheppard was at a neighbouring Brandy Shop in Drury-Lane, against the End of Parker-Lane: He went directly thither, and rushing in between two Watchman, seized upon Sheppard, just as he was saying, I must go Landlady, for I can stay no longer. The Prisoner being there, immediately took hold of this Evidence's Arm, and said, Hold, hold, where are you going to carry him? The Linnen, as before deposed, was found at her Lodging, and she said at first that she had it from Kate Cook; but afterwards that Sheppard brought it to her to make him some Shirts; but that she did not know it was stolen.

                  </hi>. I keep a baker's shop at 36, Bridge-street, Greenwich—Collins was in my service from 12th January till 14th February—I do not know anything of the other prisoner—I once saw him on 23d February, when he came to fetch Collins's clothes—on Sunday afternoon, 28th February, I left my house between 3 and 4 o'clock—it was then properly secured and fastened in all respects—I returned at half-past 9—I unlocked the front door and went in to the parlour—I first noticed that a candlestick was not in the same place as it was when I went out—I got a light and went into my bed-room—I found the articles strewed about the room, and missed two watches, two seals, two keys, and a ring, from the bed room—I went down stairs again, and found that the parlour door had been forced open, the lock of the till in the shop was broken, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in copper taken—I called in the police immediately—we examined the premises, and found that an entry had been made through the iron grating of the area, which leads from the street to the bakehouse—the locks were forced, and one iron was forced back and laid over on the top of the other, so that no suspicion should be raised from anyone passing by—there was room for a man to go down—the bakehouse window was not fastened—going in that way anyone could obtain access to all the rest of the house—the area grating was closed and fastened with a lock when I left home in the afternoon—I looked into the cupboard in the kitchen, and found between three and four pounds of beef gone, and the same quantity of pudding—the broken part of this watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I believe to be part of one of the watches that I lost—these two seals are also my property—I have had them in my possession these forty years—this watch key is also my property—I am quite certain of that—I saw the other watch that I missed at 120, Old Kent-road, a pawn<lb></lb>brokers shop—I identified that as my property.</p>

I am the wife of Richard Hodge of 137, Bridge-street, Greenwich, and live next door to the prosecutor—on Sunday, 28th February, at half-past 7, I was standing at my door, and saw Collins come from the prosecutor's area gate with his boots in his hands—I saw him put his boots on and lace them up—he shut the gate after him, shook his trousers down over his boots, and said, "Now I am all right," and went away towards Deptford—I had seen him twice before—he had not got anything with him—this was from a quarter to twenty minutes past 7.</p>

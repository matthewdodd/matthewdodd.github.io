                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). I am thirteen years old—I was in the service of Mr. Henderson, of the Temple, about nine months—I recollect taking some property of his—a boy named Drew persuaded me to do it—I took some chessmen to Mr. Read's, the prisoner—I did not know him before—we asked him if he bought them—he said, "Yes"—he asked me where I lived—I told him in Stamford Street, but I lived in Providence Place—he did not ask me how I came by them—I forget what he gave me—he offered me a price and I took it—that was the first thing I took to his shop—I went with Drew—I went again about a fortnight before I was taken into custody—Drew asked him if he bought silver at the time I took the chessmen—he said, "Yes"—Drew is a little taller than me—he was fifteen years old—he said that he would bring some silver, and we took a dozen forks—we did not take all the silver forks at that time—we also took a large soup ladle and some spoons—we did not take all the plate at that time—he gave us 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the forks and the ladle and the spoon altogether—there were three large and three salt spoons—we said we would bring some more things—he said, "Very well"—I went again in about two days and took two telescope</p>

               <p>candlesticks, two large branch ones, and some silk handkerchiefs—he gave me about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them—I mentioned the price—he asked me how I came by them—I told him we were selling them for mother—he only asked me that once or twice—I went about four times a week to the shop—I sold him things on every occasion—there were no books—I received about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether from Reed—I got all the things from the prosecutor's.</p>

               <p>speak to him, but that he would go and see her if she made an appointment to meet him—he only said that on the last occasion—I never said that my mamma was so busy packing her boxes that she had not been able to come to see him—he did not ask for an appointment—I did not tell him on one occasion that my mamma would have called on him but that the housemaid and the other servants had insisted on going out suddenly for a holiday—Drew did not say so in my presence—we told him that we were cousins—I told him that Drew had been adopted by my mamma and papa, because his father and mother were dead—I do not think I told him where they had died—it is a fact that Drew's father is alive at this moment—I told Read when I brought the two candlesticks that my mamma had no use for them, and that she was no judge of them, and would he be good enough to see what the value was—I thought the forks were silver—he said I had better take them back to let mamma know they were not—I took the candlesticks back with a leather bag with "A.H." on it—he told me to go back and tell my mamma that he could not give more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or two guineas for the candlesticks, as she might think they were worth more—he said the branch candlesticks were not worth more than a guinea—there were two sets—I do not know how much he gave us for the other set—Mrs. Read gave us sixpence apiece—I asked him if he bought cards—he said, "Yes"—I went on the second occasion with a riding whip in my hand, and dressed as if I was going out riding, and told them we were going to a riding school to take lessons—that was not true—at another time we told him we were in a very great hurry, as we were going to see Christy's Minstrels with my mamma and papa—they said that they must take the plate to Mr. Hanley's, to get it weighed, and see what it really was worth—Mrs. Read said, "Perhaps you cannot wait?"—we said that we could, and we waited—I do not think I said that I wanted to take 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to my mamma—I never got more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got a cheque from Mr. Read for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also a cheque for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not go back and say that I enjoyed Christy's Minstrels very much—I did not go for a day or two after that—I told him the last time I went that my mamma would see him between ten and eleven next morning, as he had said that he really must see her—I did not go there after that—he did not say that he would pay me no more money until he had seen her—Drew was not with me the last time—I was alone—I received between 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—no money was owing to me for plate, nor did he say that he would not pay it till he had seen my mamma.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer—on the 10th July I went with Mr. Henderson to the prisoner's shop in Great Turnstile, and saw in the window a box containing a silver bouquet holder, a gold pencil case, gold cross, silver brooch, and other things—I could see those from the outside—these articles on the second page of this list were found in the back parlour—I told Read I was a police officer—I pointed to the things lying in the window, and asked him who he got that property from—he said, "Why do you ask that question?" I said, "This property is stolen from Mr. Henderson's chambers, in the Temple." He said that he bought them from a female, and he thought her name was Henderson, and she lived over the water—I asked him if he had any more property—he said, "No,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186608130054"></xptr>
               <p>nothing more than what you see"—I showed him Wilton's photograph, and asked him if he knew that boy—he said, "Yes; that boy and another boy brought the things to my shop." I said, "You bought them of a boy, not of a female, then?" He said, "Yes"—I went into the back parlour, and saw these two candelabra on some drawers, these two candlesticks, and in one of the drawers was found this plated bread basket, eleven plated forks, a silver strainer, a silver vinaigrette, punch and sauce ladles, and other articles—I asked him where he got them—he said that he bought them of the same two boys—I asked how much he gave for them—he said that he did not know exactly, his wife could give me more particulars than he could; that he did not like to buy of boys, but his wife would do so—I told him there was a large quantity of silver plate stolen at the same time, and asked him if he had bought any of these boys—he said, "No"—I took him to the station, and next morning told him I had ascertained that he had sold some plate at a silversmith's in Holborn—he said, "Yes"—I asked him who he got it from—he said, "From the two boys."</p>

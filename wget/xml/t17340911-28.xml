            . The Horse was put into my Grounds the last of July at Night; I mist him on the first of August, and heard of him again the same Morning. Mr. Hare of Barnet told me that a Man was stopt there for stealing a Horse. I went thither and found the Prisoner with Mr. Shipwith's Horse. The Prisoner said he found the Horse in the Road, and was going with him to London-bridge. I told him, from Whetstone to Barnet was the wrong way to London-bridge.</p>

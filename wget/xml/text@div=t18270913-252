I was going along with a large geranium - I put the watch into my pocket about twelve or one o'clock, when I cleaned myself and came out - I know Jeffrey East, to my sorrow; he is my landlord; I did not speak to him that day - I have not seen him since; he never said I never had a watch. I saw Jackson next day; he called me into his house to try to draw me; I mentioned my loss to him. I did not tell him Sheen had seen me with the watch. I never told Evans I had taken it out of pawn that day from Philpots - I have worked for Mr. Payne, of the Bank.</p>

            . I am a sawyer. and live in Wright's-buildings; the prosecutor is a tenant of mine - he has been badly off for the last five years. I never saw him with a watch in my life; he told me he had been robbed of one; I said it was odd, for I never knew him have one; he said,"Oh! Yes, I took it out of pawn yesterday morning from Philpot's, at Bermondsey." I know he often borrowed money to get victuals - I would not believe him on his oath.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Why? A. I believe him a very bad character - he has no lease of my house; I want to get rid of him- I never knew him swear false; he is given to drink; I think he was fresh when he spoke to me; he had come home in the night in question quite tipsy; I would not believe him if he was sober, for I believe he never had a watch.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL MARTIN re-examined. I was once taken to Union-hall for an assault, and was acquitted; this man's wife once took me there, but they were glad to make it up. I was never there at any other time; she charged me with indecently exposing myself.</p>

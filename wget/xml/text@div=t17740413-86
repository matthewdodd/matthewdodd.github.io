I did not perceive her take any thing away, nor feel any motion there as if they had been taken away; I shoved her away with my left hand, and she went about her business.

            . I am a constable of Bishopsgate Ward. On the 29th of March I was going round to see if the watch were properly set and minding their business; while I was enquiring into it, Bayes came running up the street; I thought he had been robbed; he said he had; he laid hold of Field, and charged me to take care of her; then he run after Gahagan; he soon brought her back, and then told us he had lost two pocket books, which contained two bank notes; several people then began to croud round them; the watchman and I kept the people off, and kept the women separate by themselves; one of the women (I am not sure which) dropped the red pocket book; it was picked up nearest Field; I did not see her drop it; the prosecutor saying there was another pocket book, which contained the bank notes, I made them stand upright, and set their backs to the houses; then the other pocket book dropped under Field which contained the bank notes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief mate of the <hi rend="italic">Sparkling Wave</hi>—on 3rd January she was lying in the Victoria Docks, right opposite the Custom-house, between warehouses B and C—I had a silver watch, a gold chain, and a gold ring, which 1 kept in my state-room—I last saw them safe about.2 o'clock on 3rd January—I missed them at half-past 5 on that day—I did not give information to the police that evening; I did the next morn<lb></lb>ing at 8 o'clock, after breakfast, and put 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. reward on it—the prisoner was second mate on board, his berth was next door to mine—I did not look into his berth on the 9th—it was on 21st, when I gave him into custody—I was examined before the Magistrate on this charge, and gave my evidence—it was about ten minutes before that, that I went into the prisoner's berth and looked in his bed, when I went and got a policeman—I searched in his bed on 21st January—I lifted the pillow and found my watch and chain connected together, in the pocket of his waistcoat—I left it there, and went for the police—a policeman came—the prisoner was on board when he arrived—I told the prisoner I had suspicion, and wished to overhand his bunk—the policeman asked him if that was his bed—he said, "Yes;" and he went to his bed and overhauled it, and found my chain and watch, with the ring, in his waistcoat pocket—I said, "Did you know them belonged to me"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "How did they come into your bed"—he said he did not know, he did not put them there—I said, "If you do not know who put them there I shall give you in charge," and I did—I had seen the prisoner wearing the waistcoat in which they were found, many times—no sailors are allowed to go into my cabin without they have business there, unless they are ordered on duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PATER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is the waistcoat here. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot swear to it—I do not know whether the waistcoat has been brought here by any witness—I will swear that I have seen the prisoner wear that waistcoat most every night when he goes ashore—he has been in the ship with me since 5th November—we came from New York—I do not know whether he wore that waistcoat on the voyage—he wore it on shore—the vessel arrived in London about five weeks ago—we left New York on 11th or 12th November I believe; we were about thirty-eight days on the voyage—we went to Queenstown, Ireland—it was not there that I saw the prisoner wear the waistcoat, it was after we arrived in London—I do not know exactly when we left Queenstown—I spent Christmas-day in London, at the Victoria-docks—I did not see the prisoner wear it on Christmas-day to my knowledge—I have seen him wear it a dozen times since we have been here—we have been lying here about six weeks—he has worn it on shore in the evening—Captain Emery is the captain of our ship—the prisoner and he have not had several quarrels that I am aware of—there has been no quarrel on board ship coming from New York—the prisoner has not quarrelled with the captain—there was a little difference between them—I do not know that they have been on most unfriendly terms—they have had words, and so have I—the prisoner went about <hi rend="italic">licking</hi> the sailors and the captain would not have it; that was all—the sailors did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270069"></xptr>
               <p>not complain—the captain saw it and stopped it—that was all the trouble there was—the prisoner's berth was open—we call it a state-room—it is open to everybody—I offered the reward for the recovery of my watch and chain the next morning, the 4th January, and gave the prisoner in charge on 21st—I searched his berth on that day on account of suspicion—I went in alone, because I thought it would be better—the captain has never said in my hearing that it would be the best thing that could happen if this man was got out of the ship—the crew said they wished he was out of the ship—they were angry with him—I have heard that said on more than one occasion—no sailors use this state-room; only the second and third mates together—I do not know if this man was discharged whether the third mate would succeed to his office as second mate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you influenced by anything that the crew have said in making this charge against the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; the prisoner dis<lb></lb>charged his duty as usual between 3d and 21st January—he wore the waistcoat when he went on shore—no one slept in the bed, under the pillow of which was found the watch and chain, except the prisoner—there was another berth belonging to the third mate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did the prisoner sleep in his own berth every night after the ship got to London? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he was mostly away at nights—he only slept on board two or three nights.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Between the time of missing your watch and chain on 3d January had you seen and conversed with the prisoner at all about your loss? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I told him I had lost it—he was the first one that spread out that I had lost it—I do not know whether he slept on board or away the night I lost it; I forget that—this, is my watch and chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the watch was going the right time when I lost it</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police in the employ of the Victoria Dock Company—that dock is a port of entry and discharge in the port of London—on 21st January, in consequence of some information I received from the last witness, I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Sparkling Wave,</hi> lying in the Victoria Docks—I there saw the prisoner standing at the door of his cabin—I asked him if that was his cabin—he said, "Yes"—I told him I wished to search his cabin, as he was suspected of having stolen the chief mate's watch—he said, "Very well"—I did search, and in searching his bed found under his pillow a waistcoat, in one of the pockets of which I found the watch, chain, and ring, that I now produce—I then asked the prisoner if that was his waistcoat—he said, "Yes, it is"—I asked him if it was his bed and his berth, and he said it was—the watch was ticking at the time I took it from the waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a watchmaker, living at Victoria Dock-road, West Ham—I know the prisoner—on 15th January he brought this guard and ring to my shop to have them repaired—the guard was broken—he wanted the ring made less, to fit his finger; a piece taken out of it; he said he wanted it to fit his little finger—I mended the guard, but the ring I did not do anything to—I saw him again on 17th two days after—he came back and paid the money, and took away the ring and guard—I had lent him ten shillings the first day he brought them, on 15th—I had no security—he brought these things and asked me to repair them—he said he was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201270070"></xptr>
               <p>short of money, and that he would come the next day, as he would draw of the captain, and take the things away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was there any repairing required to be done to the chain? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I repaired the chain; it was broken—I recognise my own work here—it is a very common pattern—this chain has been broken and tied again since I had it.</p>

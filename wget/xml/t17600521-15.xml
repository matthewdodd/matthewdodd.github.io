               <p>Kelley. I believe it was a quarter of an hour before 2 o'clock on the 19th of this instant. As I was setting in my watch-box, I heard an uncommon noise of thrusting through a passage, it was my business to examine what it was; I went out, he saw me with my lanthorn, he makes a double, and went down the street with the bundle on his back, opposite to my lord Hyde's door, duke-street; I had the advantage with my lanthorn, and 2 lights that were there, which gave me a full sight of him; I saw him plain, and described him plain to the men after the prisoner got away; for he throw'd down the bundle, and run away, and I went and took him in his master's yard, and deliver'd up the bundle in Mr. Stubbs's yard; we carried him into the taphouse.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you take him?</p>
               <p>Kelley. I took him between 5 and 6 the same morning; his master's yard joins to where the robbery was commited.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before justice Cox when the prisoner was there?</p>

               <p>Q. Whether you did not declare you could not be certain at first, but only said to the best of your knowledge; and did not the justice say, that would not be sufficient?</p>

I was then in my bed; he said, the man that I have taken is a middle-size thinish man, with a scraggling short sort of hair, with a cast in his eyes, a blew coat, sustian breeches, and black stockings; I got up and dress'd myself; he brought me to the top of Mason's yard; when we came into the tap-room, in that yard I saw the prisoner among other men.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner at the bar go to bed about 9 o'clock that night; I went to bed at 11 when Mr. Cottis did, in that very room which the prisoner lay in; I saw him in bed when I went to bed, and I got up about three the next morning to make water, St. James's church clock 3, then I saw him in bed, and Mr. Cottis along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie in the same bed with them?</p>
               <p>Whitehouse. No; I saw the prisoner likewise get up about 5, or betwixt 5 and 6 that morning, I mean the 19th of this instant.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when he got up?</p>
               <p>Whitehouse. I was in my bed in the same room, and saw him putting his cloaths on as I lay.</p>
               <p>Joseph Hall. The prisoner at the bar lodg'd at my house, I have known him twenty years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he lodg'd at your house?</p>
               <p>Hall. He has lodg'd at my house from last Christmas; I know very well that he went up stairs to bed before the clock struck 9, on the 18th of this instant May, being a sunday; I call'd him up the next morning, I understood afterwards he was got out of bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How is your house secur'd on nights?</p>
               <p>Hall. If any body goes out of my house, they can't get in without somebody within let them in; when you go out the door follows you, and shuts and locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any going out that night?</p>
               <p>Hall. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any reason to suspect the prisoner was out of your house that night?</p>
               <p>Hall. No; I have not the least in the world; sometimes he drives a jobb, and comes home late, and I get out of my bed to let him in, if after 11 o'clock, at that time I always shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. What character does the prisoner bare?</p>
               <p>Hall. No body bears a better character; he knows where I put my money as well as I do myself, if he had been minded to take from me, I might have lost a great deal.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cottis. What is the prisoner's general character?</p>
               <p>Cottis. He bares a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. to Whitehouse. What character does the prisoner bare?</p>
               <p>Whitehouse. A very good one, he is an honest industrious man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howel. I have known the prisoner about 2 years.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his general character?</p>
               <p>How. He is a very sober, careful, industrious man, and a very honest man as far as ever I heard.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Howel. I live in Rider's-street, St. James's.</p>

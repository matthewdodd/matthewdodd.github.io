                  </hi>. I am a constable attached to the General Post Office. The prisoner was a letter carrier in that office—I cannot say how long he had been employed there—he was employed on the morning of 12th March, in what is called the Circulation office—that is the office where letters are stamped and then taken to the sorters—he was employed at one of the stamping tables, in stamping letters and taking them away into another room to the sorters—this was about 6 o'clock in the morning—there is a partition between the stamper and the man that takes the letters away; he was at the end of the table; it is a long table; there is a partition between the stamper that he takes from, and the other man that takes from the other stamper—there are different tables, but only one was at this table—in consequence of some instruction that I had received, I was in the office with Mr. Clare, watching the prisoner—he could not see us—I saw him taking the letters from behind the stamper; he gathered up a quantity of letters, and selected a letter which bore two penny stamps—he took it out, and kept it by itself; I saw him take hold of it and feel it before he laid it down, and then he took up that armful of letters, the armful of letters that he had collected up, that he selected this one from, and took them away to the sorting room, leaving the letter with the two stamps standing on the table—he then came back again, collected up another handful of letters, perhaps a dozen, and set them up against the partition, and the letter with the two stamps he set up behind them—he set it up against the partition, and the others in front of it; the letter with the two stamps was then next the partition—he then collected four more separate handfuls, and set them up against the others, and each time he did so, he took the letter with the two stamps that he had put behind, and put it in front of each handful, so as to be nearest to him—he then just turned round to look behind him, and unbuttoned his waistcoat two or three buttons at the bottom, turned round to the table again, placed his arm down with the letters, and at the same time with his light hand took up the letter with the two stamps, and put it under his waistcoat—he then placed his thumb against the letters to press them, and took them away—Mr. Clare was with me all the time this</p>

               <p>happened; he went after the prisoner—I went down into the inspector's room, and Mr. Clare came into that room with the prisoner—he told the prisoner that he had been seen to put a letter underneath his waistcoat—he said he had not done so—I then searched him, and told him to take off his coat and waistcoat—he did so; I did not see the letter—I then told him to take off his trowsers; he sat down in a chair and took them off—while he was in the act of taking them off, I saw him fumbling something under<lb></lb>neath his shirt—he then finished pulling his trowsers off, and stood up with his hands down by his side, holding his shirt close to him—I immediately took hold of his shirt and shook it, and this letter dropped from underneath it—I said, "There is the letter," and picked it up—the prisoner said, "Oh, it must have got in underneath my waistcoat by accident as I was taking the letters away"—the letter is directed to Miss Boughton—I felt something inside the letter like money—it was opened before the Magistrate, and contained two sixpences and a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of letter carriers at the General Post Office. The prisoner was a letter carrier, and was also employed in the Circulation office as a stamper—his proper duty was to stamp the letters, and nothing else—he went out of course on the morning in question, and gave his stamp to the man that should have been behind him, and for a few minutes he did the duty of the man that should have carried the letters—the man to whom he gave the stamp was the man who should have carried the letters into the other room—I was there with Bingham on the morning of 11th March—I was in such a situation that I could see all that the prisoner did—I had gone there for that purpose; I was at a window—when the stamper stamps the letters, he removes them away behind him, and the man who carries them to the next office packs them up behind him against the partition until he has got a bundle, and then carries them to the sorting table—I saw the prisoner, in taking the letters from behind the stamper, select one bearing two stamps; he felt it, and placed it against the partition on the stamping table—he then selected more letters from behind the stamper, again took up that letter, felt it again, and then placed it at the back of the letters he had collected—he then collected some more, took the letter from the back of the letters, and placed it in front—he then turned round sharply, as if to see if any one was observing him, took the letter in his right hand, unbuttoned his waistcoat, placed the letters on his wrist and arm to carry them away, and slipped letter into his waistcoat—I then went down to the inspector's room, and afterwards went to the prisoner and brought him into the room—as we went along I saw him shuffling his hand about his trowsers and waistcoat—when</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185704060029"></xptr>
               <p>we got into the room, I told him that he had been seen to secrete a letter in his waistcoat or the waistband of his trowsers—he said he had not—I told Bingham to search him—the prisoner took off his coat and waist<lb></lb>coat, and then his trowsers—I saw him, as he was taking off his trowsers, pushing and shifting something about, as if he was pushing it up behind his shirt—he was sitting down at that time—when his trowsers were off he was told to stand up—I saw his arms close to his shirt, and I said to him, "Take your arms away"—Bingham took hold of his shirt and shook it, and this letter fell down on the floor; it bears the Aylesbury post mark of 11th March—that would arrive in the Circulation office on 12th March, and would be sent out that morning—I felt the letter, and found that it contained something—it has the Inland post mark on it, which shows that it had arrived at the Post Office that morning.</p>

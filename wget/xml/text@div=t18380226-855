                  </hi>. I am the wife of Mr. Frederick Barfield Edmunds, and keep a shop at No. 38, Commercial-road. The prisoner was our servant of all work, for three weeks and four days. On Thursday evening she was sent out, and on her return she handed a silk handkerchief to her master, and said she had found it—he asked her what she was going to do with it, whether she would sell it—she said she. did not care—he offered her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she would not take that—he offered 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she took that—Saturday was a busy day—on Monday I missed several things, and, among the rest, a book—I inquired for it—she said she knew nothing about it—I then searched, and found these things secreted—I called her, and said, "Sarah, how could you take these things from my work-box?"—she said, "I did"—she made no denial—she owned it before the Magistrate—I found them under her bed—she had no box whatever—she was lying on the floor—I found the raisins in a cupboard under the stairs, that was never used—I have lost a number of other articles, which I have not found—I found a pudding made with the same sort of raisins, which she said her sister made her, but her sister denied it—the prisoner was a very artful, had girl—I found a shilling with the other articles—she said the shilling was not mine, but on the Friday she had told me she had no money.</p>

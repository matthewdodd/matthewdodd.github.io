                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Collins, and live in Little Chapel-street, Soho. On the 4th of May, Mrs. Ford brought me a basket of things to be mangled—about a quarter to three o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for them—I never saw her before, but I thought she was Mrs. Ford's servant—she said, "I am come to fetch the stout lady's things from No. 6, Carlisle-street"—I said, I was very sorry the things were not done—she said, "Well, will you bring them home when they are done?—I said I would—about a quarter of an hour afterwards she came again, and said, "I am come for the things from No. 6"—I said, they were not done—she said, "I am to wait for them"—I went down stairs and brought them up—she said "Oh dear me, I am very sorry the lady has no change, only 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, that is of no consequence whatever, my little girl shall go with you to take the basket, and can get the change—they came to 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave my little girl 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to give change for the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she came back in five or ten minutes—the things have never been found—I have made every inquiry at the pawn-shops.</p>

Q.</hi> What was it the person who called upon you said about the stout lady? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That she lived at No. 6, Carlisle-street—she said so immediately on coming in—I am certain of that—I said so before the Magistrate, and heard it read over to me—I am certain of that—I named No. 6, Carlisle-street several times, and heard it read over to me—I am quite positive it was a quarter to three o'clock when the prisoner came the first time, and the second time was about a quarter of an hour after, when she took the things away—she had on a black silk cottage<lb></lb>bonnet, a very small shawl of a dark-mixed colour, a lavender-coloured gown, and a white calico apron, which was quite new, and which I believe my little girl has now got, for the prisoner took it off, and folded it round the bundle which she gave to my child—I am quite positive she is the person, and she is, well aware of it, for she knew me when I saw her in custody—she was taken on the 7th, in the Broadway, just past St. Giles's church—I have not been talking over this matter with my little girl—I have not questioned her about it—I have named the circumstance once or twice, but not to her particularly—I never asked her whether she remembered what dress the prisoner had on—I never had any conversation with her about the dress she had on—I swear that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and live with my mother, Mrs. Collins.

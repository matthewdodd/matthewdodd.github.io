                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, and live at Sewardstone Road, Bethnal Green—on 2nd January, about 7.40, I was in Sewardstone Road—three men came behind me and one before me, who put his leg in front of me, while one of the others gave me a severe blow on the back of my neck, from which I am suffering now, and I fell forward on my face—I regained my feet, I do not know how, and the prisoner seized my chain and dragged it and my watch away and ran off—I followed him fifty or sixty yards to the, end of the road, where he doubled back, and I doubled back and followed him; two parties tried to trip me up a second time; I stumbled, but did not fall—I called "Police!" and then got up to the prisoner, who stopped and said, "Here, governor, here it is," and handed me my watch and chain—I seized him; we had a desperate struggle, and I gave him in custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The assault was instantaneous—I was so confused that' I do not know how I got up—when I called "Stop thief!" people came out</p>

               <p>of the houses to join in the pursuit, but I had seized the prisoner before that—the prisoner was forty or fifty yards ahead of me at one time, but I gained ground on him—no one was running between us, and no one was round us when he gave me my watch—I live in that road, and I know that there is no side street in it.</p>

On the first of May, about half after nine o'clock at night, I heard a noise, like the lifting up of a window, in the passage; the outside window shutters of the passage window were not fast. I took a candle in my hand and went to look; I saw the prisoner in the passage; he immediately got on a board and jumped out of the window, which is about six feet high from the ground. I unbolted the door immediately and pursued him. I cried, stop thief; he had a bag on his shoulder; he threw that down; another person took him; he would have been taken sooner, but he cried stop thief himself, and that misled the people; he was taken at Queenhithe, about two hundred yards off.</p>
               <p>How far was he off when you got out? - About ten yards; he was standing up in a corner with a bag over his shoulder; when I came up to him he threw down the bag and ran away; he had no bag when he was in the passage; the sack was brought to my house, there were some things in it, but they did not belong to me. I got a constable and took him to the Compter. I asked him what business he had in my house? he made me no answer. I am sure the prisoner is the man that was in the house; the window was shut down; I saw my servant shut it just before.</p>

Richard Moore—I gave him in custody six weeks ago last Monday—she came with a seal, and sealed up the home that I had honestly worked for, and I had partly kept him for ten years—I did not give him in custody—he had gone away on the Saturday—the wife fetched him—I gave him in custody in self defence, when he came on the Monday with his wife, and the nurse, and the superintendent to take the home from me, and put the seal upon it; but she could not do it, and went back to the Magistrate—I have four children by him.</p>

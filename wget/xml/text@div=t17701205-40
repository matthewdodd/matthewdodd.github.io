               <p>Mr. Fordyce. In August last, the last Tuesday in the month, save one, coming from my house at Roehampton to London, between eight and nine at night, my coach was stopped: I saw three, my servants told me there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050026"></xptr> six or seven of them; they desired to have our money; I saw two on one side of the coach and one on the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of their persons?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. It was between light and dark, I could not see them distinctly; I delivered my money, so did my wife; I gave them, I believe, seven or eight guineas; they afterwards demanded my watch; my wife and I both gave our watches.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they produce any fire arms, or any thing of that kind?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. There were three pistols in the coach at one time; they put a pistol to my head, and another to my wife, the third pistol was pointed to a gentleman sitting on the other side of the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of them then?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. They went away precipitately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any pursuit after them?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard of your watch again?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen your wife's watch?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. Lady Margaret (my wife) was robbed of her money and watch, and some things hanging to the watch at the same time; that watch I have seen, since it was sold to a watchmaker of credit open Ludgate-hill: I have seen one of the rings that was fixed to Lady Margaret's watch; I don't know the number of the watch, but I know the watch, it is a gold repeater; it was made by my particular directions: I saw the prisoners at Sir

               <p>Q. Did Clark say any thing about the ring or watch?</p>
               <p>Fordyce. Sir John asked me whether I thought I knew the man; I said I had been robbed by a man very much resembling Clark, and dressed much as he was at that time: the prisoner Clark has a particular face, * and I thought I recollected him to be one of those men that robbed me. I would not speak positively where the life of a fellow creature is at stake. I believe he is the man.</p>
               <p>* Clark is cross eyed.</p>
               <p>Q. From Defoe. Do you think either of us robbed you?</p>

               <p>Plumley. I don't know; he had then the appearance of a gentleman; he said it was his own property. I bought it on the first or second of October, either Monday or Tuesday; I believe Monday.</p>

               <p>Q. How come you to be there?</p>
               <p>Stamford. I was taken out of a house where girls at the town used to live, and was chiefly inhabited by them. Clark was taken at that time, but he was acquainted of that charge: Clark and Defoe were afterwards apprehended, then I appeared against them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lodge at that house?</p>
               <p>Stamford. No, I did not; but I was there about ten or eleven days.</p>
               <p>Court. It seems petty extraordinary that they should talk so plainly and openly of a highway robbery?</p>
               <p>Q. From Defoe. What day of the month was it we shewed you the rings.</p>
               <p>Stamford. I can't tell the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. To Vine. Did you ever hear the prisoners talk of this robbery?</p>
               <p>Vine. They made a common practice of robbing; they got their bread by it; they talked of their robberies; I can't say particularly as to this robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. To Stamford. Was it before or after the robbery of Mr. Fordyce, that they talked in this manner to you?</p>
               <p>Stamford. It was sometime after, it was not advertised; it was in a paragraph.</p>

               <p>Defoe's Defence.</p>
               <p>The robbery we are charged with we know nothing of, nor the parties, no farther than being acquainted with them at the coffee-house;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177012050028"></xptr> as to acquaintance with Grindal, we know very little of him, we know no more of him than passing the time of day with him; to up the acquaintance with them both, it can't amount to six-pence. I have two witnesses in the country to prove we were both, in the country together at the time of this robbery. Grindal has been tried twice here for forgery, * and once at Huntingdon.</p>
               <p>* See No. 114. in Mr. Alderman Turner's mayoralty.</p>
               <p>Clark's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was in the country sometime with Mr. Defoe.</p>
               <p>Q. To Stamford. Did you see the prisoners about at the time the robbery was committed?</p>
               <p>Stamford. Yes, both before and after the robbery; they went to Oxford on account of a rumour against them.</p>
               <p>There was another indictment against them for a high-way robbery.</p>

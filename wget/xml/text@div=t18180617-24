            . I live in West's-gardens, Shadwell. On Monday, the 18th of May, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was passing the prosecutor's stable, and saw two men, one appeared to be breaking the door open - I passed just by them. I went home, looked out of my mother's back window, and saw the same men driving same sheep up Dock-hill, they were going away from Mr. Robins's, in the way to Blackwall. I saw the prisoners in custody on the Wednesday following, but cannot swear to them.</p>

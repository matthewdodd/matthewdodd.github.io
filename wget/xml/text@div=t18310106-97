On the 15th of December, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw him take the carcase of a sheep and a side of veal, out of the shop, on his shoulder; I was standing at the door - he passed me with them: I did not speak to him - it struck me he had stolen the sheep, as I thought it had not been sold; I followed him - he went up the market, and put it on the cart of a Mr. Staples, who was known to me; I said, "What are you going to do with that sheep?" he seemed confused, and said a man had given him 3d. to take it to Gravel-lane, Ratcliff-highway; Staples lives in Cable-street, which is in that direction - he did not further describe where he was to take it to; he said if I would allow him to go he would find the man - I said, "Well, I'll go with you;" he said he could only find him if he went alone - I gave him into custody; the side of veal belonged to Staples.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Staples, of New-road, St. George's, who used to employ the prisoner for a day now and then, when busy. I was with master's cart, and when I got into the market the prisoner called out,"John, your side of veal is ready at Mr. Scales';" he knew we have one every Monday there - I said I was not ready for it; I had to get something from Spencer's - when I came out of Spencer's there was nothing in the cart; I came out a second time, and found him in the cart, covering the sheep over in the cart with the side of veal, as well as he could; I did not expect a sheep from Scales - I said"What business has that there? my master won't have his meat muddled with other people's;" he said a man gave him 3d. to carry it to New Gravel-lane;" he was not in master's employ that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When the cart came up Price asked me to help him put a side of beef into it - the beef was not ready; he said, "If you will fetch the veal from Scales', I will fetch the beef;" a man in Scales' shop gave me 3d. to take the sheep - I am a porter in the market.</p>

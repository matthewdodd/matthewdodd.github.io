On 3d November I was on duty in Orchard-street, and saw the prisoner standing talking to two men in a corner—I watched them—the prisoner left them for a short time, returned, and nodded before she got to them—she then left them and went towards Dean-street—I followed her; she did not see me till she got to the corner by the Broad Sanctuary, where she threw a parcel down an area twenty yards from me on the opposite side—I did not hear it fall; I only saw the "go" of her hand—I looked into the area, and saw three half-crowns lying separate—I picked them up and followed the prisoner, and took her in custody.</p>

I am a shoe-black—on 3d November I was at the corner of Dean-street with another shoeblack, and saw a policeman walking quickly, and the prisoner in front of him—directly she got to the corner, I saw her throw a paper parcel over the railings into an area—I did not hear it fall—the constable got over, picked it up, and followed her—I then looked over the area railings and saw two half-crowns lying in a corner—I went into the area and found a paper parcel containing bad money, rather tightly done up—I did not open it, but it was burst a little, and I saw that it was money—I gave it to the constable just as I found it.</p>

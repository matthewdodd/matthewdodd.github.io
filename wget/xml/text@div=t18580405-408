                  </hi>. I am a private in the Coldstream Guards. The prisoner was in the same regiment—he returned to the barracks about 1 o'clock in the morning on 24th Feb.—I believe he had been drinking—he conducted himself in a disorderly manner, threw his clothes about, and talked</p>

               <p>loud, no as to call the attention of the sergeant; and the sergeant told him if he did not behave quietly he would have to be conveyed to the guard-house—hereplied, if he took him to the guard-room he would cut his b—throat—thesergeant ordered two privates to remove him—the prisoner said he would go to the guard-room himself if he would let him pat on his boots—he went out of the room, and came in again, and took off his boots again—the sergeant told him to dress to go to the guard-room—he then began to feel about his <hi rend="italic">kit</hi>, which was over his bed—he found a razor, and he struck at the sergeant with the razor, and cut him across the throat—he said nothing at the time—the sergeant was then going to lay hold of him, and he struck at him again, and he heaved np his arm and cut him across the breast—the sergeant came up to the other end of the room to me, and said, "Pemberton, my throat is cut"—I then jumped out of bed and wiped his throat with a sponge, and he was taken to the hospital—the prisoner afterwards said he knew very well what he had done, and he was not sorry for it—that was three or four minutes afterwards in the barrack-room—before he struck the sergeant, he said he had done seven years penal servitude, and he would do twenty for him; and after he had done it, he said he would serve me the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant in the Coldstream Guards. On the night in question I was in bed when the prisoner came into the guard-room—inconsequence of his violent conduct, I remonstrated with him, and told him he must be conveyed to the guard-house if be persisted—I got up and ordered some men to remove him—he said he could go to the guard-room, that he had had seven years penal servitude before—almost immediately after, he went to his kit and found something with which he cut me under the chin, under the left arm, and on the right breast—some of the soldiers came to my assistance, and he was taken away, and I was taken to the hospital—I am almost well now—I never had any quarrel or disagreement with the prisoner previously.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the Grenadier Guards On the morn<lb></lb>ing in question the sergeant was brought to the hospital—I found a deep wound across the centre of the throat about two inches long, such as a sharp instrument would make; another incised wound beneath the left arm, on the side of the body, about two and a half inches long, and also deep; and a. superficial wound across the breast about an inch long—both the wound in the throat and that beneath the arm were of a dangerous character—they might have been produced by this razor (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

Yes; the prisoner was a servant and a waiter; I hired him as a servant, to do every thing that I told him to do; if I ordered him to brush me a pair of shoes, and he refused to do it, I would have discharged him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been a servant and a waiter? - A. I believe a twelvemonth last March.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information did you call to your assistance Mr. Holdsworth? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of that and Mr. Holdsworth, mark any money? - A. One seven-shilling piece, one dollar, a half-crown, five shillings, and a sixpence; I marked them on Saturday, the 25th of May, and went in the evening to the Mansion-house and gave it to Mr. Holdsworth: On Sunday I left my house at one o'clock, and my sister went with me; I returned about five minutes before nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. The money that was received, where was it put? - A. In a little bowl that I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other waiter but the prisoner? - A. A porter: On Sundays he takes money when the other is at dinner; when I returned home I turned out all the money that was in that bowl into a half-pint bason; before I went out in the morning I counted out five guineas in small change; I took the half-pint bason with the money up stairs; I counted the money over twice; my first object was to know what was taken; I counted out the five guineas that was left: On the second time of going up stairs I missed the dollar and the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen that marked dollar and the sixpence? - A. Yes, I knew it to be the same that I had marked; I took the prisoner up stairs with the Marshal into my room; he said he was honest, and he was very much surprized that he was charged with a theft; he suffered himself to be searched; he said the sixpence was given to him, and he had given the dollar to his sister that evening; she wanted one, and he had put in five shillings for it; I said to him, I shall soon convince you of that; there is no more than one shilling in the bowl that I had marked and put in the bowl in the morning; I went with the officer to his sister, and she gave the dollar to the officer in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290031"></xptr>presence; I knew it to be the same that I had marked.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. The prisoner was your waiter and your servant; if he had refused to have brushed your shoes you would have discharged him? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. You pay taxes for your servants - Do you pay for him as a waiter or servant? - A. A waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. You would rather pay one guinea instead of two; now we find what sort of a servant he was - Did he pay you or you him? - A. He.</p>
               <p>Q. How much a year did he pay you for being your waiter? - A. He pays me 120 l. a year.</p>
               <p>Q. And finds himself in every thing - A. Yes, he finds himself in clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. And he pays you for the honour of blacking your shoes 120 l. a year - You marked a dollar and some money of your own, and gave it to Mr. Holdsworth? - A I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you came home at night, you did did not look into the bowl and count it; you put it into a half-pint bason and went up stairs? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You were anxious to know whether you had been robbed, and like a candid and respectable man you called and said to the prisoner, give me an account? - A. He could not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take that to be an answer to my question, or do you think I am so silly as to take it - Did you when you came home, and before you charged him with any theft whatever, did you ask him what money he received in the course of that day, and put it down? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him any question whatever, as to the money he had received that day, till you had put him into Mr. Holdsworth's custody? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This man was entrusted to receive money and give change, was he not, from this bowl? - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. What money he received from a customer, if he wanted change he would resort to the bowl for change? - A. Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you say, I have lost five shillings to day; what money have you received, what money have you given in change - A. I left out five shillings in the morning, and I put in half a guinea; this was about eleven o'clock at noon I made up this money; I did not come down stairs till one and I found the five shillings safe.</p>
               <p>Q. This was one o'clock - How many people came into your house from one o'clock till nine o'clock you cannot tell - Was there any gold there? - A. He had changed a one pound note.</p>
               <p>Q. In addition to the five guineas? - A. He had changed a one pound note from the bason.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When you went out, how much money did you leave? - A. Five guineas, in half guineas, seven shilling pieces, dollars, half-crowns, and shillings and sixpences, in the bason.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came home how much money was there in the whole? - A. When I came home I counted one pound seven shillings, and five shillings of this money was taken before I left the house, and one pound I apprehend was spent by Mr. Holdsworth's party.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot know what money was paid; you found an addition to your money of one pound seven shillings, and what was given in change for that one pound seven shillings you do not know? - A. There were two 1 l. notes he had given change for; one was changed while I was there.</p>
               <p>Mr. HOLDSWORTH sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the City Marshal? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Lewis deliver any marked money to you? - A. He did, on Saturday evening, a 7-shilling piece, a dollar, a sixpence, a half-crown, and 5 s. I directed Tipper and Stanton to to be there; I gave Tipper a seven-shilling piece and 3 s. and Stanton had the dollar and the sixpence; when Mr. Lewis was up stairs, and the prisoner with him, I told the prisoner that he had received a dollar; he admitted it; he said he had put five shillings in the bowl in lieu of it; he had given the dollar to his sister; I desired him to empty his pocket, in doing which he threw out three sixpences; one of the three was one I had received from Mr. Lewis, and another of the sixpences was a sixpence I gave to him to take three pence out; he said that the sixpence that was given to him marked, was the sixpence that I gave to him to take three pence out, that was not so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When the prisoner was asked about the dollar, he said it is very true, his sister wanted the dollar of him, and he put five shillings in the bowl for it, the value of more than twenty shillings was in the bowl? - A. The identical money was all in the bowl but the dollar and the sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. A waiter will find it more convenient to have small change in his bowl than large - He had put five shillings in the bowl, in lieu of the dollar? - A. I think it is more handy.</p>

               <p>Q. Is it not probable, in consequence of much money being taken, that these identical shillings might have been given to customers in change? - A. They might.</p>

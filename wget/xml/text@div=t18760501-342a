                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">interpreted</hi>). I am a hairdresser, living at 124, Castle Street, Leicester Square—I met the two prisoners near Hyde Park about 9 o'clock on the 2nd April—I understood by their signs they wanted me to go home with them—I said "No"—I went into a public-house alone to get rid of them—I had a glass of ale, and then suddenly found the two were there—they molested me, and wanted something to drink—they had some<lb></lb>thing, for which I paid with small money out of this purse (<hi rend="italic">produced)—I</hi> left the public-house, and when about twelve steps away they came up to me; one pulled me one side and the other pulled me the other side, and asking me to go with them—I suddenly felt I was robbed—I then found my purse containing 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. gone, also a bunch of three keys and a snuff-box—I stepped them both, a policeman came up, and I at once gave them into custody—these articles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)are mine—I last saw them about 9 o'clock in the evening—I was sober.</p>

I was returning from Brompton, where I had been out to dinner—this was on a Sunday—I had been drinking beer for dinner; I had none before dinner—I had some glasses with a friend between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day—I had not been drinking in the afternoon—I went into the Park for a walk, where I heard preaching going on—I went into the public-house alone to get rid of the prisoners; my intention was to come out of another door—I did say I went into the public-house with the pri<lb></lb>soners—whatever I may have said, I went in alone, and they came close after me—there were several persons there.</p>

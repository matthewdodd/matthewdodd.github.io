On the 3d of July, about eleven o'clock at night, I locked my desk, which had about 40l. in Bank of England notes, and a great deal of silver, in a private drawer, in it-the prisoner often saw me put my notes in the private drawer; my family were at Brighton, and he was going to them the next morning. On the 3d of July, about a quarter after six o'clock in the morning, he tapped at my bed-room door, and told me that thieves had been in the house; I went down without dressing myself, and followed him into the front parlour, which looks into the street, I found the left window-shutters entirely demolished and part of the shutters laying in the room, I asked him if there had been any plate on the side-board the night before? He said there were four spoons and the sugar-tongs. I said, I hope William they have not been in the counting-house. He said I hope not Sir. I went there to my private drawer in my desk, where I always put my notes, it was locked - I found it very difficult to unlock it being very much mutilated. After some trouble I unlocked it and found all the notes which I had put there the night before gone. There were one 10l. and three 2l. notes among them - I always write on my notes. I lent the prisoner 2l. the first day he came to me-it might have been a 2l. note, I had upwards of 20l. in 1l. notes, in my drawer. I found the bottom of the drawer had been forced up with some instrument, and the notes drawn out with the hand. I also lost a black pocket-book with memorandums out of the drawer. The prisoner said what a shocking place London was to live in, and he must go again to his own country - He had only lived a month with me. I did not suspect him at all. He was going to Brighton at two o'clock, and he asked me to let him go to the west end of the town before he went. He returned and went to Brighton; after he was gone my attention was directed to the window blind; I found it was impossible for any<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181709170013"></xptr>person to have come in from the outside, as the blind must have been broken for them to get down, and it was not injured in the least, it became evident to me that it must have been done inside; upon which I went to Lambeth-street Office; Miller was sent to Brighton on Friday, and brought the prisoner to town.</p>

            . I am an officer of Lambeth-street, and went to Brighton for the prisoner. I told him that I suspected he had broken his master's house open, and desired him to show me his things, and inside his coat lining I found two 2l. notes, pinned; he took me to the drawer where the coat was, opened it himself, and said they were his things; I asked him where he got the notes from, he said he borrowed them of a friend at the west end of the town; I showed him Mr. Docker's mark on the notes, and told him he must have stolen them from his master, as his marks were on the notes - He stood motionless for sometime, and then said, "I did rob my master." I said nothing to induce him to say so. I asked him where the other notes and plate were; he said he would tell his master when he got to town, as they were hid in his master's house. As we came along in the coach, I asked him why he could not tell me where the property was; he said he hoped nobody else would be hurt beside himself, as he was the only person who did the robbery, and that he gave 30l. to

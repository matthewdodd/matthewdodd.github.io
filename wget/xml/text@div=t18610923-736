                  </hi>. I am under-warehouseman at Messrs. James Berry and Co., Queenhithe, wholesale stationers—their warehouse is in the parish of St. Michael's, Queenhithe—I have charge of the keys of the warehouse—I locked up the premises on the evening of the 11th of this month, about a quarter-past 7—I left them safe at that time—there were six desks in the office altogether; four in one, and two in another—they were all apparently secure—as the clerks leave they lock their own desks—in one of the desks there was a bowl with some postage stamps—I did not see it that evening—it is generally kept there—I did not notice the area railings that night the policeman, who was watching, outside went with me into the premises the following morning—I came there the next morning about half-past 7—when I found the place had been broken into, I sent for further assistance to the station—I found that the desks had all been entered and the contents strewed about—I noticed four coats lying on the floor in one of the counting-houses—they were in the same room that they had been the evening before—I know the prisoner—he had no business on the premises</p>

               <p>—I saw him discovered up Stairs on the first-floor, secreted in a rack on some papers—I saw a piece of granite on the basement; it was not there the day before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 417): About 10 o'clock on Wednesday night, 11th September, I was on duty near the prosecutor's premises, and about a quarter before I on Thursday morning I noticed that three spikes had been broken away from the grating, and a granite stone lying in the basement—when I first came on duty that evening the spikes were not broken or the granite there—I noticed that—I reported this at the station—I did not watch the premises myself after that, some one else was put on the watch.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 64). In consequence of information I received at the station-house, I proceeded to the prosecutor's premises on the morning of 12th September, about 8 o'clock—on entering the warehouse we found that four desks were broken open, on the ground floor—upon searching the warehouse, in a back room on the first-floor, I found the pri<lb></lb>soner concealed under some paper—I found nothing on him but some lucifers matches—an entrance had been effected by three bars being broken away from the area—I noticed several coats lying on the floor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Messrs. Barry and Co.—I bad a coat which I left on their premises on the evening of 11th September, hanging up in my office—I found the coat, 'the next morning, in another office on the floor with several others, with the pockets rifled—all the contents were left in my own office—the prisoner was not employed by Messrs. Barry, and had no business upon the premises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you always hang your coat in the same place? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Always.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Thomas Harwood states that the bars were broken a week before; it is at the top of a place where a lot of lads play about, and there is a heap of stones just opposite; they might easily have been broken by any one throwing stones there. I don't think it is fair I should be indicted for breaking, when it might have been done by anybody else; of course I can't say anything as to being found in the warehouse.</p>

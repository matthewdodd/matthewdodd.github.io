                  </hi>. I am a shoe-maker, of 9, Gee's Court, Oxford Street—on Saturday night, 11th August, after twelve o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Gee's Court, Oxford Street—he said to my mother-in-law that he would kill all the lot, and he came down to my door and made use of the same words, lhat he would kill all the b----lot—I said, "I am a poor weak man, I don't want no fighting; I have nothing to do with you, but you won't kill me," and I struck him—we fought, and he knocked me down three times—my wife came down out of bed and took me away, and shoved me into my landlord's—I was in there between a quarter and half an hour—when I came out I was told that my wife's head was cut open, and I saw her in Oxford Street, standing with her hands up to her head, and the blood running down her back—I said, "Who has done that?"—she said, "George, the man you were fighting with"—the prisoner was not there then—I took her to the hospital—we had not been drinking; all the drink I and my wife had was one half-pint of beer at our supper—we went to bed, but my breath was so bad that I was obliged to go down to the door—I have been ill for three years with diseased heart and con<lb></lb>sumption, and my wife has been my chief support—the prisoner was sober—I had never spoken to him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waiter, of 25, James Street, Oxford Street—on a Saturday evening, six weeks ago, I saw the last witness fighting with a man in Gee's Court; I did not see his face; I could not say it was the prisoner—I saw the deceased come and fetch her husband away, and push him inside a door—she came out again to prevent the man from going in after her husband—the man mumbled something, caught hold of her by the shoulders, and pushed her down, and while she was on the ground he kicked her with his foot, at the back of the head I believe; I did not see the wound, but I saw blood come out of the head—he might have done it a second time, but I only saw him do it once—I might have been two or three yards away from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not the husband and wife come out again together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; she came out and held the door—she had only got her gown on—</p>

               <p>I was knocked down and had my ribs kicked in, not by you, but through your affair—there was not half a dozen people in the court when I passed, only those who were looking out of windows—I was attacked because I said what a shame it was to hit the old man—they were all sober, by what I could see.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 13, Gray's Buildings—on Saturday, 11th August, I was passing through Gee's Court from Oxford Street, and saw the prisoner and a woman having a squabble, jangling together—I saw him push her down, using a bad word—she fell backwards, and He made a kick at her—where he kicked her I can't say; I saw blood—I called him a brute, and said he ought to be locked up.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Gee's Court, and am a tin-plate worker—I was in the barber's shop on this night; I heard a row in the court, and saw five of them pitching on to the prisoner, fighting him; there were two females, the deceased's father, her husband, and son—I picked up his cap when the row was over, and said, "George, come away; it is no good fighting with them"—I saw the deceased go ia doors with her husband and shut the door, and the prisoner went up the court with his mouth bleeding, and I saw no more.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in High Street, Marylebone—on 30th August I was called to 9, Gee's Court, to attend the deceased, as medical officer of the parish—my assistant saw her first, the day previous—she was suffering from inflammation of the brain—she had a curved scalp-wound extending from the vertex to the left temple—I could form no notion of what had produced it; a kick might do it—I attended her till 9th September, when she died of inflammation of the brain, caused by the wound.</p>

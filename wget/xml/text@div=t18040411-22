On Wednesday, between eight and nine o'clock in the morning, the 14th of March last, I went to a friend at the Prince of Wales's Feathers, in Exeter-street; his name is Winter, and was to purchase a horse and a cart for me; I went to pay one Dunn, a baker, for the horse and cart; he was there, and the prisoner at the bar; we all drank and eat together; I have known the prisoner for some time, but not by name.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you occasion to pay for the horse and cart? - A. I pulled out of my pocket-book, and gave to the said

             a 10 l. note to give to Mr. Dunn, the baker; I do not understand notes, being no scholar: I see Winter give Dunn the 10 l. note for the horse and cart as part of payment; the prisoner was in the tap-room at the time Dunn, the baker, and Winter went away as soon as the victuals were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - A. I found it was between the hours of eleven and twelve. After Dunn and Winter were gone, the prisoner continued in my company.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you drinking together? - A. I cannot recollect that; we drank after they were gone, if we did, it was only a pint or two; I had drank gin in the morning, I think three glasses; I did not drink beer till after I had my victuals, and then I drank very near a pot to my own share.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say how long you had continued in company with the prisoner after Dunn and Winter were gone? - A. Very near three quarters of an hour; we sat talking; he says to me, if I was in your place, Mr. Dunn, I would go and look after my property, the horse and cart I had bought; I said, where is the use of my going, when I have given the man liberty to work the horse and cart till Saturday, that was part of the bargain; he said I would have you go, for fear the horse and cart should be sold again; with great persuasion I went, and he went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when you left this public-house? - A. Near one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you feel yourself at that time with respect to your sobriety? - A. Quite sober.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell the Justice that you felt yourself in liquor? - A. I did not, I had been drinking a little gin in the morning, and after that I had some victuals, and the porter does not hurt me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the Justice mistook you; after you went from the public-house, what state were you in? - A. I was quite sober; I and the prisoner went down to the King's Arms, in Soho-square; as we went along we called upon one Dunn, a Police-officer; the prisoner asked him if it was not right that I should go and get a receipt for the 10 l.; then we all three went together to the King's Arms to get a receipt from Dunn, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110021"></xptr>baker, for the 10 l.; he lived opposite: I had to pay 1 l. 6 d. the remainder of the money; I took out my pocket-book, on purpose to give Dunn, the Police-officer, a 1 l. note to pay Dunn, the baker, I had another 1 l. note besides in the corner of the pocket-book; I did not know what money I had when I went out; I had a 5 l. note; I afterwards found, when Dunn returned the pocket-book to me, a 5 l. note and a 1 l. note too; I did not know it was a 5 l. note; I am no scholar.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that you gave it to Dunn? - A. Yes, the 5 l. note and the 1 l. note too; I put them in my pocket-book, and put it in my coat-pocket; the prisoner was with me all the time; we staid at the King's Arms the best part of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you had some more liquor there? - A. Yes, because we joined the company of Dunn, the baker.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say you were perfectly sober when you left the King's Arms? - A. Not quite, but as sensible as I am now,</p>
               <p>Q. When you left that house, who was with you? - A. The prisoner, and Dunn the officer; we walked together from Soho-square till we came to the Cadogan Arms; Dunn, the officer, parted from me just by York-street; and the prisoner promised Dunn to see me home.</p>
               <p>Q. What occasion had he to see you home? - A. On account of my limbs being so bad; I am very feeble.</p>
               <p>Q. No other cause? - A. No, I was supported by the prisoner, till I desired to lean against a wall.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be resting that way? - A. About two minutes; he stood at the right-hand side of me, and I felt his hand in my pocket; then I said to him halloa, what are you doing; as soon as I had spoke that, he took to his heels, and run round the corner of York-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that you felt with your hand his hands at your pocket? - A. Yes, my pocket was turned inside out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you immediately miss your pocketbook? - A. Yes; I immediately called out stop thief; there came several neighbours round me, and asked me what was the matter, I told them I had been robbed; they asked me if I knew him; I said I knew him very well, but I did not know his name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see your pocket-book again? - A. Yes, it might be about two or three minutes after, that a man that lives in York-street, picked it up close by me, and gave it me; he is a newsmonger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him open your pocket-book? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to examine it then? - A. I did not then; when I came to Winter's house I examined it directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say, that what you call a 5 l. note was taken out of the pocket-book? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it that you had the prisoner taken up? - A. On the Saturday following; I left that to Mr. Dunn, the patrol, who understood the business better than I did; I informed Mr. Dunn of it on Friday.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to inform him of it sooner? - A. I went to the Prince of Wales's Feathers, there I saw the prisoner; I did not go nigh him, but sat at the other side of the tap-room, I said nothing to him about it then; he owned to other people on Thursday in the tap-room.</p>

               <p>Q. You have none of these people here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take him up? - A. On Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present, and what did he say? - A. He said he was willing to go.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing found upon him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean about your pocket-book laying by where you were standing? - A. Very likely he might have dropped it there.</p>
               <p>Q. How could he possibly open your pocketbook and take your note out; you told us he was running away? - A. I cannot say whether he might have took it out before; I am not clear in that, and was trying to put it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you do not know your note again? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a Police patrol; I saw the prosecutor and the prisoner together at my own door; I heard the prisoner say, that it was better for him to go and pay the remainder of the money, for fear they should swindle him out of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the prosecutor in at that time with respect to sobriety? - A. In appearance he was fit for any sort of work; I thought he was sober; I went with him and the prisoner to the King's Arms, there I saw Dunn, the baker; I said to him, I am authorised by this man to say to you, if you will be good enough to take the remainder of the money, and let the man have the horse and cart; he said the difference between him and Dunn was, that he was to work the horse and cart till Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the conversation, did Dunn take out his pocket-book? - A. Yes, he gave me two notes, one a 5 l. note, and the other a 1 l. note: As Dunn, the baker, would not take the remainder of the money, I gave it him again; I said, take notice what money you gave me; I saw him put it in his pocket-book, and I saw him put his pocket-book in his right-hand pocket; we staid at the King's Arms about half an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180404110022"></xptr>hour, or a little more; Dunn, the baker, went away, the prisoner and I went with him; he is quite a cripple; he cannot walk above forty yards without sitting down; he was supported by me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sober when he quitted the King's Arms? - A. As sober as he is now; I walked with him about half a mile; I left them together; I said, Mr. Dunn, I must leave you because of my duty; the prisoner said he would take care of him and see him home.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it you saw Dunn the prosecutor again? - A. Not till Thursday night; I saw the prisoner again on Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Dunn, the prosecutor, made his complaints to you? - A. Not to me, it was to my wife; I happened to be on duty on board the Tender with some men; on Friday I saw the prisoner, I had not a warrant then; I had instructions from Sir

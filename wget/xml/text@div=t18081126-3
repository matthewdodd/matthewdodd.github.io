               <p>Q. At what time in the day was it - A. I cannot pretend exactly to say; it was between two and three o'clock I believe; he came alone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. No; he called for a glass of ale; I served him with a glass of ale. I threw the shilling on the table which he gave me.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house was this that he gave you the shilling - A.In the passage where I have a machine to draw beer; at that time I stood behind the table; the place being dark I just looked at it and threw it on the table; I said I hoped it was a good one; he said yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you throw it on the table to sound it - A. Not particularly to sound it. I gave him his change, a sixpence and four pennyworth of halfpence, and then I took the shilling up and went towards the light to see whether it was a good one; I found it was a bad one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Are you quite sure the shilling you look up, after having throwed it down, was the shilling you took from him - A. Yes; it was a smooth shilling, it looked very well; when I rubbed it I found what it was directly; as soon as ever I pronounced it was a bad one Mr.

            . Q. I believe you are an officer of Worship street office - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany Ray on this day - A. I did; I with him to the house of Mr. Hargrave; Mr. Hargrave gave me a shilling. I was sitting in the back parlour, I heard a voice call for a glass of ale; sometime after that I heard the landlord say it was a bad shilling; the landlord was in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say it was a bad shilling to - A. To the person that tendered it, as I considered it, that induced me to come out of the parlour; I saw the prisoner and I knew him; at that time Mr. Ray had got hold of him by the arm; we took him into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you get possession of that shilling - A. Immediately I took him into the parlour; Mr. Hargrave held the shilling in his hand; I desired Mr. Hargrave to mark the shilling, and then when he had marked it, Ray proceeded to search him in my presence. I saw him find nineteen counterfeit shillings up. on him, seven good sixpences, he counted, he found upon him likewise, and four shillings and twopence in copper, he found upon him; which he took out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.What did Mr. Hargrave do with the shilling he marked - A. He gave it to me. I then went to search the prisoner again; in his right hand waistcoat pocket<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811260005"></xptr>I found a shilling, which I believe to be a good one. Here is the shilling which Mr. Hargrave gave to me after he had marked it; I have had that shilling ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. Yes, I have known him this five or six years before.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hargrave. Just look at that shilling and see whether that is the shilling you marked and gave to Kennedy - A. Yes, that is the one I had of the prisoner; I marked it and gave it to Kennedy.</p>
               <p>MR. NICHOLLS. - Q. You are one of the moniers of his Majesty's Mint - the shilling that Mr. Hargrave gave to Kennedy, I put into your hand - A. It is a counterfeit.</p>
               <p>COURT. It has the resemblance of a shilling, I suppose - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. But it is a counterfeit - A. Yes. The other ten are also counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Look at the others - A. The nine are also counterfeits.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they appear fresh - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where are the good one's - A. The one that Kennedy speaks of, I rather think it is a bad one; it is silver; it never was a shilling. Here is one sixpence is good, and the others I believe are silver; they are passable; they have a better appearance than the others.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I put the shilling down on the table, I did not mean to give it him at all; I was putting my hand into my pocket to take some halfpence out to give him for the glass of ale; before I could get my hand in my pocket Mr. Ray and Kennedy seized both my hands; the landlord never moved it from where it was, at the other end of the table, till they had searched me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean to say it laid on the table all the time - A. Yes, it never was moved till they moved it to him; nor was I ever moved from there into the parlour; I was searched upon the very spot, and when he offered me the change of this shilling, they took it out of his hand back again; I did not, receive it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hargrave. We have understood from your evidence that he gave the shilling into your hand, that you threw it down on the table - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that you are very confident that he gave you the shilling in payment of the ale, and you returned him the sixpence and the fourpence - A. Yes; he afterwards dropped the sixpence.</p>

On the 4th of January, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was in the back parlour, and heard a noise in the shop like shoes falling down - I turned, and saw a man going out of the shop: I ran after him, and saw the sole of a shoe or boot under his arm - I called Stop thief! and a young man stopped him; master then came up - the prisoner is the man; I never lost sight of him, except as he turned a corner - he had not the shoes when I came up.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and live in Mary-place. The prisoner came down there with the shoes - there is a space beyond my house; I was taking down a ladder, and somebody told me a pair of shoes were thrown over the wall; I got over, took them up, and kept them till I delivered them to the prosecutor or his wife; my son stopped the prisoner - nobody could have thrown them there without coming down the court.</p>

            . I never lost sight of the prisoner till he turned the corner - he went to the bottom of the court, and was coming back when the witness passed him - he was about two moments out of my sight; he must have thrown them over the wall after he turned the corner - that was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. All that has been said is quite false - I went down there for a certain purpose, and as I came up the young man laid hold of me.</p>

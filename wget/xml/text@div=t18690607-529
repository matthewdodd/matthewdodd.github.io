               <p>May, about 6 o'clock, I was looking out of my window and saw the prisoner Jones run across a garden with a clock in his hand—he ran to a hedge—I then saw him leave the hedge without the clock—Joiner was standing in the road a little further down, watching—I then saw Jones climb over the wall of Wilton Lodge—it is rather a high wall—I saw him after that at the window—I went in and told my mother—when I looked again I saw Jones coming from the front gate of Wilton Lodge, and Joiner with him, carr<lb></lb>ying a bag—, Jones passed an umbrella to Joiner—they were watching about—there were two more besides—Joiner and one of the others went up to the hedge, but I did not see what they did there, because of the wall—I went up the side way and watched them—they were then all four walking together, Joiner carrying the bag—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bag—I gave in<lb></lb>formation to the police, and they were afterwards apprehended.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This affidavit, sworn on</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th August,</hi> 1870, <hi rend="italic">was read at length. The portions upon which the perjury was assigned were, that George King had said to Fry, at his hotel at Sittingbourne, either on Monday or Tuesday preceding</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th August,</hi> 1870, <hi rend="italic">in the presence of Ward, "What I have told you before, I say now, that what I said at the trial for English was the truth;" and that King and Ward went away together.

I live in Princes Street, Rochester—I am now an engine-driver—in 1869 I was employed by Mr. Borden to be his foreman at the brick-field known as the Horsham brick-field, about ten acres—I know Mr. Fry; he keeps the "Sittingbourne Hotel"—King was foreman to Mr. Borden before me—I recollect the Monday or Tuesday prior to 26th August, 1870—I was not at Fry's hotel at Sittingbourne, in the company of King, on either of those days—I did not see King there—I did not on any day in August see King at the prisoner's house at Sittingbourne—I was never there with King in my life—I never had any conversation with King in Fry's presence, at his house—I did not hear Fry ask King, at his (Fry's) house, when the trial would come off—I did not hear King say "Not till October"—he did not say "What I have told you before, I say now, that what I said at the trial for English was the truth"—we did not go away from the public-house together—I did not at any time go to the prisoner's house by myself and say "King still insists that what he said at the trial was true"—Fry did not reply, "Before the trial King told me that what he was going to say was nothing but the truth, and he has since told me that he spoke the truth at the trial"—I did not say "Yes, King told me so five minutes ago;" that is all false—in consequence of something I heard from Mr. Borden, I went in company with Mr. Borden to the prisoner's house at Sittingbourne, some<lb></lb>where about the 9th or 10th of January last—I saw him, in the presence of Mr. Borden—Mr. Borden asked Fry if he remembered making an affi<lb></lb>davit for Mr. English—Fry said "Yes"—Mr. Borden then asked him if he knew what was in it—Fry said "What I heard King say?"—Mr. Borden then said "But you have said about Ward"—Fry said "No, I have not"—Mr. Borden said "But you have about my foreman, that meant Ward"—Fry said "Yes, there he is now," pointing towards me—Mr. Borden then said "You said Ward was here, and heard a conversation of King's"—Fry said "They passed each other at the door"—Mr. Borden then said "But you have sworn they were here together"—Fry then said "Well, they went away together"—Mr. Borden then said "Was it not read over to you?"—he said yes, it was gabbled over to him in London—Mr. Borden then said "You can read and write; you should be more careful, as you might swear a man's life away"—Fry then said "Well, I don't care; whatever I have said I shall adhere to"—to the best of my belief, Mr. Borden said it was ruination to him, and he told Fry that he would have to prove it, meaning the statement that was in the affidavit.</p>

               <p>was a sale in the other—Mr. English did not threaten to prosecute me for taking away some bricks during the second distress—he did not say any<lb></lb>thing to me about taking away some bricks, nor did I bring them back; I swear that; I do not know what you are talking of—I took some straw away—King said something about it, and I went to Mr. English about it—he did not threaten to prosecute me; he said he would not prosecute me—I told him I had taken this straw away, and I heard I had done wrong by doing that, and I took it back before he said he would not prosecute me—I took it back as soon as I found out I was wrong—I told him I hoped he would not prosecute me—Mr. Borden had given me leave to take this straw before the distress was put in; that was why I took it—I thought there was no harm in taking a handful, but I did not take it thieving—I don't recollect that I went to any other of the witnesses for Mr. English, besides Fry and Mutlow—I did not go to King, I met him on the road—I did not talk to him about it, we were not on speaking terms.</p>

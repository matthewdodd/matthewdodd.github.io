                  </hi>. I live with my husband in Linden Street, Copen<lb></lb>hagen Street—the prisoner and his wife and three children have been living in the same house about ten weeks—on Saturday, 9th December, about 5.30 or 6 o'clock, he and his wife came home, and went into their own room—they were quarrelling—Mrs. Lambert called me half an hour afterwards, and I went down and saw one of the children bleeding from a wound on the side of its head—I took it out of its mother's lap, and took it upstairs—the mother and I took it to the Great Northern Hospital, and it was attended by a doctor—we brought it home again, and it died a week after<lb></lb>wards—I said to the prisoner "This is rather a serious case, through tem<lb></lb>per"—he said "Yes, I never intended to hurt my wife and child," and I do not believe he did either—he said that he threw a piece of iron at his wife, but it struck the wall, and hit the child—I daresay he had had a little drink, but I never saw him have any.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Coroner's constable—I received information and went to the prisoner's house, 20, London-street, on 18th December—I told them who I was, and that I had come to make inquiries about the death of their child—Mrs. Lambert spoke in a very loud violent voice, and told me in his presence, that he came home drunk on Saturday night and took a fender rest up, which is a piece of iron, and threw it at her, and it struck the child—I asked her where it was, and the prisoner, who was sitting by the fire, stooped down and produced this, and said "This is it, and I am sorry."</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the Great Northern Hospital—on 9th December, the child was brought there by Mrs. Barnsford and the mother—I found a scalp wound on the right side of its head, partly con<lb></lb>tused and partly lacerated—I told the mother what to do, and it was taken home—I saw it next day, Tuesday, and took it into the hospital—it went on apparently well, till the early part of Saturday, and died of convulsions on Sunday, the 17th—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and in addition to the small wound on the scalp, I found a punctured wound in the skull, exactly corresponding with that on the scalp, and on removing a portion of the skull I found on it several large spiculæ of bone, little splinters, penetrating the brain, and lacerating it completely—it died from convulsions, caused by the laceration of the brain by those splinters of bone, and the subsequent inflammation—it appeared that some blunt pointed instrument had fallen on the corresponding part of the scalp, vertically on the skull—I think the same blow caused the whole mischief—the piece of iron produced, would have caused it I believe.</p>

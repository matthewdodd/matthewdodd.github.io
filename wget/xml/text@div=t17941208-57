I was moving for other people till the India House took fire, and then our house catched fire immediately; I was not at home then, when with the few things that were taken out of the house there were these skins among others; there was a great many things I lost, a pretty large quantity of those were all lost, which way I cannot say, but they were all lost; they were taken down to Queen-street, where I now reside; but among these there were four skins laid at the office to be owned, Shadwell office, and I went and found they were mine, by the piece of satinet that was with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately before the fire had you seen them in your house? - They were in a drawer tied up together with a string, and put them rather on one side, I had seen them a few days before the fire, and had not sold them or touched them.</p>

             sworn.</p>

               <p>I have the property. I went down like many others at the fire at Ratcliffe, the 23d of July, between five and six in the evening. In going home I called at a public house at White Horse-street, Stepney, which I formerly kept, drinking a pot with a friend I heard the cry of stop thief; I immediately ran out of the house and saw the prisoner at the bar with a bundle in a blue apron under his arm, I stopped him and asked him what he had got there? he said, leather, and that he had found it in the street; I told him that I suspected he had stole it at the fire, and that I should detain him in custody, I took him into the house where I went out of, and a constable came in belonging to Stepney parish (his name is Germaine) then I told him I gave him charge of the prisoner at the bar, on suspicion of robbing some individual at the fire, and he had two examinations before justice Staples, then he was admitted to bail. On the 27th of November I had this summons sent me from justice Staples's, to give evidence concerning that property, which property when I left it at the police office it was sealed up. When I came to Shadwell office again it was opened to me, and there is one skin out of the four that I think to be the same property, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Whatever it was that the prisoner had got, it was wrapped up when you see it, and on your asking what it was, he told you it was leather? - He did, and said he found it.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find out who the owner of this leather was? - I did not until I was sent for to the police office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what the officers took from this man at the time they took him up? Did they take any money from him? - I took a guinea and three half-crowns from him.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the three half crowns are returned? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the guinea kept by Germaine? - The prosecutor lives in the neighbourhood and can give an account.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Mr. Germaine is very ill, I don't think he will live long at any rate.</p>
               <p>Q. to Gardiner. How far was this from the fire where you stopped the prisoner? - About one hundred yards from the fire at the time it was then burning.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my property, I can swear to it by the piece of satinet.</p>
               <p>Q. But without that can you swear to the leather? - Yes, by the particular spots.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did Germaine know where you lived? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What day did he come to you to enquire about it? - I think it was the second day, or two days afterwards. There were two or three shoemakers sent for besides, they did not own them and then they thought of me, on account of a mark that a leather seller or leather dresser knew, I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you attend the examination? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came it you did not own it then? - I did own it as soon as I came up to the office. The prisoner was discharged at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You have none of the gentlemen here who were assisting you in conveying<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179412080195"></xptr>these goods from your house to account how they carried them? - I have not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 10, Parker Street, Drury Lane—a few minutes before 11 o'clock at night, on 10th July, I came out of my house for some candles—the prisoner was on the step of her own door, No. 9—I got the candles, and was coming back again—I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in my hand—the prisoner knocked me down on my left side—I screeched out, and a young man, a companion of hers, came across the road, and put his hand on my mouth, and knocked two teeth out—I went to my own place and rested for a few minutes, and then went to Bow Street, and came back with an officer—she was on the step again, and I gave her in charge—I did not pick my teeth up, I was not able to pick myself up—she took my money from me, and the young man was with her—I am quite sure the prisoner is the woman.</p>

I stood at my door till the constable came. I never moved from the time she struck me; there was no one standing by what ever. I did not know she was giving me in charge for robbery. I know nothing about the money or candles, I never saw them."</p>

                  </hi>. I am Staff Sergeant of Pensioners, at Woolwich—on 10th May last, the prisoner came to my office—it was part of my duty at that time to enrol men in the Old Reserve—that office was regulated by the 30 &amp; 31 Vic., chapter 110—the qualifications are that the men, amongst other things, must have served in the army for not less than three months, and be in good bodily health, and produce a certificate, and be sent before the doctor—the prisoner represented himself to be George Williamson, of the 2nd battalion 2nd Foot—he was sent before a doctor—I wrote to his regiment, and received this certificate, signed by the sergeant of the regiment he stated he belonged to—I showed that to him, and he took it to the hospital with him—this attestation would be sworn by him—I ultimately paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as pay and bounty, and for necessaries—on 22nd Novem<lb></lb>ber, he came to the office again; he then asked to be re<lb></lb>enrolled in the New Reserve—he gave the name of George Williamson—ultimately he was given into custody, from information I received—I saw this document on 24th or 25th November—we did not observe until then that it was a forgery—that was the document he had to take before the surgeon in May—he would bring it back to me filled up, and it was shown to me before I paid the money to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did I produce a paper when I first applied to be enrolled in the reserve? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I enrolled you as George Williamson, upon the paper that was written from your regiment—you would have to wait five</p>

                  </hi>. I was a Sergeant of Pensioners at Woolwich, in the same office as Mr. Bleach—I saw the prisoner in the office on 10th May—he had been prior, and communication had been made with the regiment, and this document had been received back—he came to the office for the purpose of being enrolled in the Army Reserve, stating that he had bought his discharge, and we wrote to the 2nd Battalion 2nd Foot Regiment for this document—the whole of it, with the exception of the prisoner's signature and the doctor's, is in my writing—I took the prisoner with it to the Woolwich Police Court, and this is his signature attesting it—(<hi rend="italic">This contained a certificate of the surgeon, J. R. Reed, that he had ex<lb></lb>amined George Williamson, of the 2nd Battalion 2nd Regiment of Foot; and also a certificate from the Staff Officer, dated 9th May</hi>, 1870, <hi rend="italic">giving a descrip<lb></lb>tion of George Williamson, his character good, no badges for good conduct, cause of discharge, purchase, residence</hi> 2, <hi rend="italic">High Street, Woolwich, present occupation bricklayer, and was signed George Williamson, formerly of 2nd Battalion, and stated: "I declare that I have had read to me the foregoing, and am willing to serve Her Majesty for five years provided my services be required, and until fogally discharged, and I further declare that I do not belong to any other force, and have not been in any other class of the said Reserve Force</hi>")—The particulars which are filled in are got from the man himself, and from the history you have there—I don't know Dr. Read's signature.</p>

                  </hi>.

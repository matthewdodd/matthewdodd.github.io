I got up on the 12th of March, about half-past six o'clock, to open the shutters, as usual, and the first shutter stuck a little; the prisoner, who was a stranger to me, was walking about - he came and asked if he should assist in getting it down; he pulled a knife from his pocket, eased the shutter and I took it down - I had an opportunity of observing him; he walked up and down before the shop, and as he went by once, he rubbed his hands together, and said, "It is a cold morning, Sir" - On Saturday the 14th, I got up about half-past six o'clock, and found a hole had been bored in a shutter, about six inches diameter had been cut out: I missed a good deal of wearing apparel, which was five or six feet from the window, and could not be got out without something being put in - I have recovered best part of my goods.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live directly opposite Mr. Rushbrook. Two or three mornings before the 14th, I observed Mr. Rushbrook opening his shutters, and saw the prisoner there; I saw him take a knife from his pocket - he was walking about and continued to do so for some time afterwards; I am certain of his person- I heard of the robbery, and met the prisoner in Fleet-market. about six weeks after, in company with another man; I informed the prosecutor I had seen him.</p>

On the 14th of March, about half-past eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner in company with a woman, who was carrying a large bun<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160021"></xptr>dle; they were going out of Finsbury-square into Sun-street - I watched them nearly to Petticoat-lane; they walked as I considered in company together - I stopped the woman, and asked what she had got; at that moment the prisoner, who was in company with another man, turned round and went off, and I saw no more of him - the bundle contained the best part of this property; I did not see the prisoner again till the 19th of June, when he was going into Smithfield - I took him, and told him I took him for a burglary, committed in Leather-lane. Holborn; he said he knew nothing of it - I asked if he knew any thing about

            ; he said he did not - I searched his lodgings, and in a table drawer I found these three joints of a fishing rod, one skeleton-key, a phosphorus-box, and this hook; the joints screw into each other with a worm, and the book fastens in at the end - I found a fag end of blue cloth also.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you sure this is a skeleton-key? A. I should think it was; I conceive that he was in the woman's company - they were walking together; I was on the opposite side of the way, in Sun-street, and did not hear whether they talked - I saw them within three yards of each other; they might have been within two yards of each other - I never saw them nearer; I should have taken the prisoner, but he went off too quick - I knew him before; I went to different public-houses, to look for him - he told me where he lodged; the remnant of cloth is only a strip, an inch wide.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was he walking before and behind the woman? A. Yes, from the end of Sun-street, till they got into Petticoat-lane.</p>

            . Here is one of the coats I lost - the officer has returned me the other articles; I lost three yards of woollen cloth, worth 2l. - I have examined this remnant; it is the same colour and quality, as what I lost, but I cannot swear to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are there not millions of yards of that sort of cloth in the City? A. No doubt of it; the woman was tried last Session and acquitted - the prisoner never came to me to ask if I had any charge against him.</p>

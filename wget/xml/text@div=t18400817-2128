                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, and live at Pentonville. I am agent to Mr. William Easted, who is contractor for building some sewers at Westbourn-green, for which purpose some bricks, made by Herron and Rutter, at Cowley, were sent by the barges, on the Grand Junction Canal, to Paddington—the prisoner is a wharfinger and occupier of No. 8 wharf, at Paddington—we agreed with him to land at his wharf, to convey them to the works at Westbourne-green—he was to be paid 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a thousand for the wharfage—9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for unloading them, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for cartage—the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for wharfage was to be paid whether the bricks were merely carried across the wharf to the carts, or whether they were deposited if the carts were not ready—a barge in general holds twelve, fourteen, or sixteen thousand—I occasionally attended on the part of Mr. Easted to superintend the unloading of the barges, but I deputed my foreman, who generally at<lb></lb>tended, to see that the number unloaded corresponded with the barge ticket; and if they were right he wrote on the ticket, "Short tally"—the prisoner had no authority to sell any of those bricks—his business was to cart them forthwith to the work.</p>

               <p>for any bricks that were lost or stolen from that wharf—I made the con<lb></lb>tract with the prisoner alter hearing what the prices would be, that he should be paid after the rate of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per thousand for carting and un<lb></lb>loading these bricks, and for the wharfage—I did not depute Williams to make any agreement with him—I deputed him to ascertain from the differ<lb></lb>ent wharfingers their prices—I consider that the prisoner was to be an<lb></lb>swerable for whatever bricks could be proved to be landed on his wharf—he was to make them good to Mr. Easted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Easted under the direc<lb></lb>tion of Mr. Goode. It was my duty to attend the wharf when the bricks were brought there in barges till Whit Monday—when the bricks were landed the boat ticket came up with the boatmen—I ascertained that the number was right, and signed the ticket as "Received for Mr. Easted"—on the 24th of June I saw one of the prisoner's carts going down Pad<lb></lb>dington, loaded with Mr. Easted's bricks—I saw them delivered at Mr. Cheel's, in Charles-street, Manchester-square,—I followed the cart—I then went to Westbourne-green, where I saw Phillips, and we went to Mr. Cheel's place, and saw the bricks—we then went to the station-house, and then to the prisoner's—about three hours and a half had elapsed from the time I first saw the cart till I got to the prisoner's place—a man, whom I know perfectly well, was driving the cart—he was working for Mr. Skuse—when we saw Skuse he was in the street opposite the King and Queen public-house—he said, "I have taken 500 of your bricks for a man I do a great deal of work for, with the intention of returning them with 500 from Mr. Boyle's brick yard"—I said, "That is a <hi rend="italic">rummish</hi> way of doing business, as you have not acquainted me, it is a thing I durst not do of my own accord"—I told him the information I received from Mr. Cheel was quite opposite to that—we then went to the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was this all that happened? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said, "How do you do?"—he often promised he would send all the bricks fended for us Westbourne-green, and I have said to him "If any bricks are landed here for us, mind and don't get them intermixed," and he said, "What bricks are landed for you shall be sent to Westbourne-green, and there shall' be nothing diminished"—I asked him to be honest with the bricks, and bring them faithfully to our place—I believe I told him he was answer<lb></lb>able for all the bricks on the wharf.</p>

                  </hi>. I received a communication from Williams on the 24th of June, and I went with him to Mr. Cheers—after that we saw Skuse in the street—he said Mr. Cheel wanted the bricks to use, and it was too far to go to Mr. Boyle's field—he said he had taken 500 of our bricks away, and he meant to return them next morning.</p>

I am a builder, and live in Charles-street, Manches<lb></lb>ter-square—I went to the prisoner on the 22nd of June—I had often seen him before, but had not seen him then for perhaps a week—I did not order any bricks of him on the 22nd, but I saw some on his wharf, and asked him if he dealt in bricks—he said he dealt in any thing—I asked what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184008170156"></xptr>
               <p>he wanted for those bricks—he said 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a thousand—I asked him if they were delivered or fetched for that—he said delivered, I said very well, and told him I would take ten thousand if I had room to put them—he asked me if he should send me in five hundred that morning—I said, "No"—I did not tell him that I wanted bricks in a hurry and could not send as far as Boyle's field for them, nor any thing of the kind—I did not mention any place—he had been employed by me to fetch rubbish frequently—on the next day, the 23rd, I ordered him to send some carts for my rubbish, but I did not order any bricks—I cannot say, whether he sent any thing with the carts that day as I did not see them—I did not receive any bricks—nor have any been delivered on my premises at any time—there are five hundred bricks or more for what I know, deposited adjoining my premises, but not on them—they are put against a public house wall—they are marked with a crown I believe—I had not ordered any bricks to be sent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I have been for a great many years in the service of Mr. Defries—I principally keep the books. In Sept. last the prisoner was in his service as a traveller—it was his duty to collect orders and to receive money on account of his master, and when he received it to bring the money to Mr. Defries the day afterwards—that was the rule, except he went out of town, and then he accounted on his return—I know a customer named Dawkes—on the 20th of Sept. the prisoner came in, and said Mr. Dawkes wanted some cottons—Mr. Defries gave the prisoner one gross of soda cottons and one gross of other cottons to take to Mr. Dawkes—I booked them to George Forey—the next morning the prisoner came, and said he had left the two gross of cottons at Mr. Dawkes', in Shoreditch, and they were not paid for, and I booked them to Mr. Dawkes—the prisoner never paid me the money for them.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a naphtha-lamp manufacturer, and lives in Cambridge-road. We had dealings with Mr. Defries—I did not pay for any goods I had of him in Dec. last—I do not know whether I paid afterwards, or my husband—here is a receipt to this bill, which I believe is Mr. Forey's writing; but I was not there to see the bill receipted—I handed this bill to Mr. Defries; but I cannot say when—I can only suppose about two months ago—I found it amongst my receipts, and handed it to Mr. Defries.</p>

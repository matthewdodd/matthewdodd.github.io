                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker at 46, Mulgrave-place, Wool-wich I supply gunners in the Royal Artillery with boots—when a gunner wants a pair of boots he brings a request, signed either by the captain of the company or the pay-sergeant—I knew James Thomas as pay-sergeant and staff-sergeant in the Artillery—I used to deliver boots to gunners on the production of a document signed by him—we take the measure always; but if they are in a hurry for the boots we supply them if we have a pair that will fit them; we always keep a stock ready on purpose—on 7th September the prisoner came to my shop with this order (<hi rend="italic">read:</hi> "September 7th, 1859. Mr. Logan,—Please to make Gunner Andrews a pair of boots.—James Thomas, Staff-sergeant, R. A.")—that is the usual form in which they come to me—the prisoner was in uniform at the time; generally speaking, the order began "Please to make," sometimes, "Please to deliver"—"please to deliver" means, if you have them ready give them, but if not, not to make them—upon looking at the order I believed it to be a genuine one—I said to him, "I will take your measure;" he said he would have a pair at once, as he was very much in want of them—I then supplied him with a pair of the value of 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he took the boots away with him—I had never seen him at my shop before with an order for boots—I know a person of the name of Cornelius Horgan, a gunner in the Royal Artillery—upon 19th September he came into my shop and gave me this order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—upon the production of that order I delivered Horgan a pair of boots, and he took them away—I afterwards gave up the two orders to police-constable Newell.</p>

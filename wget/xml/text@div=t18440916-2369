I sent in some furniture to the house in Roehampton-lane—some of it belonged to myself—I sent in a van load of furniture—among it was a mattress, value 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and another mattress, not intended for sale, was sent to protect a glass—the mattress was lot 41—when the mattress was brought before the company, I said that was not the mattress—I said so publicly to the porters in the room—I said so to the prisoners—I said, "That is not the right mattress, but we will sell it, as you have brought it"—I made no observation about the other mattress at that time—next day, as soon as I arrived at the place, I asked the prisoners what had become of the mattress—they said they knew nothing about it—I thought the mattress might have gone away, and went to search for it—I went to Barnes, to my son—I got no information about it, and returned to the sale-room—I bad sent for a constable to give the men into custody on the previous charge, and while he was talking to me, Pond brought the mattress up to me, and put it into the house—I gave him into custody for stealing it—I do not recollect whether he said anything—I had charged him with taking the mattress be<lb></lb>fore—this is it—it is the one which was intended for sale, and I am certain it was sent—I saw it put into the cart, and afterwards saw it at the auction-room.</p>

On the 22nd of Aug., about half-past six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners—they had something with them—I do not know what it was—it was wrapped up in a wrapper—I did not take particular notice of it—I could not tell whether it was a mattress or a bed—it looked like something of that sort—Pond said they were going to the Parcel Delivery Company—I said, "Why not give it to our carrier?"—he was going to take the bundle he had on his shoulder—I went with him to Webb, the carrier, and said, "Webb, I have recommended these men to you with this parcel"—I did not hear the prisoners say anything—they left the parcel at the carrier's—it was put into the cart—I do not know whether they told the carrier where to take it to—I never heard them say a word to the carrier, that I know of—I returned with them to Mr. Lyne Stephens'to take down some curtains which I was employed to do that morning—I saw nothing more.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Barnes, and am the carrier from Barnes to London. On the 22nd of Aug. Strudwick came to my place with two men who were strangers to me—I did not notice them enough to swear to them—they said they brought this mattress to go to London, they were going to take it to the Parcel's Delivery, but Strudwick had brought them to me—I told them to put it into the cart—they did not say where they brought it from—there was a direction on it—I have not got that direction—it went with the parcel—the mattress was afterwards fetched away about eleven, I believe by Pond—I saw him—he said it was the wrong mattress—he left the wrapper to go according to the direction—it went up to London with the cart—I did not go with it—I was at home that day—I did not myself take it anywhere.</p>

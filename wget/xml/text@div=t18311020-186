On the 11th of October I went out, leaving the door of my room locked, and the window open; it opens on a place by which any one may pass from the room occupied by the prisoner - the prisoner was at home when I went out; on unlocking my door I found my room in confusion; the wood of the window cill was broken, and the things strewed about the room - I missed three frocks from the drawers; I had left a chair against the drawers, and that was removed - when I went into my room the prisoner was getting out of my window; I said to him, "Lodge, what have you been after?" he said to get a light - I went down, and fetched my husband's brother; in going down I saw the prisoner had no light in his room, but he had a fire - he was taken the same evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Were all these goods in the shop at the time he lived with you?</p>
               <p>Rooke. They were.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176105060009"></xptr>Q. When did you lose them?</p>
               <p>Rooke. I lost some about last Christmas was a twelve-month, and the rest before he went from me. The latter part of last summer he had hired a coach for a day, and he went down to Greenwich; it cost him 8 s. I thought he could not come honestly by the money, so I turned him away. I found him in cloaths, but he had no wages from me, but he often had a shilling given him, and he had some perquisites in the shop. I had missed, while he was with me last summer, a quantity of corded tabby, a piece of green, and a piece of blue ducape, 10 or 11 yards of blue sattin, 13 yards of striped lutestring, and 13 yards of white damask. About 9 or 10 weeks ago Mrs. Ward, a neighbour of mine, came and begged I would take him again. I had hired a servant that I liked, and I did not chuse to turn him away to take Charles again. After that this servant did not please me, I turned him away and took Charles again a second time. On the 14th of April last my sister discovered one of my ruffled shirts on his back, and informed me of it; and, the evening before I had missed a piece of alamode silk that was to have been sent to Whitechaple, then I told him I thought he had taken it; he said any other of my servants might take it as well as he; and, that he knew nothing of it. I told him I would go to Mr. Fielding and get a warrant; he said, very well, as I thought proper. I went and got a warrant and took him up. When I had the constable in the shop, I told him I missed several things, and desired he would confess if he had taken any thing, he confessed he had taken the alamode silk. When we came before Mr. Fielding I asked him if he had any thing else, he said there were one or two more things. He had taken a lodging on the back of my house the week before. Mr. Fielding granted me a warrant to search the lodging, and another to search the prisoner Clay's mother's lodging. They were going to be married. I found the piece of alamode silk in his lodgings, in a mahogony chest of drawers; a piece of gray stuff, a piece of drab coloured camblet, 2 sattin boards, and 2 rollers that we roll silk upon, a remnant of hessian brown linnen, 2 pair of cotton stockings, a black sattin hat that he said Clay had cut off from a piece of black sattin that was in the drawer. There were a great number of houshold goods which he had bought with money made of my goods. In Clay's lodging I found 2 yards of brown camblet, all these my property. Mrs. Ward came to me at Mr. Fielding's, and told me she had stopped a piece of black velvet, a piece of blue, a piece of black, and a piece of pink coloured silk, which Miller brought. I lost 71 yards of ruby persian, and found 61 yards of it at Mr. Hall's, a pawnbroker, I found a piece of green tabby at Mrs.

            's. I lost 35 yards, Mrs. Brown had sold some of it.</p>

               <p>Q. How much did you find there?</p>
               <p>Rooke. I believe I found 12 or 13 yards there, and I found 13 yards of pink tabby, which Mrs. Brown had sold to Mr. Wigdon. I found 36 yards of yellow ducape at Mrs. Ward's. She is a mercer, and deals in silk. I found 9 yards of sattin, and about 4 yards of black velvet, and 16 or 17 yards of blue corded tabby, and a quantity of pink sattin; I don't know the exact quantity. The next that I found was at Mr. Brook's, a pawnbroker, he came and shewed me a piece of silk, about 46 yards, my property, it was blue and white tobine. Other silks I found at Mark David's, a jew.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he a pawnbroker.</p>
               <p>Rooke. No, he is not. I went there after they had made their confessions. He told me he had sold those goods to

I found a quantity of green ducape, and a quantity of green sattin, pawned at Mr. Ealing's, a pawnbroker; at Mr. Fryer's, a pawnbroker, I found a quantity of green stuff, a quantity of white stuff, some drab camblet, a quantity of black sattin. All those pieces found at those places are mine, I saw them at Mr. Fielding's, and swore to them as my property.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you charge Miller?</p>
               <p>Rooke. It will be proved he brought them to the people. Spruce confessed before Mr. Fielding to the taking almost all of them. After I had charged him with taking them all, he recollected as far as he could of them, and owned to the taking the greatest part of the things mentioned in the indictment, and a great many more that I cannot find, he then discovered that Miller was concerned in the affair; and he has owned the same to me several times since.</p>

            . I keep a shop in the Strand, and another on the back of St. Clement's. When I went to my shop in the Strand, I found three pieces in a chair that I sit in, in my parlour, a blue, pink, and a black piece, and Miller stood by the chair. I said, friend, these are yours, are they? He said, madam, I am a dealer, and lived in Vinegar yard some time ago, and they are very honestly come by; they are a person's silks that wants money. I asked him what he asked a yard for them, (the black is uncut velvet) he asked for the blue silk 4 s. a yard. I said, what do you ask for the uncut velvet? he said 8 s. I said, what for the pink? he said, seven and six pence. I said, friend, you look like a very honest man, but I cannot tell every body by their looks; pray tell me how you came by these silks. He said, very honestly. I stopped them, and advertised them, here is the paper they are advertised in ( Producing a daily paper.) He left the goods, and went away, and came with two men, and demanded the goods. I would not let him have them, and then he served my husband with a copy of a writ. I went to Justice Fielding, Mr. Rooke was there. I desired him to go to my house, and look at the goods, there was

               <p>Q. What did you give a yard for it?</p>
               <p>M. Kinnersley. I gave 4 s. a yard for it. I asked him how he came by it, he said, he bought it of a person that wanted money; he said, he had been a dealer, and had lived in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176105060011"></xptr> Vinegar-yard. I sent to Mrs Hanks, to know if she recommended the persons that came to me.

On the 10th or 11th of April, Miller brought me this piece of silk, and asked me four guineas upon it; I asked him several questions, and suspected he did not come honestly by it, and I stopped it till four in the afternoon. He desired I would let him go, and he could bring a person to his character at that time; then he brought justice Bedwell's son to vouch for him, then I lent him the money he wanted. In two or three days after, I heard Mr. Rooke had been robbed. I went to him, and asked him if he had lost any silk, he said yes. I told him I had a piece of this colour, and who I took it of.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I told Mr. Brooks, I had lost such a pattern, and described it to him before I saw it.</p>
               <p>Brooks. I was before Mr. Fielding, there I saw Miller, I swore to him, as the person that brought the silk to me, and related the circumstances that I have just mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asked how he came by it?</p>
               <p>Brooks. He was; but he did not assign any reason how he came by it; he only said, he pledg'd it with me.</p>

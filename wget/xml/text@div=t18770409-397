On 3rd March, in consequence of information, I went with Francis, another officer, to Cox's shop—I saw Mrs. Cox and had some conversation with her—I looked behind the counter and under it I found three bags containing lead concealed under a quantity of rags—I sent Francis to fetch Cox, who came; he made some motion to his wife, and then sitting on the stairs he said "Did not I buy this lead of a man named Smith?"—she said "Yes, you did, and you know nothing at all about it"—I asked him for a description of Smith—he said "A tall, big man, four or five inches taller than myself"—Francis said he would charge him with receiving the lead, knowing it to be stolen, and took him to the station—I afterwards went to 20, Old King Street, where Winch lives; I found him in bed, about 11 o'clock—I told him I wanted him to come to the station with me, I did not tell him what for—he got up and dressed himself and accompanied me part of the way till we got to the stable where the lead was stolen from, he looked up and smiled—I said "Cox tells me he has not paid you for it"—he said "If Cox has said so, it is a d——lie, he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it"—I took him to the station, where he was seen by Mr. and Mrs. Cox—Cox said he was the man—Mrs. Cox said to the best of her belief he was—he made no reply—I have seen the prisoners in company on many occasions—I weighed the lead, there was 2 cwt. I qr. 8 lbs.; I took a portion of it to the Cattle Market and compared it with the roof and it tallied.</p>

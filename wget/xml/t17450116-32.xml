            . The Prisoner put two firkins of butter into my boat, and told me, if I would tell him where to sell them, he would give me half a crown. I carried him to King Edward's stairs at Rotherhith to Mrs. Sheppard's; and by the persuasion of the Prisoner she bought one. He told her the vessel was taken by the French, and that they gave each of the men two sirkins of butter towards their wages.</p>

            . Milberry and the Prisoner came to me, and by a great many persuasions I bought a firkin of the Prisoner, and gave him 16 s. for it. He told me the ship was taken by the French, and that he had the butter in part of his wages; he said, we sailors seldom make dry bargains, and asked if he should send for a bottle of wine, but I refused it: it was marked R.

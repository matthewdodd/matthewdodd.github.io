My master gave me three 1l. notes and 20s. in silver, in a piece of paper. I went with him as far as Dean-street; he took me down Mead's-court, in a dark place, and told me to wait five minutes till he brought the note from his uncle; he returned in about five minutes, and gave me a piece of paper. The wine stood on the ground; he snatched the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140048"></xptr>money out of my hand, and ran away, leaving the win behind.

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live at Low Layton, in Essex. On the 18th of Feb. I lost two legs of mutton from the front of my shop—I saw them safe between six and seven o'clock that evening—I after<lb></lb>wards saw one of them, when it was found by the policeman—about one that day Howton came to my shop for a pound of beef steaks—I saw him afterwards at the Three Blackbirds public-bouse, nearly opposite my shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Lion and Key. On the evening of the 18th of Feb., between eight and nine o'clock, I saw Howton in ray tap-room—I did not see him come in—about a quarter of an hour afterwards Bryant came in with a leg of mutton under his arm, in a handkerchief—the shank end of it was exposed—he stopped ten minutes, drank with Howton, then went out, and returned in about a quarter of an hour—he had nothing with him then that I saw—he went away—Howton stayed till a quarter or twenty minutes to eleven—he then left—when I had occasion to close my house I went out and saw Howton hanging about my fence—I asked what he was hanging about there for—he said there was a haunch of venison in my skittle-ground, and I might have it—I said I would have nothing to do with it, and he went away—the policeman and I went to my skittle ground and found a leg of mutton.</p>

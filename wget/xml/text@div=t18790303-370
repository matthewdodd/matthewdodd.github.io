                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector, Scotland Yard</hi>). On 6th November, at 1 o'clock, I went to 1, Jefferson Street, Bromley-by-Bow—I was aware that Inspector Roots had been there—a woman opened the door—I was with Inspectors Robson and Dowdell—I told her we were police<lb></lb>officers—she went into the back parlour—I followed her, and saw part of a printing press, some lithographic stones, and other machinery—she suddenly ran upstairs; I followed her, and in the first-floor front room I found the two prisoners—I spoke to them in English and German; Trojanowski</p>

               <p>answered me—I told him we were police-officers, and had come there to search for the machinery for the manufacture of Russian rouble notes—he said "I know nothing at all about it; the machine was brought here by two foreigners who I don't know"—he afterwards said to me in German, "About two weeks ago a Mrs. Artiss came and said that some machinery was on the way; the machinery soon afterwards arrived, and soon after<lb></lb>wards Szumowski came"—a little while afterwards he said "I knew that the machinery and other implements which Szumowski brought to the house were intended for the manufacture of Russian rouble notes"—I took them both to Bow Police-station, where they were charged—I afterwards examined the lithographic stones, and on two or three of them found impressions of Russian notes—I assisted in searching the house; Roots has a list of things found—I was present on the 29th when Szumowski was arrested; Russian rouble notes were found on him—I don't know how many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said at the police-court that Trojanowski said "I knew that the implements he brought were used for forging"—that may have been seven or eight minutes after he said that he was innocent of it—he said that quite voluntarily, without any question on my part—I found no forged notes there—I found no ink—I did not search the room—I do not know what Roots and Dowdell found—I first heard of these forgeries on 26th October, when the case was placed in my hands—I began to watch the prisoners on the 28th—I saw the press in a downstairs room; it was taken to pieces—the impression on the stones was faint—the room in which I found the press was not the room in which I found the prisoners; they were upstairs—Seikrist said nothing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Russian, and am in the Metropolitan Police Force—on 6th November I assisted in taking the prisoners from Scotland Yard to Greenwich Police-station—on the way Seikrist said to me in German, "Will you come and have something to drink? you need not be afraid to drink with me; I am an innocent man; I am innocent of the whole affair; I have only been in this country three weeks, and I have known Szumowski for some considerable time abroad; he has written to me to come over to this country to print Russian false rouble notes, but owing to some diagree<lb></lb>ment between Szumowski and Trojanowski I have not worked them yet; unfortunately I have destroyed all the letters"—he further said that he was a lithographic printer and a gardener by trade, and he worked at whichever he got first—I told Inspector Dowdell the statement he made—I did not drink with him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in the Metropolitan Police since 1869—1, have been engaged in attempting to detect these forgeries since October and November—I did not during that time watch the movements of the men who have pleaded guilty, nor do I know who did—I was not in the Russian police before I came here—Dowdell does not understand German—Siekrist made the statement voluntarily—I am sure he said they were aware that the machine was brought there for the purpose of forging Russian rouble notes.</p>

I know Szumowski and Pfeiffer, who have pleaded guilty to-day—I kept observation on them two or three months in 1877—I also know Seikrist, and have seen him in the company of Szumowski and Pfeiflfer—I first saw him in their company about the beginning of May, 1877—since April and May, 1877, I have not seen them until they were in custody—Seikrist and Szumowski were continually together; they lived together.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 27, Red Lion Square—I was for many years a lithographer, and have a thorough practical knowledge of the business in all its branches—I have seen the lithographic apparatus produced by the police—I saw it put up at Scotland Yard as it would be for working—it was complete, and had been used—the tubes of colour would be used for printing what are called tints, not for opaque colours—I have seen all the Russian rouble notes in these packets taken from Szumowski; they are lithographed—if a person wanted to make those notes he would require a lithographic press and lithographic stones—all these in the packet "GR" are from stones and from the same stones, and the same in both packets—I have seen what would be a makeshift for a copperplate press; it was not made for one—it could be applied for taking transfers of small pieces such as these, because these might be engraved on a separate plate, and then a very small press would do to take a transfer and put them together, but I do not know whether it has been used for that purpose—another application to which it might be made would be for glazing the papers when finished—I have examined the eight lithographic stones produced by the police, and numbered them as I examined them—on stone No. 1 there are tints from the printing of six one-rouble notes—the border and the corner of the note I could trace very distinctly—I am perfectly certain that is the same kind of border and corner as is used in a genuine Russian one-rouble note; it is an exact counterpart, the same size and length and breadth—I could not, of course, trace the fine design, that would be impossible—on stone No. 2 I found the lettering of these one-rouble notes—I could</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187903030058"></xptr>
               <p>trace all the letters of line 5, letter for letter—the formations of each are peculiar; in lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 the type was similar—I could not trace the individual letters except by the space that they occupied—the ornamental Fin line 1 I can swear to—then on stone No. 3 there were six impressions or designs for the back of a rouble note, that is, for six notes—I could see distinctly the devices between the tablets containing the figure 1, and I could see the 1 inside—I could see them sufficiently to measure that there were the same distances between—the border was the same size, and there was the small type beneath the tablets, which I could see occupied the same space and was the same lettering—on stone No. 4 there were only three impressions—they were all different—all I could see upun them was the border of the back of a one-rouble note—it is my belief that those three were the originals from which other transfers were made, so that they could be renewed—all these four stones, 1, 2, 3, and 4, had the old work not merely ground off, but they were quite clean and nicely grained, and in a fit state to receive new work; you might have drawn a portrait upon them—No. 5 was polished fit for use—I could not discover anything upon that; it was merely polished—the first process in rubbing a stone off is to take coarse sand or pumice stone—in this instance pumice stone had been used—there may have been something upon it before, because a new stone would not be delivered in that state—I can tell the difference between a new stone and an old stone—this had been used, and the process of taking it off had been gone through—stone No. 6 was grained ready for use—I was not successful in tracing what had been upon it, but it had been used; I am certain of that; it had been polished down and grained—sand is sifted through a sieve, generally from 90 to 120 to the square inch, it would be the finest of these, and it would be absolutely necessary to put ink work on such a face—the sand is all one size—it is thrown over the stone, and another small piece of stone with some water is rubbed over it very carefully—that is called graining—a good grainer com<lb></lb>mands good wages—sea sand is not sifted at all—it is merely to cut it down—there is great danger of the work coming up in the next printing, and you may sacrifice 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of work—sea sand is used to take sufficient surface off the stone before beginning the graining—I used myself to take a very coarse instrument and make a gash across the stone, so that I should be sure the old work was ground off—graining is a delicate process of preparing the surface for the next work after being ground down—I do not think that sea sand had been used on these stones—stone No. 7 any one may see has been used for a black slab to spread black printing-ink upon it—No. 8 appears to have had three tints—those tints were rather larger than the one-rouble note itself, but it ia necessary they should be larger—in a one-rouble note the tints extend beyond the paper—(<hi rend="italic">Looking at the back</hi>) it extends right over to the outer edge of the paper—it is necessary the tint should be larger than the note, and the paper is larger when first printed than in its present state, so that when the edge of the paper is trimmed you cut the margin clean—you could not print it if it was the same size; it would be always spoiling the next note—they are cut after they are printed—the paper produced is exactly the size to allow for the cutting; just a little larger than the notes—it would require to be a little larger; you could not print exactly to the edge; it would always be slipping, and spoil the next note it came over—stone No. 8 is only polished, and in a dirty state—the quickest way of erasing the impression is with a piece of pumice stone; the most effectual way is to grain down with sand.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On Nos. 1, 2, and 3 the impressions were of a one-rouble note—Nos. 5, 6, and 7 I cannot tell whether they referred to a one-rouble note or not—No. 7 was only an ink slab—No. 4 was the back of a one<lb></lb>rouble note; there were three different impressions, one the back, one the front, and the other something else—I can swear that one was the back—5, 6, and 8 I could not distinguish—6 and 8 had been used—black ink would be necessary for making the notes; no black ink has been found—varnish would be necessary, but none has been found—there must have been black ink, or there could not have been the black ink slab—there was no palette knife or scraper—I missed a great many necessaries—the material for printing a perfect note were not all there, but a very long way towards it—I cannot say that any of the notes produced were made from the stones I saw, but the stones had been used to produce notes exact facsimiles of the Russian one-rouble notes—there is no doubt about that—the paper that might be made into a ten-rouble note is larger than the note—it might be used for anything else—I cannot tell the exact size of paper for a ten-rouble note—if the same size as a one-rouble note the same size paper would be required.</p>

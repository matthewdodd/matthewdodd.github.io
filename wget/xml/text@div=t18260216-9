            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Tretfield and Lawrence, leather-factors. On the 3d of February I was at work with Nash, in Leadenhall-market - I saw the prisoner take a pair of horns from this pile, near the Lamb public-house, and put them under his apron - he went away towards Mr. Osborn's warehouse; I told Nash, who went after him - I went in afterwards, and found a pair of horns behind a pile of leather.</p>

            . I was with Sanders, about a quarter before five o'clock in the afternoon; I followed the priso<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160014"></xptr>>ner into Osborn's warehouse, and saw him throw a pair of horns, from under his apron, behind the leather; I spoke to him - he appeared rather agitated, and said "Don't say any thing about it; I took the horns, and I can't deny it - I will never touch a horn again;" I said, "I don't know whose they are?" he said, "I know they are Mr. Smith's."</p>

            . I took the prisoner on Saturday last, at the King's Arms, public-house, Leadenhall-street; Mr. Lawrence said, "We want you - you know what it is for Bill - I should not have thought of your robbing us, as you are set to watch others;" he said, "I never took a horn out of the market in my life."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going across the market, and threw a pair of horns into the warehouse; I did not know they were Mr. Smith's till Mr. Nash said there are no horns put in there, nothing but leather, and I know that Mr. Leaf Hooper had forty-eight heads put in there that day.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS NASH re-examined. Q. Is that a place for horns to be put? A. It is not, but they are put there almost every day.</p>

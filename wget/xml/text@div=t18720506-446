                  </hi>. I am a printer, at 7, Manor Street, Lambeth—my father is agent for 14, Manor Street, where the prisoners resided—on Saturday last at 9.45 at night, in consequence of a communication, I went there and saw the two prisoners in the down stairs room; the male prisoner was at the window and the female at the foot of the bed—the room was all one red glow, and full of smoke; the bedding, mattress, sheet, and counterpane were all in one red glow—I did not say anything to the prisoners, or they to me; I went and got some water and put the fire out—the prisoners did not assist</p>

               <p>me at all—after putting it out I said to the man "What is the cause of this fire?"—he said "My wife lit a match and set fire to it;" she said "No, I did not, it was you; you want to put it on me because my mother has been in the madhouse twice"—he replied "Let the b—things burn, and burn the bitch"—that was all that took place—the woman's face seemed covered with blood—they were both the worse for liquor, the female was the worst—they were not so drunk as not to know what they were about—the inspector came in and they were taken in charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> They were both drunk—the man said "My wife did it with a match"—I could not discover whether there was any smell of tobacco in the room; there was too much smoke; the woman's face was covered with blood, as if from a blow—I did not see whether any of her clothes were scorched, I did not examine them—Mr. Brooks said the furniture was their own.</p>

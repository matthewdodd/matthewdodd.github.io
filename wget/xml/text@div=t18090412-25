               <p>Q. When had you last seen your things safe - A. It is five weeks next Monday; on that night at half past twelve o'clock I was going to bed, I pushed my door open and found my box broken open and a man's waistcoat in my box; I took this waistcoat into the garret to ask Mr. Woodruff if this waistcoat belonged to him, and when I came up to the bed the prisoner was under the bed; she creeped from under the bed; she had neither cap, handkerchief or shoes on.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of her - A Mr. Woodruff demanded her to go out of the house; when she was coming down stairs I went to her and pulled a shift of mine from under her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know nothing of this woman at all - A. I never saw her before. Her cap and apron I found in my box, her bonnet and shoes were at the head of Mr. Woodruff's bed; my room is the two pair of stairs room, Mr. Woodruff's is the garret.</p>

            . On the evening of the 27th of March, about half past twelve o'clock, I went up to bed, I began to undress myself, I heard somebody under the bed; the girl came up, she said Mr. Woodruff is that your waistcoat; I said who is there; I had an old sword, I drew it. I told them whoever it was to come out; the prisoner creeped from under the bed, she said a young man was to meet her there, he said he lived in the room. Nobody sleep in that room but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she sober - A. I cannot say, she said she was tipsy. We found the staple of the girl's box as if sawed through.</p>

I have two small children; my husband is out of employ and a cripple; I went out that night to get a shilling by prostitution; I went up Seacoal lane, a young man told me to go up into the garret of that house and when the house was quiet he would come up; after I had been there a little while that young man came up, he asked me what I wanted; he swore he would cut me in two if I did not speak; he dragged me down stairs; my clothes came off with his dragging me down stairs.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor applied to me - I went with him to the house where I found the prisoner in the room; these trous were on the bed, very wet; the prisoner said she did know how they came there.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How came I to be acquitted from Bow-street for a whole week, and then taken again?</p>
               <p>DAVID GEORGE ALDERSON re-examined. There was sufficient evidence at first, and she was discharged; the prosecutor came again, and said the prisoner and her friends been abusing him very much, and Mrs. Earl would con forward; I then went and took the prisoner again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Blythe said he would take 12s. for the del but my husband could not get it, so I was taken again - my husband signed a paper at Bow-street - it was to be settled for 12s.</p>

            . No, that is not true; I deny it altogether.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any payment of 12s. to be made? There was no payment no promise, except that the office should not lose his expenses.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you to have the money? A. The officer to have it, and he did not part with the trousers till be g his pay.</p>
               <p>DAVID GEORGE ALDERSON re-examined. Q. What were you to have 12s.? A. No, my Lord; I did refuse give up the trousers - I said I had lost two days in looking after another girl, and I asked 7s. for the two days.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you a salary as an officer? A. I have only 2s. 6d. a night - I am a night officer - I am paid by people for what I do in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Halls aware of that? A. Yes, he is, my Lord - I took the other girl by the prosecutor's description- she was taken before the Magistrate, and denied knowledge of it, and went away about her business - Mr. Earl came and gave her evidence, and then the prisoner was taken again.</p>
               <p>Q. How comes it that 12s. was to be paid? A. That know nothing about; but after the prisoner was discharged I looked to the prosecutor for 7s.</p>
               <p>JURY to T. BLYTHE. Q. How came the sum to be 12s. A. Why, I did not know what the expenses might be; I said it might be 1l., I did not know - the prisoner's husband said, I must be as favourable as I could; and I said,"Bring what you can, only show yourself a man;" I did not then know what the officer's charge would be.</p>

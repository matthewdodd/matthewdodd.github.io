            , and live at Wattleton Farm, Beaconsfield. On the 7th of September I had a bay gelding for which I gave 20 l. I was called up about one o'clock in the morning, and went to the meadow where my horse was placed overnight. I found the gate of the meadow broken, and the horse gone. I immediately went home, saddled a horse, and started instantly in pursuit of it. I took the London road, and came up with the prisoner on Ealing Common, 17 miles from Beaconsfield; he was riding my bay gelding, and leading a black poney; mine was the largest horse of the two. This was about half-past three o'clock; I had started from Beaconsfield at two; I had rode very hard all the way: the knees of my breeches were left unbuttoned in my hurry of dressing. I asked him if he was going to London; he said he was. I asked where he came from; he said from below Birmingham. He seemed to look a good deal at the knees of my breeches not being buttoned, and noticed me. He then began to say that he had not had the horses long in his possession; that a gentleman on an iron-grey horse put them into his hand. I asked where he was going to take them; he said to the sign of the Nag's Head, in Oxford Street. I had not told him that one of them was mine, as I wished to keep him in conversation until somebody came to assist me. He drew on one side of the road, and observed that he taken some beer at Uxbridge which did not agree with him, and he must get off. He jumped off the horse: I wheeled round and caught him by the collar. He struggled a good deal. I told him he had got my horse; he being on the ground, got me off the saddle; I continued to struggle with him, I was obliged to loose him, and while I was recovering my seat, he mounted the black pony and went off at full speed. I followed, and when he got about two hundred yards. I caught him by the collar. I drove him into Acton; he then turned to the left up a bye road. I caught him by the tail of his coat, and should have pulled him off the horse, but the tail gave way; his coat came off in my hands. He went off again at full speed, and got into the turnpike road again. I kept close to him all the way; I caught him by the collar about two hundred yards from Acton; he instantly dismounted and jumped over a hedge into a field; I got off my horse and caught him about forty or fifty yards off; and gave him in charge to the watchman of Acton. I am certain the gelding he was riding is mine, it is now at home. I bought it in August.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. BRODRICK. Q. Do you live with your father? - A. I do. The horse works in his business, and eats his corn; but I bought it with my money, intending to sell it. It is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got up in the night did you see a parcel of horses running about the street - A. No; the man who called me said there were horses running about. My horse was too heavy to leap, and not likely to attempt it; if he did he might break the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not likely if he heard horses about that he would jump over after them - A. He was not likely to leave the horses in the field which he was accustomed to. When I came up with the prisoner, he was going at a jog trot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he was to have 7 s. for taking them the sign of the Nagg's Head public-house. - A. No. When I seized him, it was evident that I was going to take him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you that if you enquired at the turnpike, you would find he had come through alone? - He said nothing of the sort in my presence. He said he did not know the man who gave him the horses.</p>

            . I live at Mr. Rolfe's, and take care of the horses; on the evening of the 6th of September about seven o'clock, I put eight horses into my masters close; this bay gelding was one of them. About two o'clock the next morning, I went to the close, seven horses were there, but the bay gelding was missing; the gate was broken in two in the middle at the top bar; it was locked the night before. There is a high hedge all round the field.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The top bar was broken; if an awkward beast tried to get over, he was very likely to break it? - A. Yes. I saw the gelding again next day; it was brought home. Beaconsfield is on the Birmingham road.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say if you enquired at the turnpike, you would find he came through alone? - A. No; he said a man employed him to take the horse and pony to the Tagg's or Nagg's Head public-house, he did not know which, and he was to have 7 s. for it. That he had never been in London but once, which was about four years ago. There is such a parish as Ealing or Zealing in Middlesex.</p>

I went on; a post-chaise overtook me, and I rode to Uxbridge - walked on about four miles by a hay cart; a gentleman overtook me, and we fell into conversation. I said I was a horse-dealer; he said he wanted to buy a horse; I asked him where he lived, and I would bring him one; he gave me his card. He left me, and up came a man with three horses, and asked me to take them on with the cart. I said I did not belong to the cart, but that man did; he said he would treat me with a pot of beer, and the man took some with me. He gave me 7 s. at the public-house door, leaving the two horses with me, and went on on an iron-grey one, and in about half an hour the prosecutor came up and asked about the horses, and when I got down he went to catch hold of me, and when he took me into custody, the watchman came; I said if they would let me stop outside the door, I would shew them the parties who could prove it when they came by.</p>

            . I am a carpenter and builder, and live at No. 5, Gloster-place, Vauxhall-walk. On the 6th of September I was coming from Uxbridge towards town, and overtook the prisoner; I believe he is the man; he was walking alongside a hay cart. I did not know him before. I got into conversation with him; he said he was a horse-dealer; I said I wanted to buy a horse, but was in no particular hurry. I gave him my card, and kept with him till he came to the toll-bar; he had no horse with him then. They called to a man to open the bar, but I walked on, and stopped at a public-house at Ealing, I think it was called the Green-man; and while I was in the room, the prisoner came up to the house; he took some beer out to a man who was there with two horses, and rode another; they had some conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go out to see what sort of horses they were? - No; it was not my business. I was at the door, and had some porter with them there. I heard the man say he wanted the horses sent to town, and saw him pull out a red bag, and give the prisoner some money; the prisoner took the two horses. I walked on and saw no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the prisoner an old acquaintance? - A. I never saw him in my life before or since. He said he was coming to London, but did not say where.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him with two horses, did you not say,</p>
               <p>"You may as well let me ride one?" - A. No; I am not fond of riding bare-backed horses. I should know the man again who gave him the horses. They were talking together before I went to the door; but the moment he got the horses, he finished the beer and rode off. I had no further conversation with him. The other man went in the same direction. I have not seen the prisoner since until to-day. I gave him my card, and said I wanted a horse about thirteen hands high; and if he should have one, I would see it. The prisoner was by the side of the hay cart, and the driver on the top of it. I am a master builder. I wanted a horse to draw old materials. I had a cart and horse last year, and sold it in October, as it was a bad one; and was without one after that. I gave him a written card which I had about me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is this the card you gave him? - 
               <persName id="t18240916-184-person1552">A. </persName>
            (looking at it) It is my writing. I forgot to tell you, that the prisoner, when the man gave him the horses, told me he was coming to the Nagg's Head, Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you not say a few minutes ago, that you did not speak to the prisoner after he got the horses? - A. I said not a moment after. I had the beer in my hand when the gentleman rode off; he then said he was going to the Nagg's-head; I wished him good bye, and walked on; he told me it was the Nagg's-head. When I first saw him, he was about a mile and a half from Uxbridge; he was then walking by the side of the cart. A man was laying down in the cart; he is not the man who gave the prisoner the horses. I walked with him by the side of the cart, about a mile; he had no horse then. I was in the tap-room of the public-house; he came into the passage; the gentleman was at the door, and did not come in. The prisoner came and asked me to come and have some beer with them; they were drinking at the door. They had been in conversation (before I came to them) about taking the horses to town; the man on horseback said,</p>

               <p>"Very well then, it is all settled; and I now give them up to you." He then pulled out a bag, and gave him some money; I did not see how much.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of the two horses saddles on? - A. I do not know.</p>

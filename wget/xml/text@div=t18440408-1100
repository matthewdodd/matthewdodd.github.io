On the 9th of March a clerk came to me at the Custom-house—I went with him to No. 9, Mark-lane, and found the prisoner Coyle there—I did not write this note, and know nothing of it—I asked Coyle who gave him the note—he said a man named Sands—I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Charles Wass and Co., No. 9, Mark-lane. On the 9th of March Coyle came to the counting-house, and said he was sent by Mr. Reilly with this note for the money—I did not give him the money, not considering it true—I fetched Mr. Reilly—Coyle told me Mr. Reilly had sent him with the note, and I should find him at Nicholson's Wharf; but I found him at the Custom-house—(<hi rend="italic">note read</hi>)— Sir, Will you have the goodness to send a sovereign by bearer for me, as I have a few charges to pay; and, being short of cash, I shall take it as a great favour. I will return it to-morrow. L.</p>

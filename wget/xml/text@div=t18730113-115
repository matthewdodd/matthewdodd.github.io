                  </hi>. I live at 12, Great Windmill Street, Hay<lb></lb>market, and am a waiter—I was married to the prisoner about eleven years ago—I believe it was in April last that we agreed to separate, and I agreed to allow her 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and for some time I made her that allowance—latterly I have not been able to continue the full payment, but I have regularly made her some allowance—shortly before Christmas I received a letter from her, and in consequence I went to her apartment at 3, Roehampton Street, Vauxhall Bridge Road, on the morning of the 24th</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187301130016"></xptr>
               <p>December, about 9. 20 or 9.30—I saw her, and she asked me where I was going to pass Christmas Day—I said "I did not know"—she asked me whether I would live with her again—I said it was impossible, that I could not submit to the ill-treatment I received—she also asked me to spend Christmas Day with her, and I declined doing so—she then stabbed me repeatedly in the arm—I was sitting on a chair thinking, and she flew at me and struck me—I have got four or five wounds in the shoulder and arm, and there is one nearly into my lung, and if it had gone a quarter of an inch further I should have been a dead man—she did not say anything—I was so terrified I don't know what she did say, but I rushed away from the place—the door was locked, but I got away somehow; I don't know how—my wife had locked the door when I first went in; she was in the habit of locking the door—J got down stairs and I was detained quite half an hour, and I was almost exhausted from loss of blood—I got outside and went to 93, Vauxhall Bridge Road to some relatives of my wife's, and they sent for a doctor—Dr. Cassells came to me about three-quarters of an hour after I was wounded—I saw the instrument my wife used—it was a knife that formerly belonged to me—I had not taken the knife to my wife's apartment that morning—it had been out of my possession six or seven years—there was no struggle or anything of that kind by me to get possession of the knife until she stabbed me—after she had stabbed me I tried to wrest it from her—the wounds were inflicted by her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was about April that I separated from my wife; a deed of separation was drawn up—I was not aware that one of the conditions of that deed was that if she was sent to prison there should be no allowance made to her—I was informed of that afterwards, but I have not seen it—I was a waiter at the time I separated from her—I was employed at a restaurant in Piccadilly—I had been there about twenty-five yeans—I left five or six weeks or a couple of months since—MRS. Federorwas the proprietress—I was supposed to be discharged for drunkenness—I received a letter from Mrs. Federor that I must leave in consequence of my drunkenness, and take the consequences of my conduct, and I did not go back again—I was not twenty<lb></lb>five years with Mrs. Federor—I was four or five years with her—my wife used to come to the corner of Windmill Street, and she annoyed me so very much that I was ashamed to go back to my situation in case of anything happening—it was her own house I went to on the day she committed this assault upon me—that was in the Vauxhall Bridge Road; she had been there about nine months since we separated—I did not take the rooms for her—I had been there before twice, I think—we separated because we could not agree—it was not because my habits were so drunken she could not live with me, far from that—I undertook to pay her 15. a week—I received a letter from her to come to her and I went—she had sent me invitations repeatedly before, but I did not go always—it was always at her request that I went—I had not paid her the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. during the last week—I sent her a sovereign on 1st September, and I sent her 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. one week and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. another—I have not kept up the 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was out of a situation—I could have got one last week if it had not been for this—I can't get a situation in a week to suit me—I would not take anything—I did not take up the knife first—I never touched it, and I had not seen it for years—I was sitting down answering her questions and the knife came into me, and I said, "For God's sake, don't murder me"—when I found myself stabbed I tried to get hold of her hand to get the knife away—the landlady did not</p>

               <p>come into the room—I saw her at the bottom of the stairs—I did not say to her that it had done it myself—certainly not—the knife dropped—I did not get possession of it—I got away as soon as I could.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Upper Tachbrook Street, Pimlico, and am a doctor of medicine—on Tuesday, 24th December, I saw the prosecutor about 11.15 or 11.20 in the morning—he sent for me—I found him suffering from four incised wounds; one on the front of the shoulder bone, one on the top of the shoulder, one a little lower down, on the upper arm; the last was lower down, considerably outside the arm—the first-mentioned wound was the most dangerous, it struck the shoulder bone—I did not probe it, because I could see the bone; it cut into the bene—the lowest wound was the deepest, the other two were merely superficial—there was a considerable loss of blood—if the first wound had been a little lower down it would have penetrated the lungs—I should say the wounds were inflicted by such an instrument as this knife—from the position of the wounds, I should judge they were not self-inflicted, nor likely to have been received in a struggle to get possession of a knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the prisoner's hand on 27th December—there was a wide open wound on the back of it—I can't say whether that would be caused in a struggle—I don't believe the wounds the man had could have been accidentally caused—the blows must have been given direct—the wound furthest from the front was as far back as you can reach, a little above the tibia, it was a cut in and downwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in the London-road, Southwork; the prisoner has been in my employ during the last month, as general servant. On the 15th of Feb. a policeman was sent for—I saw him go into her room, and makes a search—the prisoner was at the station at the time—the drawers in which she kept her clothes were unlocked—we found the articles pro<lb></lb>duced in them—here is a little worsted bag which I use for putting halfpence into—to used to stand on the parlour table—this silver knife has my name on it—this small album is mine—there is the writing of different parties in it—it is not written by the prisoner—this small china ornament used to stand before the fire-place—this basket and tray were in her drawers—my knife was sometimes kept in my bed-room, in my dressing-case, and sometimes in the parlour—I recollect it lying in the parlour on the mantel-piece—this napkin is marked "D"—the proper place for that was in the kitchen drawer—here is some merino; a quantity of it was ordered to be packed up by my mother, to be taken into the country to be dyed—my mother considered she bad got the whole of it in the country—it had been locked up in a closet in my bed-room—I do not know where it was taken from—nothing was kept in</p>

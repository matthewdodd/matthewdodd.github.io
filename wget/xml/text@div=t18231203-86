            , of No. 59, Montague-square. On Saturday, November 22, about five o'clock, I was standing at the door; the watchman was calling five o'clock; and said he saw something laying across the road, and picked up a brown bag, tied round with a cord. He untied the cord, and in it was a bundle, tied up in a shawl or handkerchief; he said he would take it to the watch-house, and if I heard any inquiry, I was to direct them there. I believe the prisoner to be the <rs id="t18231203-86-deflabel463" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

            . I am serjeant of the watch of Mary-le-bone. On the evening in question, at five o'clock, I placed the prisoner as watchman in Montague-square, and on my different visits to him, till twelve o'clock, he reported that all was right, and at twelve he reported the same at the watch-house. On the following evening, at a quarter to eight o'clock, I visited him, and he reported. that on the evening before, about five o'clock, he picked up a bag, with some old clothes in it. I said, he had not acted by orders, in not telling me yesterday. He said he had done wrong; that he picked it up in the presence of Allpress, and gave it to some man, apparently a carter, who had come and claimed it shortly after he picked it up. I asked why he did not report it to me last night; he said he was sorry for it, and should know better in future.</p>

            . I am an officer. Between five and six o'clock on Sunday evening, I went to the prisoner; he said he had picked up a bundle on Saturday, and kept it in his box a short time, when a carman came to him, and said he had lost one from his cart, and he gave it to him - that the carman said it was dirty linen, and feeling it soft, he made no further inquiry. I asked if nobody else had inquired for it - he said "Yes, a tall gentleman, with mustachios" but having then given it away, he said he had not seen it: and after that he said, his reason for denying it to Mr. Dana was, because Mr. Dana's time did not agree with the time he found it. I asked how long had elapsed between the carman and Mr. Dana coming for it - he said, "Not above a minute," and that he thought it of no use to pursue the carman.</p>
               <p>MR. DANA. My bundle was in a brown bag; when I returned with the gig, I inquired of all the watchmen about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found it, and shewed it to the servant; in about ten minutes a carter came and owned it said it was dirty linen, and I gave it to him; I never emptied the bag.</p>

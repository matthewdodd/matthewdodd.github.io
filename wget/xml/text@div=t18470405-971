                  </hi> I live at No. 23, Victoria-street, Shadwell. On Sturday night, the 3rd of April, I went to bed about a quarter-past twelve o'clock—the back parlour window was shut down, but not fastened—I was awoke by the policeman about half-past three o'clock, came down, and found it lifted up to the full extent—the policeman was in the next yard—I went there—he pointed to some papers which laid in a basket, which I knew had come out of my cash-box, which was in the parlour—I returned, and found the cash-box lying open in my own yard, and a knife-case there—it had some papers in it, but nothing else—I know the prisoner by seeing him in my shop repeatedly—I had seen him in the shop about half-past eleven or a quarter to twelve that night—I lost two common spoons, which I have not found—the cash-box was near the window—it could be got without getting into the room.</p>

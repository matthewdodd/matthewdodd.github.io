                  </hi>. I am one of the partners of the firm of Richard Munt and others, of Wood-street, straw bonnet and hat manufacturers—we have velvet leaves and artificial flowers in our business—the prisoner was our town traveller—his duty was to select certain goods from the flower department and have them entered, through a particular process of our own, and then to take them round to sell—I remember the officer, Bull, taking the prisoner into custody—it was the latter end of January, I think—I heard something said about there being things at his house—the officer asked him if he had anything at his house belonging to his employers, and he said, "No, there is nothing there belonging to my employers; the only things you will find are a few broken flowers, which I have bought from time to time"—upon that I went with the officers to the house, No. 13,</p>

               <p>Sherbourne-street—we did not take him with us—I knew that to be the prisoner's house—we found his wife and daughter there—we went into a bedroom, in the house, on the second floor, searched it, and under the bed we found four hat and bonnet-boxes, four or five bonnet-boxes full of flowers, and a box that we call a wreath-box—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on opening the boxes I found property similar to what I have before me—the four boxes were full—I made a selection of the goods which form the subject of this indictment, because a portion of our tickets are on the whole of these except one, and that is an article made specially for us and for no other house in the trade—I know this one by the pattern, and this by the tickets—the value of the things found at the prisoner's house was nearly 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—these garnitures are made for us and are sold in boxes, one in a box.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner at the bar - On the twenty-seventh of February did you see him? - A. I did, I saw him at my shop, it is dated on the back of the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - A.About twenty minutes past four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. It was light? - A. Yes, I was returning from my office, and the prisoner at the bar was at my shop, bargaining with my partner; he purchased two silk handkerchiefs; I went behind the counter, to give my partner assistance, and the prisoner at the bar gave me the note in question.</p>
               <p>Q. What price was the two handkerchiefs? - A. It was either 12 s. or 12 s. 6 d, I will not be positive; the prisoner gave the note into my hand and I held it up to the light it was a note of five pounds apparently, and I conceived it to be a bad one, as I thought; I was not certain myself, I went up stairs to my wife who was ill in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You looked at the note and you thought it was a bad one - did you do any thing by way of knowing whether it was bad or not? - A. Yes, I went out leaving him in the shop and took the opinion of a neighbour.</p>
               <p>Q. You went out, and your belief was confirmed? - A. Yes, my friend confirmed me in my opinion; I went to a banker's, in Barner-street, and they proved it to be a forged one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to any Police-office? - A. I did; there was no constable there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any constable come to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Having spoken for a constable did you return home? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find the prisoner there? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as to look at this note? - A. That is the note.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found him there, what passed between you and him? - A. I shut the door upon the prisoner; I told the prisoner I suspected it to be a forged note; he said he was very sorry for it, and if I would go with him to Tottenham-court-road he had plenty of friends there, who would give me a good one, in lieu of the one in question; I told him it was out of my power; he then took the watch out of his pocket, and said he would leave it, and return the next day and satisfy me; I told him I had nothing more to do with it, it rested then with the Magistrate, I should have nothing further to do with it, the law must take its course.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the note, and that note had not been out of your custody till you delivered it to the man who took the prisoner in custody? - A. No, I put his hat on his head (the constable never came to my house, I was going from my house, when I met the constable); I took hold of him by the arm, and took him myself till we came to Blenheim-steps, where the constable met us, and I delivered him to the constable, who, with myself, conveyed him to Marlborough-street; he made no resistance after he got out of the shop at all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he make any resistance before he got out of the shop? - A. Not forcible resistance; he begged and prayed that I would let him go; we took him to the Office, and he was examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.What time were you gone from your shop, from your first going out? - A. I might be gone a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it natural to suppose this man to be gone for a quarter of an hour with this note, that if I knew it to be a forged note that I should not have gone.</p>
               <p>Court. You are not to talk and argue upon it; at present you must confine yourself to ask questions.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As to making any resistance, you cannot say I ever did.</p>
               <p>Court. He said you made no forcible resistance,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180505290022"></xptr>you only begged and prayed in the shop, and no resistance at all out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Prosecutor). Did you give him a general reason for your going out of the shop? - A. I told the prisoner I had not sufficient change in the house, I would go out and get it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are an inspector of Bank notes - I am going to shew you the Bank note in question - take that in your hand and tell us whether it is a forgery; first, the one that was given to Mr. Rhodes? - A. The whole of this is a forgery.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Be so good as to tell the Jury what you mean by the whole of its being a forgery? - A. I mean the paper is not the Bank of England paper, nor is it the engraving of the Bank of England; neither has it the water-mark, nor is it the signature of our cashiers, nor of any of the clerks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Whom does that appear to be the signature of upon the face of that note? - A. It does not appear to be the signature of the Bank, we have no cashier that signs any 5 l. notes in that name at all.</p>
               <p>Q. I am now going to put into your hand that uttered to Mr. Thompson? - A. This note is of the same texture, and of the very same description, as the other note.</p>
               <p>Q. By that you mean it is the same sort of paper, and the same writing? - A. It is a strip of the same paper and the same writing, and it is a facsimile of the other first note; they are both from one plate.</p>
               <p>Q. I am now going to give you the other 5 l. note uttered to Mrs. Pudephat? - A. This note is of the same kind of paper, from the same plate, but a different signature to the others, we have no cashiers in that name; they are all from the same plate; it is a forged note.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe you are the engraver to the Bank of England? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take these three notes in your hand - Look at that note uttered to Mr. Rhodes? - A. It is altogether a forgery; this is a forgery also of the same kind, and in every respect; it is from the same plate.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the note uttered to Mr. Thompson - Look at that which was uttered to Mrs. Pudephat? - A. This is a forgery, in every respect the same as the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Are every one from the same plate? - A. From the same plate, the same paper, and the same ink. (The notes read in Court.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I must acknowledge I uttered these notes; I sent to the Bank, and Mr. Winter attended me in Newgate; I candidly told him the manner in which I got these notes; I passed three before that one to Mr. Rhodes; I knew it not to be forged. Can it be supposed that I, knowing these 5 l. notes to be forged, would have continued in the shop, when he was away from the shop a full quarter of an hour; I left on the other side of the counter, and the door open. I acknowledge I had the notes; I found the pocket-book, and I uttered the notes, but I knew them not to be forged.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any witness to call in your behalf? - A. I have not; with respect to the notes I found them; they did not belong to me, but through my partner's distressing me to the last shilling, I passed them; I must acknowledge my dishonesty that I did not advertise the book in which they were found; to say that I knew they were forged, I did not.</p>

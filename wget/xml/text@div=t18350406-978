                  </hi>. I am a journeyman baker, and live in Mary-le<lb></lb>bone-lane. On the 21st of March, I fell in company with the prisoner at the Queen's-head, High-street—she came into the company I was in, and as they were quarelling she placed herself by my side, and asked me to go to the bar, and take something—we went and had a pot of half-an-half, and a quartern of gin—she then asked me the road to Oxford-street, and said she wanted to go to Brentford—we went on towards there—she said she was poorly, and should not be able to go to Brentford that night; could I tell her where to get a lodging—I asked a man, who directed us to No. 14, Woodstock-street—I went there with her; they said, it was too early—I said the woman was poorly—the woman of the house went up stairs and came down again, and said, she could have a lodging, and it would be two shillings—the prisoner told me to pay it and she would treat me—we went out, and had some half-and-half and some oysters—she then agreed that I should go to the house to take care of her—I was to go to bed and she was to sit up—we went back—I took my watch out of my pocket, and laid it on the table—I then undressed and went to bed—I went to sleep, and when I awoke, I missed my watch and the prisoner—I went and found her at the Hog in the Pound—I got an officer, and said that was the wo<lb></lb>man—the policeman took her, and said, "You have stolen this man's watch" she began to fumble, and pulled out the case of the watch—I said "That is part of it, but there is more"—I then saw she had my handkerchief, which I had not then missed, but I had left it in the room—she was then taken—all that she said was, "Here they are"—she did not say she had taken them to take care of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you never said that she did say so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There might be such a thing said—I was not sober when I went to the house—I was when I awoke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I do not recollect meeting him at the Queen's Head at all—I saw him at the Hog in the Pound—my bundle was in my hand, he has it now—he told me, he would bring me to an honest place, and he took me to that house—I went into the parlour, and said to the woman, "Will you put me into some place, and put some of your children with me?"—she took me to that room, and the man was in bed—I said I would not go into the room for I did not know what he wanted, without it was to kill me—he told me he was a distressed man and out of employ, he had not a farthing—he had my bundle in his room, and gave me this watch to take care of for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. Her bundle is at the lodging-house now—she never went into the parlour—she went into the room, and sat down in the chair, and said that was where she should sit for the night—I went for no other purpose but to take care of her—I was partly intoxicated.</p>

               <p>to the public-house, and I saw the prisoner—he said, "This is the woman that robbed me of my watch"—she said, "Well, I have got his watch"—I said, "Give it to me"—she gave it to me out of two handkerchiefs—the prosecutor then said, "You have got my handkerchief"—I took her to the station-house—I found on her this handkerchief, doubled up as it is now, as if it came off a man's neck—the prisoner said, she took the watch to take care of—she did not state that she had left her bundle in Woodstock-street, and I did not go there—I believe it is a bad house.</p>

Did you go to that house with intent to pass the night there with her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I went at her proposal that I should go to bed and she sit up, because she was poorly—she ap<lb></lb>peared to have been drinking when she was at the station-house—I went back to the house, as I had left my braces—the woman said there were a lot more things, but I did not look at them—the prisoner sent for the bundle on the Tuesday or Wednesday after she was committed—the woman would not give it up—she said I must get an officer, which I did—the bundle was given up, likewise a night-cap of mine—I know there was a gown in the bundle, which appeared to be worth two or three shil<lb></lb>lings—I did not see any money.</p>
               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that the prosecutor had accosted her in the street, and promised to take her where she could lay down, she being ill; but to her surprise, he took possession of the bed himself; upon which she refused to lay down, and afterwards went to the public-house for refreshment; and that the prosecutor had given her his watch to take care of for him.)</p>

Jacklin resisted very much, and asked what he had done? I told him he was trying to break into my house, and had been watched ever since six o'clock - I took him into the tap. Before the officer came he put his hand into his left-hand breeches pocket, and dropped a key on his boot, and then gave it a kick. I picked it up.</p>

            . I am a waiter at the Bolt in Tun. A little before seven o'clock I saw the prisoner, Jacklin, go from Monk's door, and informed Monk of it; he went with me, and several others, and examined the door,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181901130038"></xptr>which was safe. About half-past seven I was going out, saw Jacklin leave the door again, and put something into his pocket. I watched him, and followed him into Fleet-street, to the corner of Water-lane, where he stopped and conversed with Lee, I crossed over to watch, and saw them return towards the court together - Jacklin went down the court, and Lee went further up Fleet-street, towards Bouverie-street. I crossed again, went to Monk's tap, and informed him. We went out, and saw Lee peeping round the corner, towards Boar's Head-court, looking towards the Bolt in Tun yard. Monk went between them, and asked Jacklin what he was about? he tried to strike him. I called the watch, and they were taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There is a key-hole in the door, and a gas-lamp at the entrance of the court.</p>

            . I live at Chertsey. I was in town, and lodged at the Bolt in Tun. Archer came in, and gave information. I went out, and saw the prisoners in Monk's custody. Jacklin resisted very much; I laid hold of Lee, he was quiet. They were taken to the tap - Jacklin followed behind - we sat down in a box with Lee, I thought I observed him drop something under the table, Jacklin was fighting at the time, so that I could not ascertain exactly. As soon as the officer secured him I found a bag, containing three skeleton keys, and on searching further I found a single skeleton key; Lee put his hand under the table, which made me suspect he was getting rid of something.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. NORTON. Q. It was foggy - A. It was dark. Lee had not been in that part of the room where I found the single skeleton key. There were several people in the room.</p>

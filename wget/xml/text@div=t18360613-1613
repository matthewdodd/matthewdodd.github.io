                  </hi>. I am silk manufacturer and have two partners, we live in Fort-street, Old Artillery Ground. I employed the prisoner and her husband at times—on the 3rd of June I gave her husband 110 bobbins of shuts, weighing 18lbs. 7ozs. or raw silk, to manufacture—on the Thursday morning, the 16th, I went to the prisoner's house, and saw a loom with a portion of silk left in it, and brought this part of it away—I cut it off myself—I had advanced 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd on the work—the silk was to be manufactured for me, and the whole together would have made 103 yards—it was the man I employed—this 15 yards of silk produced by the pawnbroker corresponds with the silk I brought</p>

The prisoner and her husband live in East-street, Greenwich—I occupy was apartment under them—the husband was employed occasionally in weaving—I am acquainted with the noise the loom makes, as I have been in the business myself—on Tuesday morning, the 14th, between ten and eleven o'clock I heard the roll going—that was the roller used in the loom—the work is upon it—the silk is put on it—I heard it unrolled and rolled again, and said something to my husband about it.</p>

                  </hi> I am the prisoner's son. On the 14th of June I went out of the room at eight o'clock in the morning, and there was this silk then on the roll—there was a part remaining after it had been cut off—my father did not come home that morning—I returned about seven o'clock in the evening, and something was said to me by Mr. Artis—in consequence of that, I went to the loom—Mr. Artis had seen me at two o'clock that after<lb></lb>noon at the East-gate—the moment I went home I went to the loom, and found it rolled up in a very rough manner—I found a paste-board on the top of it, to cover it so that nobody could suppose it had been touched—I took the paste-board away next morning, and found the silk was gone—I unrolled it myself in the morning and found the end of it as it is now—we could see that it was cut—I could not tell how much was gone—my mother was present—I said to her, "Mother, you have done a pretty job for yourself"—she said, "Well, I must answer for it myself"—the police<lb></lb>man took her into custody.</p>

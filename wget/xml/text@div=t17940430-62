               <p>Mr. Alby. You are an excise officer? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pays for these prosecutions? - I don't know upon my word, it is ordered by the board of excise</p>
               <p>Q. You had no intention of prosecuting this man, for this casual affray, unless it had been advised to you by other persons? - The matter was reported to the Board, and they ordered the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you on the oath you have taken, was Jones in the house at the time that you came into the house? - I did not see him first, I saw his wife.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you tell the wife you came about? - I told her I had a warrant to search her house for illegal goods.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was not permitted to come into the house at the time? - Yes, the door was open.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of this warrant? - It is mislaid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not above half an hour subsequent to your entering into the house, that the prisoner at the bar entered into the house? - No, it was not so much.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it twenty-nine minutes do you think? - No, it was not so much, it was a very little time, I was in and turned round, and the man of the house had come into the house at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. The wife and you entered into a scuffle was not this woman with child? - I believe she was, she has had a child since.</p>
               <p>Q. And you sir, as a man pretend on your oath to say that she was able to assault you? - I did not raise my hand against her, because I knew she was pregnant.</p>
               <p>Q. You have always sworn positively<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179404300104"></xptr>that the prisoner at the bar and his wife assaulted you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this unfortunate woman knocked to the ground in the scuffle? - No such thing by me, I did not see her at all on the ground.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you do it with any violence? - No; then he struck me till I was reeling down, with his fist, Mr. Edwards by that time came between us; by that time I stooped down under the bed, in order to see a bag of tobacco there; by that time the wife came up to try to take the bag from me as much as she could, she broke the bag, and strewed it about the floor.</p>
               <p>A. How much do you think there was in the bag? - The quantity I took from there, was seventeen pounds, if not more.</p>
               <p>Q. After she strewed the tobacco on the floor, what more was done? - We went into a scuffle then, and she took me by the collar, and there were people came in to our assistance, and I was determined to lose my life or keep the tobacco.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of Hudson Square, Stratford. On the morning of 1st Dec., about half past 12 o'clock, I was disturbed by a noise like a chair being moved backwards and forwards—I jumped out of bed, went down stairs, and saw the prisoner taking a gown through a pane of glass in my window, which had been mended with paper and paste; there was no shutter—I ran out after her in my shirt and she dropped her apron with some fish in it—I went back and dressed myself, and went to her husband's house, but she was not there—I did not see her again till she was in custody—I am sure of her, she was a neighbour—it was bright moonlight.</p>

I received information from Barson, and went to the prisoner's house on 1st Dec., between 9 and 10 o'clock; she was not at home—I went again on the 9th, and found her; she had been away all that time—I told her the charge, and she said that she would give Mrs. Barson 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the value of the dress, to make it up to her—I told her it would not do, and took her to the station—I found the dress, pawned at Bow, at Mr. Crawley's, but he does not know by whom.</p>

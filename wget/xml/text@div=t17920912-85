               <p>I believe you went in consequence of a hand bill, in search of the prisoner? - On Saturday the 18th of July, by the directions of the solicitor of the Post Office, I and Mr. Ferguson went to Hatfield after the prisoner, who was gone to see his wife, who lives at Lady Salisbury's, I went to the house, he was not there, we waited a considerable time, and in the evening, near dusk, I apprehended him, and took him to Lord Salisbury's Arms, at Hatfield, and searched him, and in his breeches pocket, I found two duplicates, one of which was a duplicate of a great coat, pawned by the prisoner at one Clarke's, a pawnbroker; we staid till morning, at four in the morning we came to town; the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179209120064"></xptr>committed; this is the duplicate brought out of the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Did the prisoner in all his conduct attempt to evade your apprehension of him? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>Was not he ready to give himself up? - Certainly.</p>

               <p>In July last I was a servant to Mr. Clarke, in Ryder's Court, Leicester Fields, a pawnbroker; the prisoner many times and for two years pledged things there; I know him perfectly well; on the 2d of July, he pledged a great coat; it is my writing; this is the duplicate for it.</p>
               <p>(The great coat produced and deposed to, having silk lining to the sleeves, very singular.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Foreigners pledge great coats with you that have coloured silk sleeve linings? - Yes; I have seen such.</p>

               <p>In what way did he pay you? - By a ten pound note, in two halves joined together; I applied to a neighbour, to give me change for it, his name is Gabb; I hesitated a little at first; he told me if I did not like that he would give me another; and he shewed me another, which was cut likewise; I went to a neighbour to ask their opinion of it, whether it was good; he said he had received two or three, or three or four, but they were all cut, and came from the country, in the morning of that day in a letter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This was half past nine at night? - Yes; the evening was shut in, it rained; I understood that the party I sold it to (as he told me) was going to Salisbury that evening, and if it was not ten o'clock, he should be time enough for the coach.</p>

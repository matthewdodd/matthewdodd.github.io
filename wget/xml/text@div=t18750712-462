                  </hi>. I am assistant-clerk to the vestry of Hampstead—at the end of December last the prisoner was appointed gate porter at the workhouse—it was his duty to keep the porter's book, which I have here—he would enter there the names of the persons who came in and went out of the workhouse—on 28th January he left the service—a balance of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was then due to him—his salary was 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum with lodging and rations—when he left I gave him a cheque for the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., signed by Mr. Burnaby and myself as clerk—that cheque came back from the bankers on the 9th February, and was duly charged to the guardians—I have here a cheque-book—it was kept in a desk in front of me, or it might be in a cupboard in the same office until it was used—at the time the prisoner left it was complete, not commenced to be used—the prisoner would have access to the office in which that book was kept, it was part of his duty to lock</p>

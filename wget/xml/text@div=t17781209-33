I dispatched some officers after them, while I went to see after the press; it was under the shop; they had brought it through into a vault. There I found a large press fixed, and a pair of dies in it, and by comparing the half-pence, afterwards found on one of the prisoners taken at the King's Bench, I found they were struck with those dies that were in the press. We found some half-pence lying by the side of the press; and we found another die with the impression of a farthing; the die in the press had a hole in the head; and there is a rising on the head of the halfpence corresponding with it.</p>

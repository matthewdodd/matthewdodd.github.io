                  </hi> I am an apprentice on board the barque <hi rend="italic">Deov<lb></lb>shire</hi>—it is in the London Docks—on the morning of the 13th Dec. I saw the prisoner on the starboard side of the forecastle, fumbling with his jacket—on going to the forecastle I missed my waistcoat, which had been in my chest five minutes before—I told the mate I had lost it, and he told the pri<lb></lb>soner to give it up—he took off his jacket, and there was my waistcoat over his own.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not know but it was the cook's; the cook employed me; if I did anything wrong I was very sorry for it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> The prisoner came to take away the cook's clothes—my waistcoat was in a chest, covered over with a hammock—the cook slept near the forecastle door.</p>

                  </hi> I was on board the vessel when it came in, late on Sunday evening—I had no chest, and I left my things on board till Monday morning—I knew the prisoner before, and sent him to gather my things and bedding—I went with him—my things were kicking about the forecastle—all the others had got their things away—if I take anything belonging to another</p>

               <p>I give it him when we come to rights, if they ask me if I have got it—we do not come there to rob—I gave the prisoner no direction what to bring away—he thought the waistcoat was mine, like many other articles which he did take up—it was my fault to give the man a shilling to earn—he met with this waistcoat and asked if it was mine—I said, "I do'nt know"—he said, "I will put it on, and not open this bed-rug," and he did so—other people have got things belonging to me—I would be very sorry to get a man into trouble—he did not go on board to thieve.</p>

On the 16th of February, in the evening, I was sitting in the accompting-house; I saw Dodman standing at the top of the stairs leading into the cellar; he looked very hard at me, which made me suspect all was not right. I then asked Dodman where Ward, the other prisoner, was. They are servants in the employ of Messrs. Nicholson. He said he was down in the cellar. I immediately went down into the cellar. Ward seemed very much agitated in seeing me come down; he made trifling excuses, and moved from one part of the cellar to the other to try to avoid me. I followed him close up. He then came up stairs into the distill-house; I followed him up. He went to the further part the still-house; I kept following him; he then made a sharp turn, when I heard something like spirits jolt in a bladder.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Dodman all this time - A. He was standing where I first saw him; he had not gone into the cellar then. I took hold of Ward by the collar, and asked him what he had got. He took the bladder out of rectified spirits out of his breeches, and gave it into my hand. I then called

             out of the accompting-house; I told him to take hold of Dodman, as I had no doubt of his being a party concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Dodman within sight of you while you laid hold of Ward - A. Yes, he was. He laid hold of Dodman, and said he had no doubt they were both concerned. I then enquired in the house whether Mr. Nicholson was within. Mr. Nicholson came down. When Mr. Nicholson came, he took hold of Ward. and I took hold of Dodman, and then Robert Wilson went for an officer. Dodman then wanted to go to the necessary; I said he should not move. He then put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and 
               <persName id="t18140420-42-person434">drew</persName>
             a knife. I immediately seized hold of his arm, and called to Mr. Nicholson that he had drawn a knife. He let go Ward, and came to my assistance. When he found Mr. Nicholson was coming he threw the knife from him. In the scuffle. Mr. Nicholson threw him on his back; he got up again, and threw himself down upon his belly, and attempted to burst the bladder, and with one hand he pulled it out of his breeches and threw it from him. We tied his hands. He then pretended to faint, and laid on his back until the officer came. I told the officer he was farthing. I took up the bladder which he had thrown away before the officer came. The officer said he would soon bring him about; he gave him a tap on the head. The officer then handcuffed them, and took them to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bladders - A. I took it to the office and examined it; the officer, examined it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200026"></xptr>with me. One bladder contained better than a gallon and a half of strong rectified spirits; that was Ward's bladder; the bladders leaked, so we emptied them out into strong bottles. The other bladder contained about a pint and a gallon of strong rum. The prisoners were committed to prison. The spirits are here; the rectified spirits are of the value of twenty shillings, and the rum twenty-two shillings; that is what it cost me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. What part of the premises did this take place - A. In the distill-house.</p>
               <p>Q. That is some distance from where Mr. Nicholson dwells - A. It is connected with the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Dodman did not offer any personal violence to any body with the knife - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think he took the knife out of his pocket with intention of stabbing the bladder - A. I do.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did he say what he meaned to do with the knife - A. He did not. The entrance to the distill-house in underneath the dwelling-house; it is covered in, and all one premises; we pay regular taxes for the distill-house as well as the house. We can go from the house into the distill-house without going into the street or into the yard.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for to Mr. Nicholson's; I received the two prisoners there. When I came, Dodman's hands were tied; I untied them, and handcuffed them together. I told Dodman he must go with me; he said, he would not. These two bladders were produced to me; one containing rum, the other a strong spirit. Mr. Nicholson produced them to me at the time they were nearly full of spirits; I kept them until the next day. I found the bladders leaked; I put the spirits into these stone bottles; I have had it ever since. I tasted it; one was rum, and the other was a strong spirit. I searched Dodman's premises; in his bed room I found four bottles of spirits, and this bladder, and a quantity of sugar; they were locked up in a chest. The bottles contained strong spirits like that in the bladder. I asked him how he came to do it; he replied, we are two rogues together.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever live in London?</p>
               <p>Haley. I lived with the Earl of Macclesfield fifteen years, but was not always in town. When we were at the Lebeck's Head, the prisoner call'd for something to drink by himself, but he fell into discourse with the company; there were two other men in the room; I pull'd out my watch to see what o'clock it was; the prisoner took and twisted it out of my hand, and gave it over the table to another man; they were all strangers to me; I took out my money to pay: he took two half guineas out of my hand: I began to make a noise; two of them got away; the prisoner was going out, and I got hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid the reckoning?</p>
               <p>Haley. I don't know, I paid none, nor did I call to know what was to pay; the men were all gone away: this was in a little room backwards below stairs; they went out at a door that goes into <placeName id="t17650710-36-crimeloc199">Half-Moon-street</placeName>

            . I was servant at the Lebeck's Head at that time; the prosecutor and another young man came in some time before the prisoner: when the prisoner came in, he asked for two young men; he was shewed into the room to two young men that were there before the prosecutor came in: the prisoner call'd for pen. ink, and paper, and a gill of wine; he mixed company with them; there was not the least complaint of any thing being lost: the young man and the prisoner went out before the other men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them go out?</p>
               <p>Pain. No; but I saw them come in again; the other men paid me the reckoning, and were gone, before they came back.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the prisoner and prosecutor be absent?</p>
               <p>Pain. About eight or ten minutes; when they came back again, they asked me for the other men; I said they were gone; then the prosecutor swore an oath, and said he was robb'd of his watch and two half guineas; and took the prisoner by the sleeve, and said he had snatched them from him, and had delivered them to another man, and he would not go out of the house without his watch: then the prisoner said, Come along, and they never went into a room, but went out together.</p>

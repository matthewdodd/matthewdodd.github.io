             came into into the yard with one of the elders, and Holding desired me to go with the prisoner to the warehouse-keeper, and when we came in Holding said the prisoner had some tea, and he took it out of the prisoner's left hand coat pocket, it was what we call congou tea, it was weighed, I have had it ever since.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. How long have you known Holding? - I have been in the warehouse ten years, he was there then.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of his character? - Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the prisoner? - I have known him since he has been in the warehouse; I have heard that the prisoner was subject to fits, since he was detected and brought before Mr. Stockdale the warehouse-keeper; he looked like a man then that did not know what he had done, I heard a day or two after that he had had a fit just before this happened.</p>

               <p>I brought the prisoner to the last witness on the 23d of March, as I was crossing through one of the rooms, where we lay down the teas for inspection among the brokers, I saw the prisoner take the tea out of a chest, and put it into his pocket in a small bag, he told me he was going to get some nails; his business was to go and fetch the nails and return without going up one of the allies where these chests were laid open for shew; I immediately told him he had been doing that which was very wrong, and insisted upon seeing what he had in his pocket, I found it was tea, and I took him down to Mr. Stockdale; I never heard the prisoner was guilty of any thing of the kind before; he has been in the warehouse about seven or eight months; I am credibly informed he is subject to fits, but my business lays in another part of the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What reward do the company give for the detection of these sort of pilferers? - I do not know, I never received any.</p>
               <p>Do not they give a guinea? - It is so stuck up on the stair-case.</p>
               <p>How long have you been in the warehouse? - Upwards of six years.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing remarkable that made you leave the keys? - No.</p>
               <p>You was a tobacco merchant? - No, Sir, I dealt in it in the retail way, I never hawked it about, I have a hundred customers now that deal with me.</p>

               <p>Did the warehouse-keeper say any thing to him? - No farther than he turned the bag out, and he asked him if it was a bag for the purpose; and the prisoner told him no, it was a bag that he brought his bread and cheese in.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did there appear to be any crumbs in the bag, as if bread and cheese had been in it? - I did not observe.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the warehouse-keeper ask him how he came to take the tea? - He asked him what business he had in the warehouse? and he said he was going for nails; he gave his answer with a good deal of hesitation.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to know what he said? - Upon my word I really think he did.</p>
               <p>Jury. Turn it out in your hat, and see if there are any crumbs of bread and cheese in it? - If there were any they might be left behind on the paper, the tea has been weighed in a scale once or twice.</p>
               <p>(The tea was turned out, but there appeared no crumbs.)</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether that bag really belonged to him or not? - No I do not.</p>

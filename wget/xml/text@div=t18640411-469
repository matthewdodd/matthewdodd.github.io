                  </hi>. I am a draper at Greenwich—on 24th February Dash came into my shop to look at some cotton prints—I showed her some—she did not purchase any—she said they were not good enough for the money—she remained in the shop three or four minutes—while she was there I saw the other woman looking in at the window—before Dash left the shop I missed a piece of cotton print—I went outside, and came in again, said to Dash, "You had better get away from here"—she said, "You have made a mistake in the party, it was not me"—the print was hanging on an iron rail near the door—I did not accuse Dash of taking it—she went out and crossed over to the opposite side of the way—I saw her again about half an hour afterwards, about five minutes walk from my place, with the other prisoner—they were standing at a draper's shop door together, in front of some goods—I did not say anything to them—they endeavoured to take something from the pile of goods, and the goods fell down—I saw a black wrapper fall from one of them; I believe from Mead—this piece of cotton (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was inside it—it is my property and was stolen from my door—I had seen it safe ten minutes before Dash came in—I gave them in custody—I don't believe I said anything to either of them, or they to me.</p>

Some time about Christmas last, my clerk informed me, that I was robbed; he told me, that he had picked up a duplicate in the warehouse. The clerk is here. I went to the pawnbrokers, and there I found a coverlid had been pledged. Some time afterwards, I was going into the counting-house, I observed the prisoner, Church, stooping and peeping into the accounting-house, watching the clerk, who was writing; and a little further on, I found the prisoner Beckenham, behind a bale of goods; he was evidently confused, when I spoke to him; I asked him what he stood there for; he said, he was just come in from attending my riding horse. I was convinced they were then about committing a robbery. After that time, I missed goods in a wholesale way, whole peices of goods. I got an officer to watch, and the first morning the officers came, they detected the two prisoners; I was called up by the maid-servant, and informed, that the two men were in custody. I went down, and saw the two prisoners; I asked Beckenham how he could think of robbing me, when I had been such a good friend to him; I thought he would have protected my property, and not even seen others rob me; he made no answer to that; he hung down his head, and trembled very much. The officer took them away in a coach. My warehouseman is here. The prisoners were taken before the Lord Mayor. By what I found out since, I suppose, I have been robbed of three hundred pounds.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information I received; on Friday, the 7th of April, in the morning, I went to Aldgate pump; there I met Atkinson; there I saw the two prisoners in conversation together; they went down the gate-way close to the prosecutor's house, and went into the warehouse, and in a few minutes after, I saw Beckenham come out with a pail in his hand, he went into the stable with it, and in a short time after, came out again; me and my partner had placed ourselves at a window, which looked into the yard, and as Beckenham came by the warehouse door, I saw him make a motion with his hand, he was up at the top of the gateway, and in a minute, out came Church, with a hamper on his shoulder, I could see by the light, that the hamper, on being put down, contained something white; he took the hamper into the stable, and in about a minute, came out with it empty, and took it again empty into the warehouse. Me and my partner came down stairs directly from the house in which we were; we turned round into the yard; I took hold of Church, took him into the stable: Atkinson took hold of Beckenham, we took them both into the stable; where we found the blankets, close under the horse, two dozen pair of blankets altogether; we took them back into the warehouse, and called Mr. Gunston up; we confined them together, whilst my partner went back into the stable, and found some more goods, of which he will tell you, under the manger, covered over with straw.</p>

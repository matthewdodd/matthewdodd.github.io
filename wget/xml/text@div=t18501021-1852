                  </hi>. I am an artist in colours, by appointment to Her Majesty, and carry on business in Long-acre. On Friday night, Aug. 2nd, I was returning home from Chelsea—the clock struck twelve as I passed through St. James's-park—I should say it was a quarter-past when I got to Long-acre—as I passed Rose-street (on the right side of Long-acre as you come from St. Martin Vlane), I felt both my arms pinned from behind—I had a roll of drawings three feet long in one hand, and a walking-stick in the other—at the same instant I was faced by another person, and a third appeared at my left side, at least I guess it was a third—I then saw the prisoner standing with what I thought was a walking-stick—he came up to me on my right, and immediately a machine was put round my neck from the right side, I have no doubt, by the prisoner—I had had a full view of him by the light of the lamp, waiting to put this infernal machine round my neck—I was completely strangled—my coat was unbuttoned, and ray waistcoat pockets were torn—this eye-glass was taken from my pocket, and the word "Eye-glass" was mentioned by one of the men—I was still standing up—all sensation left me, and I was dead to all intents and purposes by strangulation—I have every reason to believe that at that moment some alarm was given, for I was loosened and dashed on the kerb-stone, by which one of my teeth was broken out, and my chin was very severely fractured—on recovering, I saw one man at a distance—I think he did not know the passage out, and could not get away without passing me—I chased him about a quarter of a mile, but the pressure which had been on my throat disabled me from calling out, and I lost him—I met a policeman, and proceeded to Bow-street station—I arrived there at twenty minutes past twelve, and made a complaint—I am enabled to speak to the prisoner, by the gas-light behind me shining directly on his face—I did not describe him that night, but next morning I wrote to Scotland-yard—I saw him again at the Mansion-house, about two months afterwards—I did not know he was in custody; I saw him by chance at the bar among other persons—I went there because I heard a person had been taken into custody—the other persons were close by—I cannot say whether it was the bar—before I recognised him, I had a communication with Haydon, one of the detective-police—he did not point the prisoner out—on my solemn oath I have not the least doubt he is the man—I saw a flexible walking-stick at the station, with a life-preserver at the end of it—by putting the two ends together when round a man's neck,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185010210120"></xptr>
               <p>and twisting them, strangulation would immediately take place—I believe it was an instrument of this kind that was applied to my neck.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. O'BRIEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You gave no description of the person to the police, either that night or next morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had not been at the Mansion House a moment before I recognized him—the next time he was brought up, was on my charge—I was not with Haydon when I recognized him—on the night this happened I had been to King's-road, Chelsea—I supped there—I had dined at home—I believe I took a small glass of brandy and water at supper—I think I may say I did not take more than one glass, but could not pledge my oath now—the man I chased, was in front of me; when I got up, I chased him into Hart-street, Covent-garden, through the courts, which are very intricate, and there lost him—I saw the prisoner immediately upon being pinioned—I could not recognize the man who pinioned me—the street-lamp was behind me, eight or ten yards off—it is in the centre of, and lights up the underneath part of the archway, which is the entry to Rose-street—this was not five minutes taking place—it was more than a minute—the man who faced me came suddenly upon me, which prevented my seeing his face, and my attention was called to the face of the prisoner, and fixed upon it—I saw the prisoner immediately I was pinioned, and before I saw the man who faced me; I should fancy I was insensible two or three minutes—the whole of it did not occupy five minutes, it was done very cleverly indeed, nothing could be done better—there were a great many people at the Mansion-house—I did not see the bar at that time—I was never there before—I went there expecting to see the man who had treated me in this way—I described the prisoner, on the night previous to my seeing him, to Haydon—I had read no description of him in the papers then—I had read in the papers about Mr. Cure ton's case, in Aldersgate-street—that was before I gave the description—Haydon came to my house, in conse<lb></lb>quence of a card which I left in the City about the middle of Sept., before I went into the country—the prisoner's hat was put on him at the Mansion-house, at my suggestion—Haydon was not standing by him when I first saw him, or when I charged him with being the person who assaulted me—he was removed from the bar to the lock-up, and then I went and saw Haydon, and told him he was the man—that was after I had ordered his hat to be put on, and not five minutes after I first saw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it such an instrument as this that was used (<hi rend="italic">produced)? A.</hi> I should say it was—I saw it at the station—it might be a week or a fortnight after I had read the account of Mr. Cureton's case that I went into the country—I was suffering very much from this attack, and am now—I had no communication with any one about this, till the evening before I went to the Mansion-house—I am quite certain Haydon had not described the person who was in custody, before I described the prisoner to him, nor had any one else—there was nothing at the Mansion-house in my view to distinguish the prisoner from those by whom he was surrounded—I did not look at him a second before I made up my mind it was him—the man wore a had on that night, and I had the prisoner's hat put on, to see if I could recognize him in a hat as well as without one—I had no doubt about him before it was put on.</p>

I took the prisoner on another charge—I had then no knowledge of Mr. Miller or his address; I obtained it on 6th Oct.—I went to his house, and he described the person by whom he had been attacked—I had not described any person to him who was in custody—he came next day to the</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Who was the other man? <hi rend="italic">A. I key</hi> Williams—the prisoner was not told that he was discharged in Mr. Cureton's case—he had been remanded twice; it was then abandoned—it was not in consequence of Mr. Cureton's case being called on by the clerk that the prisoner made his appearance—remanded cases are not necessarily taken at a particular time, but generally they are—I brought the prisoner up from below—Mr. Cureton was not examined—I think no one was examined; but Mr. Humphrey, the attorney, asked for a remand, for further evidence—that was before Mr. Miller made any communication to me—I did not come up with the prisoner from below; I sent him up—I stood on the stairs, and he stood in the dock—the other two prisoners were not examined before the prisoner was remanded—every case takes its turn—I had taken the prisoner down into the dock before I heard Mr. Miller make any charge—the place where the prisoners stand, is enclosed from where the public are, by a very low iron rail—it is about sixteen inches wide—Mr. Miller stood close by the door which leads to the ante-room, about six feet from the bench.</p>

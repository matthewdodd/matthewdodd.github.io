Yes, I told the money at nine o'clock in the morning in order to pay the distiller, I knew he would come in the course of the day, I had twenty-nine pounds, I left them together under under a clean shirt that was folded, I locked the drawer, and put the key in a tray that stood on the drawers, under some dirty linen; at eleven o'clock the distiller came for his money, I asked my wife for the key of the room, she gave it me, I went up stairs and looked for the money, I found the drawer unlocked, with the key hanging in it; the ten pound note was gone, I brought down the remainder of the money and paid the distiller.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the money afterwards. - A. No, my wife told me that nobody had been to the room but the girl and her; immediately after dinner this girl went out, she came home late in the evening very much in liquor, she went out a second time and came home very much intoxicated, and went to bed; on Tuesday morning when I arose she was gone out, and while I was getting my breakfast she came in very much intoxicated, she remained there till between one and two in the afternoon asleep, then she came down stairs and went into the kitchen, and sent a lad for a pint of beer; I denied sending her the beer, she immediately went out and I never saw her till between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, she came home very much in liquor and went to bed; I got up at four o'clock in the morning in order to detain her before she went out; I went into the room to tell my wife that she was come down, and the girl went out, I never saw her after till I applied to an officer and took her.</p>
               <p>Q. You never searched her all this time. - A. No, we never searched her till we applied to an officer, we found her in the street, just above my house on Wednesday about one o'clock in the afternoon; in the course of the time, I heard she had bought a great many things with the money; I found a one pound note upon her.</p>

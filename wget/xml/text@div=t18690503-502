                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. George Clark, at 33, Stoke Newington Green—in the beginning of February the prisoners came about a quarter to 6 o'clock, and James asked if Mrs. Clark was at home—I said "No"—she then asked if Mr. Clark was at home—I said "No"—she then asked if Mr. and Mrs. Clark were pretty well—I said "Yes"—she then asked when Mr. Clark would be at home—I said I expected him in almost directly—James then said they had come some distance, and they would rest a few minutes till he came in—I then asked them into the sitting-room—after they went in there Bryant asked for some water—I went down stairs to get it—I was absent about three minutes—when I came back they were standing up—they drank the water, and said, as Mr. and Mrs. Clark had not arrived, they would call again and see them in the morning, and they went away—when Mr. and Mrs. Clark came home, we missed a time-piece, a pair of gold spectacles, and an opera-glass—I saw them safe just before the prisoners came in—I have been in the service about nine months—I had never seen the prisoners before.</p>

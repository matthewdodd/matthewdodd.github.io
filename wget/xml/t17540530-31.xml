               <p>Q. Do you remember the particular time of it?</p>
               <p>Price. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hoops were there?</p>

               <p>Price. They call them vat hoops. The prisoner said to me, we can sell these hoops to Joneswho will buy any thing. He lives in Playhouse-Yard, Whitecross-Street. We sold two to Mr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you all together when you took them away?</p>

               <p>Q. What did you do with the other hoops you had?</p>
               <p>Price. We sold them under London-Wall the very next morning. We were then all together.</p>

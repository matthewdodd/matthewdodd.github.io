             sworn. - I am an officer: On the 18th of May, I was going down the Strand with Mr. Gibbs, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning; we were following three other boys, when I observed the two prisoners behind a hackney-coach, coming from Charing cross towards Temple-bar; I observed Degranges had something under his coat; he jumped down and ran after one of those boys that we were following; they were going towards Charging-cross; the other prisoner jumped down likewise, and was following him, till he turned his head round and saw me; then he immediately ran away and made his escape; Teggatt stopped about half a minute with one of those boys; when he turned round from the boy, I laid hold of him; he immediately unbottoned his coat, and from he coat dropped this piece of handkerchiefs; Mr. Gibbs picked it up, and gave it to me; I have had it in my custody ever since (produces it); Degranges was taken last week; I had seen them both before frequently.</p>
               <p> - GIBBS sworn. - I am a Bow-street officer: On Wednesday, the 18th of May, about half-past ten o'clock, I saw Crocker apprehend Teggatt; I did not see Degranges at all; I went to Crocker's assistance, and picked up the handkerchiefs from his feet; I delivered them to Crocker at the Office.</p>

            (To Mr. Baker.) Can you speak with certainly to those handkerchiefs being your's? - A. It is a very particular pattern, and I have the duplicate of them (produces the fellow-piece); they were printed for me.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of them? - A. I valued them before the Magistrate at five shillings; they are worth thirty shillings.</p>

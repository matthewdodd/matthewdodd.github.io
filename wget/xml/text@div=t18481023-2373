                  </hi>. I live at 5, Mahomet-yard, Chelsea. On Tuesday last, about half-past five o'clock, I was with the prisoner—he had a pen-knife cutting a piece of stick to a point—he kept pricking me in the side with it—I told him if he did not give it to me, I would take it away from him—I took it away, and he said if I did not give it to him, he would job the knife into me, and in his passion he stuck the knife into my elbow—I was struggling with him at the time; he was trying to get the stick away from me—he aimed at my side, and I put my arm up, and received the blow on my elbow—it bled much, and I was taken to a doctor's—he was about half a yard from me, Dear enough to have struck my side, if I had not raised my arm—my arm is very bad now; I have not got the use of it—I am still under the doctor's care—a policeman came up immediately after it was done.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. We were struggling, and the knife pricked his arm by accident—he hit me in the eye. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. We were not struggling when the knife struck me—we had both hold of the wood—he struck me with his right hand—I did not hit him in the eye, or at all: only as he was going to hit me I pushed him away-none of the people passing by told me not to hit him—I knew him before by playing with him in the street—he is twelve years old; I am fifteen—he pricked strangers with the wood besides me, as they went along the road—none of them are here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, A</hi> 245). I came up after the scuffle was over, and Childs was sitting on the kerb-stone, and his arm bleeding violently—he told me Phillips had stabbed him in the arm—the prisoner said it was with a piece of stick, and not with a knife—this is the piece of stick (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb></lb>duced</hi>)—there was a point to it, but it is broken off—I took the prisoner into custody—the prosecutor was taken to a doctor's—I searched for the pen-knife, but did not find it—the prisoner did not appear to have been struck—he complained at the time of having been struck in the eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at 40, Lower George-street, Chelsea. On Tuesday last, Childs was brought to me, bleeding from a wound at his elbow, half an inch deep—it bled a good deal—it was not a dangerous wound—he has not yet got the use of his arm—I have not seen him since Thursday—I told him to come, but he has not been—it is much better now (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it is rather stiff—there is no inflammation—I should think be might use it better than he does—there is a trifling swelling—it required hot fomentations—his mother tells me that has been done—it is such a wound as might be made by a pen-knife—he will be able to use it in a week.</p>

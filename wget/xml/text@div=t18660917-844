                  </hi>. I am a ship-keeper, and live in Corder Street, Poplar—on the night of the 14th August, about half-past eleven, I was in Naval Row, Poplar, with a steward of a vessel, whose name was Slade—we were in the "Prince of Wales" public-house—when we came out several seamen followed us out—as I went up the street I called the steward—I was followed presently by that tall man on the right (<hi rend="italic">Collins</hi>), he was called <hi rend="italic">Scotty</hi>, and two or three others—as I got a little distance up he came up to me and flung me on my back—I got up again directly, and said, "Where is my cap?"—he said, "I have not got your cap"—I said, "Some one has; it is a villainous trick to serve a man that way"—I walked on a little farther, calling to the steward, and had got about seven or eight yards, when I was knocked down again by Collins—he jumped on me and said, "I want your money, and I must have it"—I said, "I have got no money"—he said, "You have," and he felt in my pockets, and turned them out—I pulled at my pocket myself as well as I could, but there was another one on me, and that young gentleman there on the left (<hi rend="italic">Young</hi>), he was in the presence, but there was another young fellow much like him, and I can't swear whether it was him or the other—Young was with them at one time, but not at the time of, the robbery—I have been looking ever since to find the other one, but he can't be found—I lost 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. (that was all I had) and my cap—the men got up, and one of the men belonging to the ship said to Collins, "Scotty, leave that man alone, or it will be a bad day for you," and he said to me, "If you molest me I will settle you another time"—with that I got up and ran away, and found a policeman and made a report to him—we went back, and the prisoners were apprehended directly afterwards—Slade is not here to-day—I don't know where he is—I have been trying to find out—he sent no a letter to his lodging to say that he would be there on Sunday evening, but he has not arrived yet.</p>

I live at 9, St. Leonard's Avenue, Bromley, and work on the river—on the night of the 14th August I was near the "Prince of Wales" public-house—I saw the prosecutor come out, and seven or eight men followed him—when they got him out into the road they knocked him down—Collins said to Gray, "You have been robbing that man" (meaning Slade)—he said, "No, I have not; that is my mate, and I am with him"—Collins then struck the prosecutor in the face, and knocked him on the ground—he said, "Now give me your money"—he said, "I have none," and Collins felt in his pocket; what he took from him I can't say—while he was doing that another man knelt on his breast—I don't know who it was—Young was there, and another party very much like him—I did not see any one else but the prosecutor—after Collins took his money he picked him up and knocked him on the ground again, and struck his head on the kerb—I followed them—they beat the steward after that—then the prosecutor got up and ran away—I followed the men till a policeman came up, and saw him take them all—Young was not taken at the same time—the other three are the three who were there.</p>

On the night of the 14th August, in consequence of information, I went to Preston Street, and saw the prosecutor there, and also saw Collins, Cass, and O'Connell there together—the last witness said to me, in their presence, " There is a man lying nearly dead in Naval Row; he has been knocked about and robbed"—I went down and saw the steward Slade lying on the ground, bleeding very much—I then ran back again into Preston Street, and took Collins into custody—the last witness said, "That is one of the men," pointing to Collins," and that is another, and that is another, "pointing to Cass and O'Connell—that was on the first interview, when he came up—when I told Collins the charge he said, "I know nothing about it"—after I took him to the station I went back again into High Street, and O'Connell was pointed out to me by Blackstone and another boy—I took him into custody, told him the charge, and he said, "I know nothing about it"—he called out to Cass," Pat, follow me to the station, so as you will be able to take word down to the ship where I am, "which he did, and he was charged also—he was pointed out by Slade as being one who knocked him about—Gray came to the station and identified Collins—he appeared to me to have been drinking—the prisoners had also been drinking—I have en<lb></lb>deavoured to get Slade here—he is in Liverpool—he was bound over—I took Young about an hour after at Brunswick Pier—Blackstone pointed him out—I took him to the station, and he was identified by Slade as being one of the men—he said, "I know nothing about it; I was not there at the time"—he was sober.—<hi rend="smallCaps">

            , ESQ. I live at Uxbridge. On Wednesday, the 4th of November, about twelve o'clock,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181812020013"></xptr>at noon, I met the prisoner at Uxbridge, at this end of the town, which is in Middlesex. I was in my gig with Mr. Norton - the prisoner was riding a brown gelding, and leading a roan gelding - each of them were in halter, and not saddled. I wanted to buy a roan horse, and asked if they were for sale? he said Yes. The roan horse was too small for me, and I declined buying it. He said the price of the brown horse, was 25 guineas, or 40 l. for the two. I said to Mr. Norton, in the prisoner's presence, that the brown horse was worth all the money. Mr. Norton asked where he brought them from? He said from Tilekiln Farm, near Oxford, and that he was taking them to London to sell, but to no particular place. From the price he asked, and his general conduct, Mr. Norton immediately charged him with stealing them; the prisoner said if he thought so, he was willing to leave them with him. He said he had been detained at Beaconsfield the night before on suspicion, but was released by the magistrate. Mr. Norton offered to give him the price for the horses, and lodge the money in the Bank, and if he found his story correct, he would pay him. He followed us to Mr. Norton's house - as soon as he got there, he loosed the roan horse, and gallopped away on the brown one. We pursued, and took him - he was stopped in a lane which he ran down, at the gate, which was locked. He got off the horse then, and ran over two fields - I got on the horse, overtook him, and brought him back to Uxbridge. I neither promised or threatened him - I asked him whom the horses belonged to?. He said,</p>
               <p>"As soon as I get out of the croud, I will tell you." I took him to Mr. Norton's house. He then said the brown horse belonged to Mr. Brown, of Chesrelton, and the roan horse to Mr. Washbourne, of Overton - I gave him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the horses - A. They were put in Mr. Norton's stables, and sworn to by the prosecutors, and their servants.</p>

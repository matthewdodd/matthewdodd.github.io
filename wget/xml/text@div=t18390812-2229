                  </hi>. I keep the Duke's Head public-house, in Great Peter-street, Westminster. Between twelve and one o'clock at night on the 22nd of July, the house was closed, I was trying to get the people away as fast as possible—there were seven left—the prisoner was one of them—they worked at the gas-works—I had stopped serving them, and told them it was time to go—I had coppers in the till in the bar—it was locked, and the key left in it—I left to see all fast in, the back part of the house, and on my returning, the prisoner had got his hand on the till, and was taking the coppers out—I collared him, and called for assistance—he got hold of me—my wife came, and got his hands from me—he got from me, and tried to get out—the policeman came and took him—I found 101/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. In his hand—he gave me that—I have known him a long time—I never knew any thing against him.</p>

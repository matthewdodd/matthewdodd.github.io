                  </hi>. I am a widow, and now live at No. 21, Albion-street. I lodged at No. 10, in that street—I entered on the 28th of Nov.—I saw a bill in the window, and I was ordered to be in that street, on account of my daughter Sybella Jane Baker who is very ill, and cannot come here—I went to No. 10, and the prisoner Garner opened the door—I conversed with her about the lodgings, and agreed upon some terms—she said her name was Holt—I did not see Holt at all—I wrote this paper, and I asked that it should be signed—Garner said she could not write, but she would take it to her husband to sign—she took it, and brought it back signed "M. Holt"—on the 28th I entered in possession of the lodging—I had my daughter's things put into her room, and mine into mine—there was an eye-glass, a bracelet without a clasp, some silk, two bags, some parcels of cord, some braid, and woollen-cloth, belonging to my daughter—there was a cork-screw belonging to me—it was kept in a bag in my room—it was only used by me, not in common—from time to time I missed some things—in consequence of a communication made to me by my daugh-ter, I made a search—we searched for the bags and every article in them, on</p>

               <p>the 8th of Dec., and we could not find them—I afterwards searched for other things—the bags contained all the things stated—I did not miss the cork-screw till I found it in the kitchen drawer—I used to draw my lavender water with it—all the things produced were found at once by the officer in a drawer in the kitchen where I had never been—I did not know Garner was not Mrs. Holt, till Saturday, the 17th, when I rang the bell to pay her—then Garner came up—she went by the name of Ann—I had always paid her before—she said she was not Mrs. Holt—I had always called her Mrs. Holt when first I went, and she desired me to call her Ann, because it was shorter—she did the work at the house as servant—I saw no mistress there—the first day that I went Mrs. Holt open<lb></lb>ed the door—I asked Garner who it was let me in—she said it was her sister—I never saw Mrs. Holt after that day till the 17th of Dec., when I saw Mrs. Holt, and told her that Ann said she was Mrs. Holt, and I thought 1 could pay her—Mrs. Holt then said she was Mrs. Holt, and I was to pay her, that Ann was her housekeeper—after that I was sent for to the station, where 1 saw Garner—I saw Mrs. Holt again on Saturday, the 21th—there was an account given of the property I had lost, before Garner and Mrs. Holt<lb></lb>Garner said she had called the night before at No. 21, to give an eye-glass to me—I said, "I had not heard anything about it"—I had heard nothing, but a message she had sent about a tin that was sent to be mended—I asked if she brought the eye-glass, why she did not send it up—she said she was afraid to trust the servant with it—I asked her what she bad done with it—she said, "Given it to Mrs. Holt"—then the Magistrate ordered the policeman to go to Holt's house—I went with him—Mrs. Holt was there—I told her that the servant said she had got an eye-glass to take care of—Holt said she had never seen it, and had not got it—she told the policeman the same thing—we proceeded to search the boxes which she said belonged to Garner, and there we found a bonnet and a duplicate of a ring, and in a drawer in the kitchen, where Mrs. Holt said Garner put things in, we found the cork-screw, pieces of cloth, part of the bracelet, and two bags belonging to my daughter—a person named Godfery brought me the eye-glass and two pocket handkerchiefs belonging to my daughter.</p>

               <p>—I went to the station in a carriage—it took me about ten minutes to go there from Albion-street—I think the station is in Hermitage-street—I should think it is a mile—I knew nothing of the charge of a pound of batter, till I heard of it at the station—I think it was on Monday or Tuesday—I did not say anything about it—I did not refuse to pay for it—I was not at home when the man came—I went to the station about the ring, when the man said he would not continue the charge about the butter—I did not say,"I will make a charge"—I am quite sure I did not say so—before I left the house, on the 17th of Dec., Holt said there were several things that were broken—we searched—in consequence of what Godfery said, and what was found in the kitchen, I preferred a charge against Holt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a messenger at Boyle's Court Guide-office, in Regent-street. On the 23rd of Dec. I went to Mrs. Holt's house during the time the policeman was in the house—after they had left the house, Holt told me she had found the glass in the rubbish-drawer, but the girl had not given it to her, but to prevent the girl getting into trouble she would wish to put it out of the way—we went down stairs, and Mrs. Holt asked me what she should do—I told her, possibly, as she had denied all knowledge of the glass to the officer and lady, it might be advisable if she could place it in the lodg<lb></lb>ing which Mrs. Baker had originally occupied—Holt said she thought it would not be advisable, because, by so doing, it would show the glass was in the house, and would coincide with the statement the girl had made of having given her the glass—I then asked her where the property was—she said in</p>

               <p>the register of the front-parlour-stove—she again asked me if it would not be advisable to place the glass in a box which she believed had not been ex<lb></lb>mined by the policeman, and which was in the room, under the bed—she then placed the eye-glass in a piece of cloth, and placed it in the box—after that she altered her mind, and proposed that the handkerchiefs should be de<lb></lb>stroyed, and whether, if the eye-glass were put down the water-closet, it would effectually keep it out of the way—I advised her not to destroy the property—I was then speaking in presence of her son—she took the eye-glass out of the box, and brought it into the kitchen, and thought it still advisable to de<lb></lb>stroy them; but sooner than have them destroyed I agreed to take them away—she gave me the eye-glass, and told me to go to the pump in the passage, and look inside, I should find two handkerchiefs—I went, and found two handkerchiefs—I had called at the house in the first week in Dec., and saw Mrs. Holt there.</p>

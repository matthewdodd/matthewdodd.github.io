                  </hi>. I live at Shadwell, with my father and mother—I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Clontarf</hi>, in Sept.; we were off St. Helena, on 22nd or 23rd Sept.—Buonaventura was <hi rend="italic">serang</hi> of the coloured men; I recollect his being put in irons; that was because the rest of the crew expressed a wish to go on shore and see a Magistrate, in consequence of the ill-treatment and starving they had received on board the ship; they were flogged and kicked several times—upon their stating that, they were called <hi rend="italic">aft</hi> to the cabin one by one, and seized and put in irons, five of them—Buonaventura was one of the five; he remained in irons twenty-four or twenty-five hours—I cannot say in what way they were ironed, I was in the forecastle under medical treat<lb></lb>ment at the time—I believe they were not fed while they were in irons; I did not see any provisions taken to them—the next day they were released from their irons, and returned to their duty till the evening part; they were released in the morning time, I cannot exactly say what time—in the even<lb></lb>ing, I heard Buonaventura's name called by one of the boys to go to the wheel, and he went <hi rend="italic">aft</hi>, him and me were in the forecastle at the time; he went <hi rend="italic">aft</hi> to go to the wheel, and passed by the captain about a yard, when he was called back by the captain, who had some conversation with him, which I did not hear—one of the apprentice boys was standing on the poop, and I saw him run down towards the cabin, and return immediately with this boarding pike—the captain took it from him, and gave the boatswain a blow on the shoulder—the boatswain fell on his knees with the blow; the captain <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with it and hit him a second time on the arm—I saw the arm fall, and the boatswain sung out, "<hi rend="italic">Saib, saib</hi>! broke, broke!" <hi rend="italic">saib</hi> means, "Sir"—when the first blow was struck, I called the doctor, Charles Bremen, but the captain could not hear what passed between us; he was in the after part of the ship, and I in the fore; Buonaventura then came forward, and the doctor looked at his arm, and began to dress it—we had no splints on the ship, and the doctor was obliged to apply something else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You were in the forecastle, below? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I had been</p>

               <p>ill some time in consequence of my ill treatment on board the ship—I had been flogged, and tied up—the night before this happened there was an inquiry on board the ship as to an alleged mutiny—the result of that was that the captain said that three of us were the ringleaders, and swore he would hang one of us next morning, he did not care which it was—I got a flogging, and sixteen or seventeen besides—there were very few escaped—we were rope's ended about the ship—I was seized up to the mizenmast and flogged, and another man at the rigging, and also the third mate named Staff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the third mate sent forward to act as a seaman on account of not being able to do his duty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was sent forward on account of being sick—his rations were stopped, and he came into the forecastle, and I divided my rations into three parts, and gave the chief mate one part, the third mate another, and myself the remainder—plenty of the coloured men were flogged—when Buonaventura was called aft I was sitting on his chest, against the door—I was under medical treatment at the time—I was not in my hammock, I had not been in all day—I had received no rations all day, and I was looking out for the steward to ask for some—when Buona<lb></lb>ventura got about a yard by the captain he was called back, and I saw there was some conversation—I could not hear it—the apprentice was within two yards of the captain—that was about a minute or so before the apprentice was sent down—when he came back the captain took the boarding spike and struck the man—he must have said something first, but I could not hear it—I was examined before the Magistrate.</p>

I would have nothing to do with it, because I knew I should be seized up, and flogged next morning for it—I never saw the coloured men undoing his arm—it came undone itself in the bunk where he laid; I saw the coloured men looking at it, putting the bandage on, but not taking it off—I recollect the captain going on shore at St. Helena; he ordered the sails to be furled, and the ship scrubbed round—when he came back the sails had been furled, and the ship partly scrubbed by the Europeans on board—he did not order the black men to do anything which they refused to do; it was late at night when he came back, he did not see the men that night—I did not hear him complain that the ship had not been prepared—the captain was obliged to get men from the shore to prepare the ship for sea, but that was when he had the coloured men confined in irons—they were confined because they refused to work until they saw a Magistrate, or an officer from the <hi rend="italic">Penelope</hi> man-of-war, which was lying there—I gave one of them a letter to take; the waterman gave it to the captain, and I was flogged for it afterwards; I am only now getting well from it—I had thirteen lashes across the thick of the leg, but the captain counted twelve only; the first blow the boy gave me, the captain said, "I will give you two for that," and he took the gutta percha whip out of the boy's hand and gave it me across the thigh, and said, "John, I believe</p>

               <p>that is a tickler for you;" and he kept saying, "Fancy John, steam along," which was a nick-name I had—I did not sometimes advise the men not to work till they got provisions; I advised them to ask the captain's leave to see a Magistrate—the men were complaining on the night of the trial, the captain was in a state of intoxication, with a pistol in one hand and a whip in the other, and kept putting the pistol in the men's mouths; and the chief mate acted as clerk, and took down the depositions on a slate—I was once before a Magistrate on the Island of Mauritius for being intoxicated on shore; I was fined 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—that is the only time I have ever been before a Magi<lb></lb>strate, either making a charge, or charged myself—I used to see Bremen every day after we came home till I went to my father and mother's; and I have been at his house three or four times; I went there to see the chief mate, who lodged in the same house, when we were wanted to attend the police-court; we had several cases to bring against Mr. Harrison—Anthony Laurence was one who had a case to bring against the captain—I do not know whether Bremen was another—Bremen was confined, and kicked, and treated about the same as the rest of us, and his rations stopped; that was the first medi<lb></lb>cine applied on board, when we were taken bad the rations were stopped—I had been having jalap three days running, I complained, and the captain ordered the doctor to put twelve drops of croton oil in it, and put the pistol to his ear, and ordered him to give it me; and the captain gave me a kick, of which I have the mark now—I told the captain he was very cowardly towards me, and when I came to London I would seek redress—I never told him I would take redress into my own hands; I was too frightened—I do not ever recol<lb></lb>lect telling any one to fire the ship—after we crossed the line the captain threatened to shave me; I said I could not help it; he said a little bit of a <hi rend="italic">touch-up</hi> would bring the swelling out of me, and he commenced the shaving that night—the captain sat down under the break of the poop, and his wife and child, and one of the female passengers out of the two that were on board; there was a large tub of water fixed on one side, and the boys were there—I was culled aft when I was getting my supper—several of them were called a before me, and when they came forward again their hair and face was full of tar—we had then passed the line nineteen or twenty days—we were seven weeks and four or five days coming from the line to England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I must have an answer to my question; I want to know whether you have said or heard others say anything about firing the ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till that night—that night I was sent for; I went aft, and one of the men, Hanson, who was officiating as Neptune, said, "Here is Fancy Jack, I am glad to see you;" and the captain said, "Give him a rubbing up"—they asked me my name; I said, "You have no occasion to ask my name; I have been across the line oftener than those who are going to perform the operation on me;" they set me down on a large tub of water, with a piece of board across it; I was <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> backwards, and as soon as I got up my eyes were blinded, and they asked me my name again; and one of the boys dabbed a lot of tar all over my face, and tried to rub it into my mouth; and when I made no answer, this man Neptune asked me several questions, and then the captain said, "Let him go:" and some of the coloured men were brought <hi rend="italic">aft</hi> again; I had to remain by the tub; I had to bring the next man <hi rend="italic">aft</hi>, and the men were asked different questions, and the <hi rend="italic">combustibles</hi> which were mixed up were tar and pig's dung, to <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> in their mouths; and they were asked who told them to <hi rend="italic">knock off</hi> work on that night; they said they saw the other men <hi rend="italic">knock off</hi>, and they wanted to see "<hi rend="italic">Justice</hi>," meaning a Magistrate—I should think we were fourteen or fifteen days coming from</p>

               <p>St. Helena to the line, and we had passed the line nineteen or twenty days when this happened—at the end of about forty days from St. Helena the men were asked why they <hi rend="italic">knocked off</hi> work at St. Helena—I have seen shaving in fourteen or fifteen ships; in many ships it is not performed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What about firing the ship? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I heard nothing till that night, when I heard one of the men say that the captain said that Laurence was ordered to set the ship on fire—I did not hear anything said at the same time about breaking the captain's legs; I had more conversation with these men (<hi rend="italic">the Malays</hi>), on account of speaking part of the language, and I repeatedly told them to keep quiet till we got to England, and then go to a Magistrate—I am not what they call a <hi rend="italic">sea lawyer</hi>; I have never been charged with it—I did not at any time take an axe from the cook's <hi rend="italic">caboose</hi>, and take it to my berth, and when it was found say I had taken it to hammer my chest—I did not take it; the man who took it is in Court; his name is De Cruse.</p>

               <p>Buonaventura came there this day or yesterday month, he was suffering from an ununited fracture of the arm—it had been broken some time previously about two inches above the elbow, and was not united at all—there may be a great many causes why it was not united—it may have been from bad living, or not being properly done, or a variety of causes—I set it, and have attended him since—it is very likely he will never recover the use of it again.</p>

                  </hi>. I was second mate of this ship—it is 1,091 tons burden—I recollect the Malays being shipped at Calcutta—they shipped as able bodied seamen, but they were useless; we shipped Hayes at Calcutta also, and he was equally as bad, he laid up most part of the passage, and it was stated he was the ringleader among the others to make them <hi rend="italic">knock off</hi>—that was stated in his presence by the third mate, and put in the log book—the third mate made a confession to the captain in the presence of the chief mate, me, and the doctor, and said that Hayes was leader of the gang—I heard the third mate, in Hayes' presence, state to the captain that Hayes said, "Now my lads is the time to <hi rend="italic">knock off</hi>—the captain cannot get men here, and he will have to let you go—there is a man-of-war here, and he cannot go to sea without you"—that was at St. Helena—I remember the captain going on shore at St. Helena—when he came on board again the men refused to weigh anchor; and we had to get a number of men from the shore to purchase the anchor—we had to hire the men from the shore, in consequence of the men refusing to work—the chief mate went into the forecastle and asked the men one after another whether they would, work, and they said, "No"—Hayes was laid up in the forecastle at the time—the mate asked the boatswain afterwards, and he said, "My men no work, me no work"—the captain acted very well to me throughout—on the passage home, with the crew we had, and loosing the sails and yards, it was enough to irritate any man, at St. Helena it was proposed to <hi rend="italic">knock off</hi>, and it was stated by the coloured men that they had thought to <hi rend="italic">knock off</hi> at the Cape of Good Hope—when the coloured men were let out of irons, one of them stated that one gave another a knife to cut the captain's and my throat, and then fire the ship—I never saw any cruelty on the part of the captain, or any sort of discipline, except what was necessary for the ship—the captain's wife and child and two female passengers were on board.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a seaman on board the <hi rend="italic">Clontarf</hi>—twelve men came on board from St. Helena, to get up the anchor—they were slaves from the coast of Africa—the other men had refused duty—I did not see Hayes refuse duty, he was lying in his hammock at the time—I never heard him recommend the coloured men not to work—we were not short of provi<lb></lb>sions; I was a seaman; I did not mess in the cabin—I always had my fair provision till it ran short, and it was made up in the Channel again—we were short of provisions for about a fortnight before we got into the Channel—when at St. Helena we had our fair provisions—I recollect the shaving, it is the custom in general in ships—it was conducted in the same way as such operations are generally performed—it is only for <hi rend="italic">fun</hi>, only to keep up the old thing—one man is dressed as Neptune, another man is then placed on the tub and asked questions, and the moment he opens his mouth some stuff is sent just on his lips, not in his mouth—I saw Hayes shaved; he would not allow it at all, and there is no compulsion—he was not shaved at all—there is no truth in saying they sent a quantity of tar and pig's dung into his mouth, they never sent anything at all.</p>

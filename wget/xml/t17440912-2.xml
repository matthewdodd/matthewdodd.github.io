            . I lost some things, but little thought this boy had got them. I hope, gentlemen, you will be favourable to him on account of his age, he is a neighbour's child. I never knew any harm of him before; I missed the things and charged him with taking them, for he had been at my house the night before; upon which he cried and confessed that he took them, and had pawned them to one Mrs. Aris in Baldwin's-Gardens. I went there and saw the things, and because I refused to pay her for them, she swept them off the counter and would not let me have them.</p>

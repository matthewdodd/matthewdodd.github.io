                  </hi>. I am in the service of John Tyeth Bounsall. On the 9th of June the prisoner came into our shop for some shirt-buttons—there were some scarfs and handkerchiefs on the counter—he said, "I can look at these while you are serving the customers"—he did so, and he took a hand<lb></lb>kerchief out of his hat, threw it over the things, and said, "I want one as good as that"—I said, "I have not one"—I saw his hand under the hand<lb></lb>kerchief, and took hold of him, and said, "You are robbing me"—he said, "Oh dear, it is quite a mistake"—I put the articles in a box—I then dis<lb></lb>missed the customer, and in a minute or two I saw the lid was off the box, and nearly every thing was out of it—I saw him take these articles, and he was putting them into his hat—I had no one in the shop—the servant came in—I sent her to call my employer down—the prisoner had just said, "I will take this handkerchief"—I said it was 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—my employer came in—I put it into my employer's hand, and said, "Is this mark right?"—he said, "Yes"—the prisoner was trembling—I reached over, and seized him—he took these out of his hat, threw them down, and threw the one he had away.</p>

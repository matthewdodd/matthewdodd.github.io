                  </hi>. I live with my father, at 6, Blue Anchor-yard, York-street, Westminster—on 11th August, about half-past 10 in the morning, I was at the door of a public-house and the prisoner spoke to me—he said, "Go and get me a quarter of a pound of cheese, and I will wait till you come back"—he showed me the shop and gave me a half-crown—I went to the shop—Mr. Morrell gave me the cheese—I gave him the half crown—he tried it and it broke—I gave him a description of the prisoner—I was in the shop about an hour talking to Mr. Morrell—after then I went out with the cheese, and went to the Blue Anchor to see if I could see him, but he was not there—I saw a man who is not here, but did not give him the cheese—he spoke to me about it—I went that day with a policeman to a house—I saw the prisoner and his wife—the constable said, "Is that the man," and I said "Yes"—I had seen him before, and his wife and also the other man, but I never saw him with the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a cheesemonger's shop—on 11th August this little girl came for a quarter of a pound of cheese, and gave me a half<lb></lb>crown—I tested it and broke a piece off it—it was bad—she gave me a description of a youngish looking man, with a long dark coat and dark cap, and without any beard or moustache; and I think she said he had a broad chin—I detained her, sent for a policeman, and went outside the door and looked for the man—about a quarter of an hour after the girl came I saw the prisoner pass the shop and look in very hard—he was dressed in a long dark coat and a cap—he went to the cow-yard—I saw him again half an hour afterwards with another man—I went out, met a constable, and then sent the girl out with the cheese—I saw the man who I had seen with the prisoner go and speak to her—I am quite certain of him—the constable</p>

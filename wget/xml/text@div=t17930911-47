             if she would not tell me where the goods were I should take her on suspicion, and if she did, I said, I would not hurt her; in consequence of that I found my property; she put on her bonnet and cloak directly, and took me and another young man up into a field, and she shewed us the tea chest and the watch, and this case under a sir bush, it was very visible, you might have seen it in the open road almost within twenty yards; we brought that home, she took us into the lodgings, and on the bed's head she said there was a tea spoon and tea tongs.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with regard to your house you was the last person that went to bed, you was not the first person that went out in the morning? - No, it was the soldier that went out first in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any violence done to your house at all? - No, none at all, the sash window was thrown open that was all, the room was on the ground floor. There appeared to be no violence done to any part of the house, the street door was fastened with a chain that went across, that chain was undone but no violence, the chain was unhooked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light when this soldier came up to you? - Yes, it was quite light, it was early in July the sun was rose; the soldier is not here, he is with his regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any idea how the people got into the house? - All that I know is, that the window was down when I went to bed, and was open when I got up in the morning; the window was not fastened only pulled down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was a mahogany watch stand lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that? - This watch was in this stand.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the watch a ribbon and key? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there nine hundred and sixty halfpence in the tea chest? - I never particularly counted them; I suppose there were that number or more.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of the watch? - It is not of great worth, it was my grandfather's, it is not worth much, it never goes true, if I was to sell it I would sell it for half a guinea, but I do not want to sell it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the tea chest? - It is a mahogany one, very small, two shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the price of the tea spoon? - I would sell it for six-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of the tea tongs? - I think they are worth five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the two prisoners live together, cohabit together? - Not to my knowledge, I have often seen them walking together, he used to come to her to my house when she was at work for my lodgers, she washed for them.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you last seen the soldier in your house? how long before this robbery? - I cannot recollect, it may be a week, or more. As to the woman I was told she had been there the day the robbery was committed, I did not see her there. As to the other articles they are all in the hands of the constable.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This man is a soldier. Do you know that that part of his company that were quartered at Kensington, were obliged to be out some miles from Kensington at the night the robbery was committed? - He was quartered at the Robin Hood, about three miles from my house;</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore his quarters were not at Kensington at that night? - I found the billet was changed that very day.</p>

               <p>Q. Which some people sell thirty shillings for a guinea? - I here are not many good halfpence going.</p>
               <p>Q. On the contrary you hardly ever meet with a good halfpenny in the country? - I should be very sorry not to do it sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. So that though there may be forty shillings of halfpence, they may not be worth twenty shillings; I believe you first of all took James, and then you discharged him? - I took the girl in the fact.</p>
               <p>Court. What do you mean? - When she told me where the things were I mean. I stopped James for some time in the house, and I had the curiosity to search him, I felt about his clothes, and I found nothing, and I let him go about his business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the corporal of his regiment? - Not by name.</p>

               <p>I belong to Mr. Jennings; I was going over Kensington Bridge the 7th of July last, on Sunday morning, between five and six o'clock, and I met Mr. Hanson, and he told me he had been robbed, and he suspected some persons, and being clerk to a justice I made out an information, and got a search warrant signed, and got a constable, and went to this woman's lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you get to this lodging? - I believe it was after six o'clock; the constable searched and did not find any thing; the prosecutor told the girl that he was sure that she had got the property, if she would tell where it was she should not be hurt, and she went with him, and it was found; she took us into a garden and shewed him the silver watch, and I picked up this watch at the gate, and the tea chest; that is all I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing about the bed? - The prosecutor asked where the spoons and sugar tongs were; and she told, and we went back and found them about the bed; when I came back the soldier was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not attempt to detain him? - Not at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the soldier to be taken up afterwards if you let him go? - I believe he was first taken into custody by command of his officer for being out of his quarter, and after that he was detained on suspicion.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he was taken up? - I was not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What the man is taken up for, is merely what you have heard? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the man, after Mr. Hanson had searched him a little, was suffered to go about his business? - He was. To the best of my knowledge the man went out of the house before the woman went to shew us where the things were.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Hanson. How came you to take him up? - I never took him up; I never knew he was taken up till I was sent for up to the office.</p>

             together, we searched the room round, and found nothing, we then came down stairs, and searched every part below, Hanson went to Hawkins, and told her if she would tell him where the things were he would not hurt them, so as he might get them. She then went up stairs, put her bonnet on, and said if we would follow her she would shew us where they were; she went up with us to Chapel-field, about a quarter of a mile from the house of the prosecutor, we went up that field, and we looked under some bushes before we came to it, we looked under a small sir, and there we found a small tea chest, she shewed us the tea chest, a watch stand, and watch; we then came back the other way, not the way we went; as we came along I asked her to inform us where the tea tongs and tea spoons were, she did not like at first, but afterwards she said they were at home, we then went down to her lodgings, and there we found them on the top of the tester of her bed. I have had the care of these things from that time to this. (Produced and deposed to by Hanson.)</p>

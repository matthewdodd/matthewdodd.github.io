                  </hi>. I live at 2, Canterbury Place, Lambeth Road—I was: a clerk—in March, 1866, I made, the acquaintance of Charles Webb, and he employed me as clerk, at 54, Cornhill—there was an office there—it con<lb></lb>sisted of two rooms, on the, second, floor;, at least, one room, and a little lobby—I knew him by the name of Charles Webb, and no others—the business carried on was the London and Provincial Plate Glass Insurance Company—that was put on the office-door; and also on the doors, at the entrance of the passage—I was to have 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I made the arrangement with Charles Webb—I saw nothing of George Webb till six months or more afterwards—I was there, altogether, about eighteen months—I was, engaged on 18th March. 1866, and I went about a week afterwards—I continued there till August, 1867, regularly, except being occasionally laid up with the gout—Charles Webb acted as manager of the company—there were forms of policies in the office—I was asked by Charles Webb to sign in the name of Joseph Watts Lodge—he did not like the name of Dodge—I occasionaly signed policies, not many—a few—I made them out—I signed them as secretary—Charles Webb signed his name as Charles Randall—I under stand his name is Charles Randal Webb—I frequently, saw, him sign as Charles Rahdall—George Webb came there occasionally while I was there—I don't know that he did anything at first—I believe, after some months. he was appointed as an agent—I never received, any Moneys from him—I did not give him like policies—after he became agent he might, come there more frequently—I can't say how often—he had nothing to do with the policies, so far as I know, except receiving them occasionally, I suppose, to take out, after they were executed—I never saw him pay over any moneys or receive any from Charles—I knew Frederick Webb—I Was not present at his trial—I have seen him there many times—he sometimes brought me my Money—I have seen him sign policies; but I never noticed what he signed; it was no business of mine—Frederick Webb used to, pass, in the name of Sidney, in the way of receipts, when he was out as an agent—I think I once saw a receipt signed by him in the name of Sidney—it might have been a policy, I can't say—it is over two years ago—I know of no</p>

W. underneath—I should not like to swear it; I believe it is—here is another order to Mr. Mote—I don't know whose writing it is—it is not mine—it is a similar form to the other—it is a form in use in the office—the C. G. W the same—I can't swear for the other part—here are five orders in my writing—I wrote them by the direction of Charles Webb—I believe the whole of these others to be in Charles Webb's writing—this letter of 1st September, 1866, directed to Mr. Mote is my writing, by the direction of Charles. Webb—previous to writing that letter Mr. Mote had been wanting payment of money—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sir, your account is to hand; it till be examined and reported upon in a few days. Yours respectfully, James Watts Lodge, secretary")—This one was also written by me by Charles Webb's direction; "London, September 17th, 1866. Dear Sir. I am instructed by the directors to inform you that your account will be settled on 8th October."—I wrote those letters from instructions, I copied them from written instructions, on loose pieces of paper—I am sure I wrote them by the direction of Charles Webb—I did not call his attention to the expression "the directors," I thought it was all <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi>—OK 30th March, 1867, I wrote this letter to Mote—that was from instructions: "Dear Sir. We shall be happy to see you here next Thursday, to make some definite arrangements relatives to your account. Yours respectfully, J. W. Lodge."—I saw Mr. Mote at the office once, I imagine that was after I had written that letter—he was not paid any money, that I am aware of—there is more than one person's hand writing to this policy—the second signature, George Edward, is that of I Webster—the body of it is mine, that was my duty—I filled up the policies by Charles Webb's direction—he has signed it in the name of Charles Randall—I did not give out the policy, I merely made it out—I can't tell bow many policies like that I have made out—some days there were not any—it might go for weeks without any—there was a policy kept, and the rotation number was kept correctly from some number that was started with—I should say they did not begin with No. 1—I commenced from a book that was in use—this is a written number—I should say I filled up nearer 500 than 100, I should think over a thousand—this is not the policy book, it is an agency book—part of it is in my writing—it was kept in the office—it contains the names of the agents—I could not say that I made out policies for all the agents—I have seen the agents at the office—I cant tell what has become of them—there might have been many policies issued from the office, not through agents—I have taken money occasionally by instruction—if any person brought money to pay into the office I took it, and that would be used for petty cash—very little was received—the money was paid for the insurance of their plate glass—in those cases the polices were issued—my name is down in this book as an agent—policies issued at the office was not put down as my agency business—my agency business was very little—I got it by making applications, the same as other agents, and I was paid a commission upon the custom I introduced from out of doors—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not my writing—I don't know whose it is—</p>

               <p>it is written on one of the headings of the company that were in use in the office—I don't think any claims were made for broken glass for six or seven months after George Webb came there—I can't say how many claims were made while I was there—a great many were made where the glass was replaced—not only by Mr. Mote but by other parties who have paid small amounts, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I could not tell how many claims, altogether, have been made, without the entry-book—I don't know where it is—every claim was attended to as soon as it could be, according to instructions—when I left the company, about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was owing to me for wages—I left because I became disgusted with the affair—I could not positively swear whether, before I left, persons had complained that they could not get their glass replaced—there might hare been one or two instances—I believe everything was replaced as far as they could possibly do it—I could not point out any special case where a claim was made and not paid, of cannot remember any—it is two years ago—I knew nothing of the office at 14A, Lime Street—I never went there—all the time I was employed it was at cornhill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Collins—on 9th September, I was at Harrow Weal Park—I did not receive this letter from my husband—I expected to do so on Tuesday—on the Wednesday the prisoner brought me a letter, and I said, "I ought to have received a letter yesterday"—he said that most likely it was wrongly directed—I asked him again next day, and he said that he knew nothing about it, and on the Friday he asked me if I had heard anything about it—I said, "It is mentioned in this one you brought this morning; he posted it, and he wants an answer to Monday night's letter"—he said most likely I should hear of it—that was about 11 o'clock on Friday, and I heard of it through the police about half-past 8 that night—one of the letters the prisoner brought contained nothing but postage stamps and in an envelope, and the other was a letter—the prisoner said, before I opened it, "These are stamps; shall I change them for you?"—it was not clear to everybody that there were stamps in it; you could not sea them through the envelope, but it was thick—I gave them to him to change, and he brought me black the money for them—I understand that he is very much respected in that neighbourhood—I know that he was on friendly terms with Mrs. Beswick, where I was staying, I know nothing to the contrary.</p>

I am charge-taker at the Stanmore Post-office; that is the principal letter carrier, and I take charge of the letter carriers—the prisoner was employed at that office as an auxillary letter carrier—he had been there two years—on 10th September, the mail bag arrived at about a quarter before 9 in the morning—this letter was in the prisoner's delivery if it came to the Stanmore office—it is not stamped there; the last stamp is at the North Western office—on 13th September, about 12 o'clock, I went with Mr. 'Style to the prisoner's <hi rend="italic">lodgings.</hi>—the prisoner was there, and I asked him for his pouch—he went out of the room into the next room where his pouch bung on the coal-cellar door, took something out of it, and flung it upon the coals—I said, "I will not have anything flung away"—I searched the coals and found this envelope—he did not see me find it—he was at that moment given in custody—I gave it to Mr. Styles.</p>

The man jumped up, and said, he would drink with me; he asked me to treat him; I said no; he was a perfect stranger. He then said, he would drink with me; I told him I had no more than five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181405250014"></xptr>pennyworth of halfpence and a one-pound note in my pocket; I did not mind spending the halfpence on him. He catched hold of me by the breast, and shoved me back upon a form that was there. I had not been a minute sitting there, before I felt a hand come out of my right hand breeches pocket; I made a grasp at the hand. I catched hold of the hand as it was going behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whose hand it was - A. Yes; Mary Morris's hand. I never saw her before. I jumped up, and told the bar-maid that I was done, that I had lost my watch and note. I turned my pocket inside out, to shew the people that I had lost my money. They asked me to describe the note; I said, the first figures were a 3 and a 1.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you in your pocket when you went into that wine-vaults - A. I had five pennyworth of halfpence, a farthing, and a one-pound bank note.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the halfpence gone as well as the note and the watch - A. No, they did not take the halfpence. I paid for the ale with the halfpence, and it was not three minutes before she took the note, I had my hand in the same pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the women after the hand was taken out of your pocket - A. They stopped, and Kerrick stopped. The bar-maid told her brother; he came, and bolted the doors. The man at the bar stopped, and the women too.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time that you asked for the ale, were there any other person at the bar than the bar-maid - A. There was another woman. The landlord was not in the bar then; the landlord was called in when I missed my property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you going to or coming from at that time of the night, when you called in this wine-vaults - A. I came from Paddington; I was going home to my lodging, No. 19, Whitcomb-street. I was not sober; I was sensible of losing my property.</p>

            . I was in the wine-vaults at the corner of Lisle-street and Princes-street, at the time the prosecutor came in, on the 3rd of this month; it was about a quarter after eleven when I went in; I was outside of the bar before the three prisoners came there. The two women came in with another man. Kerrick was in before they came in. As soon as they came into the house they joined company with Kerrick; they were all four together. They were talking together; what passed between them I do not know. The prosecutor came in, he asked for a glass of ale; the bar-maid served him the ale. I saw the four surround him, and I saw

               <p>Morris's Defence. On this evening a gentleman gave me a pound note; I went into Mr. Gower's; I called for a quartern of liquor; I gave the pound note into Mrs. Gower's own hand; the prosecutor snatched the note out of Mrs. Gower's hand; she said, do you know the number; I said, no; it was a new note, and folded up in four. That is all I know.</p>

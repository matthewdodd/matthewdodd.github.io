                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. William Wright Landell, of Thomas-street, Horselydown—he has a warehouse in Shad Thames, the prisoner, Kirby, was his foreman there. On Tuesday, 27th Jan., I saw him leave his house about a quarter past 1 o'clock, I followed him—I afterwards saw him at the warehouse, at Shad Thames—he and Edney were there loading a cart, Edney was in the cart and Kirby was putting in a barrel of flour—I asked Kirby for the order that he delivered the goods on—he told me he had</p>

               <p>no order, and he told Edney to drive off, and Edney drove up Shad Thames very fast—I followed him and came up with him—the cart was stopped by some carriages in the street, I desired him to come down, and he went with me to the counting house, and I told the other clerks what had happened, we went to Mr. Landell, and he gave Edney in custody, and the cart and horse—I afterwards saw Kirby give this order to Mr. Landell—(Read: "Mr. Landell. Deliver to bearer two barrels of flour and one sack of bar<lb></lb>ley, as per order lodged. H. Hart.")—I saw this other paper, found on Kirby, at the station, "Mr. Malin, baker, Bermondsey New-road"—when an order is presented, the foreman or the carman is obliged to come to the counting house, to have it signed by one of the clerks, before the goods are delivered, but this order has never passed through the counting house—it is not signed—Hart had no authority whatever to write an order for the deli<lb></lb>very of goods—I observed, when the cart drove off, that there were two barrels of flour in it and one sack of barley.</p>

               <p>Hart's Defence. On 21st Jan.

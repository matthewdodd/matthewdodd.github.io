               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know Mrs. Harrod? A. No; I afterwards met the prisoner in the street, and saw her go into a draper's shop - I told her the things were not her's; they belonged to No. 34, Gray's-inn-lane - I took her to our house, and she was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you give her the articles stated in this indictment? A. Yes; there was a table-cloth, a towel, a napkin, and the other articles stated; which we had received from Mr. Abbott, No. 34, Gray's-inn-lane.</p>

             (police-sergeant G 45). The prisoner was given into my custody - I went to No. 1, Crawford-passage, where she lodged - I found these articles in a drawer, in the second-floor front room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How did you find that they were her lodgings? A. By knowing a young man who lived in that house - the drawers were not locked - these things were on the top of the other things, and seemed to be fresh mangled.</p>

            , Please to send by bearer, one dozen of men's white cotton, 2 s. 6 d., and one dozen of women's ditto, about 3 s. J. Titcombe, Knightsbridge." He said he brought the order from Mr. Titcombe, which I believed. I looked out the goods, and gave him a dozen caps, as he said Mr. Titcombe had omitted them. I had never seen him before; he went away with the goods. I saw him again on the 21st, and am sure of his person; he was about twenty minutes with me.</p>

            . I am a haberdasher and hosier, and live at Knightsbridge. I have been a customer of Mr. Last's about fifteen years. The prisoner once lived with a friend in the City - he was never my servant; he knew the houses I dealt with. The order is not my handwriting, nor any of my servants. I sent a young man on the 3d of August without an order, but not for such articles; these goods never came into my possession.</p>

            . I am one of the day patrol. On the 19th of August, I took the prisoner in charge for another person. Savage made this charge against him; he said nothing to it; he said he had no lodging.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that he was employed to take the order by a stranger.</p>

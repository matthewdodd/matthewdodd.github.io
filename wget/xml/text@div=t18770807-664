                  </hi>. I live at 3, Wallis Court, Mint Street—I have lived with the prisoner eight years—on 9th July we went out between 7 and 8 a. m., and we drank at several public-houses and became intoxicated—we came home, and about 2 o'clock in the day I went into the room where the prisoner was lying down—I tried to take some money out of his pocket—he woke up and said "You have taken some money out of my pocket"—I said "No, I had it in my hand, but I left it there; you had better lie down and you will find it"—he laid hold of me, and we fell down on the bed and then on the floor—I left the money in his pocket—I thought he had bitten my nose, but when the bandage was taken off I found it was only a cut—I went to the hospital, where the wound was dressed—I lost much blood, but suffered no pain—I appeared against him at the police-court the next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a student at Guy's Hospital—I dressed the prosecutrix's wounds—there were two on her nose, one was in the partition between the nostrils, which was caused by the absence of the piece of flesh there, and it was much lacerated—there was another wound in front of the left nostril, about a third of an inch long, through the substance of the nose, more of an incised character, but not so much lacerated—she was bleeding profusely, and was very weak from loss of blood—the wounds are such as would be caused by a bite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were no marks of teeth on the top of the nose, but through the left nostril—a piece was bitten out.</p>

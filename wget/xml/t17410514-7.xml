            . On the 13th of April, between 8 and 9 in the Morning, the Prisoner came into my House, and said, she was very ill of the Colick, and wanted to go backwards. She sat some time in the Room, seemingly very uneasy, and then went backwards. She came in again presently, and walked about the Room, complaining that she was very ill, and said, if I had a Room and a Bed to spare, she would go to Bed; so I desired my Husband to ask our Lodger to resign her Room, but she would not. After this, the Prisoner walked about the Room some Time, and then went backwards a second time; and she staying longer than I expected, I followed her, and perceived that the Necessary-house had been washed: I asked her the reason of it, and she said, her Nose had bled. As to the Child, I saw nothing of it. The Prisoner lodged with me before this, and I took her for a single person, and a very sober good Woman .</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Distance of Time was there, from my going to the Little-house, and your coming to me?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lucas. I really believe it was about two Minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I seem to be in any pain when I returned the second time.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lucas. My Fright was so great, I can't tell.</p>

            . My Wife called me to see if the Person who lodges in our House would resign her Room, that the Prisoner might have it, but she would not; and at my Return , my Wife said to me, I hope Betty is not with Child. I then went into the Kitchen , and saw the Prisoner washing her Hands at the Water-tub, and the Bottom of her Apron was very bloody. I informed my Wife of this, and she said, she hoped there was nothing in the Vault, so I got a Candle and looked into it, and saw something which I took at first to be a piece of Cloth. I got Mrs. Watlin to come and see it, and I got a pair of Tongs, and turned it about, and then the Child's Leg appeared . Upon this I went out to get Assistance, and locked the Door to prevent the Prisoner's escaping, and before I returned the Child was taken out of the Vault, and was dead.</p>
               <p>C. Can you form any Judgment by the Growth of the Child?</p>

            . I was going by Mr. Lucas's Door, and was desired to go in. I went into Mrs. Lucas's Room, and she said the Prisoner was gone backwards, and staid a little longer than ordinary; upon which I went to see what she was doing, and met her in the passage, opening the Door. I gave her Room to go by, and she went into the parlour and sat down, and seemed to be mighty bad. Mrs. Lucas said to her, '' I fear, Betty, thou hast '' been delivered of a Child.'' The Prisoner denied she had been delivered; so Mrs. Lucas desired me to go backwards and see. Mr. Lucas gave me a Candle, and on looking down the Vault I perceived a new-born Infant. I informed Mrs. Lucas what I had seen, and endeavoured to get the Child up; and, with the Assistance of another, I did get it up; but it was dead. I believe it was at its full Growth, for there were Nails on its Hands, and Hair on its Head . The Child was not covered over with the Soil; it lay on its Face, leaning rather to the left Side; and the Face was in the Soil.</p>

               <p>C. Was there any thing about it?</p>
               <p>Davis. Nothing at all; it was quite naked, as it was born.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you think it possible for a Child to be born casually from a Woman under these Circumstances?</p>
               <p>Davis. I have heard of such things, but I never knew it.</p>

             . Mr. Lucas came to me, and asked me to lend him a Candle; I did so, and he went up Stairs directly. He came down again presently, and desired me to go backwards with him, and look down the Vault: I did so, and he asked me, what I thought it was; I said, I believed it was paper; upon that he fetch'd a pair of Tongs and rapped it; it founded hard, and on his turning it about, a Leg or an Arm appeared. He strove to get it up, but could not, and he desired me to go into the Room to the Prisoner; I did so, and asked her what she had done? and told her, she had had a Child; but she said, it was no such thing.

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Messrs. White, Greenwood, and Co., linen-drapers, in Black friars-road. On the 10th of January both the prisoners came in, about four o'clock in the afternoon—they sat down, and one of them, I cannot say which, asked to look at some white jean—I cut off two yards from one piece—one of them asked to look at some ribbon—I produced several boxes, five different lengths were cut off, and they were put together—I think I produced three boxes to them, and in one of them was a particular piece of rose-coloured ribbon, which I recommended to them—it was the only one of that sort we had—when I had cut off the other ribbon I went to take up that ribbon to show to them again, and missed it—it had been in the third box which I showed them—amongst the five pieces which they had bought then some of them were ribbons for strings—one of them, I cannot say which, asked for edging—I left the spot where I was for the purpose of getting it, and as I returned with the box they were sit<lb></lb>ting side by side, and I observed Williams give something to Blundell—I took no notice, but produced the box of edging—it would not suit, one of them asked to look at some better; and one of them, I think it was Blundell, asked me to leave that box there—I said I was subject to a fine</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in this firm—Mr. White's Christian name is William, and there are two other partners. On the 10th of January my attention was called by Mr. Miles to this transaction—I went to the place where he had been serving, and saw the two prisoners—I first asked them if they had got all that they required, and then I told them I wished to speak to them—they followed me, and I preceded them to the private counting-house—I told them I suspected they had stolen some goods—I addressed myself to both of them, because I did not know which of them it was—they appeared quite indignant that I should sus<lb></lb>pect respectable women like them—I told them I must have them searched, and whichever it was, contrived to slip the goods down from them—they both stood part of the time, and sometimes one of them sat—one or both of them contrived to slip the goods from them, but I did not see them do it—I had walked into the counting-house before them, and took notice whether there was any thing lying about—I saw every thing was perfectly clear, and when I had been there a few minutes I saw there laid on the floor three cards of lace, close to the prisoners, which was the num<lb></lb>ber Miles told me he had lost—I sent for a policeman, and tried to ascer<lb></lb>tain where the prisoners resided, that we might have had their lodging searched—I asked them where they resided—they offered to pay for the goods, and begged and prayed, and said they would go on their knees if I would excuse them—I am quite certain that is the substance of what was said by both of them.</p>

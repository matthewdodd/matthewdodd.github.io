                  </hi>. (<hi rend="italic">a prisoner, see page</hi> 932). I am eighteen years of age—my father lives at No. 3, Vernon-square, Bagnigge Wells-road—I was errand boy to Mr. Meyer, of Bow-lane—about two months and a half ago I was passing the prisoner's stall in the City-road, and saw a funny stick there, which I thought I should like, and asked the price—I had not known the prisoner before that—I said, "I cannot afford it to-day"—I had an umbrella under my arm, it was my master's, but it was the first one I took—the prisoner asked me to sell it—I said, "No," but afterwards he said that he would give me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I took it—he asked me if I had got another one—I said no, but I could get another—he said that he wanted another very particularly, and I took him another the next night—he paid me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, and said that I was to be sure and take him another one, because he had got a customer for it—I do not know whether it was silk or alpaca, the first was a silk one—they were both new, and the first had a partridge cane and a griffin handle—when I took him the third, he said that he could not pay me, as he bad only taken a shilling all day—I do not exactly know whether that was a silk one, I took him both alpaca and silk, just what he said he wanted—he gave me a shilling, and asked me if I would have a drop of ram, which I did—I did not take him another for some time after that, and he said then that he could not pay me all, as I had stopped away so long, because if he paid me all, I should not bring him any more—I said, "I must have the money, because how do you suppose I can bring you umbrellas if you do not pay me the money? I want the money to cover them"—that was an excuse I made to get the money—he said that he had a particular custo<lb></lb>mer for another, at an ironmonger's shop over the other side of the road, and I was to take him one the next night—I did so, and he asked me if I would help him to clear away his stall; I did so, and he took me to a public house opposite his court, and asked me if I would have anything to drink—he said outside, "We do not want that man to hear everything we have to say," and we went over to his house—a man came down his court to buy an um<lb></lb>brella—he asked 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it; the man would not give it, but gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was one which I had taken him, a silk one—they were all new—he asked me that night to bring him two similar ones next day, very parti<lb></lb>cularly, because one of them was for a lady—I took them, and left them at his house at my dinner time, and the woman Mary said that she would take them down to his stall—I took him two new alpaca ones the same night, from my master's premises.</p>

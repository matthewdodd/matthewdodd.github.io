               <p>THURSTON ASHLEY. I am foreman to Mr. Guillemard. The prisoner is in the employ of Mr. Guillemard. In our business we provide copper change to pay the work people.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 18th of March, had you any reason to suppose that any of your copper money was taken away - A. Yes. I kept watch, and the two Armstrongs were stationed in the house. We had agreed upon a signal; upon my seeing any person take the copper I was to cry out Rodney. On the 18th of March, I concealed myself, and at eight o'clock in the evening I heard a footstep towards where the copper was placed. I saw a child go to where the copper was. It was dark. I could only see the size of the person, not the features. I had no light until the officers came. I saw her take eight five-shilling papers of halfpence. She wrapped the shawl round her hand, put the papers of halfpence into the shawl, and put it up to her person. She took the papers of halfpence from underneath the counter, and put them into the shawl; she walked four or five feet, as if to go out of the room; I immediately got up from the place where I was concealed, and called out Rodney, to the officers; the officers came; the officer searched the shawl; they found six papers of halfpence in her shawl, and one paper was taken from her person.</p>

            . Upon hearing the cry of Rodney, I came into the room; the last witness had hold of her by the arm. I then took from her in his presence, these six papers, which I had marked that night, and he had marked them in the day time. Six papers fell from her, and one on the floor. Upon our alarm, coming up stairs, she might have dropped it, as she trembled. I did not see her her drop them. These are the halfpence.</p>

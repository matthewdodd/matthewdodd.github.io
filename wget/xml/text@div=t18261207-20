               <p>JANE PERKINS. I now live at No. 4, Foster-street, Sun-street, Bishopsgate. On the 26th of February I lodged in John Emmens' parlour; I went out between 12 and 1 o'clock that day, and returned between eight and nine; it was then dark; I found the street-door had been opened, and my room door was opened with a picklock-key; I am sure I had locked my own door and taken the key with me; I found a bundle of things moved from the drawers and laid on the table tied up ready to be taken away; there were two gowns, two night-gowns, a cloth-pelisse, two tippets, two shifts, a quilt, and a skirt; the locket, ring, and brooch were taken away; I have not seen them since; the other things were tied up ready to be taken away; this was on the 26th of February; I have not seen the prisoner till to-day; he was not in custody when I came home.</p>

            , standing at the corner of the street - Emmens' house is in the middle; I went further up the street, towards Emmens' house, and saw two men, one of whom I recollect - I do not see him here; I saw two of them before the Magistrate, they were William Blacket and

             - I am not positive that the prisoner was one; he was not in custody with Blacket and Lyall; I did not see him in Foster-street; I went further up the street, and saw a fourth man at the corner of the street, at the same end of the street as Blacket, but at another corner; I cannot say that that was the prisoner; I saw the two men standing against Emmens' door, doing something to the key-hole, apparently - Edwards, who is gone to sea, was with me; we went up to the top of the street and watched them - the first time we went up, we saw them do something to the key-hole; and when we came down the street again we saw them two or three yards off the door; and the third time we went down the street, we went to the officer's house; we then found the door of Emmens' house was open, and the persons at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182612070017"></xptr>corner of the street walked away; we went and told the officer, who came and saw two men coming up the street; he went to the house, knocked at the door, and inquired who was there; a man came out and said, "Me, Sir;" the officer laid hold of him; he struggled in the street, and got away from him; I cannot say whether that was the prisoner or not; the officer went into the house, found the parlour-door open, and it had been robbed; the things were packed up ready to be taken away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Somebody said,"It is me," and came out? A. Yes; that person got off; the officer and I went in as soon as we could; the man coming out might take about a minute; I could not see his face.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might the officer have had an opportunity of seeing the man? A. I do not know; I do not suppose we were above a minute before we went into the house; the man ran off immediately; I could not swear to him; Blacket and Lyall were acquitted on this charge- I gave evidence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Only one person came out of the house? A. No.</p>

            . I live at No. 98, Long-alley, Finsbury. On the 26th of February, a few minutes before seven o'clock, I was informed of this robbery at Emmens' house, which is in the City, and in the parish of St. Botolph without, Bishopsgate; I went to the spot, and as I turned the corner of the street, I saw two persons, who saw me and knew me; they came towards me - I knew them, and they passed me; they were coming in a direction from the house - I then went towards Emmens' house; I looked towards the shutter and saw a light in the parlour, which is Perkins' room; the street-door was open - I went into the passage, pushed against the parlour-door, and said, "Halloo, who is here?" a person said, "It is me, Sir;" he peeped out into the passage, and drew the parlour-door too; he came into the passage - I made a grasp at him, and caught hold of him; but the passage was dark and I could not see his features at that time; it was too dark; I continued my hold of him till we got into the middle of the street, and there we had a struggle; I was ill at the time; he twisted his head under my arm, left his hat with me, and got away.</p>
               <p>Q. While you were struggling with him in the middle of the street, was there a gas-light to enable you to distinguish his features? A. There was; I am certain of his person - it was the prisoner; I have known him ten years, and recognized him as soon as I saw his features; I declare positively he is the person - I did not see him again till I found him in Clerkenwell prison, about three weeks ago; I was certain he was the same person; I am quite sure of him - on going into the prosecutrix's room I found all the clothes taken out of the drawers, and in the street-door I found a skeleton key, which I produce; it is exactly in the same state now - it has been strained in getting it out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean to swear you took the key out of the hole in that state? A. Yes, I do; it was with great difficulty we got it out - we strained it in doing so; it has not been at all altered since - I was not more than five minutes struggling with him - I am sure it was not ten - it was at least five - it was about five, I cannot speak to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. If any one has sworn from the time the man came out of the house till you and he went in again it was not more than a minute, is that truth? A. It was five minutes from the time he came out of the room, till he got from me; if anybody has said it was not a minute, it is not true, but they might err - I say it must have taken nearly five minutes - I would not tell an untruth - the other men were tried in the New Court; I was examined and swore to the other men, for I knew them well before.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have been a little agitated when you were struggling? A. I was not frightened; I had an abscess in my neck, or he would not have got from me; I saw his face, but not all the time; it was five minutes after we left the parlour that he got from me - he twisted from me in a moment; I do not know that I ever experienced such a dexterous act; he kept struggling all the time; I had him by the collar, but he twisted under my arm and got away; it is a common way of getting off, but it was never done to me before; he did not throw me down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You gave evidence against two other persons; did you state them to be at some distance, or at the house? A. At a distance.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 27th of February I received information that Blacket, who was tried last April, was wanted - I know nothing of this prisoner.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JANE PERKINS. Q. You left home between twelve and one o'clock? A. Yes; it is the dwelling-house of John Emmens; he has no servant; he was out at the time with his wife and three children at the Tabernacle, which is a place of worship; I cannot tell whether any of them were in the house after I left; he has no servant; I saw them that night; nobody but myself has a key of the parlour-door to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He says he had hold of me five minutes, and has known me ten years; if so, why not mention my name; nobody ever came to my father's house till the Tuesday evening; I have been in the parish of St. Luke ten months - besides, that man is not fit to have his oath taken; he is a Deist, I understand.</p>
               <p>JURY to WALTON. Q. Did you know where the prisoner lived? A. Yes; and I put a watchman in at the window to search after him, thinking he was there, and another officer put a watchman in at the window to look for him; we have been searching for him ever since.</p>

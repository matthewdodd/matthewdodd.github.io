                  </hi>. I live in America-terrace, King's-road. The prisoner was my servant—I took seven half-crowns to John Payne, and marked them in his presence, and delivered them to him—he ought to have spent them in my shop the following morning—I looked into the till when I returned from market that morning, and there were only six of the half-crowns—I spoke to Payne, and then accused the prisoner—he was searched in my presence, and the marked half-crown found, with other silver, and gold, and halfpence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live at Chelsea. Mr. Saunders marked seven half-crowns in my presence—I passed them at his shop the next morning—this is one of them—I can swear to it—I saw the mark made.</p>

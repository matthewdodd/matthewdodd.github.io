I lost the spoons on the 23rd of September, about half past two; they were lost from off the side-board, in the parlour; the door and the gate were both left open; our house stands back, with a garden before it. I was going into my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181310270052"></xptr>mistress's room; I saw Woodling against the rails of the garden gate, and Pearce walked out of the house with his hands in his bosom; I went down, and told my mistress, I thought there had been a man in the house. I went out, and the man I first saw was a baker; I spoke to him; he went after them, and caught them both; they had got up to Ball's-pond-road. I am sure Pearce is the man I saw come out of the house.</p>

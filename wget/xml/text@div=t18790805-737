                  </hi>. I am nurse at the receiving ward at the Greenwich Union—I have been there for about 10 years—I knew a girl named Kate Smith, a sister of Ellen Smith—I knew her before she went to the home, the prisoner's place—she was a very nice child, and as far as I knew she was healthy, not suffering from any disease—we supplied her with clothes before she went to the home—she was an inmate of the Union for a short time—her mother came and took her out about the end of the summer of 1878—she came to us from the Sutton School—when she left with her mother she was properly clad, healthy, and clean—on 22nd April this year six children were brought to the Union by Mr. Pilcher, the relieving officer, and Inspector Phillips—they were Eliza and Annie Crabbe, Elizabeth Goodland, Alice Rixon, two little Edgars, and Ellen Smith—Alice Rixon was claimed two days afterwards by her grandmother—the other six were very dirty, and had the itch from the head down to their toes, all over their bodies—they had several sores and their heads were full of lice—I gave them food—I did not think they were so badly nourished at the time, for I did not take much notice of them; I only judged from their ap<lb></lb>pearance—I had known the two Crabbes before they went to the home; they had also come from the Sutton School—their mother came and fetched them from the Union; they were then properly clothed, in a clean state, and apparently free from disease—since they have returned to the Union they have wonderfully improved; they have been well taken care of.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot tell you the average cost of keeping a child in the Union—I said before the Magistrate that when the children were admitted into the Union from the home they had not the appearance of having been starved, and I say so now—I have had considerable experience of children—I formed that judgment from their appearance—I also said that they appeared to have been fairly fed, and that their clothes were not parti<lb></lb>cularly dirty—I have had a great many children in the Union who when first admitted suffered from vermin in the head—it is a very poor neighbour<lb></lb>hood round Deptford and Greenwich—it is not uncommon for children of the poorer classes to be suffering from vermin in the head—it is not a very difficult thing to eradicate them; I very soon get rid of them.</p>

                  </hi> I am relieving officer of the South Deptford district—on 14th April my attention was directed to the Home for Friendless Girls at Deptford, kept by Miss Addiscott, and on that day I went there with Dr. Ring, Inspector Phillips, and Sergeant Francis, and saw the prisoner—we said we came in consequence of communications received to visit the home and inspect the children; I told her that the gentleman who accompanied me was the medical officer—she refused to allow us to see the home or to examine the children unless in the. presence of her medical man, Dr. Ayres—we went away—I called next day in company with my col<lb></lb>league, Mr. Patty, and she again refused to allow us to see the home except</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050103"></xptr>
               <p>in the presence of Dr. Ayres—on the 21st I went again with Mr. Carter, the Coroner, Mr. Phillips, and Francis, but did not see the prisoner; she was away—we saw her mother, and we examined the house—there were eight rooms in the house, including the basement, two on each floor—two rooms on the first floor were occupied by the post-office—there are two bedrooms at the top—in the back room there was one iron bedstead—it is not exactly a back room; a portion of the front room is partitioned off—there was no carpet or any furniture whatever, or any fireplace—I examined the bedding—I cannot exactly tell what the bedding in the back room consisted of, but the general bedding consisted of packing cloth filled with straw, an under sheet, a dark brown blanket and a sheet over that, with a pillow, and either a counterpane or sheet over that—there were three bedsteads in the front room with similar bedding, but no other furniture whatever—I examined the two living rooms on the ground floor—there was no carpet or any furniture in the back sitting-room; there was a pail, a washing basin, and a paraffin lamp—in the front room there was a table; I cannot tell the number of chairs; I think there were only two; and a kind of side<lb></lb>board, or I do not know whether it was a bedstead—there were two dwarf cupboards—I partially examined one of them—I found but very little appearance of food there, a crust or two; there may have been part of a loaf; there was the appearance of treacle, the appearance of butter; there may have been a little sugar in a basin; I did not see anything else—there was a coal fire burning in that room—the washhouse had a stone floor, the front kitchen was boarded—there was a deal table and two forms in the washhouse, and there may have been a cup and saucer on the dresser; that was all; there was no fire there then; the grate was very rusty, and there was a great quantity of soot on the hobs—there was a copper—there were two doors or French windows in the back kitchen, opening up Steps into the yard, and there was not a whole pane of glass in them; the glass was all broken—there was no closet in the place fit for use; there were two; one in the yard had the appearance of being a privy; it was a heap of ruins; the one upstairs was a water-closet; the seat was all to pieces; it was impossible to use either—at the bottom of the garden there was a large hole dug which had the appearance of having been used for sanitary arrange<lb></lb>ments—I saw some clothing in an anteroom past one of the closets; the whole of the clothing that I saw there was hardly fit for use; it was ragged; I won't say it was dirty, but it certainly did not appear fit for the use of children, not to keep them warm—I can't tell the exact quantity there was; it was not a very great quantity—I saw the children to examine them on 22nd; Dr. Long was with me, and Inspector Phillips and Sergeant Francis* and in consequence of the state they were in I conveyed seven to the Union—outside the house there was a board, and on it "Miss Addiscott's Home for Friendless Children."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have a carpet in my own kitchen—I find several carpeted; it is very seldom I have occasion to go into kitchens—this is not a very small house; the rooms were a good size; it has an ordinary wash-house or back kitchen—there was not a sound pane of glass in the doors; there may have been broken pieces—there was no bed in either of the living rooms—I don't know that Miss Addiscott slept there—I could not ascertain where she did sleep—I have to go about a great deal among the homes in the district—I have not seen the children of respectable poor working men</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187908050104"></xptr>
               <p>in that neighbourhood sleeping three and four under a sack—it is a poor neighbourhood; there is frequently great distress there—I don't think there are places in which the furniture would be much the same as in this home, certainly not inferior; if you speak of respectable working men there is not a house in the Deptford district that is not fully furnished—I will undertake to swear that there are not houses in Deptford where respectable classes are living in far inferior places to those I saw in the Girls Home—I only find that when they are drunken, worthless people neglecting their duty—there is no respectable home so bad as this was—from my experience I say that every respectable working man there with a family is able to have a blanket, a straw palliasse, and two sheets, and a bedstead to put them on—I should not, as a rule, expect to find the kitchen carpeted, but a mat or a sack—it is very rare indeed to find glass broken in the back kitchen of respectable working men, unless accidentally; I have seen it, and paper and rags put in, but I am now speaking of the worthless poor in and out of the parish—we have respectable working poor, and their very respectability keeps them in that state that they would be ashamed to see a broken pane of glass—I say that the closet in the house could not be used; it was not blocked up; the seat was all to pieces; it would not be safe for any one to sit on; there did not appear to be a pan there—there was no water; I tried to see if there was any connected with the closet—nothing would go down if any water was thrown in I believe it would run all over the place, and through the floor—I did not try it; there was no water there to try it with—there was ground at the back, but it had not been cultivated for a long time—there was only weeds and grass—the father of the Crabbes and the mother of the Smiths were in the Union with them, and when they left they took the children away—they were destitute at that time; I cannot tell why they left the Union—there is a home for boys, consisting of three houses in the same row as this home; it is kept by a person who I have heard was formerly a clerk in the City—before this charge was made there was in the first place a charge of assault—I made a report to the guardians of the Greenwich Union on 2nd May—I did not hear Ellen Smith make a statement to the guardians. Ellen Smith. I went with my sister Kate to Miss Addiscott's home I think in August last year—Kate was younger than me, her birthday was 23rd March, mine is the 7th September; and I shall be 13 next September—I lost my father, who was an engineer—I had been to the Sutton Schools belonging to the Union, and I came up from there to Miss Addiscott—Miss Addiscott did not allow me to go to school when I was at the home—she said I was 15 and too old to go to school, and besides she said she wanted me to stop at home and clean her place—I told her that I was 12 years of age—I did clean the place—my sister went to the Board School with some of the other girls—whilst I was at the home Miss Addiscott sent out me out with collecting cards—we were sent out in parties of two each; four in a day sometimes—I went with Esther Edgar and sometimes with Elizabeth Goodland and Eliza Crabbe—we went out at 9 in the morning and came home at 8 or 9 in the evening—we were out the whole of that time without returning at all—Miss Addiscott did not give us any food to take with us while we were out—the collecting cards she gave us were similar to these produeed—we went to people's houses and got money, and they wrote down on the back the names and amounts—I had a purse which Miss Addiscott gave me, and at the end of the day I brought</p>

               <p>home the purse and the money and the card—sometimes the card was too full and the money could not be put down, and we used to put the money in the purse—the smallest amount we have taken home has been 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the largest 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,—sometimes when we were out collecting, food was given us by the ladies—we went out every day when it was fine, not on Sundays—we got enough food from one person and another while we were out—we did not spend any of the money—my sister Kate did not go out collecting—Miss Addiscott told me that if the ladies asked whether we liked to be in the home we should say "Yes;" and if they asked me how old I was, I was to say 15—she told me if they asked what we had for dinner we were to say meat and potatoes—we used to have something to eat in the morning at 9 o'clock—sometimes Miss Addiscott used to serve it in the front parlour and send it in by one of the children—sometimes it was later, 11 or 12 o'clock before we got anything to eat—she used to cut some bread up in a basin and put some hot water in it, and drain off the water and put a bit of treacle on it and send it in to us—at that time there were Eliza Crabbe, Elizabeth Goodland, Esther Edgar, my sister, Annie Crabbe, Florrie Edgar, and myself—that was not the greatest number I have known there—sometimes there have been 13 there—those I have mentioned were always there while I was there—when I first went there we used to have oatmeal—the water was boiled, then it was mixed with cold water, put into a spoon and stirred round till it was boiled; some salt was put in it and it was then poured out into a basin for us to eat—there was 1/2 lb. of oatmeal between all of us—no milk was put in it—there was only a half-penny worth of milk bought of a day, and that was for Miss Addiscott for her breakfast and tea—when we did not have oatmeal for breakfast we had the sop—there was not much bread given to us—we had one basinful each; not quite a basinful—it was larger than a breakfast cup; not quite so large as a pudding basin—sometimes we used to have a bit of bread and treacle at 10 o'clock at night—we had no dinner—Miss Addiscott used to be out—my sister came back from school at 12 o'clock and 4—we waited from 9 in the morning till sometimes 10 at night without anything to eat until Miss Addiscott came in—sometimes we used to have a half-penny worth of cabbage before tea, those that went to school—I did not have anything then—Miss Addiscott used to say we would have something, and then she would go out to her mother's and we should have to wait until she came home, and then some<lb></lb>times we should have a bit of oatmeal—the girls came home from school again at 4 in the afternoon, and they used to have to wait until Miss Addiscott came home, sometimes at 8 o'clock, and she would say, "Have not you given the children any tea?" when there was not anything in the house to give them tea with—we got no meat at all except on Sundays; we then had pieces of meat, small bits that were bought at the shop, like what you have to make broth with—I have been with Miss Addiscott on a Saturday night to buy it—we did not have the meat every Sunday; sometimes we had rice for dinner, and when we had rice we did not have meat—I do not know how often we had meat; we very often had rice—I was there on the 12th November, when Alice Maud Edgar died—she was at the home before me—she was not ill when I first went there; she got ill a week or two after—she slept in the back parlour on two chairs when she was ill—Miss Addiscott slept in the front parlour on the floor on a flock bed—the other girls slept up in the back room—I used to sleep downstairs in the back</p>

               <p>parlour, and sometimes Alice Crabbe used to sleep with me to keep me company—there was no bed there; we had to sleep on the floor, and put some clothes under us and lay on them, and we had to cover ourselves the best way we could with some grey bodies out of the clothes-room—up to the time that Alice Maud Edgar died there was only one blanket—sometimes Miss Addiscott used to have that to cover over herself—the children used to cover themselves over with their petticoats and that, there was no blanket—the others slept on mattresses and beds on bedsteads—there was nothing but straw in a canvas covering that had not got any sheets, or counterpanes, or anything of the kind—when I slept upstairs with the other girls some used to lay at the side, some at the foot, and some at the head—there was never any fire there—I suffered from cold there because the windows were broken—Alice Edgar was 4 years old when she died—before she died she had a few lice on her in her head—Kate Verch was a baby; she could not walk or talk—she slept along with us sometimes—I was there when she died, and when all the three died—my sister was taken ill on Shrove Tuesday; that was when she first took to her bed—she had not been well enough to go to the Board School from December—she could hardly walk; she had some of those insects upon her—she had no different food from what I have described up to Shrove Tuesday—she slept upstairs in the bedroom with the other children when she was first taken bad on Shrove Tuesday—Miss Addiscott made her up a bed in the back parlour, and she told me to take off the mattress and put it on the floor to lay her on, and ever since that night she slept in the back parlour—I used to sleep against her, not on the same mattress but on the floor; she used to sleep on the mattress—when we went to the home we only had the clothing that we had on us—they were old clothes—my sister went to school in them—there was no fire in the winter in the back parlour, only when they burnt the vermin off my sister—she kept to her bed from Shrove Tuesday to the 6th April—I knew she was ill for about two weeks before that; she could hardly eat anything and wanted drink every minute; she was thinner than when she first went into the home, and when she was ill her bones were almost through her skin—I could hardly take her out of bed because she cried about the pain in her bones; she said her bones hurt her—Miss Addiscott sometimes came home at 1 or 2 in the morning—my sister died on Saturday, 6th April—Miss Addiscott was home about 12 that night—she slept in the front parlour, and I and my sister in the back—there were folding doors between the two rooms, and she told me to shut them because she could not bear the groans of my sister; she did groan because of the pain—I attended on my sister entirely—at 12 o'clock I went to bed, and Miss Addiscott offered me a bit of meat because I did not have my tea; I gave my sister a bit and she eat it, and afterwards went to sleep—she kissed me and said "Good night," and I said, "Katie, be a good girl to-night," and she said "Yes," and she laid down and went off, and did not call me any more that night—I covered her over with a sheet, and a white blanket and a counterpane—I had not had that long to cover her over with; I believe it belonged to Mrs. Addiscott; I had never seen it before—I woke at 7 in the morning—my sister did not call me—I had to get up and light the fire, and get Miss Addiscott's breakfast—I did not go for the milk before she was up—I was afraid if there was any money gone she would blame it to me—about 10 o'clock we had our breakfast—she told me to take some to my sister and I found she</p>

Crabbe helped me to pull off my sister's chemise and that, and she had vermin all crawling over her face, and her head was nearly out of bed and her legs drawn up, I got a pail of water and washed her—Miss Addiscott did not come back before 1 o'clock—Mrs. Addiscott, her mother, came with her; she cut off my sister's hair and Miss Addiscott told me to pick off the vermin with my fingers one by one and put them in the fire—there had not been any fire before, it was lighted on purpose to burn the vermin in her hair—Miss Addiscott was obliged to go into the other room because she could not bear the smell of my sister's head—there were vermin all on the bed too—Miss Addiscott told me to go and put the sheet on the line and shake it so that they would be able to fall off—I was occupied every two minutes in taking off the vermin, and as I was having my meals she kept telling me to do it—when I washed my sister I noticed that she had the itch all over her, between her fingers, and scratches, so that I could not wash it, and when she was dead the prisoner said to me "How dirty your hands are"—I said "They are not dirty, it is the itch," and she said "Oh, whatever shall I do?"—I did not know Mr. John Smith, who married my mother; I know him now, he came to the home on the Monday night, but I did not see him because I was upstairs taking off the counter<lb></lb>panes—Miss Addiscott did not tell me that my stepfather had been—when my sister's hair was cut by Mrs. Addiscott I saw a few sores on her head where the vermin had been biting her—my sister had complained about her bones hurting her, and when she was dead I could see that they were nearly all through—when she was put in her coffin Miss Addiscott said "Nelly, look sharp and pick off the vermin before the undertaker comes"—they were not quite all picked off when he came, they kept coming on in the night—I was not picking them off all day on the Monday because I had to do my parlour—I had been doing it all day on Sunday and I did it Monday also—I saw Miss Addiscott strike my sister not more than two weeks before she died; my sister was undressed and in bed, she only had on her chemise—she was hungry, and told me to ask Miss Addiscott whether I should give her a bit of bread-and-butter—I went and asked her, and she refused, and came in with a cane, and pulled down the clothes and beat her—she gave her a good many stripes—I crawled out of bed, and saw the marks all down her arm where she had been beaten—I noticed the marks for about a day afterwards; there was no other reason for the beating than what I have said—Miss Addiscott gave no other reason—she said "You have had quite enough to-night, and you are not going to have any more"—she beat me with the poker on Sunday morning before Shrove Tuesday because I upset a cup of coffee; she hit me on the shoulder saying "Take that, and if any of you keep me from church this morning you will never see another Sunday"—the blows with the poker hurt me; the mark was there for two or three days; I showed it to the children—I saw Miss Addiscott strike Alice Maud Edgar on Sunday morning before this at the end of the washhouse; Alice happened to dirt the bed, and Miss Addiscott undressed her, and beat her with the clothes line six or seven times double, and two or three days after that she was taken bad, and took to her bed, and she died very soon after—she</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S I live at the Evalina Hospital Southwark Bridge Road—on 13th February I admitted Eleanor mobbs as a patiant—she was weighed on the 17th, and weighed 3st 5lb. 8oz.—she was weighed again on 21st March, and then weighed 3 stone 12lb. 4oz., and on 7th Mareh 3 stone 81bs,—she was much below the normal weight when admitted; she was coimderably emaciated; there was no fat which I should expect to find—she came to us to be treated for itch—she was extremely laguid and exhausted—it was with some difficulty that we could get her to take some food, she was so weak—I could trace no organic disease—we examined her very carefully on several occasions—I consider want of proper food would account for the state she was in—when she got proper food she immediately increased in weight—she was covered from head to foot with skin disease—it was certainly of long standing—her head was smothered with lice—her hair had to be cut quite short at once; it was in a filthy state—on the right great toe there was a patch of inflamed skin, with matter underneath; that was probably due to an inflamed chilblain—on the other foot there was an open sore, probably from chilblain—picked up very fairly in a fortnight or so—in my opinion, if insufficient food had been given to her for any particular period, it world bring on consumption, and I consider she would have died.</p>

                  </hi>, Sen. I am a widow, and live at 4, "Varnford Court, City—I am caretaker of that house—the little girl Eleanor Mobbs is my daughter—she was 12 last April—she went into the home on 14th October, 1878—before that she Was in very good condition—she had no lice, not was she suffering from itch or anything of the kind—I went to see her at the home fortnightly, with one exception when I left it for three weeks—I saw her with the other children—sometimes Miss Addiscott was with them, sometimes not—I noticed a change in her appearance after about two months; she seemed to have lost all her spirits in life, and was very dull and very thin, and she got thinner every time I saw her afterwards—her uncle, Mr. Heather, removed her on 12th February to the Evalina Hospital.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The reason I sent her to the home was because I could not afford to keep her—I was not to pay anything—she had previously been with an aunt, and she could not afford to keep her any longer—for the first two months she appeared healthy—the first Monday in November I noticed her looking very bad, or December; it was before Christmas—I did not speak to Miss Addiscott because the child never made any complaint to me—I saw several of the children together when Miss Addiscott was not there—they were generally in the front parlour—they had a fire there—the door was always open when I went there—I never saw Mrs. Addiscott there, or the sister—my child suffered from her birth from some defect in the roof of her mouth, a cleft palate—she is an only child—I believe at one time, when she was at her aunt's, she did have lice; she caught them at school; that was. about two months before she went to the home—she had long hair, plaited and tied up.</p>

               <p>own experience in the matter, and that is that the disease known as tabes mesenterial, pathologically and correctly known as such, is very uncommon—the deaths of three children in the same house, from the same cause within six months, taken from different families is very extraordinary, unless it were a place for the collection of scrofulous subjects—I have never known such an occurrence—in a hospital undoubtedly it may be so—it has never come to my knowledge—a scrofulous tendency would pre<lb></lb>dipose to the deposition of tubercle, so that in any collection of scrofulous children there would be nothing extraordinary in three of them getting tabes mesenterica—if there is no scrofula it is not correctly tabes mesenterica; it is really a scrofulous disease—from the appearance of the children who have been in the box there is no indication of scrofula—I would make one exception, I noticed that the child with defective speech (Mobbs) had rather an enlarge<lb></lb>ment about the glands, that may be scrofulous—I have not examined bar—from the evidence I should say that the food supplied at this home was quite, insufficient; and even if it were sufficient in quantity it would be quite inadequate to support a proper condition of health, and would in many cases lead to a fatal result—I say that from my own experience—it is a food that contains an inadequate supply of nitrogen—the population of Ireland before the famine had a certain amount of fatty substance, which these children did not get at all—the potato is an insupportable diet—potatoes only must lead to disease and death; with milk you get the fat and the nitrogen: I am able to swear that potato diet only would kill anybody—with children of tender age the presence of food giving nitrogen is absolutely necessary—there was some nitrogen of course in their food, but not nearly sufficient; not sufficient to sustain life for any lengthened period—bread is one of the elements of diet as far as it goes; that is correct—the pickled cabbage could be very little good—I would not find fault with it as doing any harm; it is simply a little vegetable acid which would be rather good than otherwise—it would be no good as a nutritious diet—in this diet, as described, there was nothing else which supplied vegetable acid; therefore the cabbage would be rather good than otherwise, but it would not supply any nutrition to the tissues—as to the case of Kate Smith, after hearing the evidence of the sister and the other evidence, I believe that her illness was caused entirely by improper diet, and perhaps insufficient quantity—the evidence is not so clear as to the insufficient quantity as it is to the quality; that is undoubted—I am perfectly clear about it—in food of that quality a very much larger quantity is required to keep body and soul together than if you gave food of a proper quality—I attribute her illness entirely to the diet—from the evidence I have heard I consider the clothing and bedding quite inadequate; that would" increase the tendency to disease—warmth is a correlative; the less warmth the more food would be required—I have formed the opinion that Kate Smith died from starvation—the condition of the body after death, as spoken to by her sister, indicates gross neglect; I am speaking of the lice, the con<lb></lb>dition of the head, the sores in the head, and the itch—the complaint that her bones hurt her, indicates that she was exceedingly emaciated; there was no cushion for the bones, no muscle—the drawing-up of the knees is a usual condition in death from exhaustion—being beaten with a rope would be calculated to prejudice her health; it would produce shock to the system, and I think accelerate death.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I never saw any of these children; I am simply giving my evidence upon the statements of the witnesses in Court, on the assump<lb></lb>tion that what they have stated is absolutely correct—I found my opinion that Kate Smith died from starvation, first upon the evidence of the sister, but I have taken the conjoint statements, as they all left an impression on my mind, as they would properly do—I have weighed the evidence in my mind to the best of my ability, and have formed my deductions from the whole, not from any special answer, and from the quantity and quality of food which the children had—I do not assume that they only had their own clothes as a covering; I will assume the utmost quantity of blankets that has been spoken of as true, and that they always had that quantity, then I am able to give evidence that the warmth was quite insufficient—there should be a blanket underneath as well as over in every case; it is not that it is required to keep the cold out, but to keep the heat in the body by pre<lb></lb>venting evaporation—I think if a child of a respectable working man, earning say 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, has not a blanket underneath, a sheet underneath, a blanket above, and a sheet and counterpane, I might fairly say that the parent has neglected the warmth of that child—I am not able to answer how working men manage; I am not an economist—in the weather we had last winter, if any working man did not supply a straw mattress, with a packing cloth, a blanket and sheet, I say he was neglecting his children, and I am ready to swear it—it is not for me to judge of what is criminal; I say he would be neglecting his children—if he could not do it, I cannot say how far he would be criminal; I simply state the broad fact that he would be neglecting the proper conditions—I say that anything under that, on the part of a person having the charge of a child, is neglect—I have formed my opinion, assuming the fullest amount of covering spoken to by anybody here—I have heard that nearly all the children were the children of destitute parents, or parents unable to provide for them—I have had very large experience in poor neighbourhoods—I was surgeon to a workhouse in Petty, France, for nine years, where we had the refuse of the population—I had no private practice among the poor—I have often visited their houses in the poorer parts of Westminster; I have seen some of the worst dens there, and where the people are working people—I have been in almost every house in the Broadway, Herman's Hill, Strutton Ground, and Peter Street and St. Ann's Lane—I have never seen the certificate that was given by Dr. Ayres to the police, which led to the removal of these children—I did not know there was one—if a child had the disease called tabes mesenterica she would waste away in the way we have heard, except as to the lice; that is an independent matter—she would arrive at the stage of the bones coming through the skin—I am now assuming a case in which the surrounding treatment was proper, but that there was active disease—assuming active scrofulous disease, and that the surroundings were right, the condition of emaciation would be the same, and death would probably occur—the legs in that case would be probably drawn up.</p>

               <p>Street, Deptford—I attend to the business—Miss Addiscott dealt with us for bread for the home daily; the children fetched it two or three times a day, three or four quarterns a day—I know Miss Addiscott; I have been to the home and frequently slept there for a week together on a visit—I slept with her in the front parlour when the children were ill—I was there on the Saturday night before Kate Smith died; she was lying in the back parlour on a bed—I cannot swear to every article she had on, but there was a sheet, a blanket, and a counterpane on the bed—she was very ill indeed—Miss Addiscott was in the room with her—I was not there when Mr. Finlay came—I saw a bottle of medicine on the mantelpiece, and Miss Addiscott gave her a dose while I was there—I have been to the home every day during the whole time Miss Addiscott had it open—I took an interest in it, especially when the children were ill—I never saw any beating or slapping of the children by her; she always treated them very kindly while I was there, and never attempted to slap or beat them in any way—my father has lived in the neighbourhood nine years, and is well known in Deptford—I always thought the home was conducted very well indeed—Miss Addiscott used to like the children very much; everything I saw there went on very satis<lb></lb>factorily—I was there every day in the winter; they had fires every day when it was very cold—I never saw the children pick up cabbage stumps in the street; I have seen them pick up orange peel, which hundreds of children will do; my own brothers and sisters have done it.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is engaged in Her Majesty's Cus<lb></lb>toms—I am the mother of the prisoner; she first started this home in July, 1877, she is now 22 years of age; she had a little money left her by her grandmother, I cannot tell the amount—I live three or four. minutes' walk from the home in Douglas Street, a private house—before my daughter opened the home she took a good deal of interest in these matters—after she opened it I went there every morning to see her—for the first two or three weeks I don't think she had more than two children, the numbers gradually increased—at one time I think she had as many as 14 or thereabouts; I was in the habit of going about the house and assisting her daily, up to the end of April—I have eight children—I had nothing to do with the money matters—I have been there when the children have had their meals—they had regular meals—they had bread and butter and tea for breakfast, sometimes bread and treacle—I have seen them have meat and potatoes for dinner, and currant pudding and boiled rice, and I have seen</p>

               <p>them have soup, not on the same day, sometimes one, and sometimes the other—they dined in the front parlour during the winter; there was a fire there—my daughter would be with them superintending and giving them their dinner; she kept no servant, only a charwoman or washerwoman—she did the cooking herself—they had bread and butter with their tea—they slept in the two pair front room—they had straw beds, with two sheets, one blanket, a counterpane, and two pillows on each bed; I have seen them with my own eyes—I have never seen my daughter beat the children, she was always kind and affectionate to them—there is no pretence for saying that I ever had occasion to interfere between her and the child she was beating—I never saw her beat a child with a clothes' line, a poker, or a broomstick—the children were fond of. me and came to me occasionally; they never made any complaint to me, and I have had one with me for three or four days together from morning till night, and if she had had a complaint she would have been sure to have made it to me—I have never received coals that my daughter has paid for, I am thankful to say I don't require it—I recollect the illness of Kate Smith; I saw her the day her mother came with her to the home, she was a very slight delicate girl; her mother said that she was in her 13th year then—I thought she was very little for that age—I saw her every day from the time she came in up to the time she took to her bed—she was in a bed in the back parlour, it was an iron bedstead, with two sheets, a blanket, counterpane and two pillows, as I have already stated; by night we should put an extra blanket on her if cold, but she was close by the fire; we used to have a fire in that room—Dr., Ayres and his assistant both attended her; Dr. Finlay saw her on the Saturday evening, as she died on the Sunday morning—the doctor paid her every attention and I myself attended on her day and night—it was my custom every morning to make her something and take it. her—I would cut her a dinner from off my own table and take it her; I would make her a custard, or a pudding, or anything that I thought her appetite would take; she was properly treated—it is not true that after her death the insects crawled from her head and body, and had to be picked off by her sister—I laid her out, and so I did the other two. I did nothing with her hair; that was taken off five or six weeks before she died, so that her head might be kept clean—she had long hair, and it was thought best to cut it short—when I laid her out there were no lice or insects crawling about her bed and over her body—there was not the sign of such a thing on her, she was kept too clean—my two daughters also partially assisted in these matters—I never saw any bruises or marks on the children—Mr. Bottomley, of High Street, Deptford, acted as the undertaker—she died on the Sunday, and she was put in the coffin on the Monday night between 8 and 9 o'clock—that would be about the proper time—I have had the misfortune to bury a child.</p>

(Read; "21st April, 1879.—This is to certify that from my medical knowledge of the Girls' Home, managed by Miss Addiscott, at Deptford, I have come to the conclusion that from want of funds or other reasons the children in the home, to a large extent, suffer from want of nourishment, considering that nearly all the children are poor, disposed to scrofula and tubercle, and in such cases efficient nourishment and warmth are most desirable elements in the treatment of such diseases.") I do not know whether the persons I gave that to are the authorities of the Greenwich Board—I think three detectives came to my house, Inspector Phillips was one—I did not write that voluntarily or under pressure; I wrote it at their suggestion—they asked if I would give a certificate to get these children away from the home—I said "I don't see what I have to do with the home or the certificate"—they said "They had been there with the Coroner and Dr. Long, and they believed the children were all starved"—I said "If that is your belief the best thing will be to get them away, and, rather than allow any suffering I will give you a certificate with pleasure"—it was my opinion that there was not sufficient warmth—I do not know of proceedings against Miss Addiscott after that by the guardians—I telegraphed or wrote to the Home Secretary—I did not introduce the solicitor for the defence to Miss Addiscott—I did not introduce my own solicitor to her—I did it exactly in this way, I have never seen Mr. Clark or her together in my life; he is my solicitor—he has been my solicitor six months—I did not suggest that he should be</p>

I have been in some thousands of homes where they were far worse—before I wrote that certificate it had been suggested to me by everybody that the children were being starved; it was the common topic, and upon that I imagined I had been duped—my opinion now is that death was accelerated provided they had funds to carry it on.</p>

A poor person might die of consumption, but if he had 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to go to Mentone he might survive; that is exactly what I mean—seeing the condition in which these children were, nothing could have saved them from death; the best of treatment could not have saved them in my opinion, but life might have been prolonged—I am perfectly sure this baby had always been scrofulous—I am perfectly ready to argue that scrofula must always be hereditary; it may never be set fire to, but there is always a spark in the system ready to be ignited—I have noticed fires when I have been there—I think I was only in the back parlour once—I noticed a fire constantly in the front parlour last winter—I have seen children sitting round the fire, and one nursing the baby that died—that was the usual way in which I saw the baby—I did not see Miss Addiscott most of the times when I went there—I saw her a considerable number of times—I walked in—the place was always open to anybody—when I did see her I thought she acted with perfect honesty in the matter, and to the best of her ability in the treatment of the children in every way—I thought she was excess<lb></lb>ively kind to the children—I did not examine the body of the dead child; I simply saw it lying on a bedstead in the back room on a sheet, with a sheet over it—it looked very proper and clean.</p>

After the inquiry was instituted by the guardians there was enormous excitement; I have seen a crowd of 200 persons collected outside the home—there was a great deal of hearsay going or, adverse to the prisoner—I heard it—I have had no communication with the prisoner or any of her friends in the matter—I have attended Miss Addiscott By the Court. I went four or five times before the death—her condition was such that by no treatment could her life have been preserved—I thought then that she would not live till morning—I saw Mrs. Addiscott that evening attending to the child in the back room; there was a fire—I examined the child, she was clean, and the bed linen also—that was the only time I was there when the children were there—I do not consider I could have been of any service if I had attended the child again.</p>

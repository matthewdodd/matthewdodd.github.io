I am one of the official short-hand writers of the Bankruptcy Court—I took short-hand notes in this matter on 25th February, 13th March, 2nd May, and 20th May, 1879—the transcript on the file is correct—I was present at the first meeting of creditors under the liquidation; it was of a very stormy character; it lasted till a late hour in the evening, and broke up without any resolutions being passed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Hassfelt was there—I do not know whether he is a relative of the Barnetts—Mr. George Lewis appeared for the creditors something was said about a warrant, but I do not recollect what—the defendant was taken in custody on a warrant just at the close of the meeting—I was at the Mansion House on several occasions—I do not remember hearing Hassfelt say "Now we shall get 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound" when the prisoner was given in custody—there were a great many adjournments, and while he was at the Mansion House they were going on with the private sittings—I do not think the meeting was so disorderly that Mr. Lewis could not be heard; Mr. Lewis is always heard with great attention when he speaks, and they listened to what he had to say.</p>

                  </hi>. I am engaged for Cope and Simner, general merchants, 7, Well Street, City—I have known the prisoner two or three years, he had small dealings with the firm—I called on him first at the end of February or the beginning of March and said that I heard from our traveller that he had an order for Lima, and we had prepared a collection, and a few days afterwards he called with Mr. Coates—we were to supply the goods on three months' credit, and if they were not paid for then, a three months' draft at two and a half—those conditions were agreed to—I had not known Mr. Coates before; the defendant said that he was his buyer—Coates made a large choice of goods, Barnett simply assenting—that lasted two or three days, and the collection he made came to a much larger amount than I expected, and at the close I had a private conversation with Barnett upon it in his office—I knew that it was an old-established firm, and he said that it was Harris, Cohen, and Co. of Lima—the defendant said that he had known Coates as a little boy and had more confidence in him than he had in his own brother—they said that Harris and Co. were an old-established firm of jewellers, and were opening a dry goods' store as well—the articles selected were dry goods to the amount of about 1,100/.—they were to be forwarded to Harris, Cohen, and Co. of Lima, and the invoice, bill of lading,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187911240059"></xptr>
               <p>and insuaance policy were to be sent to Mr. Barnett—we were to draw on Barnett if any bills were drawn—the money was not paid at the expiration of three months, and we drew three bills which Barnett accepted, the first of which was paid, and the other two dishonoured—we had them at the meeting of creditors and they passed into Mr. Sears's hands, and from him to Mr. Wontner—700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is still due to us—Barnett said, "You may look to me," and he was indignant that I should not think him worth 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound—I was not satisfied with that, but I could not get more from him—not being paid when we expected, I went and saw Barnett about it early in November—I asked him what was the meaning of the bill being returned dishonoured—ho said it was in consequence of the non-arrival of remittances from Lima, which had taken him by surprise—I asked whether that firm had failed—he said no, and he should be very sorry for the creditors if they had paid, that it was unfortunate for them, his brother was present, especially after all the money he had paid into the concern—I went home after that interview, taking the name of their solicitor, and in a few days I heard that they had stopped payment—we parted with the goods in consequence of his repeated statements that the firm in Lima was an old—established firm, otherwise I would not have done it—the transactions were small, 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or so; we never had one of 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before—shipping business is not our legitimate business—I saw Coats in the street for one or two months afterwards, sometimes with Barnett, and sometimes alone, but I never spoke to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Cope and Simner are Germans, but the firm is in Paris, London, Lyons, and Gottingen—I have represented them four years—these goods were specially insured—we packed them ourselves, and directed them to Harris, Cohen, and Co., through the Liverpool agency of the Lima line, to go to Callao, which is the port of Lima—nothing was said about con<lb></lb>firming these sales—he said "I am responsible, and you have only to look to this firm," assuring me that it was an old-established firm, and he might as well earn a safe commission—he was, of course, pledging himself to see me paid—it spread over a month or six weeks before the whole of the goods were dispatched, but the time began to reckon from the very day of each respective invoice; there were three or four invoices—we then took three months before we drew at three months—we did not begin the shippings till the middle of March, and it was the end of April before they were com<lb></lb>pleted; we went to the middle of July before we drew—we did not sell the defendant one shilling's-worth of goods after the last shipment—large houses like Faudell and Phillips and Hattons deal in cheap jewellery as well as trimmings, but they do not consider themselves trading houses—I am a Swiss—if the purchaser is not very clever to forecast the fashion, the depreciation of value of such articles may be enormous—I believe I went to the Mansion House to get the warrant, on the very day of the first meet<lb></lb>ing of creditors—I do not think I had been there before to lay an informa<lb></lb>tion—I employed Mr. Wontner—Gard and Godwin are my regular soli<lb></lb>citors—Mr. Hassfelt introduced me to Mr. Wontner; Mr. Hassfelt told me that he is Barnett's brother-in-law—I only saw him a very little time before the meeting—he called on me—I cannot remember that he told me that, if I got a warrant, I should get all my money; I did not say to him that I did not like to undertake the responsibility alone, but if he would give me an indemnity I would join—I said that such proceedings were generally</p>

               <p>costly things, and I did Dot like to go into it without knowing how far it would go, but if he considered himself aggrieved, and liked to join in it, I did not mind—he suggested criminal proceedings—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the limit I was prepared to go to, and all the rest for Hassfelt—I have that in writing, but not here; we exchanged ideas, and from him I got the idea that all the statements Mr. Barnett had made were false—I do not like to swear that no syllable passed my lips or Hassfelt's about getting a large dividend by criminal proceedings—I do not recollect that 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound was mentioned—Hassfelt did not say that he would pay most of the costs, and would take me to a good criminal solicitor, Messers. Wontner and Son—I believe he said that he had collected some evidence, and had put it, or was going to put it, into Messrs. Wontner's hands, and he took me to Mr. Wonter—he did not say that, though he had collected all the evidence, it was not well for a brother-in-law to be prosecuting a relative; but he said that my evidence was the only evidence on which a warant could be got—I do not think he said that that was what Mr. Wontner had told him: until he told me that I had not seen Mr. Wontner, and that was the first time his name was mentioned—I had not supplied him with my evidence, or given my statement to any one on oath—I don't think Has-felt made notes of my statement, but it is a year and a half ago; this conversation was a week or ten days before the first meeting of creditors—Hassfelt was a perfect stranger to me—the petition was filed on the 18th November, and he may have come to me on the 19th; I do not think I went to Mr. Wontner the same day, but within a day or two—I only saw Mr. Wontner once before I went to the Mansion House, and my statement was then taken down, and questions asked me as to my statement, which was not always very clear, because I wrote it in English—I understand all you say to me—the warrant was not in the hands of the police before December 6th—I do not know whether it was brought to the Lord Mayor's attention that the first meeting was to take place that day—I was at the meeting, but Mr. Wontner was not—Mr. Hassfelt was there, and was very excited—I did not hear him call out to the officer to have Barnett handcuffed—I saw Barnett taken in custody when the meeting was over, but I did not even know the officer till I saw him take Barnett—it was arranged that he should wait till the meeting was over and then take him—he was put in the dock before the Lord Mayor; the information that I had sworn was read—I was sworn and said that it was true—it was stated that he had been arrested at his first meeting of creditors, and Mr. Wontner asked to have it adjourned, which was done—I went there on oath twice—I may have been sworn as to the truth of my infor<lb></lb>mation—Barnett was admitted to bail, and came up several times at the Mansion House while the private examination was going on—after he passed his last examination there were adjournments till I was examined on 9th June—I have not paid my 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. yet—I have not discontinued Mr. Wontner as my solicitor in this matter—I believe the Treasury have taken it up, and I suppose Mr. Wontner represents the Treasury—I did not get from Mr. Hassfelt also an indemnity against any damages which Mr. Barnett might recover against my firm for malicious prosecution—I think I can get a paper which I say is an indemnity; it is at our office; I can send for it—I did not, between April and September, when the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid, solicit Barnett to give me further orders for Lima, or orders on his own</p>

               <p>account—a number of people collect orders for us, but not on commission; they have salaries—four out of about 25 take orders—I did not send either of them to solicit orders from Barnett after we got the 4007., but they were constantly doing so—it was their regular course of business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I had no occasion to doubt the solvency of these parties till they failed, but when they owed us 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I thought it more than enough, and forbade the travellers going there—he said that the firm at Lima were an old firm he had known for some time, and had done some little business with—Hassfelt came to consult me as one of the creditors—he said "I am Mr. Hassfelt," and stated the amount to which he was a creditor, that he knew there was some fraud in the case, some false state<lb></lb>ment which he thought he had evidence enough to show, and he wanted to know whether our firm would join in the prosecution—he gave me a few outlines of what the frauds were just to satisfy my conscience—I told him I could not embark in anything which I did not know where it would lead me to: I know that law costs money—nearly all of the creditors at the meeting were indignant—Mr. George Lewis was there on Barnett's behalf; I knew him as a well-known criminal solicitor—the indignation of the creditors was the cause of the confusion—no warrant was taken out against Eleazar Barnett.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale optician of Newgate Street—I know the defendant and William Harris his brother-in-law—I also know the youth Samuel Isaac Cohen who was in Barnett's employ; he is from 18 to 20 years of age—I recollect him and Harris going out to Lima together—I have never seen them since—Harris had been out to Lima 10 or 12 years before, and afterwards I saw him in London; for seven years I scarcely missed a week without seeing him.</p>

               <p>till they stopped payment—I knew Mr. Harris, he was a brother-in-law of Barnett's—I knew a youth named Isaac Cohen, from 18 to 20 years old; he was a clerk at Barnett's—I remember Harris and Cohen leaving England to go to Lima in June, 1878, and the former said that they were going to establish a fancy business there, dry goods; the firm was to be "Harris, Cohen, and Cohen," but I believe Cohen was only to be a name—I cannot say whether I have heard the defendant say that personally, but I have heard so—I have never seen Cohen or Harris since they went out—before Harris went out I used to see him frequently at Barnett's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known the Barnetts two years—up to the time of the failure the firm was Montague and Eleazar, and no one else—I went in August, 1876—Mr. Trotter was called half-yearly to audit the books up to the time of his death, which was in the spring of 1878—I did the writing in the books; there was a ledger, journal, cash 'book, bill book, and press copy letter book, which I have seen in Sears' possession—a set of books was kept in connection with the Manchester business—we used to supply large dress houses, but Barnett and Co.'s business was considered a wholesale one in London—I think there would be an objection among retail traders to do with wholesale houses who do retail business; that was the reason that the firm in Manchester was called Nicolle, Dupin, and Co.—Mr. Phillips was the manager; he remitted money and bills to London, and had the entire control of the sales at Manchester—the cash credits are: April 1, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; April 4, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., &amp;c.

(<hi rend="italic">For</hi> 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">endorsed "Royal Mail Steam, Moor gate Street "</hi>)—this is Harris's private account; that is outside the business—the red figures at page 4 refer to postings from the cash book to the ledger—there is an irregularity in the chronological order, the 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. item was left in abeyance, and the other items got posted and it was overlooked—when Cohen left, Lionel Harris and I kept the books; he is a relation of the family: the, defendant did not interfere with them—when Mr. Trotter died he was actually engaged in making up the balance-sheet to the end of December, 1877—I do not think an account of the stock at Man<lb></lb>chester</p>

Drouitt—the balance-sheets for June and December, 1877, are not signed, the last one signed is December 31, 1876—Eleazar Barnett was a partner when I went there, so I cannot say when he came in—the cash payments are brought out at the end of each month; the total for July is 7,069<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; for August, 11,128<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; for September, 10,721<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and down to the stoppage on 25th October 12,110<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. cash payments, including bills—I do not see why those figures should be subject to correction—all bills entered here are paid; that was the flow of cash out of the concern—with regard to the comings in, Montague Barnett or his friends brought in 800/. before 26th October—as to the actual stop. page, there had been a failure of remittances from Harris of Lima—orders for fancy goods or trimmings and braids are usually given two or three mouths before they can be executed—the generality of the goods delivered in August, September, and October would be ordered two months before—as far as I know, there was no pressure on the firm then—several parcels were refused after the first bill was dishonoured to the amount of many thou<lb></lb>sand pounds—I remember Miss Lewin coming and getting the silk and the watches before the first bill was dishonoured—I can't say whether she insisted on having the goods to meet her bill, but the goods given her were duly entered in the books—I believe Barnett sent money to Manchester in November, 1877, to fit up the premises there—I continued to act for the trustee for a few weeks—Andrews and Mason were the receivers under ha liquidation down to the adjudication in January, and they received letters from Lima and about 200/.—I gave them the figures and helped thorn to take out the figures—this is the statement lithographed for the creditors for the meeting of 6th December—I gave the figures for it as I found them in the books, and the defendant did not interfere—I urn not aware of any inaccuracy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 20, Ely Place, Holborn—I was applied to by Barnett, 18th May, 1878, to make a balance-sheet for him for the last half of 1877—a trial balance which had been made by a gentleman named Trotter was handed to me—it was imperfect, and I requested Barnett to allow me to compare it with the books—he refused, but finally I got the materials to make a true balance-sheet, and the final balance for the half-year ending 31st December, 1877, showed a net capital of 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—the value of the lease of the premises in King Street was included in that sum; the value of them is shown in the private ledger,—I believe it was 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the result of my investigations was entered in his private book; this is the entry signed by me—the lease is put down at 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was given me originally as 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and it was put down with the assets as 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the first balance-sheet; it appeared at 142<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the previous balance-sheet for June, and in the trial balance-sheet at 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—omitting the question of the lease altogether the previous balance-sheet showed a deficiency on the capital account of about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called his atten<lb></lb>tion to that, and he told me he wished the value of the lease increased by 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he had made several alterations on the premises, which fully accounted for the amount to be added—I acquiesced in that after asking him to specify the alterations, and it was entered in the balance-sheet as 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not look at the alterations.</p>

Barnett was a partner commenced prior to December, 1866—he continued a partner all those years down to this failure—he has had three partners in that time, Mr. Druitt, Philip Samuels, and William Harris—Druitt was the first partner, and then Harris, Druitt, and Montagu Bantt were all together from 1867 to December, 1871; they all signed the balance sheets—William Harris and M. Barnett were then left alone till December, 1873; Harris has not signed the balance sheets, but his capital is here—the firm was next composed of M.

Were debited for stock in the invoice book—I found the actual invoiced from the manufacturers in Barnett's books—only 10 per cent, was put on the value of the goods as against Manchester; I made a mistake in say<lb></lb>ing 12 1/2—the 13,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. includes the 10 per cent. up to June, 1878, but not afterwards—I should not like to swear I knew Parsons 5 or 6 months ago; I gave no evidence against him at the Mansion House—my impression is that I heard about Parsons before the committal in July—I have a list of the hands employed in the London ware-house—from January, 1877, to October, 1878, the monthly expenses in London were 2,087<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., of which 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid to Messrs. Barnett for travelling expenses—that does not include their drawings for their own maintenance, that came out of their share of profit—Montagu Barnett's weekly drawings are mixed up with several accounts—he did not keep them separate—there are loans to Miss Lewin and other people, borrowing and paying back, but his drawings for the four months from July 1 to the end of October were 644<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and in June, 1878, it is 812<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the six months; that would be about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I am not able to say to what purpose those drawings were devoted—I have taken out the loans on both sides—they credit themselves at the end of every half year, and Montagu Barnett's is 520<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the half-year; he took 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and his brother 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week; that went to the trade expenses; he was entitled to draw as an employe—that had not to be taken out in the balance sheet before we got the net profits—we should look at the amount of profit made in the business—Montagu Barnett was living at the rate of about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year from 1877 to 1878—if he paid any person who obliged him any interest that would be debited to him, and being debited to him, it would be in the 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—if he drew money from the business and paid it away it must appear to his debit—those amounts we can trace. I have told you of; those we cannot trace we conclude are his personal expenses—every farthing he drew which I cannot trace for loans I put down as personal expenses—the bankers' pass-book is correct, and the items vouched—all the items which appear in the cash-book are carried to some account—I do not think the prisoner wrote in the book at all—we have discovered no item omitted from the books but Parsons; it is impossible; we have no materials—when Mason and Andrews handed me the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they gave me several</p>

               <p>letters from Lima, signed W. Harris—they were among the exhibits; they were addressed to Barnett, and I took possession of them and opened them—I have not received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., only 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but 850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was received by the bankrupts prior to filing their petition—I believe the refusals to receive goods date from 25th October—hore is at page 668 of the letter-book a letter to Hutchison, of Sloe Street, saying "The goods will be useless now, as the season is too far advanced"—there are lots of countermands from the 28th, including Jules Clare and Co.—these expenses commenced in July, 1878—the total for July is 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for August 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and for September 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have the old expenses book prior to this—the petty cash in July is 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I find I have omitted 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one week and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in another for petty cash—there is an account here called travelling expenses, which I believe includes traveller's salary—these are the only books showing trade expenses—no rent or taxes are included in the figures I have given—I am given to understand that two holdings were turned into one warehouse some time before—when I became receiver I did not find two landlords—there was an entrance in Ironmonger Lane and another in King Street and a warehouse right through—Barnett employed only two men—the lease has only ten years to run—I should put the release at about 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the fixtures were of no value except to a new tenant using the same business—we made 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of them—the tenant took them because he wanted the safe, which was let into the wall—I think he would give that for the safe alone.</p>

This Trial was very long, but the Substance of the Evidence on each side may be reduc'd to this: That for the King was as follows : Mr. Smith swore, he lost the Goods above-mention'd ; That the Prisoner, who had liv'd with him a Year and a half, as his <rs id="t17151207-40-deflabel199" type="occupation">Housekeeper</rs>

Immediately he goes in Exchange-Alley, and puts up his Lottery Tickets; by which Means he discover'd the Prisoners, who sold them there. Upon this he made it his Business to find them out; and being inform'd Kelly was at Hull, in the Post of a <rs id="t17151207-40-deflabel200" type="occupation">Lieutenant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17151207-40-defend207 t17151207-40-deflabel200"></join> in that Garrison , he employ'd a Person with a Warrant to apprehend him; which was done with great Caution and Respect, the Prisoner Mower being taken before at the same Place, where she kept Kelly Company. One Beatknife depos'd, he search'd the Prisoner's Room, and in a Hair Trunk found a great part of the Goods; most of which were sworn to by the Prosecutor and his Daughter to be theirs, in Court. It was prov'd by several Witnesses, that the Prisoner Kelly manag'd the selling of the Tickets, and that Mower gave the Receipts; And that he went to the Three Cups in Aldersgate-street , to bespeak a place in the Lincoln Coach for himself, designing for Hull , which was however fill'd up by the Prisoner Mower ; That they lay together at the said Inn, and were there taken for Man and Wife; That the Goods were carried down by the said Coach in Kelly's Portmanteau , and that he himself went down with her on Horseback. The Prisoner Mower said in her Defence, That Mr. Smith had made a Bargain with her in his Wife's Life-time, to come and live with him, if his Wife should die, and be his Bedfellow: That after his Wife was dead, he claim'd her Promise, and She went to live with him, and be put her into Possession of all he had: That she was with Child by him; upon which he order'd her to take a Room on t'other side the Water, and gave the Lottery Tickets for her Security: After this her Husband came to London from Berbadoes ; and having been inform'd of her late Course of Life, she was forc'd to dispose of the Tickets to appease him. To prove all this, she call'd several Witnesses, who depos'd, Mr. Smith was acquainted with her in his Wife's Life-time, and made her civil Visits; that once he came to the House where Mower lodg'd in Mourning , and claim'd her Promise to live with him, and took her away; That after this, she appear'd very fine, and the Evidence being surpriz'd at the Alteration, Mower said, Mr. Smith gave them her as a Reward for her Services. It was also depos'd by one, That Mr. Smith Seem'd very loth to Prosecute Mrs. Mower, and would not have done it, if Mr. Kelly would have given him a Bond not to prosecute him for false imprisonment ; and that he was very tender of her while in Newgate . There were others who depos'd, they heard Mr. Smith say in Newgate, he was very well satisfy'd as to her being with Child. Some there were also who spoke well of Mr. Mower's Reputation.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner Kelly depos'd , That Mr. Mower (the Prisoner's Husband) sent for him about two Months ago, and enquir'd for his Wife; and that he inform'd him how she liv'd: That after this he went to Mrs. Mower, and inform'd her of her Husband's Arrival; which seem'd to disturb her, because of her familiarity with Mr. Smith. But after this, Mr. Mower and his Wife sent for him to a Tavern , and desir'd him to dispose of some Lottery Tickets for him; which accordingly he did, not doubting but they were his own: That after this, they all met again ; and Mr. Mower told him, he had married another Wife in Berbadoes ; but was now resolv'd to live with his Wife Jane , in Holland, where he had some Effects; and desir'd him to see his Wife safe at Hull, as soon as possible, and take care of her Embarkment there for that Voyage; for he having a Kinsman of his other Wife's in Town, who had some small Business to do with him in Holland , he durst not carry her with him lest he should be disoblig'd. To confirm all this, he produced a Letter; which he said was sent to his House in Town (where this Prisoner had a Wife and Family) from Mr. Mower in Holland, desiring him to dispatch the Business of his last Request ; for that now all Things were ready for his Wife's Reception. He also called several Witnesses to prove the Circumstances of his Defence, and to speak to his Reputation; who did him but little Service: And two Evidences call'd by the Prosecutor, gave them both the work of Characters .

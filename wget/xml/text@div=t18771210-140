                  </hi>. I carry on business as an Italian warehouseman in Long Lane, Bermondsey—I have also an establishment at Liverpool, of which the prisoner has been manager for about five years—he was paid by a salary of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week and expenses—all orders for goods were to be sent to London—many of the goods were in London and were sent from London—as to the goods in Liverpool, an order was made out from the warehouse at Liverpool, and that was forwarded to Liverpool—the prisoner's duty then was to deliver the goods and to return the delivery-order by the first post to London—the entry was to be made of the delivery in the stock-book, which was kept at Liverpool—it was his duty each week to send a list of the stock-takings of the previous week, showing what was delivered in the week and the balance at the end of the week—that was called a stock-sheet—it was his duty to pay the moneys that he received at Liverpool into the North and South Wales Bank at Liverpool, where I had an account, unless they were cheques requiring endorsement, and they would be sent to London direct—he would advise us in London the same day that he paid into the bank—he was authorised to retain 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in hand to pay expenses that might be incurred for carriage, freight, and such-like—he was not to exceed 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he sent up a list of his expenses each week, and I sent him down a cheque for them and his salary—the cheques were always drawn on my account at the Liverpool Bank—on the 8th of November, in consequence of something that came to my knowledge, I wrote to the prisoner and received this reply. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had cash in hand to the amount of</hi> 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.) On the 9th November I sent my son down to Liverpool, and on the 10th he returned to London with the prisoner—I said to him "Where is the 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.?" showing him the letter. He said "I have not got it; that is a false statement." I showed him the deficiency in the ledger, and asked him to explain it—the amount that stood in the ledger against him was between 700/. and 800/., but the accounts were not completely made up—my son was present at the interview—not getting a satisfactory answer from the prisoner, I said that any statement</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187712100116"></xptr>
               <p>he chose to make to me should not be to his prejudice—the result of the interview was that I gave him into custody—this account marked A is in the prisoner's writing—it is his daily sheet to moneys received by him upon the 30th and 31st of October—he also sent every day an account of moneys paid by him into the bank—this B is an account of moneys received on 31st October and 1st November—C is an account for the 2nd and 3rd November, D for the 4th November, E for the 6th and 7th, F for the 8th, and G for the 9th—this account of the 8th the prisoner brought with him on the 10th—he gave this in as a further account of moneys he had received which he had not previously advised—I have added up the totals of these receipts and they amount to 602<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this marked I is an account of moneys paid into the bank by him on the 1st November, and K is an account of money paid on the 3rd of November—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are accounts of the moneys paid in by him between the 30th of October and the 9th of November—the last sheet, dated the 9th, was not paid in until the 10th—the totals of these payments amount to 505/.—there is a deficiency between the moneys received by him and the moneys paid into the bank of 97<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an account of expenses sent up by the prisoner on the previous week of 3rd of November—I sent him down a cheque for that account—there is 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. down for salary—that is not his salary—it was my practice to add his salary of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week to the cheque—this 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. includes the salary—he did not bring with him his weekly account of expenses when he came on the 10th—I have not received it at all—I have not received any account from him of goods sold to Mr. Dawson to the amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—none of these accounts contain it—there is no entry in the stock-book of it or on the stock-sheet, nor is there any entry of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. received from Mr. Kearns on the 23rd of October—I knew nothing of this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) until after the prisoner was in custody—I do not think any of it is in his handwriting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He was arrested on the day on which he ought to have made up his stuck-sheet—he has been about seven years in my service altogether; two years in London before he went to Liverpool—I sent him to Liverpool to work this trade for me—I was very much pleased with the business he was making—he has more than once asked me for a rise in his salary—he has had an advance—I expressed myself in the middle of the year that I would think about his salary, and that he was to try and make all the profit he could for me—I also said I should make him a present at Christmas instead of an advance of salary—I also said "You are considerably improving your connection, and I will back you up both in supply of goods and in your remuneration"—I cannot say that I have personally audited the accounts during the five years he has been there—it is more than likely that I have, but I cannot tell you that I have at any special time—he has not often requested me to do so—my son is not here (<hi rend="italic">he was sent for</hi>)—I said at the police-court that I showed him the deficiency in the ledger of between 700/. and 800/., not on the first occa<lb></lb>sion, but the second—there was only one other person besides himself permanently employed at Liverpool to my knowledge—that was French—he was simply a warehouseman—the prisoner was buyer, salesman, traveller, correspondent, and cashier—he should have kept all the books, but I found that they are not all in his handwriting—the stock-books and stock-sheets are not, and this book is not—there was no ledger kept at</p>

               <p>Liverpool—I did not instruct my counsel to call this a surreptitious book—I am told that it was known as a scrap-book in Liverpool—I believe it was written by French and Alefounder, another person in the employ at Liverpool—this may be called an order-book—it does not appear to be anything else—the 30/. a week that he retained was for expenses—he was not at liberty to exceed that—he has done so to my knowledge and accounted for it without complaint from me—I think the week before he was taken into custody he paid 50/. in one amount in one week—he did not have a running account with me—his account was not cleared up every week—the books were kept open so as to show uncertain balances at different times, and that was allowed to continue so for a period of years—sometimes the balance was largely against him, sometimes it was decreased—there was no large balance against him till June, 1876—it was a very small balance, only a few pounds—it began to be large about December, 1876—I have not made up the prisoner's cash-book to the present date—I believe it is in Court—I believe it has been added up in pencil—I have not gone through it—the balance against him when he was arrested was not 218/.—I swear that—I believe it appears so by this book, but there are a number of false entries in it—this is not a book which I provided for it—he bought what books were necessary for his purpose and charged me with them—he would buy this book in the ordi<lb></lb>nary course of business under my authority—I had about 500 or 600 customers in Liverpool and that district—the prisoner was answerable for the increase of that connection, and I frequently urged him to increase it—when he came up on the 10th November I did not tell him that I was going to give him into custody—I wanted to get information from him—I told him that what he said should not be used to his prejudice—he came to my employment with an excellent character—I had a connection at Liverpool, but no warehouse, when he went there—I had a traveller visiting Liverpool, as other places, not residing there—I sent the prisoner there to make a business—very likely I had then about 58 customers—the increase has been partly due to the prisoner's perseverance and in<lb></lb>dustry, not entirely, for my business has increased in other districts in like proportions—his takings have been about 25,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The extension of the business depends upon the quality of the articles sold—in his last charge-sheet he charges expenses 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for salary to French 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., extra help 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and labour 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he made charges every year for extra help—he never complained that his duties were too onerous or that he had not sufficient hands—I allowed him with<lb></lb>out question every expense he charged me—no cash-book was kept at Liverpool by me or for me—I had no account with the prisoner on the basis of this scrap-book—I never saw it or examined it till he was in custody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of my ledger-account made by my principal clerk, who is here—this scrap-book does not contain entries of all the orders that were executed—independent of that there is a deficiency of stock at Liverpool—I have never been through the stock there myself—the advice-notes forwarded to London were written in manifold by the prisoner—I had no ground to suspect the prisoner till a day or two before the 9th November.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We worked from between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock in the evening—sometimes the prisoner has been at work after he got home—he had a considerable quantity of writing to do—I generally used to go home with him and do any accounts of what I had done in the day, I mean the orders I had taken—this manifold writing is the prisoner's—the reason these items were not crossed out was because the order had not been sent up—supposing his orders had gone in in the ordinary manner they would all have been entered in the stock-book—</p>

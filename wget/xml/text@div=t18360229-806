                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. John Bartolim, who keeps an hotel in St. Martin's-street, Leicester-square. On the evening of the 4th of March I was in the passage, and saw the prisoner looking in at the parlour window—he kept looking over the area railings for about five minutes—I watched him, and saw him stoop down in the passage there time, and the third time he took the mat and carried it away—I followed him with it into Leicester-square—I met Devey at the corner of Bear-street, and gave him in his charge—he took the mat from him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I did not take it—it was given me to carry—he said three or four times to the Magistrate that he did not see me take it, but his fellow-servant</p>

               <p>told him so. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I said I saw stoop twice, and take it the third time—I saw him take it—when the officer took him he said, what would he have done, if he had wanted bread—I said if he had come in and asked for bread, master would not have refused him—I had noticed him particularly, as there was plate on the table when he was looking over the blinds—the mat used to be fastened by a ring.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer, at Maryland-point, Stratford—on Thurs<lb></lb>day, 10th December, about 6 o'clock, my attention was called to the fact of three or four boys having walked away from my shop with a box—I looked round, and missed a box containing 13<hi rend="italic">lbs.</hi> of Sultana raisins which had been just inside the door—I pursued them, and overtook the prisoner about two hundred yards off—I think there were two others with him, but it was dark—he dropped the box and ran across the road—I told a boy to pick it up, ran after the prisoner, and saw him taken, on the pavement—I gave him in custody—he said, "I did not steal it, but had it given to me"—this is my box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was safe just before.</p>
               <p>MONTAGUE SANDERS. I live in Stratford—I was near Mr. Brown's on the evening of 10th December, and saw the prisoner and two or three more boys looking in at the window—they all walked off, and I saw a box in one of their hands—I told Mr. Brown; he came out, and we ran after them—I heard the box drop—the prisoner was then running across the road—I ran after him, and saw a man atop him.</p>

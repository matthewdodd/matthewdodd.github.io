                  </hi>. I live at Poplar. I was in a public-house in Wapping, on 21st Nov.—I was the worse for drink—the prisoners were there together—I did not know them before—I was there with them, to the best of my knowledge, about twenty minutes—I had 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. loose in my right-hand trowsers pocket—I treated the prisoners, and then left—they followed me to the bottom of Gravel-lane—M'Allen attacked me, and put his hand in my right pocket—he had seen me take out some money at the public-house—I held his hand in my pocket and sung out, "Police!" and Gilligan came across the street—he caught hold of me in a rough sort of manner, and we all three fell together— M'Allen got his hand away from my pocket, and a lot of my money fell about the street from my pocket and his hand—two policemen came up—they took the prisoners—I picked up two or three shillings—this knife was found on one of them at the station, it belongs to me; it was in my right-hand trowsers pocket with the silver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Allen. Q.</hi> Did not you state that you had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I changed it, and drank from six o'clock till I met with you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Allen</hi>. You were lying outside the public-house, and I said, "Don't let the man lie there, he will be taken up;" and you said, "If you will take me to Poplar I will pay you."<hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, I did not—I gave you a treat in the house to half a gallon of half-and-half to get rid of you—I did not treat you in King-street, to my knowledge—I did not go into another house and call for a pot of beer and not have money to pay for it—this took place on the pavement—I did not say it was on the iron grating.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, K</hi> 70). On 21st Nov., between ten and eleven o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners and Coghlan struggling—I heard a cry; I went up, and they all three fell together—Coghlan was drunk; the prisoners were quite sober—they were both on Coghlan—they got up when they saw me—I saw some silver on the ground; I picked up 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoners began to pick up the money—they said Coghlan was drunk and fell down—he said, "They have robbed me, I give them</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Thames-police-constable</hi>,31). I was walking down Old Gravel-lane—I heard a cry of "Police!" and saw three per<lb></lb>sons struggling—I ran across—before I got there, they were all standing up—I saw Oliver holding the prisoners—Gilligan dropped four shil<lb></lb>lings and two sixpences; I picked them up—I took M'Allen, and in going up Gravel-lane, I saw him chuck a shilling and a halfpenny upon an apple-stall—I found on him eleven shillings, a halfpenny, and a counterfeit shilling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Allen.

                  <hi rend="italic">Gilligan's Defence</hi>. I was going down to Gold's-hill, Shadwell, and saw Coghlan lying on the pavement, with his face covered with mud, and a mob of people round; some said, "Don't let him lie there;" we picked him up, and took him on; he said, "Come along this way, I have got a friend lives here;" he crossed over Dock-hill, and when we got to Cooper's-bridge, he took out his money, and said, "I have got plenty of money here;" I said, "Put it in your pocket;" he put it between his pocket and his trowsers, and it fell down; I picked up some, and his knife, and he hallooed out "Police!" the policeman came, and he said I put my hand into his pocket; I offered him his knife, and he said he did not want it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">M'Allen's Defence</hi>. We saw the prosecutor outside the door; he could not stand; he said, "Take me to Poplar, I have got a friend there;" we took him round under a lamp, where there are hundreds of persons passing by; he was senseless drunk; he did not know what to say; he charged this young man with robbing him, and when we got to the station, he charged me; I am as innocent as any person that was not there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship master, and live with Mr. Tripp, a solicitor, in Fulby Street—about 12.40 in the morning of 6th June I was called by Mrs. Tripp—there was a lot of knocking, and a great noise below—I found a pane of glass broken in the door leading from the breakfast-room to the garden, and the door was open—I called Mr. Tripp, and we went into the garden—and round to the side passage—we found the garden gate open and the prisoner on the wall, I seized him by the wrist—he was without coat or hat, and only had one shoe on; we afterwards found his coat and hat in the street in front of the house—I believe the man was so intoxicated that he did not know what he was doing; if he had intended to commit a burglary he would not have annoyed the whole neighbourhood by hammering at the place as he did—he had been in bad company, and they had left him there; he was so drunk he evidently did not know where he was—I believe he is perfectly innocent of the charge of burglary; if he wanted to steal, he could have stolen anything and gone away.</p>

I did not know it was bad"—she produced a purse from her pocket, I looked at it, and it had in it 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—some copper she bad loose in her pocket, and six metal table spoons, and six metal tea spoons—I have made inquiry, but have not found the person who sold her them—she gave the name of Elizabeth Brown at Miss Taylor's, and the sergeant at the station asked her her name, and she gave the name of Weller—Miss Taylor then said she gave the name of Brown—the prisoner said, "I don't know how I could give the name of Brown, my name is Weller"—I have ascertained that her light name is Brown.</p>

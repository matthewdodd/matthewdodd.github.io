             sworn. - I am a licensed horse-boiler: On the 30th of October last, a brown mare was brought to me by the prisoner at the bar, between seven and eight in the morning, it was a brown muzzled mare, and black in the body; I never saw the prisoner before, but I knew him again immediately; he told me his name was Edwards, that he lived at Fulham, and kept an errandcart; he said, she was a kicker, and of no use but to be knocked on the head; I enquired several things of him, and, from his answers, I thought he was an honest man; I gave him a guinea for her; I did not see him again for a fortnight or three weeks, when he brought me another horse; Johnson had given me a description of his horse, and when he came again, I stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the prosecutor on the 30th? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he give you a description of the brown mare that he lost? - A. Yes; but I did not take particular notice of the mare as to know her again from his description.</p>
               <p>Q. It is rather a singular thing. I think, that you should not? - A. I did not know the mare from his description till I examined the skin and the foot, and then I preserved it till the man came again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you examine the skin and the foot that day? - A. Yes, almost directly, but he was gone.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. But you had Johnson's address? - A. Yes; he told me he lived at Putney.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What sort of a mare was it? - A. It answered his description, I don't know that it is his mare now.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found it was his mare, why did you kill her? - A. I had killed her before Johnson came.</p>
               <p>Q. When you did find that was his mare, why did you not send him word? - A. I thought it was of no use when the mare was dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what sort of a mare it was? - A. It was a brown crop mare; the leg of it was white, and the remainder black; it had a quitter, a thing that comes just in the hoof, and a bar shoe on.</p>

             sworn. - I am a journeyman smith and farrier, at Hammersmith; I cannot recollect the time, it might be two months ago when Johnson brought the horse's foot to me; I know it by having a quitter and a bar shoe, I fitted the shoe myself, (produces the hoof and the shoe); there is no mark to the shoe; I had not a bar shoe in the shop, and I took a common shoe and brought the heel round, and that took out the mark; when I shoed her, she was in Mr. Harwood's possession; she was a dark brown mare.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you never make any bar shoe for any body else? - A. Oh yes, but I know the shoe, it is my own make; I altered it, and put fresh nail-holes in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. If you had seen the shoe, without the hoof, would you have sworn to it? - A. I would not with to have done that, because the shoe is partly worn out.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Johnson.) Q. How long had you had that mare? - A. Eight or ten days; I bought her of Mr. Harwood, at Hammersmith.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I am as innocent as the child unborn; I bought the horse of a man of the name of Roberts; he said he lived at Fulham; and since I have been in custody, my friends have enquired, but have not been able to find him. To my God, and to you Gentlemen of the Jury, I must trust my cause.</p>

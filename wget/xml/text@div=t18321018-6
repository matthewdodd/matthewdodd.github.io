On Monday morning, the 10th of September, I came down to my breakfast a little after eight; Ewer was up before me - when I got down into the tap-room; the prisoner was there, among others - I got some bread and cheese for my breakfast from a cupboard in the little back parlour; I got the cheese on a piece of bread, and was toasting it at the fire; I had got a knife and fork; when I had half done it, the prisoner came to light his pipe at the fire, and hit me on the head gently; I took no notice of that, but continued to toast my cheese - shortly after that he turned back, hit me rather harder than before, and threw the cheese under the grate; I do not remember his saying any thing - I threw the knife and fork down, and ran and hit him with my fist; he then pushed me, and we both got up in a corner, and were scuffling and hitting one another; a man in the room parted us, and I sat down - a young man came in afterwards; I continued in the room till dinner time - the prisoner was there an hour or so; a man named Oxford gave me half a pint of beer; after we were parted, somebody proposed that I should fight the prisoner on Saturday night - I did not agree about that; when the beer was given to me I just sipped it, and the prisoner asked if I had any beer to give him - I gave him the remainder; after that he had a pot of beer, and asked me to drink, and we were on good terms again - I believe he left the house soon after that; we had the beer together directly after the scuffle - it was after nine o'clock; he left the house about half an hour after I drank with him; he did not lodge in the house at that time - I saw him bring a can and put on the table, about eleven o'clock or half-past; I was in the house, and had not been out -Symmonds and another man were there; we all three had a pot of beer - the prisoner asked whose beer it was; I said I did not know - he said, "Well, I don't care whose it is, I shall drink," and drank; he then went out - there was no quarrelling about his drinking, only somebody hallooed out "Come, any't you going to be a pot?" the prisoner left, and said no more to me - I went out with Symmonds about half an hour after the prisoner, and as we were walking I saw the prisoner leaning over a gate, where he used to lodge: I said nothing to him, nor he to me - I returned to the public-house to dinner after one o'clock; I dined in the tap-room, and about two I was looking out of the tap-room window, and saw the prisoner; he came into the tap-room by the back door; he said nothing to me-I said, "What, have you been for a walk, Bob?" he said, "Ask my a-s, you bl-y fool," and I said,"D-n your a-s, and you too;" I was just turning from the window, to sit down, when this passed - when I sat down the prisoner drew towards the mantel-piece, and I saw him take a knife off the mantel-piece; he pushed towards me, and just touched me with it about my trousers; I felt the touch - I did not see whether my trousers were cut at that time; I could not see the knife in his hand at the time, but I had seen him take it off the mantel-piece, and when I felt the touch about my trousers I supposed he had it, and tried to take it away from him, but could not - he pushed towards me, and run it into my bowels; I felt the stab, and hallooed out - he directly threw the knife down under the grate and went out; he did not speak a word - Symmonds came down stairs to me; I showed him what had happened to me - Saunders afterwards came in; I was put to bed, and Mr. Hilder, the surgeon, sent for - I had only one wound, and cannot say how long I was confined to my bed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What occupation do you follow? A. I do any little jobs I can get, errands and that; I was not in the employ of any one master - I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183210180013"></xptr>was bred to no business; I had lodged at the Crispin above twelve months - I am not very often in the taproom; I first went there about eight o'clock - I am sure I was not there at six; I had no employment that day but was going to do something the next day - I have known the prisoner for years - he used to bring our milk when he lived with a milkman; I had three pints of beer myself, besides what people gave me - one and another asked me to drink; I had nothing but beer, no spirits - I had to pay for three pints of beer, but did not drink them to myself; I dare say I took three pints, and a great deal more - I was not drunk, but a little funny between ten and eleven o'clock - I was stabbed between one and two; I was drinking till Symmonds went, and then we came back and ordered another pint a piece, and Mrs. Cooper, the landlady, said we should have no more till four o'clock - I drank a little after eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you challenge this man to fight you? A. He challenged me first; I do not recollect saying, "D-n you Ned, come out and fight like a man, if you are one;" I might say so - I did not go into the road and strip; I went as far as the door with my jacket off - I had taken it off in the tap-room, because we were going to fight; I believe Mrs. Cooper was having her breakfast at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not say to you, "Be kind to the young man, and don't treat him in the way you are?" A. I do not recollect it - I did not strike him after the skirmish in the morning at breakfast; I did not knock him down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who struck the first blow? A. He came to the fire to light his pipe, and touched me on the head, and the next time he hit me hard, and knocked my cheese down under the grate, and then I hit him.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Was not the first striking as if it was in fun, putting his hand on your head? A. Yes; I did not take any notice of the first striking - the second was done in the same way, only harder; he did not bruise me, he only jolted the cheese - I felt it, but it did not hurt me; I struck him by the side of his head, and knocked his pipe out - somebody had used the knife, and left it accidentally on the shelf.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you received the wound in the stomach were you not advancing towards him with your hand raised? A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You were standing at the window, he came up and touched you, but not to hurt you, and seeing him with the knife, you went to take it from him, and then he struck you? A. Yes; he then threw the knife down and went out - I had had no quarrel with him at all about a young woman.</p>

            . I live close to the Crispin, and was there to breakfast on the morning of the 10th of September - I had taken a knife there in my hand, and after eating my breakfast I laid it on the mantel-shelf, in the tap-room; it was a case knife, not a clasp one - there were several persons in the room; the prisoner was one; the prosecutor came down to breakfast shortly after I placed it there - I saw him toasting his cheese; the prisoner and him were afterwards going to fight - I separated them - Neibour pulled his coat off in the tap-room, and went out into the road to fight; Mace said he would not fight him then, he would fight him on Saturday night- Mace had said he had got his Sunday clothes on then, and should not like to make them dirty; they had some beer together; after that I went away, leaving the prisoner and Neibour drinking beer, and apparently friendly - I returned to the Crispin about half-past one o'clock; I did not see the prisoner when I came in - Neibour was eating his dinner at the tap-room table, and after that I went out, leaving Mace standing at the window - I saw no more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were not there at the time of the occurrence? A. No; I left about two o'clock, and went to my work - the prosecutor was not at all violent in his conduct, nor making a noise while I was there- I suppose I was there two or three hours; it was after the prisoner gave him a bonneler that he went out to fight; I did not hear him use any oaths - I only had half a pint of beer of my own, and drank once out of a pot.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he offer to do any thing, or say any thing, till Mace gave him the bonneter, as you call it, on the head? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he receive a second blow before he offered to fight? A. It was the second blow on the head - it was a slight blow; he dropped the cheese, and went to hit Mace; this is the knife I had to eat my bread and cheese (looking at it.)</p>

            . I lodged at the Crispin, and was present when Neibour was toasting his cheese - his statement about that is true; the prisoner hit him twice over the head - Neibour did not strike him till after he was hit twice; I went away between ten and eleven o'clock, and returned a little before one; I went into the tap-room, and remained there till about two - I saw Neibour come in, and have his dinner; I did not see the prisoner return to the house - I went up stairs a little after two, and while there I heard a sad screaming down stairs; I went down into the tap-room, and found Neibour there, alone - he said he had been stabbed, and I saw that he had; I saw part of his bowels out - I assisted him up to bed, and went for the doctor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose he had a hat on his head at the time he was struck? A. He had a cap - the striking knocked it over his eyes; that is sometimes done in fun.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in the neighbourhood of Uxbridge-moor. On the 10th of September, between two and three o'clock, I was returning from my round, and when within a few yards of this house a person told me somebody was at the Crispin who had been stabbed; I went and saw the prosecutor on the bed - I took up his shirt, perceived a wound in his belly, and the howels protruding - the bowels had been perforated in two places; that might be done by one stab; it was an extremely serious wound - persons after such an injury generally get into a great state of depression; but I should say he was not drunk, but if he had drank a considerable quantity that morning, he would have presented the same appearance; he was in a state of colapse and depression; I have attended him ever since - he is not quite recovered yet - in my judgment, it was a very dangerous would; it was by bleeding him down to death's door that he was saved - the bowel has been restored to its place, and things are going on properly; I think the bowel is healed, but the external wound is not quite healed yet.</p>

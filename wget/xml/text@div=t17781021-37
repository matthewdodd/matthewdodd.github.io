               <p>Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he at any time, and when apply to you for any money? - Upon the first of this month he brought me this order, together with several others, for the payment of money as a reward for apprehending of vagrants.</p>
               <p>Has that order been in your custody ever since? - I delivered it to the clerk of indictments for the purpose of drawing the indictments, but I put my initials at the back of the seal.</p>
               <p>When he delivered it, had you any suspicion that it was not a genuine order? - None. I paid him ten shillings.</p>
               <p>What are the names of the persons in that warrant? - Joseph and

            .</p>
               <p>I observe that they are two vagrants, yet are treated as one throughout the warrant? - The magistrates vary in their warrants, sometimes there are four in a warrant, forty shillings; sometimes ten shillings a vagrant.</p>
               <p>I see it is for apprehending a vagabond? - It is very incorrect.</p>
               <p>That incorrectness did not lead you to suspect it? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to suspect afterwards that it was not a true order? - In passing my accounts as treasurer, the magistrates have frequently remarked upon the many sums ordered by this gentleman; I had it mentioned to Mr. Miller by an acquaintance of his that it was thought much of; and that it was thought he had acted very imprudent. He wrote me a letter that he had not signed such an order for two years. I went to Mr. Miller's, and showed him the order and he denied it.</p>
               <p>You are positive to the person of the prisoner? - Yes; very positive, because he has been repeatedly with me upon the same occasions.</p>
               <p>You take no receipts do you? - Yes, ready wrote to every one.</p>

The prisoner confess'd he took the mug from out of Mr. Wilmot's house, that he call'd for a pint of beer and drank it, and took the mug away in his pocket, when he was before the Alderman. I went with him in the coach to Newgate; he confess'd going along that he took it, and was very sorry for it.</p>

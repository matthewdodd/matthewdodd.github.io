                  </hi>. I have one partner—we are Manchester ware-housemen, and live in Watling-street. A person named Joseph Robinson came into our service in November last—the prisoner, Thomas Colegate, has been in our service six years and a half—he first came as porter, when he was about sixteen or eighteen years of age, and said he had just come to London—we advanced him, and when we went to Watling-street, which is about three years ago, we took him into the warehouse—in June last I had not agreed with him about any salary, but I should have given him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. this year—he before that had 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and lived in my partner's house, but he married in November or December last, and left my partner's house—he had no authority from me to sell goods without giving an ac<lb></lb>count of them to the entering clerk—we allow our young men to take a piece of goods for their own use, and to charge themselves at prime cost, but I should not take a piece of goods myself, nor would my partner with<lb></lb>out having it entered—during the last year we did more business than we had ever done before, and in December last we took stock up to the 30th of November—we found a profit, but the stock was about 1000/. less in value than I expected, and the profit was about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less than I had calculated it ought to be—there appeared to be a deficiency of goods from a calculation I kept of the stock at the beginning of the year, and the goods that came in from time to time—we mentioned to all the persons in our establishment that we were deficient, and my partner spoke to Stevens to look out—in consequence of information, on the 12th of July last I procured two policemen, and sent for Robinson to my counting-house—he delivered to me an account of some property, and while he was writing out a list I sent for Thomas Colegate, and said to him, "Thomas, here are some goods you had on the 7th of June, according to a memorandum of Stevens, where are they entered?"—he said, "They are not yet entered"—I said, "It is nonsense talking about that, you never intended to enter them—the fact is, no doubt, you have robbed us of these and a great many other things beside—here is Robinson, (who confesses he has done wrong,) writing out a list, now do you do the same; it may be better for you, but mind I make you no promise"—(I said that in consequence of what the officer had said to me before)—I then asked him what had been done with the goods—he said they had been sold in a tally business, conducted by his brother under the name of his brother-in-law Purkis—I enquired where the tally-shop was—he said at his house, No. 16, Devonshire-street, Mile<lb></lb>end-road</p>

               <p>—that, I believe, was the house at which Thomas Colegate had gone to live after his marriage—upon that I had Thomas Colegate taken into custody—I do not know Withers Colegate at all—I had heard Thomas speak of his brother, but I never saw him.</p>

I have lived with them about two years—I have looked at these goods—some part of them I can positively swear to as being my master's—this piece of black linen has our mark on it, and this piece of diaper I can swear to—I should say they all came from our stock—we have missed a considerable quantity.</p>

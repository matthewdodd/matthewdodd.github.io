            . I live with my father, who keeps a chandlers' shop in Buckeringe-street, Bloomsbury; the prisoner lived in the neighbourhood; I pawned the snuff box at Wises, on the 26th of October, which I had bought of the prisoner three or four months before; I did not know it was gold, I gave him 5 s. for it; he came to me on a Sunday afternoon, and asked me to buy it, I said, I did not want such a thing; he came again on Monday, and asked me to have the goodness to buy it, and I bought it; he said he found it at the corner of James's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell Wise that it belonged to a relation of yours, and you had recently redeemed it - A. Yes, I do not know why I came to say so. I told the truth when I was taken up.</p>

She said the miniature on it, was her cousin or sister, I forget which, and it was painted by an artist named Sullivan; the childs' name was Patty; I detained her; she said she had redeemed it from Wadmore's, which I found was false.</p>

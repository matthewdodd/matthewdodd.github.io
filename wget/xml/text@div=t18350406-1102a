                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Cutler, who lives at Kew-green. I saw all my clothes safe about a quarter past six o'clock in the evening of the 12th of March; there were three coats, one waistcoat, twelve yards of linen cloth, one shirt, three handkerchiefs, one pair of gloves, and six sovereigns—I saw them in my box, which was locked, but the key was in it—the box was in my room, over master's stable—I went away at a quar<lb></lb>ter after six o'clock, and returned at a quarter before seven o'clock—when I left, the outer door of the stable was shut, but not locked—the yard-door was locked—the stable is all enclosed in the same fence as the dwelling-house—it has no communication with the dwelling-house—it is some dis<lb></lb>tance from the house—I saw the prisoner at a quarter past six o'clock that evening—he stood at the stable yard gate, and asked me for work—I told him I had no work for him, but that I would try to get him some—I had known him about a week or ten days—he had a bag in his hand at the time—I could not swear to the bag again—he staid there not more than two minutes, and then went to his master—I went out with my master in his phaeton, and returned about a quarter before seven o'clock—as I was tak<lb></lb>ing the horse from the phaeton, to put it into the stable, the prisoner came to me—he did not assist me—he called as he was going home, and said he had not got any work from his master, but he was to go again to-morrow morning, and he would give him some—he bid me good night—I bid him good night, locked up the yard, and went into my master's house—I found a linen-draper in the house—I bought three silk handkerchiefs of him—I was to give him 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them—I had occasion to go into the stable for the money, and found my money was all gone, and my clothes—I suspected the prisoner directly, and instantly got on a horse and rode to Richmond after him, and from there to Mortlake—I overtook him—I got to his house with the beadle before he did—I saw him about twenty yards from the door, and the instant he saw the beadle in his garden he ran off—I mounted my horse, and rode off to East Sheen, and gave information to the police—some time afterwards the policeman came, and said they had caught him—I went and found him in a shed, all in a perspiration—I saw him searched, and found one coat on his back, three handkerchiefs in his hat, and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in his pocket—I lost some silver—I cannot say how much.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the police at Barnes. I was examin<lb></lb>ed before the Magistrate—on the evening of the 12th of March, about a quarter before nine o'clock, I received information from the prosecutor that he had been robbed—he mentioned the prisoner's name—I went with Gomm, the policeman, into Mortlake-meadows; and in a shed in one of the meadows, I found the prisoner in a very great perspiration and agita<lb></lb>tion, as if just come in—he was almost breathless—I took him into custody, and took him to the station-house at Wandsworth—when I got him there, I took off his back a coat which I now produce—I took one handkerchief from his hat in the shed, and secured his hands at that time—these two handkerchiefs I took from his hat at the station-house—I took from his trowsers pocket 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and this rasp was in the lining of the coat he had on, under the coat which I took off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman at Wandsworth. I went with ser<lb></lb>geant Payne, in search of the prisoner, into the meadows at Mortlake—I had seen the prosecutor before that, and he had informed us of the robbery—we searched through the meadow, and found the prisoner in a shed—Payne went in at one end of the shed, and I at the other—Payne turned on his light, and under the prisoner's feet I saw this coat—I picked it up, and asked the prisoner if it belonged to him—he said it did—I took Payne's lantern, and searched round the shed—in one corner I found this bag, in the hay-crib; and in it was one piece of cloth, one waistcoat, one shirt, one pair of gloves, and one coat, which the Magistrate allowed the prosecutor to take away—I kept the other property in my possession till I got to Wandsworth—I then searched every thing in the bag, to see if there was any money in the coat pockets; and then put every thing into the bag again, tied it up, and gave it to the inspector, Bignall, who locked it up in his cupboard for the night—in the morning he gave me the same things out of the cupboard, I can swear—I saw him unlock it about tea o'clock—I opened the bundle when I took it before the Magistrate, about eleven</p>

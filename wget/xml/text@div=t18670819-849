                  </hi> I am a sailor, now living at 34, Francis Street, Dept-ford—on the morning of the 31st July I was in Eltham Street, Kent Street, Dover Road—I met Slater in Union Street between twelve and one—I went home with her and Eke, and went to bed with her—after I undressed I laid my trousers on the bed—after we had got into bed Slater took hold of my trousers—I said, "What are you doing there? there is nothing belonging to you"—I made a grab at the pocket, and we had a scuffle in the room—Eke had a knife in her hand, and she struck at me—my purse was in my trousers pocket, and there was a sovereign in it—I had seen the money safe half an hour before—I afterwards found the purse on the floor, but the sovereign was gone—they left, and I went into the street and gave them into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Charles Moss, of Old Ford, Essex. On Tuesday, the 24th of November, I met the prisoner's daughter, and went home to a lodging with her—I had a sovereign and six half-crown in a purse—I put it into my coat pocket—I spread the coat over me it the bed—after I had been in bed with the daughter, the prisoner came into the room, and laid down by the side of her daughter—I awoke about four o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner had got the skirt of the coat—the daughter pulled the coat from her, and asked her what she was doing <hi rend="italic">rummaging</hi> the man's pocket—I took it from her, looked in the purse, and said I had been robbed—the daughter asked me what of—I said a sovereign and six half-cowns—the daughter said, "Mother, you must have the money, I know the man had money"—she said, "I have got no money, only one halfpenny"—I said I would send for a policeman—the daughter said, "Let us shake the straw, perhaps it may have fallen out"—I said, "It could not fall out of the purse"—the prisoner stooped down and picked up three half-crowns, which she offered to me—I said it was of no use without she gave me the other three and the sovereign—she stooped again and found another half-crown—I went down stairs, and after a little while they came down—I said they had better give me the money—the prisoner said she had only one shilling—the daughter said, "If you have, you must have robbed the man of it; I know you had no money last night"—I was quite sober.</p>

            . I occupy the shop and two parlours on the ground floor of this house. On Sunday morning, the 11th of September, about a quarter before six o'clock, I heard somebody open the street door, and go up stairs - in about ten minutes I heard some person coming down again; I went out, and met the prisoner in the passage, with a bundle under his arm - he ran into the yard, and then into the water-closet, with the bundle, and pulled the door after him; I pulled it open, collared him, pulled him out, took the bundle from him, and gave it to Mrs. Heath - I opened it to see the contents; there was a coat, waistcoat, trousers, three shirts, and other things - he begged me to let him go, which I did; he stood a little while, and then slipped out at the street door - he said if I would let him go he never would do the like any more; I had never seen him before - we went to the street door; the Policeman ran, and caught him - I am sure he is the man.</p>

            . I can swear to all these things except the petticoat - I know this shirt to be mine, and the coat; I had pulled it off on Saturday night, when I went to bed, and put it across a chair - my wife had been called up, between two and half-past two, to the apartment of another lodger, where a death happened; she is not here- I was awake when she got up; she shut the door when she went out, and I was out of bed just before day-light, as the baby I had in bed with me cried - I went on the stairs, and called my wife to fetch it; I came back, and when she went out of the room with the child I shout the door after her - I went to sleep, and knew nothing more till I awoke; I cannot say that the things were safe when I shut the door the last time - I missed them when the alarm was given, and when I got down stairs they were put into my hands; the prisoner fell on his knees, and begged me to let him go - my wife did not come up stairs, after taking the baby, till she came to alarm me; she had been down in Edgcomb's room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I asked you to let me go. Witness. Yes, but I did not, the women let you go - the house was all in confusion, and one of the women certainly helped him to get out.</p>

             re-examined. The prosecutor's wife was in my room from half-past two o'clock till she went to call her husband, except when she went to fetch the baby - one of my children died that morning; she fetched her baby, and I do not recollect her leaving the room afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, (written). I have always lived by industry, and have lived in the parish of St. Martin above twenty years, and part of that time as housekeeper, carrying on business as a working-jeweller, working for some of the first shops in London, supporting a wife and a large family; but by losses and misfortune failed. I have been working since as a journeyman for many respectable masters, and latterly with Mr. Rayner, of Union-street, Blackfriars-road, who is ready, at any time, to take me into his employ, should your mercy be extended to me by your verdict. I have only to assure you, that going towards the prosecutor's house I saw a man come out, and seeing the door nearly open, and wanting to go to the yard, I went in - I was followed by a woman and a man to the privy, when they laid hold of me, and accused me of taking some clothes, which were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183109080023"></xptr>shown by the woman. I did not go up stairs - the prosecutor was called down; I told him I did not know that I had done any thing wrong, that I was intoxicated, and hoped he would let me go, which he did; I was then pushed out into the street - I was walking away towards my home, reflecting on the impropriety of my going in, when the Policeman stopped me, and took me to the station-house - he went back, and compelled the prosecutor to come against me. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I throw myself entirely on the mercy and consideration of the Court, having a wife and three children to support.</p>

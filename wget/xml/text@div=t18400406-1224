                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the 22nd of March at Knightsbridge—I met two young men, one had a box on his shoulder—I questioned them, and then opened the box, which contained these articles—in consequence of what they told me, I went to the house of Mr. Tinkler, the prisoner's master, in High-street, Putney, the same morning, between ten and eleven o'clock—the sergeant went in, and brought the prisoner out to me—we took him to the station-house—he said he was sorry for what he had done, he knew it was wrong; he had found a bunch of keys in an out-house, and one of them unlocked the place where the key of the wine-cellar was kept, and he took the wine; that the percussion-caps and cartridges belonged to his young master; he kept a quantity in one of the rooms, and he had taken these and the bullet-mould from him—he at that time knew we had found the property on the other two men—he also said he went to Mr. Wise, in High-street, Putney, to purchase a lock to put on this box, and seeing a number, of locks there, he took the locks which were found, and theft he did not know what to do with them, and had sent them off to London—I produce the property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gentleman's; servant, and live at Putney. I know the prisoner by seeing him out with fetch—I have been out of place four months, and the prisoner offered me a trifle to come and carry the box to town—I could not get a <hi rend="italic">buss</hi>—fetch and I went to Mr. Barton's, a shoemaker, where the prisoner pointed out the box—Petch and I were taking it to town, and the officer met us.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-sergeant. I went to the prosecutor's house, and saw Mr. Tinkler, senior—I stated to him what brought me there—he rang the bell, and had the prisoner called into the parlour—when he came I cautioned him against saying any thing but what he thought proper, as what he said would be given in evidence—MR. Tinkler asked if he had taken these things—he made no answer—MR. Tinkler said he was not well, and I should wait till his son came from church, to go up stairs with the prisoner to search his box—when his son came we went up and found the locks and keys, and three keys fell from the prisoner on the floor—I took them up, and told the prisoner he dropped them—he said, "No, they dropped from the bed"—I said, "No, they are warm," then he said he had dropped them, and he had found them in an out-house—I found they unlocked the store-cupboard, the wardrobe, and the cellaret; and then the mystery was how the wine could be got out of the cellar, as we had no key that unlocked that—while we were in the passage, Mr. Tinkler's son came out and said the mystery was solved, that the key of the wine-cellar was in the store-room—the prisoner then acknowledged that he took the wine, and we did not go down to see.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and carry on the busi<lb></lb>ness of a cutler and dressing-case maker, in New Bond-street. On Wed<lb></lb>nesday, the 22nd of April, about the middle of the day, the prisoner came, and inquired the price of a small dressing-case which was in the window—I told him—he asked me if I had any ladies' dressing-cases—I showed him what I had—he said they were too common, he wished some more expensive, mounted with silver—I said, when my father returned I would procure him some, and send them—he said, "Do," and gave me his card, with "No. 2, St. James-square," on it—he said I was to send them the following evening, about seven o'clock, as be could not decide on them himself; they were for the inspection of a lady who was coming from Windsor—he said if the lady approved of them, whatever was kept would be paid for—he said the gentleman's dressing-case was to be sent with the lady's, and also two pearl knives which he selected—they were all for the lady—I procured a lady's dressing-case, of the value of 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., fitted with silver, and a small mahogany gentleman's case, value 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I sent by my father, with the two knives, one of which was worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner came again next day, and looked at some knives, forks, spoons, a pocket-book, and other things—he produced his own pocket-book—I saw what appeared to me some Bank-notes in it, and concluded that he was some foreign merchant, or something of that sort—on the Saturday he came again, and selected about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of cutlery, but they were not sent in—he said die lady had not returned, that she was to come by the train—he did not say what train—he said he hoped I should let him have the best of cutlery, as he was particularly recommended to us on account of our good things, and he had no doubt the lady would be a good customer—all the articles were for the lady's inspection—I expected whatever the lady did not keep would be returned, or I should have the money paid down—that was the understanding, as he was a stranger to me—if it had not been for his representing that they were for the lady's approval I should not have parted with them without the money—I considered he would have decided at the time if they bad been for himself—I did not intend to sell them to him—I understood they were for the lady's inspection from the first.</p>

H. De Vries," I believe, on it—he said I was to call next day at two o'clock, as, no doubt, the lady would have arrived—I did so—he said she had not arrived, but she would, no doubt, arrive in the course of that afternoon, and I was to come again at six o'clock, by which time she would be there, and would be able to decide what she would keep—between four and five o'clock I went again with some more things—(he had been to the shop in the meantime)—he was not at home—a servant girl opened the door, and asked me if the things were for Mr. De Vries—I said they were, and she took them of me—as I was returning from the house, the prisoner hailed roe in the square—he was coming from Charles-street—he said it would be of no use coming that night, as the lady had not arrived, I must come next day about two o'clock, by that time it would be decided on, and whatever was kept I should have the money for—on the Saturday I went again, and saw him—he said he must trouble me to leave them till Monday, they could not be decided on before, as the lady bad not arrived—between Saturday and Monday I learnt something that made me suspicious.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and occupied the house, No. 2, St. James's-square, in April last. In February a person called on me for the purpose of taking it—in consequence of what that person said about a friend of his, the prisoner afterwards got possession of the house—he took possession on the 24th of March—he was to pay thirty guineas a month for the first three months, twenty-five guineas for the second three months, and twenty guineas for the last three months—he took it for nine months certain—I bad an indirect reference—he was at first rather offended that I should ask him for a reference—I said it was usual in England—he said, very well, he would refer me to a banker, a friend of his, in the City—he went away, and returned next day, saying the gentleman was not in town, but he would be in two days—he returned in two days, and again said the gentleman had not returned, and at length he got the house, because I depended on a former reference which I had from a friend of his, the gentleman who had called in February—the brass plate was put on the very day he came—di<lb></lb>rectly it was decided he measured the size for the brass plate, and in a few hours it was placed on the door—I cannot exactly tell how soon afterwards any goods came—it was about the latter end of that month—he asked me to recommend him a tailor, as he said his clothes were with his family, who were to bring them on the 1st of May—I did recommend him a tailor, but he was a ready-money tailor, and the prisoner declined having him—a great many parcels came to the house—on Friday, the 25th of March, I saw this dressing-case on the parlour table—I do not know when it came—it disappeared, 1 think, next day—I lived in the house—I let him the whole house, with the reservation of two rooms for myself—the first</p>

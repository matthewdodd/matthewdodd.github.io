On the 22d of October, about half-past six o'clock in the afternoon, I took a hackney coach in Gracechurch-street, to go to Devonshire-street, I was set down at my father's door - the prisoner was the driver. I know he is the same man. I had an umbrella, a cloak, and a parcel; the umbrella and cloak were taken out of the coach, but the parcel was left in - it contained the silk in question. I missed it in about five minutes after I got home. I went to the first coach-stand, and in a quarter of an hour, found the prisoner on the stand in Theobald's-road - he had just got on the stand. I asked if had put me down in Devonshire-street - he said Yes. I said</p>
               <p>"I left a parcel in your coach;" he said</p>
               <p>"If you did, it is there now, for I have not taken any one up since - you had better look into the coach;" he himself looked in and said</p>
               <p>"There is not parcel there;" a friend (who was with me) then got into the coach, but there was nothing there; the prisoner then said</p>
               <p>"You had better look into the pocket," which I did not, because I knew it was not there; he said</p>
               <p>"If it is not in the coach you must have dropt it on getting into<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182410280053"></xptr>the coach." I said I was confident I did not; the officer Thompson then came up and searched the inside of the coach, and said he did not see it, but he would look in another part of the coach.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know where these silks were got - A. No; they came from Exeter to me; upon my oath they are not French silks. I gave the parcel into the hands of my friend when I got into the coach.</p>

            . I was with this young lady in the coach; she was set down in Devonshire-street. I put the parcel on the back seat of the coach. I rode with her, and saw the parcel on the seat - I forgot it when we got out. I saw it afterwards when the officer found it - it appeared to be the same by the outside of it. I heard her conversation with the prisoner in Theobald's-road; what she has stated is correct.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty, and saw two or three persons round the coach - I crossed to enquire what it was about, and the lady said she had left a parcel in the coach; the coachman denied it, and the gentleman and lady got in to look. I said</p>
               <p>"Get me a light," and one of the watchmen got me one. I got up to the boot, and the prisoner got up on the opposite side, and attempted to cover the parcel which was in the boot with hay. I told Dodd to take him into custody - he did so. I found the parcel which the lady claimed as hers.</p>

I took up the fare in Gracechurch-street; the gentleman brought the lady with some things on her arm - I do not know what they were; they got in and the gentleman gave me 2 s., before I started; as I was putting up the step of the coach, I saw a parcel in the road; I took it up, and put it into the boot. When they got out at Devonshire-street, the lady said to the gentleman</p>
               <p>"Have you got all;" he said Yes. I went to the stand, and then they came and asked me if there was a parcel inside the coach; I said, not that I knew of, but they might look into the coach and see, themselves; they got in, and when the lady got out, she said her father would be very angry if she did not find it; she described the parcel, and I went to get it from the boot, when the officer came and seized it out of my hand.</p>

About half-past ten o'clock in the morning of the 12th of September, I was in Cornhill, sitting in Laithwaite's newspaper-office, (where I am shopman,) op<lb></lb>posite 'Change-alley, Cornhill, under the Royal Exchange—I had a full view of the street—I heard a number of people calling out to a cart to stop—I immediately looked, and saw a man, whom I knew as a porter, under a cart—I did not see the cart before the wheels had gone over him—I cannot tell at what rate it was going previous to the accident—when I saw it, the wheel had gone over the man—it was going at a fast rate, and had only one horse in it—was a particularly heavy cart, and had only two wheels—there was nobody in the office, and I could not leave it—the man was taken up, and taken into' Change-alley—I did not go over—I should say, at a guess, the cart was going at the rate of five or six miles an hour after it had gone over the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Cornhill, about half-past ten o'clock on the morning of the 12th of September, standing on the pavement—I saw the cart coming at the rate of five or six miles an hour towards the Poultry—I was nearly opposite Laithwaite's shop—I saw John Sanders take a newspaper in his hand, from Holmes' newspaper shop window; he was coming across, from the Royal Exchange, with it in his hand—he was not reading it—there was no carriage at that present moment—to the best of my knowledge he had spectacles on—he generally wore spectacles—he either had them on, or in his hand—he was a short-sighted man—I saw the cart coming—I hallooed three or four times to the persons in the cart—Sanders was then seven or eight yards from the cart, I suppose—I should think any body could hear me—the cart kept coming on—the horses touched him, knocked him down, and he went under the wheel—the wheel caught him, and dragged him for four or five yards—the younger prisoner was driving, and the other sat alongside of him—it was a calenderer's covered cart—the horse appeared rather spirited when I caught hold of him—it went five or six yards before I stopped the cart—if the eldest prisoner had not got Hold of reins, I could not have stopped him myself—I saw no other carriage near—there was nothing to prevent their see<lb></lb>ing the person cross—the street was quite clear—I should imagine San<lb></lb>ders to be between fifty and sixty years old—he was rather infirm—his name was John—I did not see what became of him—I stopped the cart, and asked the eldest prisoner whose cart it was—he said his father's—Mr. Reynolds, seeing the accident, went to the Mansion-house, and they were taken before the Lord Mayor, who asked Johnson what he had to say—he said he was very sorry, but he had merely given the reins to Miles to drive—Miles was afterwards apprehended—it did not appear to me that there was any violent driving—Sanders might have slipped—I did not see him slip—it was quite accidental, from what I saw—the boy was not whipping the horse.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the boy, who had the reins, try to stop the horse as well as he could? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I saw; but when I caught hold of the reins, the eldest one took hold of them, and by his assistance I stopped it—the cart was seven or eight yards from Sanders when I first saw it—Sanders was on the ground almost momentarily—I did not notice a cab pass before the cart came up to him—I cannot say whether a cab had passed just before—there was no omnibus near—there might have been something up higher in the street—I cannot say there was not an omnibus twenty or thirty yards higher up the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Ship public-house, Artillery-street. I was at the bottom of Change-alley, in Cornhill—I saw Mr. Sanders with the newspaper in his hand—I have known him about six months—he was a porter, and between fifty and sixty years old—I do not think he was near-sighted, for he went about without glasses, except when he was reading—I do not know whether he had them on that morning, but I picked them up when he was run over—I saw him cross<lb></lb>ing the road, and observed a cart coming at rather a quick pace—not violently, but faster than carts generally do in Cornhill—I did not notice who was driving it—my attention was directed to Sanders—I saw the cart coming so quick I thought he must be run over—I ran to him just as he was knocked down by the horse—the horse ran against him—he was on the other side of the way—I was going to stop the horse if I could, but it went on, and I saw the wheel pass over his body, across his ribs—I picked him up, and took him into Change-alley—I sent for a surgeon, who came, and I took him to the Borough Hos<lb></lb>pital on a shutter—he died about five minutes before we got to the hos<lb></lb>pital—he was rather infirm in one foot, I think—I think, if there had been proper caution used, or a stronger lad had been driving, the accident would not have happened—the cart was five or six yards away from him when he was crossing—he was generally a nimble man—the cart was certainly going faster than usual—he went in front of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Ship. I was standing near White, and heard several voices of people—I had my back to the cart at the mo<lb></lb>ment—when I heard the voices I turned round, and saw the cart three or four yards before Mr. Sanders—it was coming at rather a fast rate—I should think Sanders must have seen the cart—he appeared to me to be confused, finding the horse so close on him, and hardly knew which way to go—Miles, the younger prisoner, was driving—the horse was rather lean—I should think he was not very spirited—the horse, or the shaft, knocked Sanders down, and the wheel went over his body, but previously it drag<lb></lb>ged him along a little.</p>

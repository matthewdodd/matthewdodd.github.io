I know the prisoner very well—on the morning of the 28th of Jan., about one o'clock, I was in the tap-room of the Rising Sun, and saw the prisoner come in there—he appeared to me to be very much agitated—I observed that his finger, or some part of his hand, was bleeding—I did not notice what part—I asked him what was the matter with his hand—he said he had cut his finger—he sat down, his brother Henry was there—after a little time the prisoner said, "The deed is done, and it cannot be undone"—he did not say this to anybody in particular—he stood up and said so in the tap-room—he shook hands with us, and bid us good bye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But did he add anything to it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He said, "It will be a mys<lb></lb>tery to you all"—his brother Henry made the exclamation, "God strike me dead! he has shot his woman!"—he addressed himself to no one—he said it loudly, for everybody to hear, and the prisoner spoke loud for any<lb></lb>body to hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did the prisoner say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not say anything that I heard—I came out of the room—after Henry made the exclamation about his shooting his woman he went to the prisoner, and felt his jacket</p>

               <p>pocket, and the prisoner said, "Ah, it is gone"—he had on a round jacket at the time—his brother felt in his breast pocket—I left the house, and as I left the prisoner's sister came in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many persons were there in the tap-room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Several, I cannot exactly say how many—he appeared very much con<lb></lb>fused and excited at the time he used this expression—he was almost like a madman, I considered at the time.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Sale-street, Bethnal-green-road. I have known the prisoner some years as a neighbour. On Saturday, the 25th of Jan., the prisoner brought the pistol produced to me, to repair the screw of the top strap, which was broken out—I repaired it for him, and took it to him at the Rising Sun, in Sale-street, according to his direction—I found him there, and gave it him, the same day—I am sure it is the same pistol—I find my work on it—he came to my house the next day, Sunday, to have a little further repair to the pistol, which I did—he applied to me to cast him some bullets—this mould belongs to me—I cast him four bullets in it, and gave them to him—(<hi rend="italic">looking at two bullets</hi>)—these correspond with the mould exactly, and fit it—such bullets as these would be cast in a mould of this size—he asked me for some percussion caps—I gave him six or seven which would fit this pistol—the only remark he made to me was that he was going to have a shooting match with one <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> Bunn—he did not say when—he left me about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, with the pistol and bullets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you did not take particular notice of his words about the shooting match? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he might have said he intended to have a shooting-match with Bunn—I did not hear him say he had made an appointment with <hi rend="italic">Dick</hi> Bunn—the pistol and bullets are of an ordinary size.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chair-maker, and live in Hare-street, Bethnal<lb></lb>green. I have known the prisoner two years—I knew the deceased, and knew he was paying his addresses to her for some short time before this happened—on Monday, the 20th of Jan., I was at a ball at the Crown and Anchor, Waterloo-town—the deceased and the prisoner were there in company—in the course of the evening I observed the prisoner show some attention to two young women there—he treated them to some drink at the bar—the deceased appeared to be angry at his attention to the girls, and struck one of them—the prisoner interfered—he separated them and they returned to the dancing-room—I was there from half-past nine to about twenty minutes to one o'clock—I did not see the prisoner in their company after they returned to the room—I saw the deceased I home, at her request—she said she was frightened about being insulted by one of these girls outside—I did not go to her father's door—when we got to North Conduit-street we were overtaken by the prisoner—we were standing talking there, waiting for him to come—we were expecting him, and he came up to us—he said nothing—he struck her in the face with his right hand—he gave her no reason for it—I told him not to strike her, to strike me—he said, "I will not strike you"—he struck her again, while I was picking up her bonnet—I returned her the bonnet, and left the prisoner and her together—they then appeared quite friendly—they had made it up—on the Tuesday morning in the following week, ahout half-past one o'clock, I was going into the Rising Sun accidentally—I knew nothing of what had happened, and saw the prisoner coming out, and Bunn and se<lb></lb>veral others—I saw the prisoner first—he said to me, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>, you have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184503030029"></xptr>
               <p>been the whole cause of this destruction"—I asked him what for—he made no reply—he seemed quite altered altogether—quite confused—he then walked to the top of the court opposite, in company with Bunn—we all three walked together—I heard him say to Bunn, "The stars give light, and the moon shines bright"—I left them and returned home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He appeared to you quite lost and confused? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did, all the while he was in my sight that day—from what I saw of him I could not place any reliance on what he said—he was agitated, wild, and confused—Bunn asked him to come home to supper with him and he made him that answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the police. I first saw the prisoner in custody at the station, about half-past three o'clock in the morning—I noticed that the skin of his right hand was driven on one side, and a slight cut here—(<hi rend="italic">inside between the thumb and finger</hi>)—it was a fresh wound—there was a wound on his finger—that was an old wound, and had a bit of plaster on it—I did not examine it, but it ap<lb></lb>peared an old wound—the plaster was dirty.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of the London Hospital. Soon after one o'clock, in the morning of the 28th of Jan., the body of the deceased was brought there—she was quite dead—I saw a mark on the left side of her neck—it was a black patch, spattered with blood and gunpowder, such a mark as I should expect to see from a pistol discharged close to the person, there was so much blood—there was a great deal of blood upon her clothes—I looked at her hands—there was no appearance of blood upon her hands, but they were slightly smeared, as if from the fingers of persons who had touched her wiih their bloody fingers—anybody who touched her clothes would have got smeared in raising her up—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mor<lb></lb>tem</hi> examination, and found a wound in the black patch, extending upwards to the back of the head to the top of the spine—I afterwards extracted</p>

I am the son of William Matthews, a salesman in the Borough-market—between the hours of 4 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon last Monday week, I was by Cromwell-buildings—some boys and young men rushed behind me, and caught hold of me by my neck, and scratched it—I became insensible from the pressure on my throat, and when I came round I missed my watch—I ran after them and saw Driscoll—a lady told me something—I saw Driscoll hold William Webster while the other chaps were getting away—I did not see which way they went—I saw a tall young man with a light Muller-cut-down hat—he was taller than me, and about the same height as Coombs—Driscoll was stopped at the Town-hall—I gave him in charge.</p>

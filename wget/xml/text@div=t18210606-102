            . I am a watchman; my box is in Crown-street, about one hundred yards from where the prosecutor was robbed; I observed a man run from me, in a direction from that spot, with his hat in his hand, he was of the prisoner's height, and ran as fast as he could; I thought there was something wrong, went out of my box, and heard a woman calling in a low voice, Stop him! I sprung my rattle, and went after him, down Circus-street, without waiting for her; a number of people came out, hearing the alarm; I could not see the person; I came back out of a court, the prosecutor stood there with some people; the prisoner came up, she said,</p>
               <p>"This is the man who robbed me!" I laid hold of him; the shawl was not found; she was positive to him, and I thought, by his size, that he resembled the man who ran by my box.</p>

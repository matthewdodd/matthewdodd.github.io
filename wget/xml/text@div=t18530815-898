                  </hi>. I live in Silver-street, Enfield, and am a carpenter and joiner. On Saturday, 9th August, I left my tools, at half-past four o'clock, in a building where I was at work—in Northumberland-park, at a new-built house—on the Monday following, at 6 o'clock in the morning. I went there, and missed one axe, three saws, five planes, a 6-inch trying square, two gouges, two hammers, and various other things—I afterwards saw the axe at the General Post-office in St. Martin's-le-Grand, on a scaffold where several men were at work—the prisoners were at work, one of them had the axe in his hand—I gave them into custody—Smith had been at work on the week previous at the next house to where I had been in Northumberland-park—he had got discharged—this is the axe—I know it positively to be mine—I drove this wedge of deal into it—it is worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I gave 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—the value of the other tools I lost was about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have not seen the other tools—there were some boards taken from one room in the building and brought into the hall in that new-built house in which I was at work—they appeared to have been removed there to make a scaffold to get up to these tools—they could get these things by means of a ladder on the scaffold—I saw the tools all right about half-past 4 o'clock.</p>

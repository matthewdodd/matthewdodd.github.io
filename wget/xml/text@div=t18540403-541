                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at No. 3, Brunswick-place, Shoreditch. I know the defendant—in consequence of an advertisement I saw in a newspaper, I saw him at the place where I now reside about the middle of June, 1852, and agreed to purchase his business—during the negotiation, he stated that he was a physician of the University of Edin<lb></lb>burgh—when I went there, this document (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was in a frame on the mantelpiece in the front sitting-room, where the patients came—during the negotiation, he stated that he was a graduate of medicine of the University of Edinburgh, and that that was his diploma, pointing to it—he and I car<lb></lb>ried on business together for twelve months, at the end of which time he left, and two or three months after that I discovered that it was a forgery—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030099"></xptr>
               <p>during the twelve months the diploma remained in the place where I first saw it—when I discovered that it was a forgery, I went to him, at No. 2, Amwell-terrace, Claremont-square, Clerkenwell, where he was carrying on business—on two or three occasions before that the diploma was the subject of remark, and he distinctly stated that he had been to Edinburgh—I pressed him more closely, and he told me he really was an M. D. of Edinburgh—I asked him if he had been to Edinburgh; he said he had, but that he was not there more than thirty-six hours—on another occasion, I pressed him more closely, as I could not understand how he had avoided the residence-clause, which was necessary, and he then told me he really had been to Edinburgh, that he had been examined in a room by three gentlemen, and was told to retire; was afterwards called in, and told that he had passed, and that he then and there paid the fees, amounting, I think, to about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he was told that the diploma should be sent to him by post—he said he had avoided the residence-clause by means of presenting a thesis—when I went to him, I told him his diploma was a forgery—he said, "for God's sake, don't mention it; I have been deceived, but I can at any time go to Edinburgh, and point out the house where I was examined"—I then communicated with the authorities of the University of Edinburgh, and for<lb></lb>warded them this diploma.</p>

Scotch diploma could he had by communicating with the party referred to; I have heard of diplomas being advertised for sale, but not specifying Scotch ones—I have not myself dealt in diplomas.</p>

D." for a certain sum of money—when I discovered that this was not a genuine diploma, I required that the defendant should withdraw 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the premium—it was a matter of two agreements; he agreed with me that he would accompany me in the business, and attend to the business with me for twelve months; he performed that agreement—this diploma was put up over the mantelpiece, so that it might be seen by all his patients; I cannot tell how many of the patients could understand or read Latin—I have walked Guy's Hospital; I have always understood that there is a necessity to reside in Edinburgh for a certain number of months, and there is a cer<lb></lb>tain course of study necessary at Edinburgh for twelve months after passing a London examination; if a student enters on the first occasion, he must reside there four years; but after passing examinations here, I believe twelve months suffices—you must be nominally apprenticed for five years in order to become an apothecary—I served three—you must walk the hos<lb></lb>pitals for three winters and two summers—I am not the prosecutor, and I believe the authorities at Edinburgh are not.</p>

               <p>the sum given; had that anything to do with this forged diploma? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No<lb></lb>thing at all; it was taken off because Mr. Bossy, who had agreed to go four miles in the first instance, now declined to do so, and requested me to give up a certain portion of distance, three miles on the west side, three miles on the south side, and one mile on the north side, for that money—the agree<lb></lb>ment was not altered at my instance, and the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in consideration of that.</p>

This University issues diplomas conferring the rank of physician—four years' study is neces<lb></lb>sary to obtain it, three of which may be taken at any other University or established school of medicine, and one at Edinburgh—besides that, there is an examination—sometimes there are two periods for the examination, but the degree is always conferred at one—it is a personal examination—there are thirteen professors of the medical faculty, each of whom examine—they generally sit together two and two at examinations—it is a real examination, a searching one—this paper produced, with my name to it, is a forgery, and the seals are also forged—our diplomas are in the Latin lan<lb></lb>guage; this is somewhat to the same effect; this is a translation of it, as well as it can be made (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), but the Latin is not very good—this case (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) contains a genuine diploma.</p>

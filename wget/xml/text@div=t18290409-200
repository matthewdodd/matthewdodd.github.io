            . I am an oilman, and live in the Strand. I was coming down Drury-lane, and saw the prosecutor - the two prisoners were behind him; Forest had his hand in his pocket, and took out the handkerchief, which he passed to Stretton; I immediately ran and seized Stretton - I told the prosecutor he had been robbed; I then ran and took Forest.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not Stretton been allowed to go a distance? A. Yes, five or six doors - that was after Mr. Howle had seen him and I had fetched Forest; he went about twenty-five yards or thereabouts - he did not attempt to run; it was not possible that the handkerchief could have dropped on the ground, and the other take it up.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>FOREST'S Defence. I had been on an errand for Mr. Reece, where I work; this man came and touched me, and said he wanted me - that I was the person who had picked his pocket; Mr. Howle told me I might go about my business, but this man called me a pickpocket, and then gave me in charge.</p>
               <p>STRETTON's Defence. I was going along, and heard a person say, "You are robbed;" I saw a handkerchief upon the ground, and picked it up - a gentleman came up, and said, "Take charge of him;" I had not my senses at the moment, I was so confused; I did drop it down - he then brought this other young man, and said I might go away, then he called me again, and said, "The other one has been saucy, and the gentleman is determined to give you both into custody."</p>
               <p>The prisoners received a good character.</p>

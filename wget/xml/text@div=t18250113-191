            , who is coachman to Mrs. Matam of Throgmorton-street. We live in London Wall. On the 3d of December the prisoner came to enquire for an apartment, I said I had only half a bed to let; she said that would do, she wanted a bed for her brother who lodged at the second public-house in London Wall, that her name was Smith - she went up, looked at the bed, and liked it very much, and said her brother had lived three years with a gentleman, who she would refer me to; she then said she was awkwardly situated, that her husband had promised to meet her, but had not, and she had a parcel at the coach-office, with 5 l. odd in it, but they had refused to give it her, because she had not the money to pay for it; that she never was at a pawn-shop in her life, having just come from the country, and if I would have the goodness to lend her 3 s. she would leave her wedding-ring with me, till three o'clock, when she would return for it. I told her to walk in, as my husband would be in shortly; I did not like to do such things and without his leave; she said</p>
               <p>"No, don't tell your husband, on any account, for he knows my husband, and may tell him" - so I let her have the 3 s. I said</p>
               <p>"I hope this ring is gold" - she said</p>
               <p>"Certainly it is, look at the stamp inside; and pray take care of it, for it was my mother's" - I went for her brother's character, but they knew no such person; she said she lived at No. 6, Swan-alley, which I found to be false. I am certain she said it was a gold ring.</p>

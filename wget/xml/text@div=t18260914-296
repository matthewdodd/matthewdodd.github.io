            . I am a porter. I called in at this house on the 13th of August; I put my hat on the table; the prisoner and another man came in; the prisoner wanted to drink with me, and we had another pot of porter; I had been very ill a long time; I put my head on the table, and soon afterwards I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket; I told the landlord of it, and asked if he would suffer strangers to be robbed in his house; my hat was then gone; and I told the prisoner I would not go out without it; he then sent his companion into the parlour, and took Melville's hat, and put it on my head, and pushed it down; I do not know where they got the hat, but they turned me out altogether, and said, what did I want more - I went home.</p>

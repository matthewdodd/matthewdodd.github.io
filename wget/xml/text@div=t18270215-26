In October last Mr. Charles Sewell kept an account at our house; on the 4th of October his balance was between 700l. and 800l., to the best of my recollection. I produce the ledger, which is kept by James Raper - on the 4th of October I saw this draft (looking at it) presented at our counter - I paid it, and I find, by the book, which is in my hand-writing, that I gave for it a 300l. note, No. 6957, dated the 20th of September, 1826, and 45l. in gold; I have no recollection of the person to whom I paid it; I have been in the constant habit of seeing the prisoner coming to our house, from Mr. Sewell, but whether I paid it to him I cannot say - since I have paid the cheque I have examined it more carefully, and do not believe that it is Mr. Sewell's writing, but I would not swear that it is not; I only examined it in the general way of business when I paid it; I should pay no more attention to a cheque presented by a stranger than by a person whom I knew; there is a stiffness about this signature, not common to Mr. Sewell's writing - his account has since been credited for the amount paid; that appears in the ledger now before me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Whose hand-writing is that entry? A. Raper's; at the time I paid the cheque I believed it to be genuine; I was told it was forged before I looked at it again. Mr. Sewell brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150017"></xptr>his book back, saying he had never drawn such a cheque- he stated this to the partners, not to me - I saw him at the house - I do not know whether his brother, the attorney; was with him; it was paid on Wednesday; I think I first saw Mr. Sewell about it on the following Saturday, when he applied for his pass-book, and I gave it him. I have none of Mr. Sewell's cheques here.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When did Mr. Sewell have his book from your house? A. On the Saturday - he did not open it, but put it into his pocket; he returned in an hour or an hour and a half, and I was informed that the draft was forged.</p>

            . I am assistant to Mr. Hawley, a jeweller, of No. 75, in the Strand, and was so in October. I know the prisoner's person. On Wednesday, the 4th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to our shop, and wished to look at a gold watch - I asked what price; he said one about twenty guineas - I showed him some; he selected one, also a chain, two seals, a key, and watch-guard - they came to 44l. together; he paid me 41 sovereigns, which were all he had in his purse - the other 3l. was paid the next day - he had the purse in his pocket; he also took from his pocket a 300l. Bank note, and said he must take care of it, for he was going out for the evening, and should not like to lose it - I told him it was a great sum for him to carry about, and asked if he had no friend whom he could leave it with - he said not near at hand, and would I have the goodness to take care of it for him till next morning - I said I had no objection, and asked for his address - he gave me, "William Parker, Princes-place, Kennington;" I told him, as he was a stranger, I would take down his address in the book, and the number of the note, which was 6957, dated the 20th of September, 1826, 300l.; he put the watch into his pocket, and went away; he came again next morning, about ten o'clock, and said he had called for his 300l. note - he said, as he was going into the country, to see his father, mother, and sister, he should like to take a present to his sister, down to Northumberland - I asked what he would like to have - he said he should like to take her a gold watch; I showed him some- he selected one at twenty guineas, with a gold chain, three small seals, and a key - also a ring for his own finger; they came to 34l. odd, together; he proposed to pay for them out of the 300l. note; I said, as my employer, Mr. Hawley, was not come to town, I could not give him change till he arrived. I directed him to call in an hour or an hour and a half; he called, and I told him it would be impossible to get change for so large a note in the neighbourhood; he said, "We had better go to the Bank;" we did so, and got the 300l. note changed for four of 50l. and a 100l.; I wrote on the back of the note, by the prisoner's desire - I merely wrote his address - his name had been previously written on it, when he left it with me.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Bank, and produce this 300l. note - when we change notes we always require the name and address to be written on the back, by the person who brings them.</p>
               <p>G. SHEPHERD re-examined. This is the note on which I wrote the address - it is No. 6957, dated the 20th of September, 1826; I have written on it "Mr. William Parker, Princes-place, Kennington," with my initials, "G. S., 4th of October, 1826;" I wrote the name and the date on it the evening before, but the address at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go back to the Strand? A. I did, but the prisoner did not - he said he had got his lodgings to pay for, and if I would give him some sovereigns he would call again in the afternoon, and settle the account - I gave him five sovereigns out of my pocket, and carried home the whole 300l. with me - he did not call in the afternoon, but came next day, and I paid him the difference out of 100l.; there was 3l. deficiency on the first transaction, 5l. I had lent him, and 34l. odd for the watch; I deducted that out of 100l.; the other notes were left in my care till he should return from the country, which he said would be in ten days or a fortnight. I was to engrave one of the seals which he bought the first time, and I gave him that when we settled on the 6th - he never called for the 200l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ERLE. Q. The prisoner was an entire stranger to you? A. Yes - I never saw him till the Wednesday. Mr. Hawley was in the shop when he first gave me the 300l. note, and showed him watches - Mr. Hawley did not interfere about the 300l. note, but saw it - all that is on the note is in my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you yourself charged with any offence respecting this 300l. note? A. Yes, both me and Mr. Hawley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make your escape from a house which you were in on that charge? A. I did not - I was detained in a house by Mr. Cope, and went out of it without his knowledge. I tendered the note to the clerk at the Bank, and received the money - I kept it without giving it over to the prisoner; he left four 50l. notes with me - he had none of the notes which came from the Bank; the notes he left with me were one of 100l. and two of 50l.; I put the four 50l. notes into circulation - the 100l. note was not circulated at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say that Mr. Hawley was present at night, when the prisoner first came? A. He was. I was detained by Mr. Cope and Mr. Gates about a week afterwards - they came without a warrant, to apprehend me and Mr. Hawley - I left the house, and returned home to the Strand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you introduce the prisoner to the clerk at the Bank, or did you appear as the person doing the business? A. I passed the note to the clerk, and he sent me to another - the prisoner was with me all the time, and I asked him what notes he would have - he said, "Get what you like." I did not introduce him to the clerk. I asked him, in the clerk's presence, what notes he would have, but the clerk could not hear that.</p>
               <p>- HAWLEY. I am a jeweller, and live in the Strand. I was in the shop on the 4th of October, when a person called, but I have not recollection enough to know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, but you saw him again the next day, did not you? A. I saw him several times; I was going out at the time - I cannot swear to him; he asked to look at some watches - Shepherd attended to him, and he purchased a watch; I heard their conversation - he was asked what price watch he would have, and said one about twenty guineas - he was shown one or two, and chose one at twenty guineas; he would not go to more: he bought a chain, two seals, and a key; I think they came to 41l.,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150018"></xptr>but there was something afterwards - he paid for them in sovereigns; I heard him remark that he did not know whether he had sovereigns enough, but on counting them he had just enough, I think 41l.; he had a guard, and ordered a seal to be engraved, which made the transaction 44l., but he did not pay that that night - he had a note in his hand, and said, "I must take care of this - this is my yearly allowance - my father allows me so much a year, and I must take care of this;" he said it was a 300l. note- Shepherd observed to him, "Are you not afraid of being robbed of it?" I think he said he had got to go Kingston - he had given a name for the engraving of the seal, and Shepherd asked for his name and address - he said, William Parker, in some square up at Kennington; the seal was to be engraved W. P.</p>
               <p>Q. After Shepherd observed to him, "Are you not afraid of being robbed?" what was done? A. He said,"I am almost afraid of carrying so large a note about with me - will you take care of it for me till to-morrow morning?" Shepherd said, "If you have no friend about here who will take care of it for you, I will;" he left the note, and Shepherd wrote his name on it - that is all that I recollect; I did not come to the shop till after eleven, or between eleven and twelve o'clock the next morning - he was just going away as I got in; Shepherd said the young man who was there last night, had purchased a watch; the prisoner was then gone - he came back in, I think, about an hour - he wanted change for this 300l. note - I told him we could not change so large a note; he said,"I will go to the Bank and get it changed;" I said,"Shepherd, you have a little business in the City - you had better walk with this young man, and he will pay you for the watch out of the note," and they went - I saw him the day following, when he called, and settled the account with Shepherd; I was standing in the shop - Shepherd asked him how he would have the change; he said, "I wish you would give me the change of 100l., the difference of what I owe you, and I will leave 200l. with you till I come back, which will be in ten days or a fortnight - if you will be so good as to take care of it," and he did leave it; I did not see him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. How many interviews had you with the person? A. I think I saw him three times, but the time was so short I scarcely noticed him.</p>

               <p>Q. Turn to Mr. Sewell's account - is that account composed of entries made by yourself? A. Yes, entirely; the cheques paid are debitted to Mr. Sewell; the cheque is paid at the counter - it is then passed down to me, and I enter it in the ledger, from the cheque itself, which is before me when I make the entry; I compare the pass-book with the ledger - it is my duty to see that they agree- the pass-book goes between the house and the customer; that is made up by different persons; none of those entries are my writing - I have the pass-book here, and remember it being delivered to Mr. Sewell on the 6th of October - it then contained an account which agreed with the ledger - I saw it delivered to Mr. Sawell on the Saturday; there are now subsequent entries in it, but still it will show plainly, by the dates, what the balance was on the 4th of October - (looking at it) I find cheques that had been paid for, perhaps, a fortnight previous, are written off under the date of the 6th of October; the entries in the ledger are made daily, but those in the pass-book on the day it is left, but still the amounts will agres; we first got the pass-book on the 6th; all the accounts in the ledger are my writing; I make the entry from the cheque, which lies before me; there was a balance on the 4th of October, due to him, of 738l. 4s. 2d., before this cheque was paid; credit has since been given to Mr. Sewell for this cheque; I did that myself, by order of Mr. Lloyd, one of the partners, and credit has been given him in the pass-book also.</p>

            . I am a hop and seed merchant, and live in the Kent-road - my business is carried on at No. 3, Three Crown-court, Borough; the prisoner lived with me a little more than 12 months, as clerk. I had occasion to leave town on business on Monday, the 2d of October; I intended to be absent about a fortnight - the prisoner was in the counting-house, when I left - I do not remember whether I told him how long I might be absent, and cannot say whether he knew that, or where I was gone - I went to Halstead, in Essex, on Monday night - slept there at my father's, and went to Braintree on the following morning; and selling more hops than I expected, I had occasion to come to town on Wednesday, and arrived about eight o'clock at night, on the 4th of October - I did not go to the counting-house till the next morning - I then saw the prisoner there - I made some observations to him about some samples being thrown about, and complained to him of their not being tied up while I was absent - I did not go to my bankers till Friday, the 6th of October; I had no particular reason for going; but Saturday being pay-day, I like to see how my account stands - my bankers are Messrs. Hanburys' and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner remain with you on the 5th of October? A. He was there on Thursday morning, the 5th, about half-past 9 o'clock, when I went to the counting-house- I went into the market, and when I returned I believe he was there - I went out a second time, and when I returned the door was locked - I had a key in my pocket as well as him - I opened the door, went to my desk, and found a note laying on it - he had made no communication to me before that he was going away. This is the note; it is in his hand writing (read).</p>
               <p>MR.

Hall, Thompson, and Sewell, at Salter's-hall - I looked at my pass-book in the clerk's office, and finding an entry, which I did not expect, I looked for the voucher, and found a cheque for 345l., which I was debited for, in the pass-book. This is the cheque (looking at it) - it is not drawn by me; I have no doubt of the body of it being the prisoner's hand-writing; I never authorized him to draw any cheque.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect him to fill up any cheque for that amount? A. Certainly not. I do not speak to the signature, except that it is not my writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The prisoner was in your employ at Three Crown-court, Borough? A. Yes; that is in Southwark; I left the counting-house about half-past two o'clock on Monday, and left London about three or four; I returned to town on Wednesday night, about eight o'clock; I got on the coach at Braintree; I did not go further than Halstead, which is seven miles from Braintree; I intended to have been absent a fortnight; I took with me samples of, perhaps, one hundred and twenty or one hundred and fifty pockets of hops.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you meet with at Braintree? A. I find, by my sale-book, I sold two pockets to

            , fifty-seven to Mr. Satch, of Colchester, ten to Mr. Walton, of Chelmsford, and, I believe, I sold two more to my brother; I sold no more; I intended to go to Norwich, where I had left my horse and gig, to resume a journey, and I went subsequently; I meant to go to Yarmouth; I should not have returned home, had I not made the sales I have mentioned; I had made an appointment with a gentleman, and, I believe, I wrote to him from Norwich, stating that I should meet him probably on my next journey; I sold these hops at Braintree fair; I had returned from Norwich on the 27th or 28th of September to supply myself in the market, ready for the fair; the hops I sold were all Kent, except two pockets; I had no more Kent left, and was obliged to return to town for more samples, as the people there seldom buy Sussex hops, which was all I had left.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, why take them there? A. It is impossible for me to tell what people may fancy.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you leave your cheque-book, on going from town? A. In a separate drawer, by the side of my desk; I believe I locked it; I have no recollection of having found it unlocked; here is my cheque-book and the margins; I never had any conversation with the prisoner in my life, on the subject of my balance.</p>
               <p>Q. You never communicated to him the state of your affairs? A. No, not the particular state of my affairs; I never told him the amount of my balance; all I say of the signature to the cheque is, that it is not mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the turn at the end of the l, does it not appear to have been added to the original signature? A. It appears to have been tipped up with a pen; I do not believe it has been added; I have turned my l's something like it at times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever said that, but for that you should not have known it not to be your hand-writing? A. I never said any thing of the kind - I never said so to Mrs. Amey England, nor to any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at your cheque-book, and refer to the margin of a cheque, dated the 2d of October, and see if it is not torn out? A. There is the remains of a cheque having been torn out clean - I do not recollect ever finding the drawer open - I sometimes put a short dash with a pen at the bottom of my name - it is very probable that I have torn cheques out at the end of my book to take with me when I am going to travel, and sometimes I tear it out completely to the margin; but when I come home I take off the following cheque, and write on the margin of that the particulars of the one I have used.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, at any time, subsequent to the discovery of this supposed forgery, advise Mrs. England not to go to Messrs. Hanburys'? A. I did; it was before the prisoner was in custody - I did not state to her that I had paid in 900l. or 700l., shortly before this cheque was paid; I might have said that I had paid in money, but not those sums; I have no recollection of having said any thing to her - I never heard Mrs. Sewell say so to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to her that England thought he had ruined you in drawing out that amount, because he was not aware that you had paid in 700l. or 900l. shortly before? A. Certainly not; this calls to my recollection something of what did pass - I might have stated to Mrs. England that he thought he was drawing nearly, or quite, all the ready money I had there; but he was not aware of the sums I had previously paid in.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Mrs. Sewell saying, "He thought he had overdrawn 14l. or 15l., did not he?" addressing you? A. Certainly not; nor did I say, "Yes, but I had paid in a sum of 900l. shortly before," or any such a thing - I did not tell her that I was the nominal prosecutor on this charge, or give that as my reason for advising her not to go to the bankers.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, on the solemn oath which you have taken, between Almighty God and the prisoner, is not that signature your hand-writing? A. Certainly not; decidedly not - not one iota of it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Nor was it written by your authority? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You found your pass-book at home? A. Yes; it was in my desk, which was locked.</p>

            . I am master of a Reading coach. In October I saw the prisoner at the Saracen's Head, Friday-street; I drove a coach backwards and forwards then; he went to Reading once with me; I occasionally stopped down at Reading; and about the 19th of October, or the latter end of that month, I had some conversation with the prisoner at Reading; I recollect telling him, about eight o'clock one morning, that I fancied he had been doing something wrong, as I had seen him with a gold watch, and understood he had another - I said I had heard of a forgery in town, and thought he might have been concerned in it; he said he did not know any thing particularly about that; perhaps he might, but he did not say he was concerned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he deny being engaged in it? A. No; in fact. I did not press it - he said he thought he should go away somewhere, and talked of going to Oxford or Southampton - he said he hoped I should not detain him, or stop him; this was after I had told him what I had heard of a forgery in London - I said I thought if he had done it he had better be off - he took the nails off his portmanteau, which formed the initials, W. P., and left the portmanteau with me till he should come or send for it - I produce it; here are the marks of the W. P.; he did not say where he was going, and never came or sent for it; I saw Mr. Gates, the solicitor, open it, and take out some papers, which I put my initials on, with the date, the 25th of October - these are them.

            , ESQ. I am one of the partners in the banking-house of Messrs. Hanbury and Co. On Saturday, the 20th of January, the prisoner came into the inner counting-house of our banking-house, No. 60, Lombard-street, and asked for Mr. Lloyd; I said my name was Lloyd; he said, "My name is Sharpe England;" I replied, "Who is Sharpe England?" not, at the moment, recollecting the name; he said, "I am come to surrender myself;" Mr. C. Lloyd, who was sitting at the desk, turned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182702150021"></xptr>round, and said, "Oh! he is the young man who committed the forgery;" I said I hoped he had well considered the matter, and the step he had taken - that he had nothing to expect from us, us it was out of our hands, and in those of the Bankers' Association; I think he said, "I suppose you won't let me go now;" I said, "Certainly not," and asked him to step into another room; he said, "I hope you will consider my case as leniently as you can." I sent for Mr. Gates, and went myself to the Mansion-house, for Mr. Cope.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ERLE. Q. When you said you could not let him go, did that appear to alarm him? A. He was as collected as possible,</p>
               <p>G. SHEPHERD re-examined. This is the seal, the chain, and watch that I sold the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). May it please your Lordship, I am fully aware of my awful situation, but of the charge, I, in the presence of Almighty God and the Court, declare myself innocent; my father was a respectable tradestman, well known and esteemed, and in the early part of his life was in the service of one of the worthy Aldermen of this City; he was in bad health, sustained great losses, and died insolvent, leaving a widow, a younger brother, and myself, without the means of support - I was only four years old; my mother was reduced to poverty and distress; under these circumstances I became acquainted with Mr. Sewell, who took me into his service, at 8s. a week, and after being with him a year he increased my wages to 10s., which continued to the time I left him; I will not enter into the particulars of the transaction, as it cannot be confirmed, and I shall be charged with having impeached others.

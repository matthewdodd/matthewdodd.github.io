As I was going along the foot-way (it was light) Goodwin and the other prisoner were together; they came up to me; Goodwin demanded my money, I said I had none; he then said to the other d - n the bitch! she has got money, run her through! I had given them three halfpence; they untied my silk cloak and put it in their pocket; I had never seen them before; I am sure as to Goodwin. It was light at the time; I cannot be sure to the other man. They presented a brass hanger to me; the handle of which was loose, and the blade rusty. They were taken up that same night about 11 o'clock; I had given information before at the guardhouse that I had been robbed. They were in soldiers dresses when they robbed me.</p>

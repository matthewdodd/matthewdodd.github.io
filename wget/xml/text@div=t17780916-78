            , Mr. Bristowe and I present, and two gentlemen from Nottingham. Barnard came and pulled a parcel of papers out of a bag and wrote what they liked: Barnard said to Bristowe, we must swear one has been at such a place, and the other has been at such a place; Bristowe said that would do very well; he wrote something and hurled it over the table for us to sign.</p>
               <p>What place did he say they must say you had been at? - He said one at Calais, the other place I cannot remember; he then ordered us to set our hands to that writing; then Bristowe told Norton he must pay Barnard five guineas; Norton scrupled it and wanted a receipt; Barnard asked him if he disputed his being a gentleman; Norton then paid the five guineas; then Bristowe said I must pay Barnard five guineas; there was nothing said what Barnard was, we did not know we were to have any thing to do with any body but Bristowe; we asked what Barnard was; Bristowe said it cost him three or four hundred pounds to learn the business, and would we take the business out of his hands. I paid him five guineas.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said about crossing the salt water? - That gentleman said something about crossing the salt water over a piss-pot, or something of that kind.</p>
               <p>What good were you to receive for the five guineas? - We were to be discharged in two or three days by his order; he said something about the insolvent act; we did not know the meaning of it. Norton and I went up to Bristowe the next day; he was in bed; he got up to let us in, and we asked what Barnard's name was; he would not tell us, but began to d - n and sink, and said it cost him four or five hundred pounds to learn this business, and what the devil do you think (says he) I will tell you his name, if you get your business done that is enough for you. I afterwards spoke to a Mr. Williams, and we apprehended them.</p>

That they said, they must make them fugitives, and talked about the Insolvent Act, but he did not know what it meant; that he was quite a stranger to an Insolvent Act, and did not know what it was; that Barnard never told him he was to surrender to a prison; that they told him he should go home in two or three days; that when he saw Bristowe sit drinking all day Sunday and Monday, he was uneasy and wanted to go home; that he never told Barnard he had no effects, but he had assigned them over months before. Being asked if he was to surrender to a prison why he signed the schedule? he said he signed the paper without reading it; that they did never tell him what it was, nor did they say that they were to swear at all.)</p>

               <p>I am a gardener in Leicestershire. I came to town with Bristow and the last witness; we were to be discharged from the incumbrances we were in, but I did not know by what means. We met with Barnard at the Swan with Two Necks in Lad-lane on Sunday; Barnard and Bristowe asked for a private room, when we came into the private room Barnard pulled out a bag of writings and asked me if I intended to be discharged; I said, what do you think I came here for? he said very well, I need say no more to you; and he said to Bristowe we must fix them as fugitives; Bristowe agreed to it, and he began filling these papers up. Bristowe said Barnard was an attorney, that he was the man that was to do the business for us; I asked Bristowe more than once how this was to be done; Bristowe swore it cost him five or six hundred pounds to learn this; and if I tell you or any body, you will take the business out of my hands. I saw Orme pay Barnard five guineas. (A paper shown to Orme.)</p>
               <p>Orme. That is the paper I signed; that is all that was done for the five guineas.</p>
               <p>(Norton on his cross examination said that Bristowe never demanded any money on his own account; that Bristowe had cleared several people in the same manner; that Barnard said we must go over the piss pot and then they could get some Abrahams and Moses's, or somebody, for five shillings and threepence to swear they saw us go over the salt water; that he never said in conversation with a Mr. Fletcher; that he did not want to hurt Bristowe, but only wanted to get a little money to pay his debts; that he never said any thing about this matter to any body, except his wife; that he told Barnard he had assigned his effects over five years before, and had nothing he could call his own but a turnip-hoe, or something he worked with, and that Barnard said he belonged to some prison, but the witness said he did not know any thing was said about surrendering to a prison.</p>

               <p>Barnard said in his defence, that his business was only with Bristowe; that he had nothing to do with the men, that Bristowe was to be his paymaster; that Bristowe told him they were to take the benefit of the act as fugitives; that he asked them if they had been abroad; they said yes, one said at Calais; that he showed them the act, and told them they must make a schedule of their effects, and that they must surrender to a prison, and could be cleared no other way; that he waited at home on the Monday, expecting that they would come and surrender, but saw nothing of them; that on the Wednesday Bristowe told him they were gaping about the town, and he could not find them; that he did not see them again till they came with an officer, and gave charge of them.</p>

            . I lodge in the King's Arms yard, Coleman-street. I put the articles stated in the indictment into a bag, and sent them by coach to the Spread Eagle, Gracechurch-street, to be left till called for. I walked to town. The watch was in my pocket - I met the prisoner in my way to town. I arrived on the 1st November, and stopped at the Cherry-tree, Kingsland-road, for him, as I had given him my watch to sell for me, and he had gone away with the money. When I got to the Spread Eagle, the bag was gone - the prisoner was taken next day. I had told him I had sent my property there.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 2d of November, about ten o'clock in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street; the porter of the inn was with me; I told him I took him for stealing some clothes from the Spread Eagle; he denied the charge. I took him up the yard, and Penny identified him as the person who received the property. I found a waistcoat on his person, with Mitchell's name at full length on it, also a pair of stockings, neck and pocket handkerchiefs, with his initials, and 14 s. 6 d. in cash He denied having any property when I searched him. I have found nothing else.</p>

            . On the 16th of last month, about 11 at night, I was going along Ludgate-street. The prisoner at the bar came and took me by the arm, and asked me if I would go along with her. Just by the end of <placeName id="t17611209-35-crimeloc194">creed lane</placeName>

She turned her back to the wall, and put her hands behind her; I threatened her with my stick if she would not deliver it. She dropt the book by my foot, and ran away. There was no person near me at that time but she. A young man came up, and said he saw her go down that lane, and said he would go with me to see to find her. We went, and came back and looked about, and as we came to the spot where she drop'd the book, there was she standing. We took her. I really believe, by the light of the lamp, the prisoner is the same woman. I knew nothing of the tobacco pouch, till the watchman took it off the ground where she was.</p>

            . I am a watchman; I stand at the toyshop at the corner. I had been round my beat, and saw the prosecutor talking to a woman. I made up towards them, and saw the woman slide a pocketbook from under her cloak, and let it fall. I helped to pick up the papers that fell out of it; he gave me charge of the prisoner; but I am not sure she is the woman that was with him first.</p>

            . I got a little merry that day. She wanted me to go home. I crossed the way at St. Paul's Church-yard; the gentleman took me by the cloak, and said, you are the person that picked my pocket of a pocket-book. The watchman crossed the way, and took charge of me.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prosecutor. Did the prisoner cross the way at the time you took her into custody.</p>

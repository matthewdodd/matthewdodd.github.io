                  </hi>. I am shopman to Charles Ward, of Great Russell-street, Covent-garden, a tobacconist. The prisoner came there on the 15th of June, and asked for cigars—I heard a rattle of snuff-boxes on the trays, and I looked, and one was gone—I charged him with it—he said he had not got it—I told him there was one gone and I could not let him go till I was certain—I was going round the counter, and he gave me the snuff-box—this snuff-box had been removed, and he gave it me from somewhere behind him—he took it from his left hand—he was standing with his side to the counter, and his left hand behind him—there was a counter behind him, and he could have reached it at the time he gave it me.</p>

On the evening of the 4th of October, about five minutes after eight o'clock, my shop was preparing to be shut up - I had a quantity of goods in the window - silver, gold, jewellery, watches, and plate; I I was behind the counter with four or five young men, my apprentices; I heard a violent crash, resembling almost the pole of a coach being pressed on the plate glass of the window, which is much stronger than common glass; on turning round, I saw a hand as if trying to catch hold of some of the goods - there were gold chains, gold and silver watches, and other goods in that part of the window; some of them within half an inch of the glass, and some eight or ten inches from it; the hand was introduced about four or six inches, where some gold watches were suspended - I could see the hand; the window was perfectly safe before; I happened to have one of the young men outside the counter - his name is Loosemore, and in less than three seconds he was out; and Beeston, another shopman, had got hold of the flap of the counter, and he was out in a moment, and I followed him immediately; three of us were out in less than a minute; when I got out, I saw Beeston had hold of the prisoners Delaney and Ryan; I laid hold of one of them and brought him in, (I am not quite certain which) and Beeston brought in the other; and afterwards Loosemore brought the prisoner Mahoney in, and in two or three minutes an officer came in, and on Mahoney he found two gold chains; I knew them to be mine; I saw the hands of Mahoney and Delaney were much cut, and bleeding; and next day I noticed something the matter with the knuckles of the other, as if he had been in some conflict, such as a pugilistic conflict; I am fearful I have lost also a gold watch, a silver watch, and two or three articles; we found one gold watch on the pavement I swear the gold chains are my property.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Jones. On this evening I heard a violent crash of glass in front of the window - I instantly ran out to the window, and saw the three prisoners at the bar, close upon the broken pane of glass; Delaney and Ryan had their hands inside the inner part of the window - both of them had both hands inside the window, which was broken sufficient to admit their hands - I should think twenty inches of it were broken; Mahoney was standing behind the other two; I made a rush on them all three, and seized Ryan and Delaney - Mahoney slipt from under my arm; Ryan and Delaney then made a rush to get away, and in doing so, we all three fell on the pavement; at that instant Beeston came out, I gave them both into his custody as they lay on the pavement; I then went in pursuit of Mahoney - I lost sight of him, and in the hurry of my pursuit, I passed him three or four yards, when a passer by called to me, that I had passed my man - I instantly turned round and saw him; I am quite sure he is the man - I collared him immediately, and brought him back to my employer's shop - the other two were then in the shop; I saw the officer search Mahoney, and saw him take one lady's gold chain from his outside pocket - I was then desired to attend outside to watch the broken window, and saw no more; I have not a doubt of the three prisoners - we had a full light on their faces; there are five or six gas lights in our shop.</p>

            . I was shopman to Mr. Jones at that time; about eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the shop near an opening in the counter; I heard a most tremendous crash of glass, and immediately went out; Loosemore was first - I saw him struggling with the prisoners Delaney and Ryan on the pavement - I went immediately to him; Loosemore said, "There is another, you take charge of these;" which I did, and he followed the other; the prisoners struggled and got up, and at that moment Mr. Jones came; he took hold of one, I the other; I did not observe their hands - I saw a gold watch on the pavement, about two feet from the window; that watch had hung before the square of glass that was broken - I suppose there was about £400 worth of property hanging before that pane of glass; Loosemore returned with the other prisoner, and they were taken by the officer.</p>

             (policeman.) I belong to Bow-street. On the evening of the 4th of October, I was called to Mr. Jones' house; I found the three prisoners in the shop - I searched Mahoney first, and found two gold chains in his right-hand coat pocket - I produce them; I searched the other prisoners but found nothing; I saw nothing of the gold watch - Delaney and Ryan's hands were both bleeding and cut; I asked Delaney if he had anything<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183310170006"></xptr>about him - he said he had a watch, but had given it to somebody at the window when he was scuffling with the shopman.</p>
               <p>Delaney. Q. Did I not tell you as I was passing by, I picked up the watch, and when Mr. Jones laid hold of me it fell out of my hand? A. No; you did not say that.</p>
               <p>DAVID JONES. These chains are decidedly my property? they are worth sixteen guineas; the gold watch I did not take notice of; some small things were picked up by a female neighbour, and brought in to me, and several things were missed.</p>
               <p>Delaney. All I have to say is, to beg the mercy of the Court; distress and want of employment drove us to do it; we were in a state of starvation.</p>
               <p>Mahoney. We were in a state of starvation and distress - I have no friends.</p>
               <p>Ryan. We were in a state of starvation and distress - we do not know any body in this country.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stock and brace-manufacturer, in partnership with others, at 17, Cheapside. The prisoners were in our service; Westerby was a foreman, and Dixon was under him—we took stock in June, and found a deficiency in the department the prisoners were employed in, of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe the collars produced to be our property—on 4th Sept., in consequence of some<lb></lb>thing, I called Dixon to my counting-house, and asked him if he knew Mr. Attenborough's, the pawnbroker's, in Newington-causeway—he said he did—I said, "You have been in the habit of pawning large quantities of shirt col<lb></lb>lars there, my property"—he said he had pawned shirt collars there, he was not aware they were my property, they were given him by Westerby—I asked him how many times he had pawned shirt collars; he said he could not tell—I asked him whether he could tell whether it was one or a dozen times—he said he could not—I asked if he had not pawned collars elsewhere, he said he had—I asked where; he hesitated, and I said, "At Mr. Powell's, in the Borough"—he said, "Yes"—I asked how many times; he said he could not tell—I had a policeman by, and gave him into custody—he said it was no more than he expected—his duty was to starch collars before they went to be washed.</p>

                  </hi> I am a bookseller, and live in Gray's Inn<lb></lb>passage. On Saturday, the 30th of Jan., Box brought thirty-one volumes of books to my place—they are here, this is one of them, and this another—these appear to be the same books—Box asked me if I would buy them—I looked at them, and remarked to a customer, that they were very curious—(some</p>

               <p>of them were curious)—I asked Box where he brought them from—he said, "My name is Box, I live down the yard; I am acquainted with a person you know of the name of Deacon"—(I did not know such a person)—I asked him where he brought the books from, and whose they were—he said he was employed by a person, who was coachman to a lady in the neigh<lb></lb>bourhood of Brunswick-square—I asked him what he wanted for them—he said, "5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—I said 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi> for so few books—he said he was to have 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and all he got above that, he was to have for himself—I ultimately agreed to give him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, and I asked him several questions as to where he obtained them from—he said, "I hope there is nothing wrong in it; if I thought there had been anything wrong, I would have had nothing to do with it"—I asked if he would leave them till Money morning, as I had heard of the lot that had been sold to Mr. Petherham—(I am not certain whether I told him that)—he objected to that—I then asked him to leave them for an hour, as I had not got sufficient money to pay for them—he agreed, and I went to Mr. Gregory to ask about those sold to Mr. Petherham—Mr. Gregory rather strengthened my suspicion, and referred me to Mr. Bryan—he fancied them to be part of the same lot, and that they had been stolen—he advised me to pay box a sovereign—I paid him a sovereign as a deposit, and told him to bring the person who employed him to sell them, on Monday morning, and on Monday morning he brought Watts—I then said I wanted to know something more about the books, and asked Watts whose they were—he said they were partly his own, they had been given him by his cousin, one Charles Smith, who kept a beer-shop at Barnet—I asked how long they had been in his possession—he said about four month, that part of them had been given him by his cousin, and he was to choose them out of a larger lot—I asked him whose property they were previous to their coming into his cousin's possession—he said his cousin was in the habit of attending sales, and he purchased them at sales—he afterwards gave me his named and address, and the name and address of the person he worked for, Mr. Cain—I went with Mr. Lilly to Barnet, to inquire for this Charles Smith—we inquired all over Barnet, and found from the description which Mr. Lilly gave of Smith, that it resembled a person of the name of Charles Love, who had been there, but was gone from Barnet to Enfield.</p>

               <p>who called himself Charles Smith called upon me—(I described that person to the policeman)—he left seven or eight books with me, and said he would bring more—respectable person came with him, who I understand since was Watts' father—Smith said those were the kind of book, and he had some more in the country, which he would bring up if I liked—I told him he might bring them—in a few days he called with another person, and said he had brought the books up—that they were in a place in Lansdowne-mews—I went to that place to Watts'—they were in a room through the waiting-room—Smith said he brought them up that morning—I looked them over.

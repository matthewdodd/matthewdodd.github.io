            . I am a watchman I live in Osborne-street, Whitechapel, about eleven o'clock, I heard a call out of, stop him; I went directly after him, I saw the prisoner and another alongside of him running as hard as they could run; one ran down Winfield-street, and the other ran down Old Montague-street, and down Green Dragon-yard, and at the bottom of Green Dragon-yard, there is a door that is locked at eleven o'clock at night, the prisoner could not get through there I took him; when I took him I asked him what he had done with the man's watch; he said, I have not a watch.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am as innocent as a new-born child; I was coming down the street, I went down that court, there was no thoroughfare; the watchman catched hold of me, and the prosecutor said I was the man some yards before he came nigh to me.</p>

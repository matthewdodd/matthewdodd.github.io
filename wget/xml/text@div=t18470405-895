                  </hi> I am the daughter of William Dicken, who keeps a shop at Brentford-end. On the 15th March the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco—he gave me a shilling—I gave him the change, and he went away—I put the shilling into a little box in the till—there was no other shilling there—next day, the 16th, the police-sergeant came, and I gave him that shilling—I found it where I had placed it—I marked it.</p>

On the 15th March I heard an alarm about some bad money being passed—I went to the Six Bells public-house at Brentford, and found the prisoner—I commenced searching him—he put his hand into his left-hand pocked, and pulled out this shilling, which I produce—I caught his hand, and he dropped it by the side of him—I took it up, and took him to the station—he was there liberated, because we could not find any more upon him.</p>

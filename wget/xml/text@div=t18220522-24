On the 11th of May, I was in a public-house in James-street, Covent-garden; I had been drinking at another house and was rather intoxicated, but knew what I was about; it was between four and five o'clock in the morning - I had been up all night - a man insulted me very much, and the prisoner took my part: we had something to drink together there, because he took my part - I paid for it, I did not pull out my purse, as I had silver in my pocket - I went away and he followed me to every public-house I went to - I went to other public-houses, he insulted me because I would not give him any thing to drink - I went into the Compasses public-house, Drury-lane between eight and ten o'clock in the morning; he had been following me all that time - we had something to drink there; I treated him at every public-house, and between the parlour and the bar of the Compasses, he seized me by the waist with both his arms, and put his hand into my left hand breeches pocket - we had a great scuffle, I hollowed out Murder! as loud as I could, and held him as tight as I could - his collar tore, and he got away; the people in the house prevented my pursuing him. I was locked in by two men, and the landlord's daughter and another man. When I got up, I found my money was gone; as soon as he got the money out of my pocket he threw me down. I had eight sovereigns and a five pound note (besides silver and copper) which were in a purse - I had felt it safe a few minutes before. I saw the prisoner again on Thursday, the 16th; I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You say they locked you up at the Compasses; did they complain against you - A. They lodged a complaint against me at Marlborough-street, but they could not sustain their charge.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you recollect going into a coffee-shop in St. James's - A. No. There was a great crowd round, while he was fighting for me - I felt my money safe after that. I wanted to get rid of him, but he kept following me every where.</p>

            . I am a green grocer, and live in Great Wild-street. I saw Jones in the market about half past six o'clock; I did not know him before; he appeared very drunk - the prisoner and another person were with him. I saw them come out of the King's Head, public-house, I knew the prisoner before. Alsop and him came out fighting, which brought a crowd. Jones was holding the prisoner by the arm after the fight, and took him across James-street - they returned to the King's Head, and the landlord prevented their going in again - they went towards Long Acre; Jones was then holding the prisoner, he appeared desirous to stay with him; I saw no more. The prisoner was taken on the Thursday following, at the King's Head; he surrendered willingly.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in High Holborn. I saw Jones and the prisoner together between six and seven o'clock in the morning, at the Rose and Crown, public-house, St. Giles's, gambling; a third person in the company said, if Jones did not pay what he lost, he would beat him. The prisoner kept shoving towards the prosecutor, who had a handful of silver and half-pence; he shoved him, and some of the silver fell from his hand, which the prisoner snatched up; they were wrangling. I tried to get the prosecutor out of the house, he was very drunk - they all went out together. I went to a public-house with them in King-street, and did not stop there two minutes; the beadle came and desired the prisoner to go about his business, and let me see Jones home, but he followed us to the Three Compasses; he joined us in the street before we got there. My motive in going in was to get rid of the prisoner. Jones and him wished to go into the Compasses. At the Three Compasses I saw the prisoner attempting to take his purse, which he had pulled out at the Rose and Crown. I do not remember seeing it till after he was at the Rose and Crown. He kept shuffling and hustling about him. When Jones had money in his hand the prisoner caught at it; Jones had put his purse in his left hand breeches pocket - I went out to fetch an officer from the watch-house which is about two hundred yards off. I returned in five or ten minutes and found Jones only there, who said he had been robbed. I understood there had been some disturbance between him and the people of the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you had been out all night, drinking - A. Yes, I was sober. I saw the prisoner on the Monday following in a different dress, and did not know him till he came and asked if I had seen the prosecutor; I said no, for he had given me his direction No. 6, Basinghall-street, instead of Evans's court; he said if I would meet him at nine o'clock he would go to him with me; I waited till ten o'clock, but he never came.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper. I was fetched to the Three Compasses by a man who was in possession<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182205220010"></xptr>of the house, about a quarter past nine o'clock; I found Jones and Wilson there, the prisoner was not there; Jones was very much in liquor, and was given in my charge for assaulting the landlord's daughter - I kept him in the watch-house; he made a noise and screamed like a madman, more than any thing else, and was too drunk to go before a magistrate - he made no complaint during the whole day, but after leaving the office in the evening, he said he was robbed of eight sovereigns, and a 5 l. Bank-note, and he should know the man who took them. On the Monday between four and five o'clock, he came up again with Wilson who said he knew the man. On the Thursday following about six o'clock, Wilson took me to the King's Head, James-street, where I took the prisoner; he made no resistance.</p>

            . I am the beadle. About seven o'clock on Saturday morning, I saw Jones, the prisoner, and Wilson, going up King-street, Long-Acre, and in a few minutes Wilson came and said something to me. I went to the Fountain, public-house, King-street, and found them, and another man in company. I desired the prisoner to go about his business. Jones was very tipsy, and refused every assistance. I could not get him into a coach. I drove the prisoner from him, and thought he was gone safe away, he went towards home with Wilson.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He pulled me into the Compasses, and said I should not leave him, but that I should see him safe home.</p>

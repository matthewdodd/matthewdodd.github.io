               <p>Mr. Stagg that he should take off so much per week from his wages till he was paid; and afterwards Mr. Stagg said, (in confidence like, for I know him very well,) "I tell you, Mr. Moule, I was rather in an awkward situation with Jager"—I said, "How was that?"—he said, trade had been lately very bad, and Jager had not taken orders sufficient to pay his wages with, therefore he did not know what to do; if he kept him he did not want him, and if he sent him away, he would take every one of his customers away, for many customers he had called on would not give him an order, that would give Jager one; and therefore, to save himself, he must certainly transport him—I have no interest in this case, except to tell the truth—I have known the prisoner some years, and did business with him when he kept a shop in Holborn—I always thought him a very honourable young man.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a general shop in Griffin-street, Deptford. On 8th Oct., between 8 and 9 o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for a half-quartern loaf—he gave me a shilling—I thought it was good, gave him the change, and he went away—I put the shilling on a shelf by the window, apart from other money, and after the prisoner had gone I found it was bad—I am quite sure it was bad—I kept it a little time, and then burnt it—on 16th Oct. a woman came to the shop, called for something, and paid me with a bad shilling—I looked at it before giving her the change, and returned it to her—she went away—I watched her, and saw her join the prisoner at the bottom of the street—I followed them, and told the prisoner he had not been quite so fortunate as he had the week before—he said he did not know me or the shop—I am quite positive he is the same man.</p>

We have a customer named Forbes, at Ryegate—on the 20th of July Huggett came to the shop—I had not known him before—he said he came for Mr. Forbes's order—I went and told Mr. Ryder, and found there was no order—Huggett then gave me this order—I took it into the counting-house, and gave it to Mr. Ryder, who came and questioned him—he said he saw Mr. Forbes write the order—I was sent for a policeman—Huggett was taken, and Ellery, also who was waiting outside—(read)—"Mr. W. Forbes wishes Messrs Barras to send him by the bearer, who will wait, 6 best Woodville's, 3 Cuba's, 3 cheroots. Ryegate, July 20, 1839. To Messrs. Barras and Co., High-street, Bloomsbury."</p>

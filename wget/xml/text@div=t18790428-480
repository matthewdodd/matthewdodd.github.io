                  </hi>. I am a cooper, at 24, Young Street, Victoria Dock—on Saturday night, April 5th, between 11 and 12, while going home I was attacked in Wentworth Street, Spitalfields, by three or four young men—I had about 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the right-hand pocket, and other money in my vest pocket—I was caught up from behind, and when I tried to get clear I was caught up by the chin from behind, tripped up and thrown down—the money in my right-hand pocket was taken, that in my vest was not taken—after robbing me they ran away—I was not hurt much—I was not choked, only hurt a little in the arm—I was not quite sober, but knew what I was doing well enough—the prisoner was afterwards brought before me, but I could not recognise him, I was taken so suddenly from behind that I had no chance of seeing him—I had had two or three half pints of ale.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 57). I was on duty in Wentworth Street, Spitalfields, on the 5th April, about 12 p.m., and saw the prisoner and some other lads hustling the prosecutor—they knocked him down and rifled his pockets, and ran away—I got in a doorway about ten yards off, and as they ran towards me I jumped out and apprehended the prisoner, who was running away—he said, "What have you got me for? I am running after my pal"—I said "Come back here and I'll tell you"—I then asked the prosecutor if he had lost anything, and he said "Yes"—I said to the prisoner, "I shall take you to the police-station, and you will be charged with robbing the prosecutor"—when at the station he said, "I was running to a coffee-shop to get some food"—the prosecutor was drunk, but knew what he was about—he was charged by me with being drunk, and it was entered on the charge sheet—between the time I saw the prisoner ill-using the prosecutor and the time when I caught him I had not lost sight of him at all—he was one of the men, there were four of them, the prisoner was the one who knocked him down—I could not see whether he rifled his pockets—they all got up then, and left the prosecutor lying on the ground—the prisoner did not try to escape—when I took him back the prosecutor said he had been knocked down and robbed, but did not know who had done it, and could not swear to the prisoner—the prisoner denied the charge at the station.</p>

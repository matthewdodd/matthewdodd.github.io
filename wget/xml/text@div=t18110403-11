The prisoners came to my house on the 1st of March under pretence of giving me an order for a pair of shoes; I measured Sanders; Gill was with him.

            , and on some little recollection I found I had missed one pair out of three pair which had been hanging at the back of the shop. My son pursued the prisoners, and brought them back; the prisoner's were both searched, and nothing found on them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find the shoes - A. By the information of Gill himself. He said the shoes were to be found in Primrose-street, Mr. Fuller uhd them.</p>
               <p>MR. FULLER. I belong to the board of Ordnance. On the 1st of March I was in Mr. March's shop, Mr. Taylor came in and informed him that he had lost a pair of shoes; the prisoners were pursued and brought back. Gill said he had been drawn in by him; he did not say whom; it was his first offence, and the shoes were to be found in Primrose-street. I found the shoes. These are the shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Are they your property - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181104030007"></xptr>Shoes are so much like one another I cannot swear they are my property.</p>

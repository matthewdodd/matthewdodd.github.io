               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Goodall. No, I never saw her before, but am certain she was the woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get your watch again?</p>
               <p>Goodall. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you seen it last?</p>
               <p>Goodall. I had seen it a quarter of an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you say she took it.</p>
               <p>Goodall. She owned it before justice Cox, and said she had left it under a stair-hole amongst some dust. We went there to look for it, but could not find it. Here is my handkerchief that we found upon her at the searching of her, which I lost at the same time, that was taken out of my coat pocket; the watch was in my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take her up?</p>
               <p>Goodall. I took her up immediately, and when we searched her, the handkerchief was found in her bosom.</p>

               <p>I was searched directly. I never saw the man nor the watch.</p>

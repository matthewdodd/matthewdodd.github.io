On the 23d of April, about half past four o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop and requested to look at some black ribbons; the drawer was produced, and by her manner I rather suspected her. She then enquired for black figured ribbons; I told her I had no black figures - she was perhaps ten minutes at the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew her any thing besides the black ribbons - A. No. There were three pieces on the counter, she conveyed one piece to the edge of the counter, in her clothes; she endeavoured to hide that piece by the corner of her shawl; she then said none of them would answer her purpose, my answer was, very well; I put the drawer in its place, and she went out; I followed her to the door, and when the shawl was attempted to be thrown over the ribbon, I saw a white paper on the ribbon, and as she got off the step of the door I took hold of her arm, and said what have you done with the ribbon, she said she had got none: I brought her back into the shop, and at the same time the witness Turner gave me the ribbon, and said, sir, I believe this is your ribbon. She strongly denied that she ever meddled with the ribbon.

            . Q. Do you remember seeing the prisoner on the 23d of April last - A. Yes; I saw her come out of Mr. Smith's shop, I saw the prisoner drop this ribbon from her clothes. As Mr. Smith laid hold of her arm she had just got on the pavement, off the steps.</p>
               <p>Q. You went into the shop did not you - A. Yes; I heard the prisoner deny having the ribbon, I asked her how she could deny it when I saw her drop it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence, nor called any witnessess to her character.</p>

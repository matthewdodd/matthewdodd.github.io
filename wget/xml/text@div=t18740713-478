I am manager of the Old Rose public-house, St. George's Street—on the night of 12th June the prisoner and deceased were there drinking together with a third man—they were quarrelling—I told them to go outside, which they did—I stood at the door to keep them from coming in—I saw the deceased strike the prisoner two or three times and want to fight him; they were not violent blows—the prisoner said if he gave him one blow that would be enough for him, and he hit him one blow under the nose on the lip; he fell and caught his head against the side of the kerb—I went in and saw no more—they had been drinking, but were not drunk.</p>

I am a cheesemonger, of 58, St. George's Street—on 12th June, about 8.15, I was in the Old Rose, and saw the prisoner and deceased there and another man who the deceased wanted to quarrel with, in fact they were all quarrelling together—I went away and returned again a little after 9 o'clock—the prisoner and deceased were then outside the house quarrelling again—the other man had gone away—the deceased struck the prisoner three or four times, and wanted him to go in the road and fight—the prisoner eventually went into the road; it is a steep hill—they put up their arms to spar, and the prisoner hit the first blow, hit the the deceased under the nose, and knocked him down, his head struck against the kerb, and there he lay insensible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Bryant, who keeps the Weymouth Arms, Weymouth Street—on the 23rd March last the prisoner was in my husband's employment as a potman—I was desirous of purchasing a bedroom suite and consulted the prisoner about it—he, said he could get it at trade price at Basing and Green's—on the 23rd March I went with him to Messrs. Green's—I chose the set and came out and told the prisoner where it stood and gave him a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., note and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he went inside and came out saying the price was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that it was too much, and that he must go to Thames Street to ask his master, where he stated his master lived—he said he would be back in half an hour, and I never saw him again—I waited some little time.</p>

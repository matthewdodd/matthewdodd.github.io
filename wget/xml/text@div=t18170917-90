            . On the 9th of August the prisoner came to see me, and stopped with me until the 31st, as my master and mistress were out of town; she brought a bunch of keys with her, she used to carry them about with her - She said they belonged to some of her boxes in the country; on Monday the 25th, she said she had lost the keys; on the 26th she brought a band-box nearly full of her clothes, and the next morning she packed it up - She saw me looking at her-and said that dirty linen would not lay so close as clean, as she could not easily get all the things in; she took it away on the 31st, and left the house for good at ten o'clock the same night; in about a quarter of an hour after she was gone, I missed the property. I got an officer and went to her lodgings, we found one pair of my mistresses stockings there - We lost a great many more articles.</p>

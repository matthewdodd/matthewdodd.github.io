               <p>Q. On the evening of the 11th of October, did you see the prisoner at the bar - A. Yes, he came into our shop with a young man of the name of Jones, as I am told. When they came in, Jones, the other man, spoke; he said he wanted to see some fine broad lace, to him a dress for his sister. I shewed them a box of lace, the prisoner looked at it with him, and he spoke about it with him. We had four or five candles in the shop, there was a good light, it enabled me to see the prisoner and to observe the persons of the two men. While they were there, a gentleman came down stairs, I think, from recollection, a person came down stairs. Jones told me it was not precisely the lace that his sister wanted. The prisoner said, the the lady, or sister, had better come to the shop. Upon that they left the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they stay in the shop - A. Some minutes, I took no particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner said she had better come herself, and quitted she shop - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 14th, did the same men come again - A. Yes, about half past seven; I believe both the same persons came again on the 14th; before they came in, the door of the shop was shut, one of the prisoners opened it; it was shut upon a spring latch, they come in together as close us possible, and one of them opened it. I am quite positive the door was quite close, and the latch had fastened in the catch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is there any thing particular in that circumstance the latch is always shut, of an evening is it not - A. I am sure it was shut, I was standing at the end of the counter, about four or five yards from the door; they spoke to me when they came in; the other one said, I was so good as to shew them some lace the other morning. Jones said that I took down the box again; I knew them to be the same persons again. The box had some paper folded over the lace; upon my taking the lace out, the lace was folded on cards. I removed the paper with intention to expose the lace; two cards of lace laid on the top; I was taking the two cards of lace out when the other young man laid hold of the lace and run out of the shop. I cried stop thief immediately; Rice let him pass by him, and stood by him so as nothing could go after Jones without passing by him. My<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181501110037"></xptr>youngest sister got out of the shop first, immediately after him. I run out of the shop as quick as possible, and just as I turned my own door, some man laid hold of me; he said, where are you going, my dear? I returned immediately; my youngest sister had gone to make the pursuit.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon afterwards did you see the prisoner - A. In December I saw him again; this was on October the 14th. I saw him again on the 19th of December in Bow-street Office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him again - A. The moment he came in at the door; I am certain he is the person.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of this lace - A. One hundred pounds; I have seen three yard of it again at the pawnbroker's, it was brought to Guildhall; I saw it first at the pawnbroker's.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner one of the two - A. Yes, he was; I saw him look at the lace on the 11th of October. The young men came in and asked to look at some thread lace; I was then in the shop by myself. I rang the bell for my sister to come, she shewed the lace to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the prisoner is one of the said person - A. I am, I recollect him perfectly. When they came again on the 14th, my sister shewed the lace net to the prisoner; one of them put his hand into the box, and took out two handfuls of lace, and immediately ran out of the shop, I pursued the one that took the lace and lost sight of him; the prisoner followed him.</p>

             and Shenston. I lodge in a court in Clare Market, the name of of the court I cannot call to mind. We all four went out together from my lodgings; we had agreed before then where we should go to; it was to this house in Cannon-street. I had been there on the Tuesday before with the same party; nothing was done on the Tuesday. On the Thursday we agreed to go again, for the purpose of taking this lace. When we got there we waited, we all four looked at the shop, and looking in, and seeing three ladies, we thought that was too many to do business. We waited a quarter of an hour, we made the proposition to get one of the ladies to leave the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the means - A. We thought of taking a neighbour's name that the Miss Jacksons might be acquainted with. We observed the name of Wrigglesworth. Then Joseph Shenstone went into the shop, saying he came from Mrs. Wrigglesworth, she had got a friend come from the country, and wised to look at some laced caps, and begged the lady would step down immediately with a sample- Shenstone went in, and came out again to the door; we watched him in, and saw one of them go up stairs. Then James Jones and William Rice went into the shop, what they said I cannot tell. I saw one of the ladies, there was a strong light, and three or four candles in the window. I stood on the opposite side of the way, we saw one of the ladies pull down a box of lace, I walked about two yards from the door; as we turned our heads, we saw Jones come out of the shop with a hand full of lace. Rice followed, and a lady followed and cried stop thief. Then me and Shenstone followed towards St. Paul's Church-yard; we had agreed where to meet; we met in a sort of a Brood way, at the back of the Blue Last, and when me and Shenstone came there we met Rice and Jones, they said all was right; we went to a public house in a court in Drury-lane, nearly opposite the Pavillion, and sent for a person to buy the lace. The lace was not produced, they did not agree to the price. I saw the lace in Jones's hands, it was sold for eleven pound to the best of my knowledge, to a man in Fleet-lane, of the name of Green. We all four went to his house, and measured the lace; I believe the man lives there now; he has a lodging in the two pair, at a muffin shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Should you knew him again if you were to see him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. I believe you were not taken up? without being taken up you made a disclosure of this - A. Yes, and some other offences, without ever being taken in custody.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You never were taken in custody, were you - A. No, sir, no, not even charged, I never was in my life: I engaged in this business.</p>

               <p>Q. Other people were to thieve, and you were to share the profit, that was the case then - A. To be sure.</p>

               <p>Q. In what was that, stealing from some body else - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Come, out with it? Of which you were to share a part of the plunder, were not you - A. Only once.</p>

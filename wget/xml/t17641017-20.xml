I said, if you have a mind to come to work in the morning, do: I got up, and began to look for my pocket, and found it was gone: there was in the pocket thirty-four shillings; I went to his house, and asked him for it; and said, if he had spent a crown of it. I would past that by: then he swore he had been in bed with me two hours, and would not give me my apron, not any thing else. The constable would not take charge of him: I got a warrant and took him up two days after.</p>

               <p>Bulmore. Hearing of those wrangles, I enquired the woman's character in the neighbourhood, and was informed she has a very good one; this I heard no longer than yesterday; and I heard the prisoner say afterwards, that she never bought him any cloaths.</p>

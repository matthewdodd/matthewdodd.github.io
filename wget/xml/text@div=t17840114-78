               <p>Examined by Mr. Silvester.</p>
               <p>Did you go on the 9th of January to the Globe Tavern in Hatton Garden? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did you meet there? - I met a man.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon did you meet the prisoner himself? - In a quarter of an hour? the man said he would step out and see if his friend was come; he stepped out and introduced the prisoner at the bar to me; the prisoner sat down by the side of me, and he says to his friend, is this your friend; then we began to discourse; says he now I can depend upon you, I said yes, then he pulled out a guinea to shew me, which is this; I praised it exceedingly, I turned it over and said I never saw so good a one in my life, I said it was so good I thought I could vend a great many of them; I asked him the price, he told me it should be thirteen shillings; says I twelve shillings and sixpence will do I suppose; why, says he, if you take a quantity and are likely to be a better customer, I will not stand; accordingly I had the guinea in my hand, and I kept it in my possession till he stept to the door to send for the rest; when he came in, he said have you any call for any whites; says I you may let me look at them; says I they are very good indeed, I think I can be a customer for some of them; says he they are nine and twenty for a guinea; he asked me if I wanted any half bulls, that is half-crowns, then a gentleman came in and interrupted our discourse; my friend said, says he, you will be late out of town, says I, damn it, we never mind, we travel all hours, only give us a bottle; he then said he could not get them that night, and just at that time Mr. Clarke came up, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>The guinea and the shilling produced.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetwood Prisoner's Council. You never saw this prisoner before? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was any body in company with you? - The man that introduced me.</p>
               <p>Where is he? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Is he a friend of the man's or of your's? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>But you know that person? - I know him by sight if I was to see him.</p>
               <p>Do not you know him otherwise? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, have not you seen him since? - Not to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Have not you seen him so as to speak if you chose it? - Not to have any connection with him.</p>

               <p>I am employed for the mint, and have been for many years; I had information of the prisoner; I got a captain of our patrol to act as a deception, not to be known, I desired him to act as a smuggler that he might not be known, and I gave him two twenty pounds notes, and desired him to go to the Globe Tavern, and when the money was brought he was to send one of the notes to be changed, and when that note was sent out to be changed I then know that the money was there; I received a message, that he was come they believed, and I took Gilbert in custody and searched him, and I found seventeen shillings and I think ten or twelve sixpences all counterfeits. (The guinea shewn him.) I suppose that is not worth above three-pence or a groat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Twelve shillings and six-pence is a pretty good price for it? - Yes, very good.</p>

From the time the prisoner stopt me, till we parted, took up five minutes; I was much frightened; it was day-light; I am positive as to his person; I looked at him very often as we were walking together: directly I saw him at Bow-street; I was very positive as to the person; the constable of Brentford produced the watch. He stopt me about two hundred yards from Gunnersbury-house.</p>

               <p>I live at Twickenham; on the thirteenth of February, I saw the prisoner between the turnpike and Isleworth-town; between six and seven in the evening; it was on the foot-path, about a hundred yards beyond the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Court. Then in consequence of something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178902250029"></xptr>that passed between him and you, you apprehended him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon? - Directly; he went towards the turnpike, and I followed him; I called out, stop him! and he was stopped just before I got to him; just as he got through the turnpike, he was taken by two or three gardening men; it was before seven; then they took him to Mr. Wheler's, and from thence he was taken to the Round-house; I saw a canvas bag, sixteen bullets, and a mould, taken out of his pocket, and a pistol; that is all I know.</p>
               <p>Field. I took the pistol out of his pocket myself (produced); this is the pistol I took out of his pocket; it was not loaded; it appeared to have been lately let off. I saw Shallard take the key out of his pocket, after I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Shallard. The key fits the pistol.</p>

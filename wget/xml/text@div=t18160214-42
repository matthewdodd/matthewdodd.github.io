            . I lost all this property on the 18th January. I lost it at about a quarter before eleven at night. I was coming from the West end of the town, and coming along Newgate-street, I stopped at the corner of St. Martin's le Grand for a few minutes. During the period I was stopping there, this

I did not go into any house there. She took my watch out of my pocket, and ran off directly. I followed her, and I lost sight of her going round the corner. I can't say she took my money. I saw no more of her. I had that money when I came past St. Sepulchre's church. I did not speak to any one but the prisoner. I never found my notes again. They had been in my small clothes pocket. There is a great intricacy about the courts there. I am sure she is the woman. She was taken up the second day after.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. I am twentynine years old. It was not a frequent practice for me to carry so much money about me. I am a <rs id="t18160214-42-viclabel245" type="occupation">labourer</rs>

               <p>Q. When you felt her draw the watch out, as you say, why did you not seize her before she went from you - A. I had not power to lay hold of her. I was about five minutes with her. I did not tell the watchman I missed my notes. I then went straight home, for fear I should lose my situation. I had received these notes from my sister to purchase Stock for her. She sent them on the 17th, and I lost them on the 18th. Nobody in London knew of my possession of them. I had been up to see a person of the name of Kinzey, in New Bond-street; but he did not live there; and coming back, I stopped in my way in Brook-street, Holborn, at the Three Tuns. I had a pint of porter to drink, and I was perfectly sober when I came out.</p>

            . I am an officer of the city. In consequence of an application from Dunn, the prosecutor; I and Turnpenny went after the prisoner. The prosecutor gave as a description of her, and then we knew we had frequently seen her about St. Martin's Le Grand. We went in search of her, and found she lived in Willow-court, Willow-street, Curtain-road. We found her in bed; this was on the 20th of January, at eleven o'clock in the morning. I informed her of the charge that was against her. She denied all knowledge of it. We searched the premises, and found as many as sixty duplicates; some for watches, but none of them of the prosecutor's. Her husband was not at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Adolphus. The prosecutor said he had seen another woman, and we apprehended her; but she said she had seen nothing of the transaction.</p>

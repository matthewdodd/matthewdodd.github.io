I rode about five or six hundred yards after he had passed me; as I was riding down a hill I drew up my horse, then the prisoner rid across me, caught hold of the horse's bridle, presented a large pistol to me, and demanded my money; I said he should have what I had; he said be quick; I gave him nine shilling and four-pennyworth of half-pence; he said I had got more, I said I had not: during this conversation I had an opportunity of observing the prisoner's countenance. I observed he had a little cast in one of his eyes; he said I had more money; I told him I had no arms about me, and he might search me if he chose it. I asked him for some money to pay the turnpike, he refused to give me any. He rode off towards Barnet, and I came forward for London. I stopt at the next public house, and wrote down a description of the man and horse, and sent it to Sir

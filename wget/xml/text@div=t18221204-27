She asked me for some gin, I said I had no money to part with; she kept following me, and asked for a few halfpence - I gave her 2 d. or 3 d.; she then came close to me - I found I had lost two sovereigns and a penknife. I stopped and accused her of it - she had kept pushing up close to me till I missed the money - nobody else came near me. I had it safe when she first came up, for I had my hand in my pocket at the time. I had her taken to the watch-house - my pen-knife was found on her but no money. I was sober, I had been paying my men at Pimlico, and was going home. I had come with another man who was going into Regent-street.</p>

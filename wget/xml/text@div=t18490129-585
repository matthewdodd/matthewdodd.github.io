                  </hi>. I live at Dockhead—the prisoner was a customer of mine. On 20th July, 1846, he brought me this Bill of Exchange for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;—. he wanted me to cash it—I gave him cash and goods for it—I paid away the bill, it was returned, dishonoured—I went to the prisoner and told him—he gave me 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and afterwards 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he would make up the remainder as soon as he could—he said I had no occasion to apply to Mr. Nokes, the acceptor—I afterwards applied to the prisoner for the rest.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Green Man, at Plumstead. The prisoner is my son-in-law—the acceptance to this bill is not mine—I do not know whose writing it is—I did not know anything about it till it became due, which I believe was in 1846—I then told the parties I should have nothing to do with it—I gave no one authority to write my name to it.</p>

Q.</hi> You do not write so well as this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not now—I cannot say whose writing it is—I believe it to be the prisoner's—he married my daughter eight or nine years ago—he never asked me to give him a bill, or spoke to me on the subject—he has not signed my name for me—I have not asked him to sign it—I do not know that he signed my name at my re<lb></lb>quest to a petition to the Clothworkers' Company: he got me their address—I have not been told that if I said I authorized him to sign this bill for me I should be liable for the amount of it—I do not think I am liable—he had a few things of me, and has pawned or made away with them—I do not re<lb></lb>member calling on him about the time this bill purports to be drawn, that he was in great distress, or that I said, "I had only got a few shillings about me"—my memory is not very bad—I never signed the bill—the prisoner did not ask me to let him draw a bill on me, and say he would get it discounted, and be sure to pay it—his wife did not say to me, "Father, John has got the bill discounted"—I do not know that he knows my writing—I should think he does—we have had very little connection.</p>

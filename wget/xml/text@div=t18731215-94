               <p>Frederick Leigh, the prisoner's brother, made a commuuication to me, and I went with him towards a house hi Cold Harbour Lane, and met the prisoner coming from the house—I advised him to go home and not go to his father's house to make a disturbance—he said he had been at work all the week and received no money—I told him again to go back and to allow his wife to go back, and no doubt his father would pay them both—I said that I should go and see that there was no further disturbance, and if there was he must put up with the consequences—soon after, Frederick was standing in the yard and the prisoner on the footpath—the prisoner rushed to Frederick, struok him on the chest, and knocked him down, his head came in contact with the kerb, and he became insensible—I took the prisoner to the station, and then went back and took the deceased to the station, where Dr. Jones ordered his removal to the hospital—the prisoner said "I did not strike violently; he has been drinking all the afternoon, and if he had not he would not have received so severe an injury"—Frederick died next day just before 1 o'clock—I then charged the prisoner with causing his brother's death—he said "I am very sorry, it was his own fault; if I had had ray money it would not have happened. I was excluded from the house, me and my wife, and my father, and my two brothers, my brother knocked my hat off, and I hit him, he had his arm up at the time, and I hit him, but the blow was not enough to knock him down had he been sober"—the deceased seemed quite sober when I first saw him, which was ten or fifteen minutes before.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw the deceased's hat fall off just as the prisoner knocked him down—I saw the deceased try to step on the pavement—he tried to avoid the prisoner—he was about the centre of the road when the prisoner went up to him and went towards the kerb to get away from him—the deceased was 5 ft. 5 in. or 6 in. high—he was taller than the prisoner—his age was twenty-two—the father is a most respectable man—the deceased was stouter and more powerful than the prisoner—from the time the deceased came to me first to the time he was knocked down twenty minutes elapsed—I went with the deceased towards the house and met the prisoner—I stopped and talked to him, and he went with me to the cab rank—I went on 10 or 12 yards, and the prisoner was talking to his wife on the foot path—the deceased was 10 or 15 yards from me when the prisoner met him—the prisoner struck him and I am sure be hit him, but I am not sure whether it was on the chest or not—this occurred in an instant of time—I do not think the deceased had been drinking; if he had, it was very slightly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 425, Brixton Road—on this Saturday evening, at 7.30, the deceased was brought to my house insensible and suffering from compression of the brain—I examined him carefully, but could not find any evidence of fracture of the skull—there was a wound on the back of his head such as would be caused by falling against a kerb stone—I smelt his breath, and he certainly had been drinking, but I cannot tell you to what extent—I ordered his removal to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—I examined the deceased and found him suffering from concussion, and a lacerated wound of the scalp—he died next day from compression of the brain—it was such an injury as would result from his being knocked down and striking his head on the kerb.</p>

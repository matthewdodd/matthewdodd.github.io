                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Sidney Young and Charles Magnay—I carry on with them the business of ship builders, and have done so for forty years. In the early part of this year we had, I suppose, about 300 or 400 men in our employment—we had regular times of work, and for going off work—in the summer time the men commenced work at 6 o'clock, and worked from 6 till 8, then from half-past 8 till 11, from 20 minutes past 11 till 1, from 2 to 4, and from half-past 4 to 6 o'clock, making altogether nine hours and forty minutes—having had considerable expe<lb></lb>rience in these matters, I found that those intervals were of the greatest possible inconvenience, and productive of the greatest possible evils, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150060"></xptr>
               <p>the subject of universal complaint on the part of all—practically we found it so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In consequence of that, did you issue a notice, altering the times, the effect of which would be, to give ten minutes more to the men in reality, but to prevent those constant intervals of cessation from labour? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I sanctioned the issue of that notice by my partners—this is the notice—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To the workmen employed in this dockyard. We have long been sensible of the great evils resulting from the unnecessarily frequent inter<lb></lb>ruptions of work, under the existing division of the hours of labour. While it is a source of continual dissatisfaction and complaint on the part of the shipowners, it is certain that the greatest real injury falls on the workmen themselves, most of whom are employed by the job, and any waste of time is consequently a deduction from the Amount of their earnings. This waste does not result from too many hours being devoted to rest and refreshment, but from the too frequent cessations from work, which causes indirectly but inevitably a serious loss of time, without conferring any benefit whatever on the workman. And finding that the system does not prevail in any port in Great Britain, except that of London, and that even there it is exclusively confined to the private dockyards on the river Thames, and cannot therefore be alleged to be necessary for health or comfort, we hereby give notice, that from and after the 3rd of May next, the hours of work, which are at present in this establishment, from 6 o'clock to 8, 2 hours; from half past 8 to 11, 2 hours 30 minutes; from 20 minutes past 11 to 1,1 hour 40 minutes; from 2 to 4, 2 hours; from half past 4 to 6, 1 hour 30 minutes; in all, 9 hours and 40 minutes; will be regulated as follows: Commence work, 6 o'clock; breakfast, 9 to 10; allowance, none; dinner, 1 to 2; tea, none; leave work, half past 5; total, 9 1/2 hours: and from 2nd Nov. to 2nd Feb., commence work, daylight; breakfast, 9 to 9 3/4; allowance, none; dinner 1 to 13/4; tea, none; leave work, dark. The workmen will perceive that by this alteration no addition is made to the number of working hours per day, which will in future be shortened by ten minutes, and is less than at any port included in the statement below, while the extension of breakfast time to one hour will enable very many who reside at a distance from the premises to enjoy that meal at their homes, instead of being compelled to resort to the public house. They will also, we doubt not, duly estimate the great advantage of leaving work at an earlier hour, by which their oppor<lb></lb>tunities for improvement, comfort, and recreation will be greatly extended; and on the whole we trust their good sense will prove to them, that the change we thus announce, while promoting that order and regularity which employers and employed in every establishment ought equally to desire, is calculated in an especial manner to advance the interests, physical and moral, of the working classes, whose social improvement we are ever anxiously desirous to promote. The bell will be rung five minutes before, and the gates be closed punctually at the above times, and the gatekeeper has strict orders not to admit any workman except at the above hours of admission. Young, Son, and Magnay, Limehouse Dockyard, April, 1856."—<hi rend="italic">To this was appended a statement of the hours of work at fourteen out-ports, showing that at none were the hours of work less than ten hours, that at none was there any morning allowance, and, with two exceptions, none in the afternoon</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>). We issued a second address, dated 13th May—this is it: ("Limehouse Dockyard, May 13th, 1856. We have intimated to our workmen that on and after 17th instant we purpose to amend the division of the hours of labour in this establishment, so as to assimilate it in principle with that maintained in every important outport of the country; at the same time that it reduces in a slight degree the period actually devoted to labour by the existing practice. We very deeply regret to find that a measure which we conscientiously believe is calculated equally to benefit our workmen as ourselves, has met with what appears to us the most unreasonable opposition from the shipwrights of this port. The mea<lb></lb>sure is briefly to be described as the substitution of two intervals of one hour each, and cessation from work half an hour earlier than heretofore, in place of four intervals, one of one hour, two of half an hour, and one of twenty minutes; a system which has acted prejudicially against the general interests of our trade, is fraught with the most pernicious effects to many of the workmen, and must be more or less detrimental to all of them. This sub<lb></lb>stitution is founded on the practice pursued at Aberdeen, Dundee, Leith, Sunderland, Newport, Liverpool, White haven, Greenock, and also at North-fleet; in every one of which the actual time for work exceeds from half an hour to an hour, that which we propose it should be here. We have offered to refer the decision of the desirableness of this change to the arbitration of any impartial person or persons on whose judgment the shipwrights and our<lb></lb>selves can mutually rely; and so anxious are we, frankly and fairly to test the question, that we now, moreover, thus publicly intimate our readiness to submit the case to such a tribunal, even though the shipwrights decline to commit themselves to abide by it's issue. We hereby give notice, that we are prepared to enter into an engagement, guaranteeing employment to shipwrights, for twelve months from the date hereof, on terms either by the job or the day, equal to the highest rate paid in the other established dock-yards on the river; and that the hours of work shall be regulated entirely in accordance with their wishes, based on the principle of not exceeding the time, at present actually expended on work, of not exceeding two intervals during such period, and of leaving work not later than at half past 5 o'clock, and on Saturdays at 4 o'clock. Young, Son, and Magnay.") Then came this address, of 15th May, signed by Frederick. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To the ship-wrights of the port of London. Shipwrights and brother workmen—Your privileges have been unfairly interfered with by Messrs. Young, Son, and Magnay, of Limehouse, who have altered your hours of labour. It was resolved at a special general meeting, held at the Edinburgh Castle, Step<lb></lb>ney, on the 16th of May, 1856, 'That the alteration in the hours of labour, proposed by the above firm, was a violation of your rights; and the meeting pledged itself to resist it by every legal means in their power until the obnoxious notice given by the above firm was withdrawn.' We beg, there<lb></lb>fore, most distinctly to inform every shipwright, that the dispute has not originated with the men. We make no new demand; but when on a sudden a notice is issued to the effect that it is the intention of Messrs. Young and Co., to deprive us of certain regulations or privileges which we have been, in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150062"></xptr>
               <p>quiet possession of from time immemorial; regulations which custom and time have legalized, and the tacit agreement of the firm had ratified, we think it very just and proper to bring the matter forward for your serious attention. We have made no new demands: had we done so, in consequence of non-concession, then we might have been deemed unreasonable in our conduct. Augustus H. Frederick, president. Thomas Marr, secretary, May 15th, 1856.") In reply to that we issued the following address, (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To the general body of shipwrights, now in the port of London. A placard has been circulated, signed, 'Augustus H. Frederick, president; Thomas Marr, secretary:' in which we are accused of having unfairly inter<lb></lb>fered with your privileges, and violated your rights. We shall not stop to inquire, whether you have authorised these individuals to speak in your name; but we denounce the charge as untrue and calumnious. If 'customs and habits' had been confounded with 'rights and privileges,' rotten boroughs would have still existed, and reform in every department, political and social, would have been impossible. We have simply to reply, that we con<lb></lb>sider the pretended rights, to which the placard refers, as real wrongs to the workmen; and the supposed privileges as real curses. It is this conviction that has induced us to propose a change, which has unexpectedly called down on us the unscrupulous denunciations and violent opposition of pre<lb></lb>sident and a secretary of——what? We appeal from this tyrannical decree to your individual judgment; we propose actually to diminish your period of daily labour, and so to regulate it's intervals as to accord with the practice I of the country at large; and thus promote your interests, your comfort, and respectability. Let every man examine for himself, and determine by calm consideration of our published propositions (which may be obtained on appli<lb></lb>cation), whether our description of these propositions, or that of our calum<lb></lb>niators is the true one. But this we are quite ready to discuss; and to revise, modify, or withdraw them if proved to be injurious or unjust to you; and we have already offered to submit the whole question to impartial arbi<lb></lb>tration. We ask you whether, in offering such a course, we manifest any disposition unfairly to interfere with your rights and privileges?' When<lb></lb>ever or by whomsoever these are assailed, it will always be our pride and our pleasure to make common cause with you in their defence. But we can<lb></lb>not tamely submit to the cruel proscription to which it is attempted to subject us; and we appeal with confidence from this injustice and wrong, to your fairness and independence. We throw ourselves on that public opinion, which will finally decide justly. Young, Son, and Magnay, Lime-house Dockyard, May 17th, 1856.") Then followed this other address, signed by Frederick. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To the whole of the shipwrights of the port of London. Shipwrights and brother workmen,—We are extremely sorry to be under the necessity of making a second appeal to your good sense. Your president and secretary have been assailed by Messrs. Young, Son, and Magnay, as being calumniators. That we most emphatically deny, and throw it back from whence it came. The special general meet<lb></lb>ing at the Edinburgh Castle, Stepney, tells those individuals they were authorized to speak in the name of the whole body of shipwrights in the port of London. We still maintain your privileges have been inter<lb></lb>fered with unjustly. We have nothing to do with rotten boroughs. We shall not stop to inquire into that matter. Our cause is too sacred, or it would not have lasted for the last century and more; therefore, that proves to us it is right, and not wrongs and real curses, as denounced by Messrs. Young, Son, and Magnay. They also say, 'The violent opposition</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150063"></xptr>
               <p>of a president and secretary of what?' They knew of what when they wanted the society's assistance. Why was not this tyrannical question resorted to half a century ago, or so late as three months? No, became then your services were required for your country.

Let every shipwright judge for himself in the matter now before him, and use his own discretion. Augustus H. Frederick, president. Thomas Marr, secretary.")—The 3rd May was the period originally fixed for the alteration to come into operation—we found that there was an unexpected opposition raised to it, and we also found that by 3rd May many of the men who were opposed to it, and who were engaged upon jobs, would not have completed them by that time, and we thought it more prudent to postpone its coming into operation until after that work was completed, which we did, first to the 8th, and subsequently, I think, to the 17th—several of the men were under contracts at that time—the result, however, was that they left their work unfinished, and all of the men left the yard on 3rd May, leaving the contracts incomplete—in consequence of that, we endeavoured at last to obtain labour elsewhere, but not till after a considerable interval, during which we hoped they would be inclined to come to reason; but they did not—there is a public house called the Union near our premises, overlooking our yard—there is a room at that public house that commands our yard, and that room was occupied from soon after 3rd May—during my continual attendance at the premises I constantly observed shipwrights, very many of whom I knew personally, seated at the window of this large committee room, and congregated around the door of the house, and opposite the gates of our establishment, in considerable numbers—I noticed some of the defendants, Gale, Mumford, Reeves, Edward Hopper, and Brown very constantly, very frequently Frederick, and John Hopper; I should not like to speak positively to any others—they were generally seated at the window, smoking pipes, or in consultation apparently, in con<lb></lb>versation at all events with each other, and with the persons who were assembled around the premises—the persons in the committee room appeared frequently to be in communication with the people round our gates—this continued, I should think, more than a month before we took any steps for obtaining workmen elsewhere; during that time our work was at a complete stand still, to our great inconvenience—at the end of a month we endea<lb></lb>voured to get other men; we sent to Gloucester, Ireland, and other places, and advertised in the public newspapers, offering twelve months' employment, at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, to those who were inclined to come into our employment-some persons came up; I think the first who came were from Gloucester; I do not recollect that I saw them—I saw a great many of the men who came up from the country—I saw the whole of the first number of the Jersey men—I met them myself at the South Western station—I think that must have been on 24th July—before that I had some conversation with Edward Hopper; I cannot give you the date of that; it must have been in the course of the month of June—I found him at the counting house—I said to him, "Hopper, I am a little surprised at the active part you are taking in this business, because, although the obligation that I know you are person<lb></lb>ally are under to my firm does not claim from you any gratitude, or ought not to induce you to go to work for us on terms that you yourself are not satisfied with, I think it is not becoming in you to take so active a part as you are doing in preventing other persons who are willing to come into our employ, from doing so"—his reply was, "I am not interfering, Sir"—I said,</p>

Young—I did not know him in the neighbourhood before that time—I did not know anything of Reeves before that time—I saw Reeves very often at the public house—I recollect the Jersey men coming, there was an additional crowd collected in consequence of that—on 26th July they commenced work, and went out at the usual time, half past 8 o'clock—a great number of persons collected on that day, particularly at dinner time, when the men left the yard to go to dinner—I saw a great number of the men at the window that day—Brown was there; he was outside the yard, about the streets, in the neighbourhood where the people had collected, in the crowd—I saw Edward Hopper; he was there the first part of the morning, at breakfast time, when the men went out—to the best of my knowledge, Reeves was there and Young—I cannot say that anybody else was there, because there was such a crowd—I saw them mingling with the parties that were outside—I do not know how long they were there—I left them, and went home from about half</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 313). I was at Messrs. Young's on 26th July—I agree that there was a large crowd, making a great deal of noise—I took hold of Brown, asked him if he wanted to kill the men, and told him I should know his face again; that was all I said—he made no reply that I know of, but there was a great bustle—I saw him strike several times.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk, in the employment of Young and Magnay. I remember the strike of these men in May, and seeking for other hands elsewhere—about the end of May I was sent to Paddington station, to meet some shipwrights who were coming up from Gloucester—I got to the station about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes before the train came in—it was after 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and not so late as 8—when I got on the platform I met Gale and Mumford together; they entered into conversation with me—Mumford asked me how many men I expected up from the country; I do not remember whether he said from where—I said, "I do not rightly know how many it is"—he said that be understood there were as many as twelve to come; I said that I did not understand that there were as many as that—he said that he had a letter from Gloucester to say that some hands were coming, but they were the worst hands in Gloucester—he said, "There are some expected from Wales are there not?—I said, "I do not know"—he asked me what Mr. Cousins</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150069"></xptr>
               <p>was doing—I said, "I do not know"—Cousins is a draughtsman, I suppose; and he was supposed to be at Gloucester—when I said that I did not know how many were coming from Wales, he said that he understood there were two to come from Wales; I said that I had not heard of any coming Wales, but not being in Mr. Young's confidence, I was not aware whether such was the case or not, but he appeared to know more about it than I did—he said, "Oh, bless you! we know all about it when anybody is coming to town"—this was before the train arrived, and when it arrived we went up in company together, to see whether there were any that looked like shipwrights—we walked up and down, and could not see any that looked like shipwrights, and Mumford said, "I do not see any that look like shipwrights," but when they were getting the luggage out, some two or three men stepped out, and conversed with one that was there, I do not know whether it was Gale or Mumford—I went up, and they left the one they were talking to, and came to me—I told them where I came from, and that I came to see after their luggage—they looked after their luggage afterwards, and I put it in a place of safety, and got a lodging for them, to prevent bringing them to Limehouse that evening—a railway officer took us under an underground passage, and left Gale and Mumford walking a little distance from us—just before I left I looked back, and saw them, but lost sight of them, and we went into a coffee house, and engaged lodgings—the men said that they should like a little refreshment, and we went into a public house—Gale and Mumford were there, and conversed with the men across the table; they said that they were out on strike, and the cause of it was that their rights and privileges were being unjustly interfered with; that Mr. Young was as good an employer as any one on the river, and that it was merely a difference of opinion in the right of beer time, but it was a right and privilege, and they could not consent to give it up—the Glouces<lb></lb>ter men looked at me, as if waiting a reply—I said, "What these men have told you is true, except that it is not a right; it is merely an old custom which exists in the port of London, but not on the river Thames, not even at Northfleet"—Gale and Mumford said that it was the unanimous opinion of a meeting of 2,000 shipwrights—I said, "It was not unanimous, for I know a man who approves of the new terms;" and they did not say any more on that subject—they entered into a little desultory conversation; and when the men were going away, Gale, Mumford, and myself stopped, and had a little something at the bar, and Mumford went into the parlour again, and said to the men something in an undertone, which I did not hear—Gale followed; he seemed speaking; and we came out again—before we came out they insisted on sending some more refreshment to the men in the parlour, at their expense; that was done, and then we left, and came down to Limehouse together, leaving the men behind; they came in an omnibus to the railway—when we got to Limehouse, I was going home, and we bade each other good night, and they said, "We must go to the Union public house, to see our mates; they are there waiting for us"—I had left instructions overnight for the men to come to Limehouse, but in the morning I went to stop them, to keep them in town all day, and not to come down till the evening—Mr. Young had given instructions for that—when I got out of the station in Fenchurch-street, I met Gale and Mumford, who said that my men were waiting for me at the Great Western station at Paddington—they were coming from the City way from Fenchurch-street to the station, and I had got out at Fenchurch-street station, and was going to the west end—I went towards Oxford-street, and met an omnibus, with three or four</p>

               <p>Gloucester men on it—I got off my omnibus, stopped the omnibus, and get them to get down, and go the Paddington station; I think two were left behind—lodgings were provided for them at Limehouse, and I told them would leave a man for them to go about where they pleased, and at night they would find their lodgings at that house, Mr. Ray's—on Saturday morning I went to the lodgings to see the men, and found them not in the house, but a few doors off there was <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was standing, and some of them were in it, and the others were standing by another one—in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, with three of the Gloucester men, Edward Layton Hopper was seated—I walked up rather sharply, and I think Henry Hopper gave him a signal, and he opened the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> door, stepped out, and shut it—Edward Layton Hopper wanted the other men to get into the second <hi rend="italic">cab;</hi> one said, "I will not get in unless some one else <hi rend="italic">gets</hi> in," and Edward Layton Hopper said, "it is all right, I will go with you;" they got in—Edward Layton Hopper did not get in, but followed round the corner on foot—I did not follow to see if there was any further communication with them—I went back again to the yard, and in the afternoon went up to the Great Western Railway to get whether the Gloucester men had really started—they did not come till after I got there—I went to the carriage after they ware seated, looked in at the window, and had some conversation with them—they went back to Glou<lb></lb>cester; they never came to work at all—some men were engaged to come from Jersey, by way of Southampton, and I went to Southampton to meet them.</p>

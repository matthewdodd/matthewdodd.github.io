The prisoner was in his service in 1837 as housemaid—he had a residence in Wales then—she was in his service for two years, and left it—I engaged her a second time on the 1st of May this year, and she was discharged on the 17th of June—I had the misfortune to lose a £5 note—before the pri<lb></lb>soner</p>

               <p>Q. I believe you have had your horses for some time from Mr. Gullan, a job master. - A. For more than five years.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it was agreed upon that you were to find the coachman with board wages, and a livery. - A. It was; in the beginning of last year the prisoner was hired by Mr. Gullan, to drive my chariot, and I found a complete <rs id="t18060416-71-deflabel425" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

               <p>Q. On what day did you discharge him. - A. On the 2d of November I sent him and the horses back to Mr. Gullan; I gave him his board wages at the same time, and paid him all that was due.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he and his wife sleep in a room over the coach house. - A. They did, he came on the Monday and said he was going into the country to look for work, and begged that I would let his wife remain in the room over the stable till he got a place, I gave permission; I told him to bring me back the livery, and to clear the stable of every thing that belonged to Mr. Gullan, and to let me have the key; when I ordered him to bring back the livery his answer was certainly, so, the clothes are not mine, and I should not think of keeping your property; he disappeared from the stable that day, and I could never hear of him till the beginning of this month, I then caused him to be apprehended; he acknowledged before the magistrate that he had sold them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. This man was hired and sent to you by the man whom you hired the horses of. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He lives over Westminster Bridge, the agreement was that you was to pay the coachman so much a-week. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had only a pair of horses when he came, the third horse came the second day after the man came. - A. I did not agree with the prisoner at all, the master was answerable for the third horse, I paid Mr. Gullan for the horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there not some difference between you and the prisoner about the third horse. - A. The man had asked me to give him something more, which I had refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you promised him to give him the livery for the trouble. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you dismissed him he had the livery on him. - A. He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give him permission to wear them clothes till he got other clothes. - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When first I was sent by Mr. Gullan to Mr. Sheldrake, he questioned me where I lived, I told him at Mr. Oliver's at Bath, whom I had lived with fifteen months, and if he did not approve of that, I would let him have a character of nine years I lived servant with Mr. Rutt; in consequence of that Mr. Sheldrake said I shall give you twelve shillings a week, I said I was very well satisfied with that, and Mr. Gullan's wages; I asked him respecting the clothes, he said he should try me with regard to what a coachman I was; in about a fortnight or three weeks I said to him it is time I should have my clothes, he told me to go to his tailor's, I in consequence went, and was measured for them, in a short time after, I was informed by my fellow servents that the clothes were not to be made; he said coachman, have you offended your master, I said I did not know, I went to the tailor and asked him the reason why my clothes were stopped, he told me it was the master's order; I went to my master and asked him if I had affronted him, he ordered me to go to the tailor again, to get my clothes as soon as I could, the clothes were brought home, at this time; Mr. Sheldrake gave me a guinea out of the chariot window, and on the day he ordered these horses home to Mr. Gullan he gave me my wages, I took the horses to Mr. Gullan, I asked him who was to pay me for looking after the odd horse, Mr. Gullan said I have only to pay you for the two; I went to Mr. Sheldrake on the Monday, I asked him, he looked at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160069"></xptr>me very hard in the face, and said that he had nothing to do with it, and I told him I should summons him about wearing my own clothes so long, he said what do you bother me about clothes, have not I given you clothes; I asked him to let my wife remain over the stable till she got well; I got a place to drive a stage for Mr. Nash, for one guinea per week; he ordered my wife out of the stable, although she was in a poor condition, with two scalded legs; as I was driving the Woolwich stage, I stopped at Mr. Gullan's door, I told him that I had got Mr. Sheldrake's clothes, and if he would satisfy me for taking care of the third horse, I would return them; I kept the clothes seven months in the whole, and he never troubled me; Mr. Gullan told him where I was to be found, which was the occasion of my being dragged away from my family.</p>

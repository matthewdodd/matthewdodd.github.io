                  </hi>. I am an engineer at 25, Rutland Street, Pimlico—on Thursday night, 23rd October, about 12 o'clock, I was in the Pimlico Road, near Chelsea Barracks, going home—when the prisoner called out to me "Halloa! old fellow, are you getting home?"—I said "Yes"—he said "You are Scotch?"—I said "Yes"—he then said he belonged to Edin<lb></lb>burgh, or had been there some time, and we had a conversation about Edinburgh—then he said "Will you give me a glass of beer?"—I took him into a public-house opposite and gave him some ale, and I had some lemonade—we went farther along the street, talking the whole time about Chelsea Barracks and Edinburgh and Scotland—he then said "It's time 1 was going"—I put my hand to see the time, and found my chain hanging to my waistcoat—I said "You have got my watch"—he said "I have not got your watch"—I said "Yes you have"—he swore he had not, and I got excited and said "I would rather lose anything than my watch. Give me my watch, I know you have got it, and I will give you all the money I have got"—I had only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said "I have not got it"—my father bought me the watch, and I valued it a great deal—I then took hold of him by the coat and said "I shall not leave you till I get my watch; I will go to the barracks or the police-station"—then he commenced abusing me and striking me—I saw the witness Parker coming along, and I called out to him to help me; and just as he came up the prisoner gave me a violent blow on the eye, stunning me, and I do not know what took place after—I have the mark now—the policeman then came—I had the watch safe when I met the prisoner—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—it was not broken; it was taken off the swivel—I had only two glasses of stout before I saw him, and then I only had the glass of lemonade.</p>

               <p>the college—I heard Christie say "Give roe ray watch," and as I got nearer I saw his gold albert-chain hanging down—Christie was holding the pri<lb></lb>soner by the collar—he said to me "Gentleman, if you are a gentleman, help me. He has stolen my watch"—I said to the prisoner "If you have got his watch, give it up; what do you want to knock the man about like that for?"—he was hitting him—he said "I have not got bis watch"—I said "Release him; I'll see that he does not get away;" and as soon as he released him, the prisoner struck him a violent blow in the eye, and knocked him into the road—I said "Well, now you shan't go till the police<lb></lb>man comes," and I detained the prisoner till the policeman came up—when I first came up they were struggling together—the prisoner said twice in my presence "I have not got your watch"—when the policeman came, be asked me to walk on the other Bide of the prisoner, but he did not show any violence—after walking about five minutes, the prisoner pulled the watch out of his pocket, and said "Here's the watch," handing it to the policeman—I believe he had told the policeman twice that he had not got the watch.</p>

On the night in question I was coming off point duty just before 1 o'clock when I heard some one quarrelling on the other side, and when I got within 4 or 5 yards of them I saw the prosecutor run into the roadway holding his hand to his eye and say "Oh?"—I went across and saw the cabman holding the prisoner, and he said he had stolen the prosecutor's watch—the prisoner said "I have not got his watch"—I said "Then you have assaulted him"—he said "Yes, I have"—the prosecutor said he would charge him with stealing his watch—he said "I have not got your watch; I have struck you"—I said "You will have to come along with me now"—he said "Very well"—I took him in custody, and the cabdriver walked on the other side of him—after walking 300 or 400 yards he said "I have the watch," producing it from his tunic pocket, "I shall give it to the inspector when I get inside"—I took him to the station and charged him with stealing a watch and assaulting him, and there he gave me the watch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the house of Carlile and Co., 13, Bow-lane, Cheapside, warehousemen—the prisoner was in our employment for some ten months as clerk, and afterwards as cashier—he has not paid me these three sums, nor accounted for them in his cash-book, according to rule—his duty was to receive no money whatever except he had a ticket from the party who sold the goods, with the amount and number upon it—on the 28th I saw an irregularity in the book, which called my attention to it—I did not wish to create any suspicion in his mind, and let it remain till the 31st—I then called him into the dining-room, and pointed out these discre<lb></lb>pancies, and asked him to give an explanation what he had done with the moneys—they are entered in our cash-book, but not in the book which he kept—I have examined it carefully and there are no such entries—it was my custom to go over his cash-book every night with him—he said he knew nothing whatever respecting it, that there must be some mistake in it—I gave him in charge, and he said the same to the officer.</p>

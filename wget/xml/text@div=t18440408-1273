                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutor's employ. About two months ago there was a barrow outside my master's shop—about a quarter to ten o'clock at night I was sent to take it down to the factory—as I went I trod on a bundle of fat outside the factory-gate, about the middle of the court—I put my hand down to the bundle, and found it was fat—I took the barrow into the factory—after the prisoner had shut up that night, I saw him come down the court and take up the bundle of fat—he put it on his shoulder, and I fol<lb></lb>lowed him with it to a little court facing his house, in Little Earl-street—I then went home—I knew he lodged in the front room on the first floor, at No. 6, Little Earl-street—I think there was about half a hundred weight of fat in the bundle—the prisoner was at the time employed in the factory in melting—there was fat in the factory.</p>

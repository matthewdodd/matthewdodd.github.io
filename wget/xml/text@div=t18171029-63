            , we supply the Gas Light Company with cocks, and live in King-street, Snow-hill. On the 25th of September, the prisoner delivered me an order for twelve main cocks for them, which I delivered to him. He used to come for these things for the Company-they are 3s. 6d. each.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. I have seen the cocks since; they are the same which I delivered for the Company.</p>

             BUTLER. I am clerk to the Gas Light Company. I gave the prisoner the order, and wrote it myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He did not deliver me the bill of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he ever tell you he had received them-A. No.</p>
               <p>ROBERT PERKS. I am a brazier, and live in Long-lane. On the 6th of October the prisoner offered me a dozen main cocks for sale, at 2s. 6d. each. I gave him 2s. 6d. on account, and told him to call again at night. I informed the Gas Light Company, and Drinkwater waited at my house for the prisoner - He came between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and asked if I would keep them? I told him I would, and paid him the difference. As he was going away the officer took him.</p>

            . I waited at Perks's house, and apprehended the prisoner as he was going out. I told him to come with me, and took the money from him. I told him I took him for selling the cocks - He said nothing. As we went along he said it was a terrible thing for him; he was in liquor, and it was his first offence - He was not in liquor. He said he was driven to it through distress.</p>
               <p>JOHN PORKNELL. I am employed by the Company. The prisoner requested me to intercede for him, as it was his first offence.</p>

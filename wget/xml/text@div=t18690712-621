I am single, and live at 6, Macclesfield Street—on Monday night, 7th June, I met the prisoner in the Haymarket—he went home with me, and next morning Harriett Smith, who lives in the same house, came into the room with some cards—the prisoner was there then—he played at cards with me, and won 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of me—he got his breakfast with me, and when he was going away he laid these two medals on the table, saying that if I gave him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he would give me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he represented them as being two sovereigns—I made up the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., with some half-pence, as I had not enough silver, and gave it to him—(he had shown me the money going home the night before; he had his waistcoat pocket full)—I jumped up to put them in my purse, and as he was going out I said, "These are bad ones"—I threw one to my friend, and she said that it was not good—I followed the prisoner into the street, and he said that if I did not go back he would split my b—head open—I saw him again the same night, and the night following—he tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Are you engaged?"—I said, "No"—he said, "May I go home with you?"—I said, "No; give me my money, or I will give you in charge"—he got away, but I spoke to the police—I saw him on the Sunday night following—he jumped into a cab, I called to the cabman, and the prisoner jumped out at the other aide—when I met him again he said, "I am obliged to come up the Hay-market with my collar turned up, and if you go on with it I shall get twelve months in prison"—I walked up the Haymarket with him, and left him and spoke to a policeman, who took him.</p>

               <p>Hicks lives in the same house—on the morning this occurred, I went into the prosecutrix' room, and gave her a pack of cards which she had asked me for—the prisoner was in her room—he asked me if I knew the three game trick, which he had been playing with my friend—I said, "No"—I am certain he is the man—I saw him leave, and as he went down stairs the prosecutrix threw these coins into my room, and asked me whether they were good; I said, "No."</p>

I went to the window, which looks from the compting-house into the warehouse. I asked the occasion of their coming there. The prisoner had his hat in his hand, he said, Damn your eyes and limbs put a shilling into my hat, or by God I have a party that can destroy your house presently I put a shilling into his hat and they both went away.</p>
               <p>What induced you to give him this money? - I was afraid of the consequence.</p>
               <p>And under that fear you gave him the money? - Yes. I had the day before seen houses destroyed, and there were no military at that time at hand, and I was afraid of any thing happening to me.</p>
               <p>Did you observe whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand? - He had a naked knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>A large knife? - Not a large knife.</p>
               <p>How did the other behave? - He did not say any thing.</p>

               <p>Do you remember seeing the prisoner in company with any other man at any time come into Mr. Daking's warehouse or compting-house? - Yes, at about two o'clock on Thursday the 8th of June; he was in company with a slender young man taller than himself; the prisoner had a clasp knife in his hand; he went back to the compting-house; my master arose from the desk and came towards the window and said, what do you want? The prisoner said, a shilling into my hat directly. My master hesitated some time and said, what is the shilling for? He said for his men and his soldiers if he would keep the blood within his mouth, that if he did not give a shilling immediately he would bring his men and take Mr. Daking's house down. My master gave a shilling; he held his hat and received it in his hat; he then crossed over the way to the oil-shop. I followed him there; he repeated the same words there to the gentlewoman.</p>
               <p>No matter what he did there was he secured instantly? - Not in my presence; he was taken about ten minutes after.</p>
               <p>Are you positive the prisoner is the man? - I am.</p>
               <p>To Daking. Is your warehouse a part of your dwellinghouse? - My dwelling-house is in Broad-street, at a distance from the warehouse.</p>

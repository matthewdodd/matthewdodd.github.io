            . I live with Mr. Swinton; he was out of town the day these things were stolen. I had been at the Custom house; about two o'clock, when I returned, I heard somebody upon the stairs: as nobody had any business there without my knowledge, I called to know who it was; I saw the prisoner, he had something concealed under his coat; as the counting house and the butler's pantry are up stairs, I supposed he had been upon business; I asked him if he wanted any thing, he made no answer; I repeated it but had no answer. I stept pretty quick to the door, he got out and ran; I pursued him and called out, Stop thief, and then he dropt this silver tea<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177107030005"></xptr> Pot, (producing it.) I passed it and pursued him up Rupert street, still hallooing, and at last took him; and with the assistance of this man, brought him back to Mr. Swinton's house: we searched him, and out of one of his pockets we took this silver sugar pot, ( producing it) both of which, I swear, are Mr. Swinton's property; I saw the tea pot the evening before; the prisoner was never out of my sight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a musical instrument maker, in Henrietta-street, Covent-garden, the prisoner is my apprentice. On Sunday, the 19th of May, he wished to go out, as his brother had just returned from sea—I said I had no objection—I had some suspicion, and in the evening I asked him to open his box—he did so, and pulled out two or three things, and then locked his box again—I then had the officer—he was taken to the station-house—his box was opened, and these things were found—there are 9 3/4 lbs. weight of brass, worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or more—I had such things on my premises—I know this.</p>

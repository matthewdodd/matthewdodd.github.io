                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Mr. William Metton, a solicitor, in Bedford<lb></lb>row. On the night of 9th Aug. I was at Chelmsford—I received a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184808210138"></xptr>
               <p>No. 23053, from Mr. Nicholson, at a booth—I put it in my right-hand trow<lb></lb>sers pocket—when I got in the passage, between the seats, I was hustled by several persons—there were two women there and five or six men—the note was taken from my pocket—I gave information, and on 11th Aug. I went with Mr. Harris to the prisoner, and asked him what knowledge he had of that note—he said he had it from a man and woman at the Fleur-de-Lis public-house, which is half a mile from Mr. Harris', which is in Shoreditch, that he did not know anything of the man, more than having seen him at the public-house four or five times—he knew neither his name nor address, that he was rather tall and stout, of a florid complexion, and was accompanied by a woman, who was round-faced, and smartly dressed.</p>

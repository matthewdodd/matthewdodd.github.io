I was going along Brompton-row, and met the prisoner—she asked me if I knew of a lodging—I said I did not—she asked me to go with her along the road to look for one—she asked somebody else for a lodging—I went with her to Caroline-place, and the took a lodging—she called on me next day at my own house—she had a parcel—she sent somebody out to get bacon and butter for tea—I lent her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—I went with her to the Duchess of Gloucester public-house—she left me in the Park, to come home by myself—before we went out I had fasted all the doors up, and she insisted on it that I had not fastened them—I went down to see, and they were fast—there was 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., on the shelf when I went down, and I left her in the room—the doors down stain were fast be<lb></lb>fore I left the house—when I came home, at half-past eight o'clock, I missed the shilling off the mantel-piece, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the table-drawer—I had suspicion, and went to her lodging next morning, and she had not been home—I went to the Duchess of Gloucester, where she had told me the kitchen<lb></lb>maid was her sister, but they did not know anything of her—I saw no more of her till she was in custody—when I opened the parcel she brought, it was only the skirt of a gown; she told me it was a dress.</p>

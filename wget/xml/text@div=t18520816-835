                  </hi>. On the evening of 15th June I was in company with the prisoner drinking—we had had a good deal to drink, and came out of the public house—I went away, came back again, and asked him to go in and have some more beer—he said, "No, do you want anything with me?"—I said, "No," and he put his hand into his pocket and stabbed me with a knife—I had not given him any provocation, or done or said anything to annoy him—I did not owe him any money, or ask him for any.</p>

                  </hi>. I was standing at the bottom of Denmark-street, about half-past 7 o'clock, and saw the prisoner and two more standing at the door of the "Kettle Drum"—I heard the prisoner go up to the prosecutor and say, "Do you want anything of me?"—he said, "No"—the prisoner went back again, put his hand into his pocket, went to the prosecutor, and gave him a blow—I saw something in the prisoner's hand, it glistened, but the blood flowed so immediately I cannot say what it was—the prisoner then ran back again, and stopped about two minutes—a man said to him, "<hi rend="italic">Hook</hi> it"—he said, "No, I will stand my ground, I have given him what he wanted to do to me"—the other one said, "<hi rend="italic">Hook</hi> it"—he said, "No, I have half a sovereign behind the bar, and I shall go and get it"—I saw him go in at one door and he came out at another, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon at the London Hos<lb></lb>pital. I saw the prosecutor on the night of 15th June—he was in a very faint and weak state from loss of blood—I found a wound on his left cheek about an inch in length, and an inch and a half deep; there was a small artery divided —it was a very dangerous wound, it bled on two or three occasions after it was dressed—he was in danger for ten days or a fortnight; he is still suffer<lb></lb>ing from it, and he will be some time before he recovers—the effect on his speech is produced by the wound—there is paralysis on one side of the tongue, and he will never be able to speak properly again.</p>

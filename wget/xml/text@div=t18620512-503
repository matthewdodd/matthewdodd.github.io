               <p>pairs of uppers and ten pairs of soles, to be made up by her husband—I know that by looking at my book—it is not here, but I also know it independently of my book—it was this sort that she had, but here is only a portion of them—I identify these six pairs of uppers with the blue lining, as given to Mrs. Ware; they are just in the same state as when I gave them out—I can also speak to these nine pairs of soles—they ought to have been worked up and returned to me, but they have never been returned—that is the only instance of goods going out and not being returned within the last two years—I went in search of Ware, three days after giving her the work, but they had moved away, and I could get no tidings of then—we have not taken security from the workmen for the last two years—we do not sell uppers or soles in this state.</p>

On 18th Oct., at a quarter past 1 o'clock in the morning, I was on duty at Stanley-villas, Notting-hill—I saw the prisoner; he had apparently been drinking, and was on his hands and knees—I asked what he was doing; I got no distinct answer, and I took him into custody—I found a small bag in his left hand trowsers pocket, with four counterfeit shillings in it—they were separately wrapped in papers—these are them—I took the prisoner to the station—he said I might want a friend some day myself—I said I might—he said, "Be a friend to me now, if you like"—I said, "What do you mean?"—he said, "Chuck them away," or "Throw them away"—I searched him at the station—I found on him one more counterfeit shilling loose, and one good shilling, and 9 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in coppers.</p>

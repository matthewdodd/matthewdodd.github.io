On Tuesday evening, the 3rd of January, I left London, and was going home—I was stopped after being at the Churchill Arms, Kensington Gravel-pits—I was going in there, and suppose these two men were at the door—I do not recollect that, as I was so drunk—I found myself in custody next morning, and all my money was gone—I recollect having it in my pocket when I left London, between nine and ten o'clock—I cannot tell when I became insensible—I was not drunk when I started—it was as much the effect of being in company where they were smoking, as drink—I do not recollect much after leaving Piccadilly.</p>

On the night of the 3rd of January, it being late, my mother sent me out to look for my father—I saw him in Silver-street, in the Gravel-pits, near the Duke of York public-house—Lightwood had hold of his right arm, and asked me what I wanted—I told him it was ray father—Lightwood let him go, and dropped something—he stooped down to pick it up, and went across to Peel-street, near where he and Hughes were working—Hughes was present, and he stopped, and used threatening language—he threatened to knock my father—over head—I do not know what for—he got hold of my father's arm, and said be<lb></lb>fore he would let go, my father should break his arm—he did not say why he held his arm—I called, "Police," and I think three came up.</p>

I was in Churchill-street with Mr. Reid's two sons, on the 4th of January, at ten o'clock on the morning after the robbery, and met Lightwood and two others coming along the street—I knew he was working there at that time with Hughes, sinking a well—as soon as young Reid saw the three men come round the corner, he pointed out Lightwood to me—I followed him a little way, and took him into custody—I took him to the station-house, and searched him—he said he had a little silver in his waistcoat pocket, which was all the money he had, and that was part of his week's wages which he had received the night before—I found two shillings, a half-crown, and sixpence half-penny in copper, in his pocket—he said he slept that night at a house in Pell-street, where he was at work—I went there, and made inquiry—I then asked him where he lived—he said at Acton, with his father, who was out of work, and the key was left with the next door neighbour, but he did not recollect the neighbour's name—I found out the lodging after a long inquiry—I did not find the key with the neighbour, but lying over the door—I took the owner of the house and the police-sergeant who searched the room, and found a box, which I opened with a key he had given me—I found five half-crowns in the till of the box, and, further down it, folded up in a blanket, seven sovereigns and a half—he had told me he had only got the remainder of five shillings, which was his wages.</p>

On Tuesday night, the 3rd of January, the two prisoners were in my house, and the prosecutor with them—they came in ogether—Light-wood appeared sober, Hughes appeared a good deal the worse for liquor, and the prosecutor, I found out afterwards, was in liquor, but I did not perceive it at first—he treated the prisoners to some gin, and took out his purse to pay for it—it contained gold—I changed a sovereign for him—he had some rum and water afterwards by himself—Lightwood had some porter and some rum—he said he was going to work all night, and took half a gallon of porter out with him—Hughes remained behind and got into con venation with the prosecutor—he wished to accompany him home, but I objected to it, and said he only lived next door, and there was no occasion for his assistance—I did not know exactly where he lived at the time, but said so to prevent Hughes going with him—I got Hughes</p>

               <p>Q. Where there any pole ewe sheep? - A. Yes; nine of the lot that were missing; they were penned in a pen by themselves, about eleven o'clock in the day, after which I did not give any body authority to take them away; I sold them to a man of the name of Taylorson; I have not been paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it the custom of Smithfield Market to deliver the sheep before the money is received for them? - A. No; sometime after two o'clock I dis<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020082"></xptr>covered that the nine pole ewe sheep were gone; they were marked over the loins with the country mark; with oker; there was no brand in particular that I observed.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose pen of that day was this pen near to? - A. It was near to Mr. Hebb's, opposite to it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had so missed the sheep, did you see any thing further of them? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any part of them after they were slaughtered? - A. Yes; I saw one skin at Islington; I am sure that that was one of those nine pole sheep that I lost, it was produced by the constable; I saw none of the live ones.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe the removal of sheep to and from the different pens is conducted by the drovers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This young man was a drover? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the 10th of March? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Mr. Hebb constantly attend Smithfield Market? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after was it that this young man was taken up-was it not a fortnight? - A. Not quite, I believe, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not this lad there, in the market, on the Friday following, and the Monday after that? - A. I cannot say; I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. He carries on the business of a drover under his father and brother? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when a purchase is made, the drover is generally directed to what pen he should drive the sheep? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then the drover takes them where he is directed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. Was the prisoner employed, as a drover, by you, on the 10th of March? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. This was on the Monday? - A. Yes; and he was taken on the Saturday in the week following, I believe, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. At the time he was taken, he was attending at the Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not a man been taken up before for stealing these sheep, of the name of Filaster? - A. No; he was not taken up, he was only charged with it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. After you have sold sheep, do the drovers remove them from one pen to another? - A. Yes; it is done by my own drovers, and by my own orders.</p>
               <p>Q. After they are sold? - A. Yes; to make room for other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these sheep moved by your orders, after they were sold? - A. Yes; by my drover, and Taylorson, to another pen that I had, the same day, opposite Mr. Hebb's; my pens were all fronting of Mr. Hebb's.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, did you not, upon their being lost, actually pay Taylorson for them as Taylorson's sheep? - A. No, I did not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. I am a salesman in Smithfield: On Monday, the 10th of March, my pens were opposite to Mr. Tingey's; between half past one and two, which we call late in the day, I observed some sheep in a pen which was next to mine, they were small pole-sheep, I supposed them to be Nottinghamshire sheep; I cannot say whether they were ewes or not, as they had no butcher's mark upon them; that is a mark put upon them by the butcher soon after they are bought, I looked upon it that they were unsold; and several butchers asked me the price of the sheep; there was a saint mark upon them, that appeared to have been on for a month or six weeks; it was an oker mark across the loins; they had the appearance of being from eight to twelve sheep, but the particular number I did not notice; about half past one, or from that to half past two, I cannot be particular to half an hour, I had sold four sheep to a person of the name of Worrall; somebody asked me if those sheep opposite mine were mine; I said, no; and in about half a minute after that, I saw the prisoner go into the pen and drive these sheep out; there were a number of drovers about; just at the close of the market it is very common for the drovers to assist in clearing the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the skin since? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the skin of one of those sheep that you saw drove out? - A. I cannot swear that; it was like it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Tingey there at that time? - A. No; I did not see any body there that belonged to him at that time, or after.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure it was the prisoner? - A. Yes, he was a butcher's drover; I had seen him for about six months before it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This was done when there were a great number of drovers about, in the open market? - A. Yes; Smithfield is always open.</p>
               <p>Q. Every person there must see what he was about? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The man that was with him was not the prisoner's brother? - A. I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it usual for sheep that are sold to have the butcher's mark put upon them? - A. It is very common.</p>
               <p>Q. These sheep had not the butcher's mark? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if they had been sold to Taylorson, they would have had his mark? - A. It is not a certain rule.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner in the market since that day? - A. No, I have not, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Before these sheep were driven away, had they any butcher's marks? - A. They<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020083"></xptr>had not; there is one set of drovers to the salesmen, and the other butchers drovers, to drive the sheep to where the butchers live; but the butchers drovers do not assist the salesmens' drovers in removing sheep from one pen to another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Did you see the prisoner at the Police-office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He came there voluntarily, did not he? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing at the bar? - A. When I was there I saw him standing at the bar, by the side of his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not there to see his brother, who was charged with she offence? - A. I do not know what he came for; I saw him at the bar, and then I pointed him out to the Magistrates.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any sheep stopped at your house all night? - A. Somebody holloaed out from the door to leave some sheep for William Field; I was in the bar; I did not see who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, did they leave any sheep? - A. I believe they did; I never saw any in particular, any fasther than a large drove before the bar-window.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did the drove consist of? - A. Six or seven score.</p>
               <p>Q. How many sheep were left with you? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Court. Q.Recollect you are upon your oath, and before a Court that have the power to commit you if you do not speak truth? - A. I do; I was out all day on Tuesday, and did not see any delivered.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watson. Q. You take in stocks occasionally there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid you for those that were taken in? - A. I never take any money but what is spent in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money was taken in the house that night for these sheep? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that ever happen to you before? - A.Repeatedly.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other cattle of any other description that night? - A. There might be, I cannot say; the stable were open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. Q. Recollect yourself, and mind what answers you give me; have you ever said at any time, the number of sheep that were left? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect yourself; I will have a positive answer-did you ever, at any time, mention the number of sheep that were left? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never did? - A. I do not believe I ever did.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me caution you? - A. I have heard people say there were nine sheep, and I may have said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never swear that nine sheep were left? - A. I never swore that, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. What, do you swear without knowing what you swear? - A. I never swore it, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say to whom they were delivered? - A. I was not at home at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you upon your oath, whether you did not say to whom the sheep were delivered? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that; is that your hand-writing? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sworn to that, and you signed it? - A. I signed a paper, but I never saw it, at the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you sign it, if you did not see it? - A. I never read it; they told me to put my name down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it ever read? - A. I do not remember any thing being read particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you, upon the oath you have taken, swear that that deposition, taken before the Lord-Mayor, was not read to you before you signed it? - A. No, I will not; they were all read over.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not desired to attend to it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you again-did you not mention the number of sheep? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have a positive answer; did you or not swear before the Lord-Mayor, to the number of sheep? - A. Upon my word I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. I will have a direct answer, or commit you? - A. I believe I said something about nine sheep before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sworn before the Lord-Mayor? - A. Not the last time.</p>
               <p>Q. But you were when you signed it? - A. Then I must have sworn to the nine sheep; if I swore there were nine sheep I did very wrong, for I never saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear to whom they were delivered? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not swear not only that there were nine sheep, but that they were delivered to H<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180004020084"></xptr>man; recollect yourself? - A. To the best of my knowledge I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. That will not do, I will have a positive answer; you shall not escape justice in that kind of way; did you or did you not swear that the nine sheep were delivered to Harman? - A. I could not swear to it.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you did or did not? - A. I cannot say; I might swear it, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you account so little of an oath that you do not take notice what you swear; this was read over to you, and you swore to it, and signed it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then upon your oath do not you recollect? - A. I do not recollect, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. I expect an immediate answer whether you swore that before the Magistrate? - A. I dare say the paper is right.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to tell me just now, that you did not know the number of the sheep? - A. I never saw the sheep.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to say there were nine? - A. They told me to swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who? - A. The Lord-Mayor's clerk, him that wrote it down, told me to swear to what was wrote there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not take it down from your own words? - A. I was not examined that day at all.</p>
               <p>Q. He asked you if what you signed was true, and you said, yes? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were examined the day before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was put down upon paper, and read to you the next day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had time to recollect yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner's voice very well? - A. I have been in his company two or three times; I am very intimate with his brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it is your practice to take in from any body that comes, any articles they choose to bring? - A. If they say who they come from.</p>
               <p>Mr. Shelton reads - "Informant says, that nine sheep were brought to his house at Ponder's-end, late on Monday evening, the 10th of March, and the next day delivered to Joseph Harman."</p>
               <p>Q. Is that true, or not? - A. The nine sheep I cannot say; the other part I believe is true; my wife told me they were delivered to

               <p>Q. Might it not happen that the man desired them to be left, and not the person now at the bar? - A. I cannot say; I was busy drawing my sheep at the time; I rather think it was Richard, but I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. This bar is adjoining the road? - A. Yes; I saw Atkins through the window; it was candle-light.</p>

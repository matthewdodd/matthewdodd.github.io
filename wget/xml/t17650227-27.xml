After that, seeing the prisoner in all those fine things, gave me a great suspicion she was a thief: then I and my wife took her to my bed-chamber, and examined her; she said a woman, named Kenrick, who lodged in my house, broke my chest of drawers, and took out fifteen shillings, and gave them to her, and took some money herself: I carried them both before Justice Welch; there she swore the same, before the Justice, against the old woman: the old woman denied it: the justice said to the prisoner, she was a bad girl, and bid her go home, and deliver the things to her master.</p>

The justice asked her, if she knew any thing against the old woman? she said no, nothing at all: she had before sworn the old woman gave her the gown and buckles; the other was acquitted, and she sent to New-Prison.</p>

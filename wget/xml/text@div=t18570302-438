                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Edward Jones, a tallow chand<lb></lb>ler, at No. 301, Kent-street, in the Borough; it is in the parish of St. Mary, Newington; he resides in that house. On the morning of 24th Feb., I was awoke about 3 o'clock—I went down into the shop, and found two police<lb></lb>men—the shop was in order, but we missed four boxes of candles on exa<lb></lb>mination—a bag of alum had been removed, and two balls of candle cotton—before I went to bed I had gone round the premises at 1 o'clock that morning—at that time the side door leading to the warehouse was shut—I did not try it, but it was apparently fast; it was shut to—when I came down again, it was open, and the lock was broken.</p>

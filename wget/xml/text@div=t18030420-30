               <p>Q. How did he break the window? - A.With his hand; I should suppose he had something in his hand, but that I did not see.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from him? - A. I was opposite to him, on the other side of the way: then they both walked away together; then they came past backwards and forwards several times.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were you? - A. I stood where I was watching them; they came backwards and forwards by the shop-window several times, and looked in; afterwards they both returned, and Jones put his hand into the window, and took something out.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see at that time what it was? - A. No; he put it under his coat, on the lefthand side, and then gave it to Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to him at that time? - A. About the same distance that I am now; I continued in the same situation.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Smith do with it? - A. I don't know; I desired Ferris to apprehend Smith; I apprehended Jones, the little one, and took him into a public-house, and Ferris brought Smith in about the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing produced in the public-house? - A. No; after they were secured, Ferris went out, and brought in a candlestick.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lost sight of the prisoners at all before you apprehended them? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Q. You are a patrol? - A. Yes; on Thursday the 17th of March, I had been with his Majesty to Covent-garden Theatre, with Gleed; we afterwards walked down Holborn, and observed the prisoners at the bar looking in at the shop of Mr. Fontaine, we crossed facing Mr. Fontaine's, to see whether they were going to do any thing, or what they were, and a little while afterwards, I saw the little one, Jones, break the window with his hand, or something in his hand; they passed on for a little bit, and then returned again; they walked backwards and forwards two or three times; I saw Jones take something out of the window that he had broke, and put it under his coat, he afterwards gave it to Smith; Gleed desired me to apprehend Smith, and he would take Jones; I then went very near him, and saw the candlestick in his left-hand, it looked like brass, or copper; I was then within about two or three yards of him, he saw that I was coming towards him, he stepped aside into the road-way, and shyed the candlestick at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it hit you? - A. No; he then ran away, I pursued him; he ran up against some gentlemen that were walking very fast, and I then apprehended him; I took him into a public-house directly, I was at the door before Jones and Gleed, we came up just at the same time; I handcuffed them together, and then went again to find the candlestick, and found it within ten yards of Mr. Fontaine's shop.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180304200039"></xptr>Q.Near where he threw it? - A. Yes; there is a public-house, with some shutters under the window, he threw it against those shutters, and it rebounded into the road, where I found it; I heard it strike against the shutters.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick it up yourself? - A. No, a young man said, here it is, and picked it up and gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the direction in which the prisoner was going? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.What time was it, from his throwing the candlestick at you, till it was found? - A. About five or six minutes; I went out directly that way, and handcuffed them; it has been in my possession ever since. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. You are very sure, what he threw towards you, was a candlestick? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any candlesticks in your window that night? - A. Yes, several.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your window whole or broke when the lamps were lighted? - A. To the best of my knowledge, there was not a broken pane in that window, I broke one pane myself that evening, but it was subsequent to the prisoner being apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you receive an alarm from any body? - A.About half-past seven, or it might be eight, I am not quite certain, I was called down stairs by Ferris.</p>
               <p>Q. Who serves in your shop besides yourself? - A. The shopman and porter.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not heard any alarm, or missed any thing till Ferris came? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state was the window? - A. The window was broke and the candlestick missing, that I had placed there a few days before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your's a sash-window? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't remember having seen it that day? - A. No, I do not; but had it not been there, I should have missed it, because the vacancy was obvious.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss the candlestick before he produced it to you? - A. I am not clear whether it was before or after.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the place, where you had placed it, within the reach of a man's arm? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he produced that candlestick did you know it? - A.On examining it, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that candlestick? - A. This is the candlestick, I have no doubt of it, it has my handwriting on it with ink, on the metal, both the cost and selling price.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Is this the only window that you observed broke? - A. In that part of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any window broke in the shop, in any part of it? - A.Cracked, I dare say.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us, you know the candlesticks by the cost and selling price? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you put your cost and selling price upon all your candlesticks? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you sell them with the cost and the selling price upon them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you sold a great many of the same sort of candlesticks? - A. Yes, but not since I placed them in that place I missed it from.</p>
               <p>Q.Should you be able to swear to this from any other mark than the cost and selling price? - A. And the circumstance of my having placed it in a particular place, there had been a vacancy, and I found an odd one in paper, which I put in the vacancy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Watson. Q. How lately had you seen your shop-window before this alarm? A. I cannot say precisely, before I went up to tea.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you suppose? - A. It might be a couple of hours, I cannot say at all.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Smith, did not say any thing in his defence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones's defence. On the 17th of March, I was going from my father's house, in Liquor-pond-street, to Mr. Townsend's, just as I got to Mr. Townsend's door, about ten or fifteen yards from the prosecutor's house, the witness, Gleed, came up and seized me by the collar, he took me to the public-house, I underwent strict search, but he found nothing upon me; I did not know what I was taken up for, till I was fully committed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Sandy-hill, Plumstead. On Saturday, 1st Oct., I was going home from Woolwich theatre, between 12 o'clock and half past, and saw two marines in uniform, standing near Mr. Marks' premises, one tall and one short—the tall man was dark, I could see his face—they were looking towards the public house, not towards Marks'—they were about the height of the two prisoners, but I cannot swear to them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bombardier and collar maker in the Royal Artillery. On Wednesday morning, 15th Oct, about half past 6 o'clock, I passed by Mr. Marks' place, and saw the window half open, and a quantity of lace and a civilian's cloth cap on the cill outside—there was a hole cut in the double panel of the shutter, to admit the fingers of a man to ease the bolt—I put the cap on the area, pushed the lace in, and called Mr. Marks up—the lace seemed as if a person had dropped it or pulled it in coming out of the window—any man could have got in at the window, it was half open—a pane of glass was broken close to the catch, so that they could put their hand in and open the window, and get in.</p>

On Wednesday morning, 15th Oct, about 11 o'clock, Harpley brought me a piece of new lace—I bought it of him for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he went away—about 2 o'clock both the prisoners came with some gold lace in a handkerchief—I asked them where it came from—they said, "Wait, and we will show you"—they gave me a push against the counter, and went away, one to the right and one to the left—I went after them, but could not catch them—I took the lace to the station house—my shop is 150 yards from Mr. Marks'—this is the lace (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I know what <hi rend="italic">lair</hi> you have got me on now"—he said that he was in <hi rend="italic">Jack's</hi> canteen yesterday morning, and another marine gave him a piece of lace to sell for 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which he did, and that he went again with him, and he had something in a hand-kerchief, but he did not know what it was—on the 18th I saw Maughan at Charlton fair, and supposing him to be a deserter, I asked him if he did not belong to the Royal Marines—he said, "No," and that his name was Wil<lb></lb>liam Jones—I told him I should take him on suspicion of being a deserter, and also of committing a robbery at Woolwich—he said that he was not the man—I looked at his shirt, saw the name of Maughan on it, and de<lb></lb>tained him—I found this large knite and purse on him (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

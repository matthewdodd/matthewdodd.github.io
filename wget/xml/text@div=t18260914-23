            . I am an officer, and beadle of St. Giles'. On the 24th of July I apprehended the prisoner in Pall-mall - Nicholas was with me; as I took him along I called him aside, and told him I suspected he had committed a robbery, and attempted to bring me and my fellow-officer into trouble; I neither threatened or held him out any inducement to say any thing; he asked if I would allow him to write a letter to his master, Mr. Knight - I said, certainly, and asked where he would have it taken to; he said to his master's chambers, in St. James'-square - we took him there; Mr. Knight was out of town, and we took him in a coach to Marlborough-street - he stated in the coach that he had stolen the plate from Mr. Knight's house, No. 8, Marlborough-street; I went there, and got a pattern fork, then got into the coach, and drove to Mr. Levy's, in Holywell-street, Strand, where he said he had left the plate - I asked Levy if he knew him - he said Yes, and that he had brought the plate there; I asked if he had any plate similar to this fork; he said Yes, and sent his wife up stairs - she brought down eighteen forks and six spoons; Levy said the prisoner had brought it there - that he had given him a pair of trousers and 1s. 6d. for one spoon - the prisoner did not deny it.</p>

            . I live in Holywell-street. On a Sunday morning, a week before the officer came, I got this plate from the prisoner; he first came and bought a pair of trousers for 6s.; my son called me down; he said he had got some plate to sell, and that it was his own; I put my hand on it, and said I could not buy it without a reference; he said he would bring two references in two hours, but he did not come, and I gave information at the office next morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was there no quarrel between you about the price? A. No; he asked 5s. an ounce - I offered him 4s., but I did not pay him for it; I should not have bought it without a reference; I suspected it was not his own. I keep a clothes-shop. I gave the same plate to Green.</p>

            , as she certainly was not lawfully married to Innes; she then took the power of attorney back with her to have the memorandum at the back signed, and said she would be with me on the Tuesday morning. After she was gone, not being quite satisfied in my own mind whether she was married or not, and not wishing to run the risk of identifying a married woman as a single woman, or a single woman as a married woman, in my way home I called on Messrs. Owen and Hicks, of Bartlett's-buildings, attornies to the family; they recommended her to me last spring.</p>

            , cheesemonger, of Greenwich; being then pretty certain, but not quite, that it was a forgery, I again put her off to be with me again on the Wednesday morning, intending in the mean time to make enquiry respecting the power, whether it was a good one or not; in the afternoon of Tuesday, myself and her father went to Greenwich; I went to Mr. Allin's house by myself, having the power of attorney with me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her again? - A. On the Wednesday morning; I got to the Bank pretty early, and went to Mr. Newcomb, the principal clerk in the Reduced Office, about ten o'clock; in going through the rotunda at the Bank, I saw the prisoner and a man with her standing just by the door going in; I said, Miss Hurle, you are come very early this morning, I will be with you in a minute, and immediately left her; from that time I did not see her till she was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you delivered up the power of attorney before that? - A. Not before that; after mentioning the circumstance to Mr. Newcomb, he took me to the accomptant-general; the accomptant-general took me before the Directors of the Bank, and they requested me to give the power of attorney up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it afterwards delivered over to Mr. Kay, the solicitor? - A. I gave it up in the morning, I should suppose between eleven and twelve, and I was again sent for in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that to be the same power of attorney? - A. Yes, by this P being blotted a little, and wrote again, and also by my own hand-writing upon it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The description of the witnesses were wrote by yourself? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not understand, from the whole tenor of her conversation, that there was a connection<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180401110040"></xptr>between her and a man of the name of Innes? - A. Yes, I found there was an acquaintance, and a pretended marriage.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the power of attorney the first time in the office for some time? - A. For about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. It then passed into different hands, did it not? - A. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not see it again for the space of twenty minutes? - A. Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person that was with her afterwards when you saw her early on the Wednesday morning? - A. I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine that paper? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conversation pass respecting that paper in the prisoner's presence? - A. Certainly, between me and the prisoner, and the last witness.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as state what that conversation was? - A. The prisoner, with the last witness, came to my Office to ask the objections I had to passing or admitting this power of attorney; I told her, I had compared the signature with the former signature of Mr. Allin, that there was a difference in the present signature and the former signature of Mr. Allin; in answer to which, she said, she expected it would be so; that Mr. Allin had been long out of the habit of writing, so much so, that her aunt signed all his drafts upon his banker; in answer to this, I said to her, perhaps your aunt has signed this for him; no, she said, I might depend upon it that Mr. Allin had signed that himself; I believe I put this question to her a second time, suspecting that her aunt might have signed it; to which she answered, I might depend upon it, it was not so; I then said, Pray, Ma'am, if I may ask you the question, what is this old gentleman going to do with this 500 l. she answered me, that he was going to make her a present of it for the great care and attention that she had many years paid him, and that her aunt was willing he should so do. I then asked her how this power came in this mutilated state; to which she answered, just as it was going to be executed, the dog had got hold of it and tore it; if that was any objection to the power she would take out a fresh one. I did not think any part of it torn to affect the validity of it; I therefore told her the Bank of England would never wish to put any constituent to any expence that might be fairly and properly avoided.

               <p>Q. Meaning Mr. Allen's family? - A. Yes; I observed to her, that he was a considerable proprietor of stock, and if he would certify what I should write upon the back of the paper as to his personal knowledge of Mr. Allen, I then would take the matter into further consideration when she brought it back again, and from that till the present time I have not seen the power of attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. After that you saw nothing of the prisoner? - A. I saw her the morning after in the Rotunda, along with a man, but I had no conversation with her.</p>

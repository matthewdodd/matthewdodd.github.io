            . I am a constable of St. Martins in Fields. On Friday night last, about nine o'clock, I took the prisoner in custody at the Lemon Tree, out of the pretended custody of a man that pretended he had a bastard child; he had this bundle of things and going away from his lodging with them. On Saturday morning I made enquiry about the pawnbrokers; I went to Mr. Cordy's, I found that the watch had been pledged and taken out from there; I went to Mr. Solomon's I found that he had bought it out and out; Solomon lives in Vinegar-yard, he is a clothes salesman; I got the watch from Solomon, I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Donaldson, was not I in charge of another constable - A. You were in charge of a pretended constable, who let you go away with me; I told him he was no constable; I put him of one side directly and took you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was I going to take my clothes away - A. I took you with the bundle; I asked you what you were going to do with the things; you said you were going to your washerwoman; I said are you going to have your shoes washed; they were all the things that you had in the lodging, you were taking them away. I delivered you the things up before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>COURT. How soon afterwards did you examine his lodging - A. In half an hour afterwards, and then I only found a phial.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was I taking my clothes out of the house, or not - A. Yes, you were; an old shirt, a pair of shoes, a parcel of cuttings and shears, all the moveables that you had in the lodgings; you were going out with them when I stopped you.</p>

               <p>- SOLOMON. I live in Little Russell-court, Drury-lane; I am a salesman.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the prisoner before - A. I saw him last Friday, about four or five o'clock, he came to my shop and told me he had a watch in pledge for two pounds, and asked me if I would buy the duplicate; I told him I never bought duplicates; I bought the property, I could not buy it without seeing it; he said he would sell me the watch if I would go with him to the pawnbroker's and pay the interest; I asked him how much he paid for the watch; he said six pounds. We went to the pawnbroker's between four and five in the afternoon; I asked him the watchmaker's name, he said I should see the watchmaker's name when I saw the watch; he lived over Blackfriers-road, and he bought the watch over Blackfriers-road. We went into the pawnbroker's; I paid the pawnbroker two pounds for the principal, and eight pence for the interest, and took the watch out. When I came home I asked him what he asked for the watch; he said three pounds ten shillings; I told him I would give him no more than three pound. We bargained for it; I gave him one pound, he gave me sixpence for the interest. Three pounds and two-pence I paid for that watch: when I brought the watch home the box was open; I asked him where the key was belonging to that box; he told me he lost it; then he took the money and went away; the watch case, if you examine it, is broken open.</p>

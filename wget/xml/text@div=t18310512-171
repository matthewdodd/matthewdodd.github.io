             letters perhaps more than a hundred<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183105120093"></xptr>years. In April last the prisoner was in my employ - his business was to take the letters out of the box, and put them into a bag, or, if any body brought letters into the shop, and gave them into his hand, to put them into the bag instantly - that is an unpaid letter-bag, which was to be sent to the Post-office as soon as the clock struck five; after the letters were made up, the prisoner generally tied them up, and put a string round them - he put the wax. and I put the seal to it; he and I were the persons who made up the letters to be sent to the Post-office - his business in the morning was to do any thing we wanted, and, among other things, to clean the boots and shoes; we did not trust him much in the shop, but generally sent him on errands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was rather an under kind of servant? A. Yes - he did not live in the house; I gave him 6s. a week, with his breakfast and dinner - he states himself to be more than eighteen years old; I have four clerks and two servants employed in the stationery business - I have a room across the lane, and at times have eight clerks; none of them make up the bag; I will not swear that has not occasionally happened - my son sometimes makes it up. but nobody else that I know of; it has happened that I have not been at home when it has been made up - the clerks never sealed the bag, to my knowledge; they may have done it.</p>
               <p>Q. When was your attention called to the loss of this letter? A.On the Saturday morning my attention was called to the finding of a Bank-note; there was nothing particularly suspicious happened on the Tuesday - the prisoner has been two years and upwards in my employ; I considered his father a respectable man - we had a very good opinion of him, and trusted him with a great deal of property of our own.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q.On that Tuesday, did you yourself seal the bag? A. I did, and the prisoner assisted me.</p>

            . On Thursday, the 21st of April, I required the prisoner to go with me to the Post-office - he came from a room allotted to him opposite our office, up one pair of stairs, in Middle Temple-lane; the room is not in our house - it is allotted to the prisoner to clean boots and shoes, and doing other affairs; I think that was between twelve and one o'clock - after being summoned by me to come down stairs, telling him he was wanted immediately, he wished to return to his room, but I required him to come instantly - he was in the habit of cleaning my boots; he did not return after going away that morning - after he was gone I put on a pair of my boots, which I got from our office in Middle Temple-lane; his duty, when he had cleaned my boots, was to return them to my private residence in Took's-court, Chancery-lane - I found my boots in the inner office, at half-past eight o'clock, on the Saturday morning after the Thursday on which he left; I put them on, and found a 10l. note in one of them - I took it to the General Post-office, and marked it; this is it(looking at it); I had not worn the boots since the Wednesday - I was present on Friday night, before nine o'clock, when my brother brought them to the inner office; they were left there that night - the office was locked up by my brother, I think, but we left together, leaving it closed; I opened it next morning, but left it before I went to put on my boots - I left Glover there; he is a youth who had come into our service that morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long were you away? A. I should think not a minute - I only crossed the way to the office; all the clerks have access to the office, but not usually to the office the boots were in - I know of nothing that could require them to go there; they can go if they choose - it is not left open; the key is usually hung up when not in use - it hangs under the counter, behind the shop door; my boots had been in the room from Thursday morning till Friday evening, at nine o'clock - I had not looked into them during those two days.</p>

               <p>MARY INWARD. I am cook to Mr. Abram. I entered his service on the 19th of April; on Wednesday, the 20th, about half-past three o'clock the prisoner came into the kitchen - I thought I saw something in his hand - I think it was a note; there was a lighted candle in the kitchen - I believe I lighted it for him; I left him in the kitchen, and shortly after returned - the prisoner was there, and there was a letter on the dresser: I think it laid open - he was then standing at the dresser, towards the window; I believe he had a note in his hand - I do not recollect how he was holding it; I believe he was looking at it - his face was towards the window; the lighted candle was then on the dresser - I do not think it was far from him - the kitchen is light; a person can read in it without a candle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you had your own business to attend to, and did not take much notice of what was going on? A. No; I cannot swear it was a note that I saw in his hand.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Post-office. (Looking at a paper) the red ink signature or mark on this, is mine, and signifies that on the evening of the 19th of April I opened the unpaid-bag from the receiving-house in Middle Temple.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have not put your name to it? A. No, it is not customary - I have put a mark, which signifies that I opened the bag that night; I cannot speak about the paid bag - unpaid letters have, at times, dropped into the paid bag.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TYRRELL. I belong to the City Police. I saw the prisoner at the Post-office, on Wednesday, the 20th of April, when there was some explanation about a different matter to this - I searched him, and asked if he had any money; he said No - I found but 6d. on him; I was at Bow-street on Monday, the 25th of April; depositions were taken against the prisoner that day - before they were taken I saw him in the presence of Mr. Peacock, the Post-office solicitor, who told him he had no occasion to answer questions unless he pleased, and if he did it might he taken in evidence against him - no threat or inducement whatever was held out to him; Mr. Peacock said whatever he said might be given in evidence against him, and reminded him of having said, at the Post-office, that he had no money - he said, "Yes, I did, but I have since heard of what has been found;" Mr. Peacock showed him the note produced, and asked if he knew any thing of the writing - he said, "Yes, that is my hand-writing;" he said, "I put it into my master's boot, and I will tell you all about it;" he then said that on Tuesday last, the 19th of April, he was in Fleet-street, about half-past eleven o'clock at night, that he met a female standing at the corner of Crown-court, leading out of Fleet-street, who asked him to give her something to drink, that he did so - they went to a house a few doors down the court, on the right-hand side; that he called for a glass of ale, and she had some brandybitters, and he saw some Bank notes in her hand; that she asked him to write the word "Bank" on them; that he did so on some of them, but he thought not on all, and afterwards she gave him one of the notes for his trouble in writing on them - that that note produced he received from the female, and was one of those he wrote the word "Bank" on - I asked if he knew the woman; he said No. he had never seen her before, nor did he know where she lived - he said when his master called him down on Thursday to attend the Post-office, at the moment he was called he threw the note into the boot - he was asked if he had called for a light from the servant girl, which he denied - he also denied having any note in his hand, or any letter, when the servant brought the light - that was stated to him before he denied it; I asked if he borrowed a pen of the landlady to write on the notes - he said No, the girl went to a house in the court to fetch the pen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell him the servant said he had a letter in his hand? A. He had heard her evidence stated before the Magistrate; what the prisoner stated was not taken down, I believe.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q.Nothing was stated to him about what the girl said? A. No; he had heard her evidence given.</p>
               <p>MR. MARK BEECHAM PEACOCK. I am solicitor to the Post-office. I have heard Tyrrell's evidence - his account of what the prisoner said is correct; I did not hear the whole of the statement - I gave him the warning stated, and said nothing to induce him to confess; he was at the Post-office on Wednesday, and went home after that - on the Thursday he was sent for with Mr.

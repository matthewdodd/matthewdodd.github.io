               <p>On the 24th of September, I was employed on the hop duty for the Excise; I was stationed at Vinehall, near Battle, Sussex. On the 24th of September, about seven, I saw the prisoner in company with a person of the name of Cain, and a boy, with five horses loaded with spirits; they came through Vinehall; they were about four gallon casks; there were three on each, three horses, and five each on the two led horses each, they were slung across; I applied to Mr. Pudsey, the officer; we pursued them on the road; we thought it was the most likely to meet with them; Pudsey and me, and another, pursued them: Pudsey was the established officer of the Excise; we came to the place called Berwash Weald, which we thought a likely road for them to take; we had not been there some few minutes, before we saw some people stand in the road, at a little distance; we came up with the prisoner and his companions; upon sight of us, they immediately rode away, and left their two led horses, with five tubs each, and by some means, drove off four more: they rode off with the other two horses; the prisoner was certainly one of the persons; I knew him by name before, but not by sight; I am positive he was one of them; Mr. Pudsey, the other officer, pursued them, and I stepped back to take charge of what was left in the road; they might be gone four or five minutes, and they returned with one horse, and one cask more; then for the better taking the things they were down in the road; we took the horses and goods to the stable in Berwash Weald, to the stable of the publick-house called the Weald; we had not been there more than ten or twelve minutes before the prisoner and the other men appeared in sight, about twenty roods from the Weald, and sat on their horses, and used very harsh language, and swore that we should not take it away; at last, the person that was along with the prisoner, called to Mr. Pudsey by his name, to know if he would give him any thing to drink, and he told him if he came back and behaved himself quietly he would give him a glass; they came back within a few roods of the house, and we gave the other man a glass of geneva and some beer; he was there, so that we had an opportunity of observing them; after we were coming away with the things, they began to use very violent means; they concluded, when we were coming out of the stable, to join together, and not suffer us to take them away; they swore they would be true to each other, and not suffer us to take it away; the other person that is not in custody, said, let us stand true to each other, and not suffer them to take it away; the prisoner consented to it, and I believe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100089"></xptr>there were hands shook to the bargain, but I cannot say I saw that; then they both rode into the yard immediately before the door; they kept the door, and swore we should not come out with the horses nor the goods, and kept us, I suppose, for the space of an hour; and after, as we were standing at the door, desiring them to keep themselves quiet, they struck at the doorway, and broke off the top.</p>
               <p>Who did they appear to strike at? - At us, it appeared to be; they swore they would beat our brains out, and kept beating and aiming blows, which fell on the door; they were at that time on horseback; Mr. Pudsey and us advised with each other; I thought it prudent to get more assistance; I went out of the back-door; there were two doors in the stable; I went the back way to Berwash town; no officer was at home; the landlord came, and I desired the constable to come; and when we came back it was very quiet; the prisoner, I found, was shot; I found Mr. Pudsey and the prisoner; the prisoner's hand was very much in blood, and bound up with something, that I suppose, they had found in the house; the goods were then in the stable.</p>
               <p>Did you hear in the presence of the prisoner, what had happened while you was gone? - I cannot say I did.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer of Excise at Battle; I had information the 24th of September last, of five horses loaded with tubs of about four gallons each, of brandy, rum, or geneva; I looked upon it to be prohibited goods; I went in pursuit with Mr. Venis, in order to meet with them; at about nine in the morning, we came to Berwash Weald, and went across the country to meet them; I went to the publick-house, and called for one pot of beer; the landlord is here; we did not stop there but a few minutes; there were two people going in the road; I said we will go forward; we went forward; when we had got a very little distance from the Weald, I saw the prisoner and another, and a boy, all standing still on the road: we made what haste we could to come up with the smugglers; they seeing us come after them, made what haste they could away, and left two horses, with five tubs upon each of them; I put them into the possession of Mr. Venis, and we went on after them; there were four tubs more thrown off from their horses, and further, we came up with a horse and a lad upon it; the lad jumped off and ran away; I did not see them drop them; the prisoner and the other person were half a mile on the road, as hard as they could gallop; I could see them at a distance; I thought it was prudent to return back with what we had seized; we took it to Berwash, to put the horses and goods into the stable, in order to load these tubs, that we might convey them to Battle; we had not been there long, before the prisoner and another came back, with clubs in their hands, the knobs of them as large as my hand, and the other a large walking-stick, like a large long whip-stick, with a head to it; they had no tubs with them when they came, they seemed to be angry a little or so; but, however, one of them got off his horse, as we had tapped one of the tubs, in order to prove the seizure, (which is a very good way, and I always will when I can;) one of them said (that was the other man), he said he would have a soak; he went out again; we did not apprehend any danger as for rescuing them; we got the horses, thinking to come away immediately; one horse was at the door with five tubs upon him; Venis was on horse-back, I was telling him to bring the tubs along, when the other man levelled the large club at my head; I was not apprehensive of any danger; the other had been an officer; says he, take care, upon which I turned my head, and escaped it; then from that, there were some words, and they seemed to be very angry, and I thought it was likely to be a piece of work; and the prisoner said, if the other had half the heart he had, they would not have rode for it at first;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100090"></xptr>and he said something, I could not tell what, but immediately after that, he d - d his heart and his limbs, that they would stand true to each other, and take the goods from us.</p>

               <p>Court. Which of them did that? - I saw both of them shake hands to each other; they bound themselves as true as man could do with words and oaths, in taking the goods from us as soon as they could; the people got round, I think twenty or thirty in all; I said to Venis, the best way is, to get the horse into the stable again, as they seem to raise upon us; he had that horse into the stable; upon that they both rode up; the boy rode up to the door; it was opened, and I stood with a pistol in my hand, desiring them to keep off, or actually I would fire upon them; then I reasoned with them, told, them of the impropriety of their conduct, and the consequence that would follow probably, if they did rescue the goods; I told them if they did, it would be the worst job they ever did in their lives, and they should not if I could prevent it; they had large sticks, and they came up to the door, and the prisoner put his stick under the door; whether he meant to hurt me or not, I cannot say; I caught hold of his stick, and we pulled it away from him; they still continued their attacks, riding up close to the door; then they said they would have a grey horse, and have him turned out; then I told them I could not, nor would not; after that, the other person that was with them, opened his breast, and d - d me, and bid me shoot; I sent Venis to Berwash Weald to procure assistance; the prisoner and the other still kept on, they would have the horse; I pointed my pistol, and turned to shoot at them several times; it took no impression upon them; then we shut the door, thinking they would disperse; we set a person against it, and pressed against it, that they should not break it open; we pulled another stick from them, which is larger then commonly people ride with; the other that is not in custody, went to put up his stick; they got larger sticks, and came back and made a second attack at the door; the prisoner was so daring, he came and opened his mouth, and d - d me, and bade me fire into his mouth; they continued their offence for some time; this continued for two hours and more.</p>
               <p>What number of men were there around you? - I can say twenty with safety; but there were some women and children, I did not count them, and others that seemed to assist; they attempted very much to break the door open; I still threatened that I would fire if they did not desist and go about their business; and reasoned with them as well as I could, and the consequence of it. The prisoner said there is a back door, and he swore he would be in at the back door: me and the other officer were against that door, holding it very fast. I stepped up close to the door, and he was some little way off; I says to him, my friend, keep off, or I will fire my pistol; and he came forward; I walked backward. The back door was open, and he was coming in resolute; I said to him, if you do come any further, by God I will fire; with that I cocked my pistol, and the pistol did go off: there was a man hung in his head a little; I loaded my pistol directly. No others approached.</p>
               <p>Where did you wound this man? - In the left hand; the ball went through his wrist, and broke a button on his breast, which providentially did not enter his body, or else it would have killed him. When I opened the door, they were all fled: his accomplice said, I would shoot you through the body, if I had a pistol, I sent to the landlord before that, to get a peace officer.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that the prisoner is the man that was with the goods? - I am quite confident and positive that he is the man that I saw with the goods; I am quite confident he is the man that opened his mouth, and desired me to fire. After that they were pretty quiet and peaceable; the prisoner came and said, Mr. Pudsey, you have killed me; I cannot do you any hurt, and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178812100091"></xptr>hope I shall die in peace. I said, I hope I have not killed you, but if you are killed, I hope you will die in peace.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You received no blow from these people? - I received no blow.</p>
               <p>You was very safe in the stable, and they all round? - I was not safe.</p>
               <p>The goods were in the stable at the same time, and never removed by any body? - I would not suffer them to come in.</p>
               <p>You meant to stay some time at this place? - We were going away, and they drove us back into the stable.</p>
               <p>How long might this poor man be confined by the shot through his arm? - I really cannot say how long; I never saw him from that time till now.</p>
               <p>He never has had the use of his arm since? - No, nor never will, I am afraid.</p>
               <p>He had not attempted to strike you? - He had attempted, by pushing a stick under the door; the door, I believe, at that time, was open.</p>
               <p>He could not hurt you: then he had done nothing before he pushed the stick under the door? - No.</p>
               <p>Court. When the man came to the back-door, you say he had a stick in his hand? - He had. I bade him go again and again; he kept advancing all the time towards me, till I fired at him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 54). On 1st July I was with Dunnaway on Tower-hill, in plain clothes—I saw the prisoners, and followed them, having known them previously—they were following the prosecutor, and were both close together; I had seen them together ten minutes before that—Pearce put his hand in the prosecutor's pocket and took out a handkerchief, which he put into his pocket—Green was by his side, looking towards the prosecutor, and must have seen him do it—Pearce then went to a fruit stall, and Green went on and followed the gentleman—I laid hold of Pearce, and asked him to give me the handkerchief; he shuffled away and said, "What handkerchief"—I threw him down and took it from his pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman</hi>), I was with Townsend, and saw the prisoners together—Green put his right hand in the gentleman's left hand coat pocket; and then Pearce put his hand into the same pocket and drew out a handkerchief—I said to Townsend, "He has got it," and went and spoke to the prosecutor—I afterwards took Green, and told him I wanted him for being concerned with another one in picking a gentleman's pocket—he said, "You are mistaken," and looking over his shoulder at Pearce, who had been taken, said, "I do not know him"—I had been watching them for an hour.</p>

I was on duty on the 5th of August, on the Regent's Canal-bridge at half-past twelve o'clock at night—Richard Pope and others are coal-merchants, and have barges on the canal—I saw the prisoner on one of their barges going up the basin—I was at<lb></lb>tracted by his whistling and singing up the canal—I went on the bridge, and saw him throw the coals out of the barge, some on the towing-path, and some into the plantation—he then went on the towing-path, and threw the coals from there into the plantation, where they would not be so public—as I could not get down the bank at that place, and knowing him, I went and reported the circumstance, and watched the coals till two o'clock in the morning—another officer then came and relieved me—I took the prisoner in the Hampstead-road—I told him I wanted him for some coals that I saw him throw out of a barge—he said, "I am sure I did not throw any out"—I said, "I am sure you did"—he then burst out crying—there were 56lbs. of coals—this is a navigable canal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, of 20, Cullum-street, City—I was on the Custom-house quay on the night of 10th July—I am not certain as to the time—there was a rowing match going on—I was looking at it—I saw the prisoner there—when I first saw him he was standing on my right hand side, almost at right angles with my body—he took my watch—I did not see him take it—I felt a hand at my pocket—a man pushed against me from the front a minute or two before, to force me back from the edge of the river, to give the other an opportunity to operate on my pocket—I then felt something at my pocket—the prisoner was close to me at the time—I instantly looked down and saw the hand; I could not be mistaken, on account of the colour of his coat—I saw my chain drop and swing, and I saw his hand and arm pass down very rapidly—I instantly ascertained that my watch was gone from the end of my chain—finding it was gone, I seized his arm, and as I looked round I saw it in communication with a hand from behind—I seized the prisoner's arm, but the watch was gone—when I took hold of him, he commenced struggling with me—I said to him, "You vagabond, you have my watch"—I can scarcely say whether he said anything or not, for he commenced kicking and struggling immediately, and threw himself on the ground—there were some roughish people who pushed against me, and in particular the man who had forced me back from the edge of the river—I called for help—several tried to hustle the prisoner out of my hands—I forced my hand inside his neck cloth, and took him for some considerable distance before I could give him in custody—it was a gold watch.</p>

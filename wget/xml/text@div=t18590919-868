                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor of this indictment, and am a carpenter and builder of 35, Black heath-hill—the first time I had deal<lb></lb>ings with the prisoner was in the early part of 1857—I filed in the Insolvent Court all the receipts of dealings which I had with the prisoner prior to my insolvency; these are them—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are in the prisoner's writing; I saw him write them all—they are, January, 1857, 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; May 14, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; June 8th, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; August 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d:;</hi> November 28th, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I was obliged in the early part of 1858 to take the Protection Act—I had not had the prisoner's account, but I supposed it was something between 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I scheduled it at 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went through the Insolvent Court—I was a debtor of the prisoner's before I filed my petition—the prisoner made no claim on me after I passed the Court, except a con<lb></lb>versation between us—those 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. are not claimed in these particulars—after I passed through the Insolvent Court, I had fresh dealings with the prisoner, and become again indebted to him somewhere about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he sued me in the County-court, Greenwich, for 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the action came on on 29th June this year—I heard the prisoner sworn and give his evidence; this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in Allen's writing; I received it on 13th November, 1858, for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I paid him in my front office—he came in a cart, which he left with his men at the Horse and Groom public-house next door to me; he said, "I am terribly hard up for money, I have been driving all round the neighbourhood and cannot get any, and I cannot send my men home because I cannot pay them their wages; and if you could let me have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it would do me a very great service to-night"—I said, "Well, I can let you have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I then went up into my bedroom and fetched two sovereigns out of a box where I usually keep my money, and said to him, "Have you a stamp?"—he said "No," and I provided him with this stamp and this piece of paper, with which he wrote this receipt on my desk—I put it on the, file, and went with him to the Horse and Groom to have a glass of ale—on the trial of the action this receipt was delivered to the Judge, who asked the prisoner whether it was his writing; he said "Yes," but that it was for money which he received of me previous to my insolvency"—I had no dealings with him in 1856, nor has he ever claimed to have had any—the question was whether this was 1857 or 1858; he swore in the County-court that it was intended for a 7—I recalled the circumstances to his mind—I said "Allen, this is too bad; if I never had a receipt for this money at all, the circumstances under which I paid it are quite sufficient; you must remember leaving your men at the Horse and Groom and coming to me, and my going there with you; I remained a short time with you and left you there"—upon this his solicitor said, "Now, Allen, this is very positive; did you ever in your life leave your men at the Horse and Groom while you went to Mr. Wood's?"—he said "No; and I wish I may never be suffered to reach home alive if I ever had more than 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; of him in my life"—that was his only answer to</p>

I claimed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. because I feel convinced that I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I am not positive enough to prove where I paid it—in April, having an impression that I had paid him another 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I charged it; that was an experiment to try his honour—I positively swear that all these entries in the ledger were not made at the same time—although my books only show 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I claimed 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I can rely on all that is in my books; I cannot rely on anything that is not in them—Allen said in his evidence that he had been at the Horse and Groom with me on some occasion; he did not say that he had been with me there once, and only once; he said he had been with me there several times—I should say that I have been with him there half-a-dozen times—the attorney's question was not whether he had gone there with me after re<lb></lb>ceiving the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I mean to say that I never had a transaction with Allen before January, 1857; I have never said that I had—I applied for a new trial and was refused; I did not since that go to Allen's house and ask him for time—I did not go to him and offer to pay him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. down and give him a bill at two months for the balance.</p>

I am a surveyor, of High-street, Deptford—I was pre<lb></lb>sent at Greenwich County-court during the trial of Allen <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Wood—a piece of paper was torn from the file by the Judge, which was said to be a receipt for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which the prisoner distinctly said was given by him to Wood in 1857—I saw it in the hands of the Judge and the jury, but not so as to know whether this is it—Wood then asked him if he did not recollect his coming to his house on a Saturday night, and asking him to let him have some money to assist in paying his men—Allen's reply was, "I do not"—he said, "Do you not recollect my giving you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and going from thence into the Horse and Groom?"—he said that he did not; he never was there—Mr. Wood then asked him if he did not recollect his going in with him, he having left his son, or sons, I think, at the Horse and Groom; and he said also, "We had a glass of ale at the bar"—Allen said, "No, I recollect nothing of the kind; I was never there"—Wood said, "Do you</p>

               <p>

(<hi rend="italic">This being ready stated,</hi> "I am not sure whether he denied going to the public-house with Wood or not")—it is very possible that I said so, because I was called suddenly from my business, and did not recollect it, but I have recollected it since—I was not a listener in the Police-court, also—when I received the summons, I knew that I was going to give evidence—I call myself a surveyor; I am also a house-agent—I do not do a little in the law way, certainly not—I am a house-agent, appraiser, surveyor, and undertaker, and I shall be very glad to bury you at any time—I have drawn up a will—I sometimes take cases at the County-court, as agent for an attorney, a friend of mine, who is on the rolls—I am a County-court agent—various constructions may be put upon that term—I do not tout for customers and take them to an attorney—I appear for plaintiff or defendant, to represent that a debt is owing, calling on the plaintiff or defendant to substantiate the case—you may call that doing a little in the law way, I have no objection—Mr. Wood and I have not had a conversation about this prosecution, nor have I and Mr. Dempster, the attorney—I do not know how they came to call me, but Mr. Wood, as a carpenter, has been to me about measuring work—I did not make a note of what Allen said in Court—he said distinctly that it was the receipt he gave in 1857, though I do not recollect the words exactly—I will not venture to swear that his words were not "Before your insolvency;" but I do not recol<lb></lb>lect his saying so—the insolvency was in 1858.</p>

DOYLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you one of the five jurymen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we were all sworn to give our verdict according to the evidence—the jury heard Allen's story, and Wood's story, and found for Allen, less two small amounts, of 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which the Judge ordered to be taken off, as over-charge—the books were produced.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Greenwich; I was one of the Jury on this trial—Allen said that he went to Wood's after some money, to a public-house on the Lewisham-road; and saw this receipt—Allen denied receiving any money, except some for ready money work; none on the account he was sueing on—the trial took some time; there were more than two or three witnesses—Allen said that he went to the Horse and Groom to see his son, and took Wood with him, that Wood had some gin, and Allen had some rum, and they drank together.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you foreman of the Jury? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I paid great attention, but I never expected to hear of it again—I recollect the prisoner stating that he went to the Horse and Groom, but what night it was I cannot tell you—I have known the prisoner between thirty and forty years.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOYLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What has been his character and reputation during that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A very hard-working, industrious, honest man; I never heard the slightest imputation against his character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney—the question I put to Allen was, "Now listen; it has been said on the other side, that after the receipt of this 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you went with the other side to the Horse and Groom, is that true?" he said, "No; I went to the public-house, but I never received the money, and I hope I may never go home alive to my family."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What did he mean as to the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I called his attention to that particular day; Wood said that it was paid on 13th No<lb></lb>vember, 1858, and that he went to the Horse and Groom on the same occasion—Allen admitted that he went to the Horse and Groom on one occasion with his son, and workman, applying for money, but could not get it; but no particular night was mentioned; he could not tell whether it was January or June; but the prosecutor said that it was 13th November—I am the pri<lb></lb>soner's attorney—there are no more jurymen here summoned by me; no more have been summoned either this Session or last.</p>

I am the defendant's son—I remember going with my father and Mills one evening, about November, to the Horse and Groom; I cannot say what month it was; it was last year—we had never been there together before that, or since—we went in a cart—my father left us for the purpose of going to Mr. Wood's; he returned with Wood, and offered him a drop of half and-half to drink, but he said, "No," and had something him<lb></lb>self—Wood left first—my father, and Mills, and I came away together, it may be ten minutes afterwards—Wood was in the public-house with us about ten minutes.</p>

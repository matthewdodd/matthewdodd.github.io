I had an information that the prisoner had stole them. He lives in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch. He was taken up the 23d of July. He would neither acknowledge or deny the taking them. I searched Mrs. Holland's house, but could not find them. After that she sent two of them by a woman who dropp'd them by Mr. Winn's door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't know that woman or what she is talking of.</p>
               <p>Fra. Holland. Here are two gowns I bought of the prisoner (turning to the prisoner) Do you know me, young man?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Yes, I know you keep a bawdy house well enough.</p>
               <p>F. Holland. The prisoner asked me if I would buy two gowns. I told him my husband was in confinement in Ludgate, and I could not spare the money. He said he had them to dispose of for a person who wanted money. He said one would fit me, and the other my daughter; he asked 12 s. for them. I had but 4 s. and 6 d. I gave him that in part of pay. Then I sent my ring, and borrow'd 6 s. upon that, and paid him the remainder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She gave me but half a guinea for them.</p>

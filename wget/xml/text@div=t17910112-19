               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. You have known this woman a great many years? - Yes, I suppose 18 or 20 years.</p>
               <p>You knew her when she lived in the family of Mr. Fonseca? - I did.</p>

               <p>Do you say that gravely now; not so near a relation, I should think, as a father? - No.</p>
               <p>Never understood to be so? - No.</p>
               <p>This woman lived in lodgings of her own till she came to your family? - I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Have you so good a reason for believing it as having visited her at her lodging very often? - I never was there above once or twice.</p>
               <p>How long had she been a nurse to your wife? - About five or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Your wife is an ancient woman, is not she? - Not very young, nor very old; not so old, I suppose, as sixty.</p>
               <p>Upon what terms was this woman invited to come into your family? - I met her; says I, do you know any body that goes out a nursing? she said, yes; for, says I, my wife is very bad; I want a woman of a humane good disposition; I shall be obliged to you; she said, I know a very honest woman; she sent her down; the woman was thick of hearing, and she could not talk to her; she sent her away; in the course of that time she came.</p>
               <p>She did not come with any express invitation of yours? - No, she did not.</p>
               <p>You did not hear her say she was afraid of being arrested? - No, I did not; I thought her as honest a woman as ever God put life into; I thought no more of her than I should have of you, if you had been there.</p>
               <p>Did you ever give her any of the things? - No.</p>

            . I live at Mrs. Hales', in James-street, Covent-garden, and have been servant to Mr. George Henry Robins for eighteen years - I am there all day, but sleep at Mrs. Hales'; Mr. Robins' house is under the Piazza, in the parish of St. Paul, Covent-garden; he has a dwelling-house there - you can go from his auction-room to the dwelling-house without coming out to the Piazza, I believe. On Friday, the 10th of October, I was sitting at breakfast in the auction-room - my business is to keep and protect the goods; ten o'clock is the general hour to view goods - the doors are opened at nine: while I was at breakfast, about nine, the prisoner, who had lived with Mr. Harrison, a <rs id="t18281023-22-viclabel146" type="occupation">pawnbroker</rs>

            . I am in Mr. Robins' employ - there is a private communication from his dwelling-house to the auction-room, without going into the street; he has no partner - the business is always conducted under the name of Messrs. Robins. On the 10th of October I was in the auction-room, about a quarter before nine o'clock, when the prisoner came - I knew him before; I understood he had lived with Mr. Harrison, of Tottenham-court-road; he came in, wished me good morning, and asked Mrs. Kelly for a catalogue and permission to go round the room, to look at the goods for that day's sale; he staid there about a quarter of an hour, and was within the counter, where there was plate, watches, jewellery, and apparel- any person having permission to go behind the counter, could take a watch; we had several watches for that day's sale - I did not observe him do any thing: Mr. Bentley came in about a quarter of an hour, and asked to look at a watch, with the name of Bentley on it - it was not his own; I gave him leave to go behind the counter, and told him it was on the last nail, but when he went round it was gone - I am certain it was there when the prisoner was there. I went out with the officer to give information, and when I came back I heard another watch was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you remain in the room the whole quarter of an hour the prisoner was there? A. I did - my attention was not directed to him, for I was busy sweeping the room; we seldom lose property - Bentley is not here: I had no knowledge of the loss till he informed me it was not there; any body who we know to be respectable we allow to go round and see the goods: there is a Mr. Henry Robins - he sells, but is not a partner; Mr. Edmund Robins also sells - they are cousins; I only know they are not partners from what Mr. George Henry Robins said at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. From all appearance in the business, they participate with him in the disposal of property? A. Yes; many of the catalogues are in the name of George Henry Robins, and some as Messrs. - the principal of them are in the name of George Henry Robins only, and the advertisements also - I have no means of knowing whether the cousins have an interest in the business.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What age are these gentlemen? A. Mr. Henry is thirty-two; Mr. Edmond lives in the house with George Henry - I know nothing of their arrangement except what Mr. George Henry stated at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know who the dwelling-house belongs to? A. The whole premises belong to Mr. George Henry - I always understood so; and have seen the receipts for the rent in his name alone.</p>

I live with Mr. Joseph Harrison, of Tottenham-court-road - the prisoner was in his service, and left about six months ago. I delivered two gold watches to Mr. Robins' porter on Tuesday or Wednesday, the 7th or 8th of October, with a great deal of other property, at our house - they were Mr. Harrison's property, and worth 25l. together; there was a seal to them - I should know them again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you happen to know that Mr. George Henry Robins lives at Turnham-green? A. That is his country-house, but he lives on the premises at times- the whole of the goods in the sale that day were Mr. Harrison's; I had a catalogue - it described the property to be sold by Messrs. Robins; it was unredeemed pledges.</p>

            . I live in the Borough. I have two gold watches and a seal, which the prisoner pawned with me, on Friday, the 10th of October, a little after twelve o'clock in the name of John Jones, No. 14, Union-row, Kent-road, for 22l. - I am certain he is the man; I did not know him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know you ought to have two tickets when the property exceeds 10l.? A. I gave three, one for each article; he offered them at first to a young man in our shop - he brought them to me; I said I thought they would do for 20l.: I then went down the shop, and saw the prisoner - he said I had lent him once before 17l. on one of them; I said I did not recollect it, but 15l. was as much as I could lend now: the two watches were offered first, and the seal afterwards. I saw him for about ten minutes, and cannot be mistaken in him; I swear he is the person.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 13th of October, at No. 26, Exeter-street, Strand; he was at home when I went - after searching him I asked if he had any clothes in the room; he said he had, and showed them to me: he showed me a coat, which, from a description I had, I conceived to be the one he wore at the auction-room; I felt in the pocket, and found these two catalogues - they are the catalogues of Messrs. Robins' sale of the 10th of October.</p>

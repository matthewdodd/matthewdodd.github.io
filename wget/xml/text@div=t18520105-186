                  </hi>. I am a silk-manufacturer; I carry on business with my father and brother, at 10, Spital-square. Mason was our foreman for thirteen or fourteen years—he had the management of the work, giving it out, and receiving it in—he had the general superintendence, and down to this time we had confidence in his integrity—on 18th Dec, about the middle of the day, I bad occasion to go up to the place where Mason had a desk, to ask him tone questions about business—he was at his desk, and the lid was resting on bis bead—he immediately closed his desk, and turned round, and I saw he was much confused—I did not intimate to him that I thought there was something irregular, but I came down stairs out of the room where he was—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after that he went to dinner—I communicated to my partners what I had observed, and I went up to the desk where I and seen Mason—I found the desk locked—Mason had one key of it, and we had another—I unlocked it, and found in it these eight pieces of silk—they are worth about 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they are our property, and two or three have tickets on them—we have an engraved form for tickets—I saw this bag in the desk—I locked the desk again, and left the silk and bag as I had found it—Mason came sack from his dinner at the usual time, and he left at half-past 8 in the evening—my brother is the resident partner there—all the per<lb></lb>sons had left when the prisoner left; he was the last person—after he was gone I went to the desk again and found it open, and the silk and bag were gone—I searched about the premises, and came to a place we call the wicket-box, near the toilet—there is a counter before it; that is where the work<lb></lb>people employed out of doors come to et their work—it is like a box at a pawnbroker's—the workpeople receive and take out their work—we do not have weaving done on our premises—Walker was in our employ's a weaver, but she took winding home for some of her family—I found the same bag and silk in that place that I had seen in the desk—I put some marks on the silks, and left the bag and silk in the box where I found it—I communi<lb></lb>cated with the police—next morning I stationed myself with an officer in an empty house, which commanded a view of the entrance to our premises—I saw Mason come about 19 minutes past 8—his usual time of coming was 8; but for some considerable time past he had been nearly half-past 8 before he came—in a few minutes after, I saw Walker come—I still remained where I was, till I saw Walker come out in about ten minutes with this bag and the silk. (<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTIKE</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">here intimated that he was anxious, on the part of Mason, to withdraw his plea; but the</hi>

                  <hi rend="italic">thought the case must pro<lb></lb>ceed</hi>). When Walker came out, I turned to the left and went' away; I did not want to be seen—I saw Mason that morning again after he was in custody—I afterwards went to where Mason lives in Thomas-street, Bethnal-green, with the officer—I found there these twelve yards of satinette, which I believe h off one of the same pieces that was in the desk—Walker Kves in Church-street: she is married.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185201050050"></xptr>
               <p>from the first—Mason's family wove this gauze, nothing else, I believe—Walker wove for us, and the winding was done by some of her family—we have employed her some years; I recollect her seven or eight years—Mason had the general management of our business.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, H</hi> 2). I was spoken to on this matter, and on the morning of 19th Dec. I was in a room nearly opposite the prose<lb></lb>cutor's premises—I saw Mason go in, and shortly after Walker went in and two other women—I then saw Walker come out with this bag, and turn to the left, and before I could get down I lost sight of her—I found her in the Pewter Platter, about 100 yards off—she was sitting down in front of the bar, and this bag by her side; I was in plain clothes—I stopped some time, and then I said to her, "What have you got in that bag?"—she looked at me, and in about a second she said, "That is like your impudence"—I then told her I was a police-sergeant, and I suspected she had stolen property, and she must come with me—she then said it was her work—I took her into custody, and took possession of the bag—it contained the silk now produced—I took her back to the warehouse, and as we were going along she told no the foreman had given it her to take home to her house till he called for it—when I got to the premises I sent for Mason, and told him he was charged with stealing a quantity of silk, the property of his employers—he asked us to let him go back for his hat; but not knowing the premises, and whether there might be a back way out, I refused to let him go—he then said, "You know too much for me"—Walker was there at the time—Mason said some<lb></lb>thing to his master, and he cried, and said he did not know what made him do it, and he said she was not the guilty party—he cried all the way to the station-house.</p>

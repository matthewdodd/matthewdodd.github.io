            . I was at supper at Mr. Stiles's , and some of the company would persuade me there was a noise in the next room; I listened, and presently I heard somebody there, but I would not say so because I would not frighten them. I saw the Prisoner going down stairs, and when he was upon the landing place I threw the candle and candlestick at him, and then I threw a brush after him. I had like to have tumbled over him; there was another fellow with him or I should have taken him sooner, but I was afraid of being knocked o' the head.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is it likely such a boy as I should make such a Man as he is afraid - [The Prisoner was a small lad about 15.]</p>

            . Between 6 and 7 in the evening, I was in the parlour in Mr. Matthews's house over-against Mr. Stiles's, I saw something white lie at the door and took it up, this is the same gown, it was neither dry nor wet.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been to see my friends at Kensington , and as I was coming along I heard a great noise, and at last a cry of stop thief, and they crying out stop thief, I cried out stop thief, but I know nothing of what they say. <rs id="t17440113-9-verdict49" type="verdictDescription">

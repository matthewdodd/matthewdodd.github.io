                  </hi>. I live at No. 34, Webber-street, Blackfriars-road. On Saturday night, 8th Oct., about half past 10 or a quarter to 11 o'clock, I was walking along Oakley-street—I turned into Kynaston-street for a necessary purpose, and while there the prisoner came behind me, put his hand over my mouth and his arms round my neck, and squeezed my neck so tight that I could not speak; I could only make a sort of gurgling noise—he had a companion that came in front of me, and snatched my chain away from my watch, endeavouring to get my watch at the same time, but the swivel gave way, and broke the chain from it—I happened to have an old satin waistcoat on; the pocket had been mended more in one part than another, and the watch had got tight down in the corner, and that saved it—I made an effort to release myself by endeavouring to throw up my legs and fall to the ground; by that the prisoner lost his purchase, and I got my voice so as to sing out, "Murder! Thieves!"—at the same time, I had the presence of mind to catch hold of the prisoner's coat tail—I held him by it till he struck me in the mouth and loosed himself from me, and walked away—I was on my legs in an instant; my hat was off but I never stopped for that—I followed the prisoner, and never lost sight of him—before he had got much more than fifteen yards I caught hold of him—just before I caught hold of him, his companion ran to the left into the Westminster road, and the prisoner was just about starting when I caught hold of his coat—they had both walked together straight out of the street—there was no thoroughfare in the street I was attacked in, and there was no one in the street but myself, the prisoner, and his companion—it was about the middle of Oakley-street where I caught hold of him—there were no persons passing, right or left—there were three or four persons on the pavement opposite, but he had never reached them; in fact, I never lost sight of him—just as I had got hold of him the policeman came up, and I immediately</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185311280141"></xptr>
               <p>charged him with stealing my chain, bat I knew he had not got the chain; the man that ran away had the chain—it was a gold one, worth about two guineas—I am positive the prisoner is the man; there were no others but him and his companion—they walked deliberately out of the street, and I I after them—I was never, at any time, more than ten yards behind him, and from the place of the attack to where I caught hold of his coat was about fifteen yards, or a little more.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, L</hi> 168). On 8th Oct., about a quarter to 11 o'clock at night, I was on duty in Johanna-street Oakley-street, that is, directly opposite Kynaston-street—I saw two persons standing at the end of Charles-street and Johanna-street—I heard a noise behind me; I immediately turned round, and heard some man sing out "Police! Murder!—I made my way towards him, and, as I started, I saw three men come out of Kynaston-street—it was dark down where the noise was—I could not see them when I first heard the noise; they came out of Kynaston-street into Oakley-street—one of those three men was the prosecutor—I hastened down as fast as I could into the street that I saw them come into, and when I got there, the prosecutor had got the prisoner by the flap of his coat, I went up and took him into custody—the prosecutor charged him with assaulting him, and robbing him of a gold curb chain—the prisoner said he did not know anything about it; he did not know what he was talking about; he was merely walking along the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He offered to go to the station, did he not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he said he was willing to go to the station—I found on him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some halfpence, but nothing connected with this charge.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The corner house, then, concealed the last man of the three from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It concealed the whole of them for about a minute; or not so much, for about half a minute, perhaps—I saw two men and the prosecutor come in a direction from the noise—they were just starting into a run; they had not had time to run from where they came—they were hurrying along, all three of them, but not exactly running, or walking—there might be seven or eight yards space between the three—they did not turn into the street, they crossed the road—there were very few other persons in the street at the time, there was a female or two on the opposite side—I heard some female say, "That is not the man"—that was when I had the prisoner in custody—I have ascertained where the prisoner lives, No. 8, Smith-street, Walworth—he was not going in the direction of his home, but the reverse way—I am sure of that.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). I did not see either of the persons who robbed me before I was seized—the first thing that happened to me was the putting the hand over my mouth—that was done by the prisoner from behind; he then put his aim round my neck—he was still behind me; up to that time I had not seen him—I then made a struggle, and fell, and caught hold of the tail of his coat—he then turned and struck me in the mouth, and then I saw him—he got away from me, but was never at any time further from me than I am from his Lordship—it happened close by the gas light—I am rare I saw his features while I had hold of the tail of his coat—I fancy the reason they did not run was because I made such a terrible noise, crying "Murder!" and "Thieves!"—it was the other man who was in front of me; I only caught sight of the prisoner as I fell—I knew nothing at all of him before—I have since heard that his father has been a respectable brewer at Stourbridge.</p>

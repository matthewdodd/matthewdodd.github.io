                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Henry-street, Ken<lb></lb>nington-lane—I have a piece of ground at Battersea. On Sunday, the 12th of December, I saw a hole in the wood-work at the back part of the summer-house—it was big enough for a man to get in—I had seen it safe the Sunday previous—it was fourteen or fifteen inches from the ground—I missed two guns, a drawing-knife, four spoons, a rack-saw, a spade, and a three-pronged table-fork—there was a door to the summer-house, but I left it locked—they could not get in at the windows without breaking the windows, and they were fast.</p>

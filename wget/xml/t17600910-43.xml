               <p>Jos. Sparrow. The prisoner came into my yard and took a shift and a pair of stockings, that I had seen before hanging in the yard to dry.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I never saw her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. This was on the 25th of July, between nine and ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her come into the yard?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. No, I did not, but I saw her when she was in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her take the shift and stockings?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I suppose she took them.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before she came into the yard had you seen the things?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I had seen them about an hour, or an hour and half, before that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were in the yard when she came in?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I am sure they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property were they?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. The shift belong'd to my wife, and the stockings were mine; the prisoner pull'd open the shutter of the window, and put up the sash, and attempted to take a sheet that was there, that I saw very plain, I saw her have hold of it; then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176009100055"></xptr> I asked her what business she had there; then she drawed back. I went and laid hold of her before she got out of the passage; then she dropt the shift and stockings from under her cloak, (produc'd in court, and deposed to) I asked her how she came by them; she would give me no account how she got them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she at any time own how she came by them?</p>
               <p>Sparrow. No, she denied taking them; I charg'd a constable with her, and took her before justice Scott.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said before the justice he found nothing at all upon me.</p>
               <p>Sparrow. I said I found these things upon her.</p>

            . I had been out about my business on saturday the 25th of July at night; when I came home. I was told they had taken a woman, who had taken some cloths from a line; we took the prisoner to the watchhouse, and the next morning, we had her before the justice; going along, we had a great mob of people followed us; we took her into an alehouse, then the mob dispersed, and in the alehouse yard she confess'd she stole the things, and said, she was sorry for what she had done.</p>

               <p>Please you, my lord, I was a little in liquor, I was going to a neighbour's house, I made a mistake, and went into this man's entry; the man came out, and ask'd me, whether I wanted to rob him; I made him a saucy answer and he charg'd the constable with me, and took me before a justice, there he said he found nothing upon me.</p>

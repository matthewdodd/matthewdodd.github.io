               <p>Hinckingorook,</p>
               <p>SIR, - You seem to take a great deal upon yourself about my wife and family, although unknown to me, and now I must tell you, that all future debts she may contract with you, you must allow her to do so on her own account, for I forbid it on my account; do you think I am going to give up to an extravagant and obstinate woman - no, never; and the sooner she applies to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140036"></xptr>parish of Huntingdon the better, as I am here to answer for myself, for I never will send a farthing until she complies with my request; and remember, the parish allowance will not be quite so liberal as my offer is, so, Sir, I think this had better close our correspondence, as there is plenty of things in the apartment to pay that sum - so that if I am troubled with any more letters from you about my wife's troubles, I must return them without any answer - some money will be sent if the papers come signed, and not one single farthing without; I must tell you, that she has had from me for May, June, and July 19l. - now if you are a man of family, I ask you if she ought to starve or not; I think, myself, the best way to settle this, will be for her to apply to the parish, and then I will pay into the hands of the parish what they deem sufficient - I have got copies of all my letters to her respecting what I proposed to allow her, then they, (the parish,) will see whether I wished her to starve or not.</p>
               <p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant, R. TAYLOR,</p>
               <p>SIR, - I have now to request that you will lend no more money to Mrs Taylor, that is to say, on my account - and also that the rent is at her own charge and not mine; I think it proper to give you this notice, after which you cannot call upon me.</p>

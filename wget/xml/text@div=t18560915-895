                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 323). On 10th May I was passing North-terrace, Bethnal-green, about 10 o'clock in the evening, I found a child lying on the ground, dressed pretty comfortably—there were several persons near, it was crying—I took it to the workhouse—it was christened after me, Sarah Papps—it was in a pathway, about thirty yards from the row one way, and fifty yards the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am constable of Bethnal-green Workhouse. On 10th Aug. the last witness brought the child to the workhouse—it appeared to be about a month old; it was warmly dressed in these things I have here—it was taken to the infirmary, and given to a woman who was suckling</p>

               <p>a child—she suckled it for two days, and then she said she had not milk enough for it—it was given to another woman, who partly suckled it, but the milk did not seem to agree with the child—it was removed to the lying-in ward, and fed with milk and arrowroot—it lived there about eight days—I suggested that it should be called after the name of the constable who brought it, that it might be known who brought it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to the house surgeon of Bethnal-green Workhouse. I remember the child, I attended it the last five days before it's death—it died on 26th Aug.—the cause of it's death was the want of proper nourishment; the want of mother's milk—it is very dangerous to take a child of five weeks old from the breast of it's mother—it would be more dangerous than if it had never sucked—in taking it from one breast to another it is very often attended with considerable risk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You do not mean that there are not hundreds of cases in which children of five weeks are taken from the mother, and brought up by hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are generally put to wet nurse—they are frequently brought up by hand, but it is attended with risk—the child might not take to the wet nurse, many hundreds of children do not—I should say if the child had taken to the wet nurse in all probability it would have lived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are there not foods that are sufficiently nourishing to bring a child up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the child's life depends on the nature of the food given to it—children generally will refuse to go to another woman—it is the change that causes it to be dangerous.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. I never saw him before the 2d of September, he came into the house with wine and spirits. I saw him come into the house with wine and spirits in hampers from White and Proctor's.</p>
               <p>Q. How many - A. I think 5, I am certain 4. I was called up to dinner about 4 o'clock, and when I had nearly finished my dinner, I heard the warehouse door open, I came down and saw the prisoner in the warehouse with the hampers close to the door, I saw the pieces of cloth in one of the hampers. I examined the hamper, I found the end of a piece of cloth 20 yards and a half marked with our private mark in my own hand writing. I searched further, and looking into another hamper, I found a second piece of cloth, and in another hamper, a bottle of brandy; there was our private mark in my own hand writing on the second piece of cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of these two pieces of cloth - A. Forty pounds in the whole, I looked at the bottle of brandy. I saw the seal of White and Proctor on the cork.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Q. What share have you in the business - A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there when the prisoner came a second time - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do with the wine he brought last - A. He left it I think in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany him in the cellar - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect whether the goods that first came in were in hampers or flat baskets - A. What I call hampers perhaps you may call flat baskets, two of the hampers that I found the cloth in had partitions.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he leave a hamper or more while you went down in the cellar with him - A. I assisted him down with the first baskets, I was in ill health, I called in a porter from next door.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had come down in your cellar did not he leave the hampers in your warehouse - A. I was in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. The whole of the time in his absence - A. I do not know that I was in any other place, I cannot swear that I was there the whole time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons might have access to that warehouse besides the prisoner and yourself - A. No more than Mr. Milton and the maid servant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bolland. Whether they were hampers or flat baskets, were there two pieces of cloth when he brought them A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sold this cloth to White and Proctor - A. No, nor to the prisoner.</p>

I live at 70, St. John's-street, Clerkenwell, and am a partner in the firm of Whitmee &amp; Co—we are agents for ironmongery—in consequence of some communication from a person who waited on me on 18th December last, I called upon the prisoner in Loughborough-road, Brixton—I saw him—in consequence of what passed there, he called upon me on 22d December at my place of business in St. John-street, and gave me orders for plated goods, cutlery, and ironmongery to the amount of about 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he selected the goods, and gave me the order to supply them—he said that he was a gentleman living on his income as a landowner, at Westhorpe, in Suffolk; that he was living on the monies remitted by his agent, but he should not be able to pay until the middle of January—he said that he had an estate at Westhorpe, and he left it to his agent to manage; that he had at his place at Brixton a bill of exchange which his agent had transmitted him for the sale of hay to a neighbouring farmer, that he would bring that bill, and if we chose we could discount it and give him a cheque for the dif<lb></lb>ference—he brought the bill on Friday the 24th—he was told that the money for the difference could not be given until the bill was approved—this is the bill (<hi rend="italic">This was a bill for</hi> 208<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">dated London,</hi> 18<hi rend="italic">th December, at two months, drawn by W. J. Saunders, and accepted by W. S. Grimwood, payable at Bar-clays', addressed to Mr. William Scott Grimwood, Rookery Farm, Westhorpe, Suffolk, and endorsed "J. Saunders"</hi>)—The prisoner said that he wished the goods to be delivered that same evening (Friday), which was promised—they were not delivered in consequence of information we had learnt concerning him—he was arrested on the Sunday following—I told him that we would submit the bill to our bankers for approval, and in the event of their ap<lb></lb>proving and discounting it, he should receive a cheque for the balance.</p>

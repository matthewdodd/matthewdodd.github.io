                  </hi>. I am a labourer in the employ of the South Western Railway Company, and live at No. 2, Elizabeth-place, Hampton-street, Wandsworth-road; the prisoner is my wife. On Saturday night, 23rd Oct., I came home with her from the public house, about 12 o'clock—I was perfectly sober—my wife was not, she had been drinking—I do not think she knew what she was about—I went into the beer house, which is my landlord's, to tell him I was not going to pay him that week—a friend of mine, named Parsons, was in there—he asked me to drink, and we had a pint of beer each—my wife followed me, and took a seat along with four women that were in there, and partook of part of the beer—the beer shop is within one door of my house—we left the beer shop, and went home, and Parsons was to bring in a pint or pot of beer—when I got in doors I sat down in a chair at the entrance of the kitchen—my wife was standing at the far end, at the other end of the table—I said, I wonder where Parsons is?—she broke out into a passion, making use of some angry words, cursing, and saying, I am d—d if he is coining here, unless his wife comes—I said, Don't you be quarrelsome, don't be disagreeable most likely his wife is in bed and asleep before now, where we ought to be—she still kept on with those words—I said, If you mean to quarrel, you shall not quarrel here; don't disturb the people that have gone to bed—she then stripped up her gown sleeve, put her fist in my face, and said, I defy you, you b, to stop me—from those words I could see she was going to ill use me, and before I could get on my legs, she caught hold of me by the hair <hi rend="italic">of</hi> my head with one hand, and by the throat with the other, trying all she could to choke me—I bit the heel</p>

               <p>of her hand, and she seized the axe, and gave me two wounds, one right across the nose, and one on the bone of the ear—she had pulled me down on the ground, and fell a-top of me, and kept me down—when I receive the two blows, I became insensible for some time—I felt that my face was smothered with blood, which was running into my mouth—I was found lying at the front door, half in and half out—how I got there I cannot say—the witnesses came to my assistance, and took me first to the station, and then to the doctors—I have been attended by Mr. Ayres.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a smith; we reside at No. 1, Anthony street, Elizabeth-place. I went down for a jug of water, and saw the prisoner and her husband down at the foot of the stairs—Mr. Avery was down, and Mrs. Avery was rather on the top, because there was a step—I went and got the water, and went up stairs, and left them in the kitchen—I did not interfere—I saw nothing further till I heard Mr. Avery call Murder! and saw him half in and half out of the door, with his head and face cut—when they were on the ground, Mrs. Avery said that Mr. Avery had got her hand in his month, biting it—I was not near enough to see whether that was correct—I cannot say whether she had hold of his hair or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was under him when I said so; and did not you say, "Oh, Mr. Avery, don't?" <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I might have said so—I did not know at the time what position they were in—they have quarrelled before, and she has been out of doors—whether she went out of her own accord, or whether he turned her out, I do not know—I never interfered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You know it very well; why should I be cross with you for not opening the door for me? <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I think you had better hold your tongue; if you wish me to speak, perhaps I may say a great deal more than you may wish.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse clipper, and live at No. 36, Ann-street, Clapham. I went to the prosecutor's house, and saw him lying part in and part out of the doorway, with his head towards the passage—the prisoner was standing in the passage—I asked her if this was her husband; she said, What has that to do with you?—I said, It will have to do with you also, and with that I picked him up—he appeared perfectly senseless; I thought he was dead—I got assistance, and we took him to Mr. Ayres, the surgeon's—a policeman came, and the prisoner was taken into custody I went to the house with the policeman, and found this axe leaning against the end of the house in the garden, near the back kitchen—there was blood on it, and there were marks of blood haying been wiped up where it happened.</p>

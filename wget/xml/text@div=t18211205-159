I live on Bow-common, the prisoner said she could get me a bed, and as soon as I entered the room she wanted eighteen pence to stop. I said I did not want her. I felt her hand about me, felt in my pocket and missed my money. I laid hold of her, two more came up and held me while she got away. I am sure she is the woman. They turned me out of doors. I waited outside, and heard her say she had got the *** thief's tea and money, and she would have a strong cup of tea in the morning. I fetched an officer. I lost some tea, but do not know what my money consisted of.</p>

            . I was fetched to the house, and demanded admission. I found six women in bed. He thought one was the woman, but not speaking positive I sent him away. In about an hour I saw the prisoner tipsy, tossing up with a man; it struck me by the bonnet she wore, that it was one I saw in the bed on the first floor, and I took her, and found two half-crowns, eleven-pence three farthings, two ounces of tea, and some mustard on her. She said a man gave it her, and that she bought the tea at the corner of Plough-street.</p>

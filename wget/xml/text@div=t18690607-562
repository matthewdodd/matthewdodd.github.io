                  </hi>. I am a printer, of 20, Lorraine Road, Wandsworth—in 1867, I was proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">British Lion</hi>, penny weekly Conservative paper, at 275 1/2, Strand—I employed the prisoner 24th June, 1867, to obtain advertisements for the paper, and was to pay him 20 per cent, commission on the amount of the orders—he brought me orders for advertisements on printed forms nearly every week—he from time to time drew the 20 per cent—among other orders he brought me this one of Mr. Benham's, and this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) if his receipt for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I paid him—here are two other orders from Mr. Ross which he brought—one is for six insertions at 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and the other for seven insertions more—he brought me three orders amounting to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 8th August he brought me this order from Mr. Newton, and I paid him the 20 per cent upon it—I have searched for his receipt, but have not found it—he did give, me one—if I had known that these were not the orders of persons advertising, I should not have paid him the commission—he brought me thirty-four or thirty-five orders, and I have only got the money for two of them, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have met the prisoner once or twice since Christmas, but I had no proof in my pocket, and could not give him in charge.</p>

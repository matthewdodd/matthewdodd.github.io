                  </hi>. I keep the Hope public house in Gravel-lane, Southwark. On 4th Jan. the prisoner Willis came, about 11 o'clock in the evening—he called for half a quartern of gin, and gave me a bad shilling—I took it up and saw it was bad—I called my husband's attention to it, and he detained Willis in the house—I went for a constable and saw White—he was a house and a half off—as I passed him I heard him say, "So help me G—he is kept"—I went for the constable, and when I came back I found White and Willis inside our house—they were both given into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I saw Willis give a shilling to my wife on 4th Jan., about 11 o'clock at night—she said it was bad, and handed it to me—I went round the bar, and asked Willis if he had got any more—he said he had not, and then he appeared to be tipsy—I sent my wife for a constable, and White came in in five or six minutes with a female and two young lads—directly White came in I knew him from a former circumstance—he had been in the house before—when he came in he said something to Willis, in an under tone, which I did not hear—I gave them both into custody—at the station White was sitting on a stool near the door, and I noticed something fall between his legs—the officer took it up, it was un<lb></lb>wrapped, and it was a bad half crown.</p>

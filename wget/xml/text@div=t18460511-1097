I am seven years old-if I tell a story I shall go to hell-fire—on the 11th of April I was sitting at our street-door, and saw a man go by me-I thought he was going up stairs to the lodgers, but I saw him afterwards come out of the parlour with one decanter under his arm, and one in his hand—I did not see his hand in his pocket-the decanters were</p>

I am the wife of William Brimson—I was in the back parlour on the 11th of April—I heard the front parlour door shut, and my little girl informed me a man had got our decanters—the prisoner was then three or four doors off—she pointed him out, and I pursued him through a public-house which leads into Baldwin-street—I saw him throw something down near the skittle-ground, and I heard the glass break as he threw it—he was taken and brought back—he had these spoons when he was brought back—he threw down this coat and trowsers—they are my husband's.</p>

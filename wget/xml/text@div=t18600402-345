I reside at Croyland in Lincolnshire, about a mile and a quarter from Mr. Stapley's farm—I know Chesterfield, he is a butcher there—his slaughter-house is close to my place—the place where this meat was dressed adjoins my premises—on 23d December I saw a cow being con<lb></lb>veyed to that place—I saw the cow taken in there—I saw persons dressing that cow—Chesterfield was one of those persons—Stapley was not there while I was there—I saw the hide taken off the cow—the cow appeared in a very bad state of health, and the stench that arose from the carcase was dreadful indeed—I, of course, have seen cattle slaughtered before—when they</p>

                  </hi>. I am a meat salesman in Newgate-market—I did not know Chesterfield prior to this transaction—I never saw him till he was up here—I have had many transactions with him—he has sent meat to my market—on 26th December, about 6 o'clock in the morning, I received, from the Great Northern Railway, a hamper with this label on it in the name of George Stapley, butcher, Croyland—I never had any transactions with such a person—I found the hamper contained three quarters and half a quarter of beef, about 500lbs. with the hamper—on opening the hamper, I saw that it was not a saleable article, and I condemned it as unfit for human food—I reported this to the authorities of the market—the meat was destroyed on the following morning—it was in a very bad state—on 26th February, I received this letter, which I purports to be signed by George Chesterfield.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This was so bad that the moment you opened the hamper you detected it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it has frequently happened in the course of my business that hampers come to me that I am obliged to condemn—this was on 26th December, about 6 o'clock in the morning—I have heard that this was dressed on the 23d—it frequently happens that meat fit to sell in the country becomes unfit to sell when it arrives—we have to condemn meat of the finest quality when killed, because it becomes unfit for human food on the journey up to town—a cow killed on the 23d might be healthy, and yet be unfit for food when it arrived—that occurs frequently, not only to a young man but to persons well experienced.</p>

TINDAL ATKINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose you exercise great vigilance? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, if I am there, and if not the persons there will do it for me—I have had some transactions with Chesterfield before and since this—his consignments have always been of the best quality; this is the only case to the contrary that I know of and I detected it immediately—I am one of Chesterfield's bail.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has he on former occasions sent meat to you in the name of George Stapley? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, never—it would depend on the state of the atmosphere whether meat would become unfit for food on the journey—it was very close at that time—meat slaughtered on the 24th, and arriving on the 26th, if it were in a healthy state when it was killed, would not present the appearance that this meat did.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had much experience in meat? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—supposing this meat not to be in a sound state when killed, by its being packed on the 24th and remaining till the 26th it would get woise—meat quite sound on the 23d or 24th, would not have that appearance on the 26th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am beadle of Newgate-market—I am not appointed inspector—I have had great experience in meat—I have been there twenty-seven years—on the morning of 26th December, I was sent for by Mr. Taylor, and I went and inspected some meat—it was all in the hamper; it had not been unpacked—in my judgment, that meat was decidedly bad, very bad—my opinion was that it was diseased meat, not meat that had become perished in the hamper—very frequently we have meat in the hampers for several days—in my judgment the appearance of this meat had nothing to do with the transit—it was not at all fit for human food.</p>

I wish to know whether there is any truth in the assertion. I have been informed that Mr. Stapley intends trying to get out of it by saying that he did not authorise me to send it to London, which is very false; but I have not seen him myself since, but the van man informs me that he called upon Mr. Stapley for the railway charges at the time, which he paid at once, and asked the vanman if he thought there would be anything more said about it, and if there should be he must not know any<lb></lb>thing. Please to send me your opinion, if there is anything likely to take place. I myself wished him not to have it sent to London at the time.

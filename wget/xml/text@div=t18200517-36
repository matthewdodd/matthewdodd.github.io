            . I am a patrol of Portsoken-ward. About two o'clock in the morning the watchman came and told me that two men were loitering about the house, we went across the road and saw them (the prisoner was one), he saw us and they walked away. I got sight of them about five minutes after. They put their hands on the carcase, went away again, and returned in about five minutes - they stood there some little time, I then saw the prisoner put his back under one of the hogs, and carry it off towards Aldgate Church. I went up to him and asked what he was going to do with it? he threw it down and ran off; I never lost sight of him till he was stopped - he had carried it four or five doors from the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in William-street, Cannon-street-road. On the 16th of July I lived in York-street, Commercial-road. I had occasion to move, and employed a man named William Lemon to move my things—among them were two feather beds, two bolsters, six pillows, and nine blankets, which I have missed—the two beds are here—I can speak positively to their being part of the things removed—I never sent the pri<lb></lb>soner to move the things.</p>

                  </hi>. I assisted in carrying these things. The prisoner came up to me, and said, "I am sent by Mr. Sides to move the things"—I said, "Very well"—he said it would be best to have two trucks, it would not take so many journeys—I said, "Very well"—we got one truck, and rolled up the bed, sheet, blanket, and such like things, and took a load away as far as William-street, where I had to get another truck—he said, "By the time you are bringing another load I shall bring back the empty truck"—I never saw him again till at the office.</p>

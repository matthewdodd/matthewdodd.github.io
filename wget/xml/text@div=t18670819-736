               <p>Oxford Street—about the commencement of July I saw the prisoner served by another assistant, to whom he gave a crown—I looked at it and found it was bad—we melted it easily in the gas, and gave the remainder of it to the prisoner, and he left—on 3rd August, between three and five o'clock, he came again—I recognised him—another assistant served him, and after he left I went to the till and found two half-crowns, one very old and very much worn—the figures were scarcely perceptible—that was good—the other was a new one, and was bad—the other assistant took it—the prisoner came again a little after seven o'clock for some more rhubarb—I served him—he gave me a bad shilling—a constable was sent for, and the prisoner was given in charge with the coins—a bad shilling was after<lb></lb>wards found where the prisoner had been standing—it was marked and given to the policeman.</p>

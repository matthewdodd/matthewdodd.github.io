I lost this hat on the 31st of October, in the evening, at about five o'clock; I went and snuffed the candles in the window, and the hat was then hanging up safe. In about ten minutes or so, a man came running in, and said, what have you lost, and after I looked, I told him my black hat was gone; that was the only one of that sort I had in the window. He said don't you disturb yourself, you shall see the hat and the thief in ten minutes, and so I did, for he brought them both back, and that is all I have to say.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 31st of October, I observed the three prisoners in Clare-street, Clare-market; I have a knowledge of them, and suspected them as they were standing together; I saw them separate, and go to a cheesemonger's shop, and from their motions, I could perceive that they wanted to steal some cheese, but they could not succeed. I followed them, and saw them attempting at several shops, until they came to Leather-lane, and then I ran down to Hatton Garden office, to get young Read to come and assist me. When I fetched him, we saw the prisoner Bone, attempt to lift off a box of plumbs from a grocer's door, but he could not succeed. While Bone was at the grocer's shop, the other two were walking up and down outside; we then got them into Ayre-street - hill, to the prosecutor's house; Leeson then went into the shop, and the other two went a little lower down. He had not been in a moment scarcely before he came running out, with something in his hand in front of him; I thought it was no use to let them go any further, and so we apprehended them. Peterkin left the other two, with the hat in his hand; Peterkin soon after put the bonnet out of his hand, and I went back and found it stuck upon the railing, at a door where we took him, and I found Bone walking at the bottom of the hill with Leeson.</p>

            . I saw Leeson go into the shop, and in a moment he ran out down the hill as hard as ever he could, and soon gained the other two, he gained the other two in Warner-street, opposite the public-house; there I saw them hand something, and then they separated; Peterkin went one way, and the other two came towards Ayre-street - hill. We found the hat on the railings.</p>

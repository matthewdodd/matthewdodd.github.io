             sworn. I am a schoolmaster, I live in Tuston street, Westminster; on the 10th of April I bought some goods of Mr. Richards, the prisoner brought them and a bill and receipt, I paid him five pounds, nine shillings, and nine pence.</p>
               <p>(The bill and receipt produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. (read in court) May it please you, my lord, the defendant was employed by Mr. Richards to deliver for him as porter, certain goods and articles, and on the delivering of the same to give a bill and receipt for the same, for five pounds nine shillings and ninepence, which he the said defendant did receive in cash of Mr. Harvey, and the said defendant returned home in order to return the cash to Mr. Richards, when to his great astonishment he could not find the money he had received, but by some accident found he had lost the same, which misfortune prevented him from returning, but the plaintiff immediately procured a warrant and had the defendant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020039"></xptr>taken into custody, the said defendant on account of his confinement was unable to support his family or of paying the said money, and wishing to make some compensation to the defendant for the loss he had sussained, wrote the plaintiff a letter, desiring him to grant him his liberation, and he would repay him by instalments, but instead of that the plaintist has proceded to the utmost rigour of the law; the defendant therefore humbly prays that his innocence will appear in not making away or disposing of the said money, but having lost it by accident, and not with intent of any fraud, or to wrong him of it by any means whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Q.(to prosecutor) What was his character before this happened. - A. I had only been six weeks in business, I saw many people employ him, I had employed him and entrusted him with money before, but not to that amount; he says he lost the money, they said at his lodgings he had not done a stroke of work since.</p>

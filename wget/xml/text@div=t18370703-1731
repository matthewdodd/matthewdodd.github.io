                  </hi>. I am a linen-draper, and live in Parker's row, Dock-head, Bermondsey. The prisoner Powell came to me as shopman on the 2nd of June—he left on Sunday—on the Monday I missed 92 yards of silk, and 26 yards of cloth—I went to No. 1, Ken<lb></lb>nington-lane, and there saw the prisoner Nixon—while we were searching the premises up stairs, Nixon came and told me some of my property was found—it was Powell's house—on going down I saw the property pro<lb></lb>duced by the officer, who is not here to day, and the property is not here—it was mine—it was black silk—nothing else was found.</p>

I occupy the house generally with my brother, we both live in the house; it was under repair. On the 14th of October the house was robbed. I found the prisoner at the West quay of the London Docks, and took him to the watch-house-Shaw searched him.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOPER. I am a carpenter, and was employed to repair the prosecutors' house, the prisoner was employed by me as a <rs id="t18181028-26-deflabel165" type="occupation">journeyman</rs>

               <p>SAMUEL HILL. I am a stone-mason. On the 14th of October I was repairing the prosecutors' door - I went into the yard; I saw the prisoner pass me, and go up stairs, about half-past seven o'clock - He came down in about five minutes, and went out of the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. I had several workmen in the house.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEGG. On the 14th of October I saw the prisoner go up one pair of stairs into the drawing-room, and then into the back drawing-room. I told Frederick Cooper to follow him up stairs, which he did.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK COOPER. I am the son of

            . I saw the prisoner in the prosecutors' back-room on the two pair of stairs, he was at a drawer. I came down, he followed me-while I was telling my brother he left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw him in the room - He came down immediately.</p>
               <p>JOHN SHAW. I am a constable of Aldgate. I searched the prisoner, and found two watches, four guineas, seven 7s. pieces, a 1l. note, and 34s. in silver on him. Next day I went on board a ship, which was bound for America, and got his chest - He claimed the things in it. I found a silver spoon marked IE, which the prosecutors' claimed. I found a memorandum in his pocket of the money which was lost out of the drawer. The ship was to sail in two days.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He said the chest was his</p>

             re-examined. The watch is my brother's, I bought it for him; it has my private mark on it-the spoon is also my brother's. The memorandum of the property which was in my drawer is in my own hand-writing, and was with the property. We hold the lease of the house jointly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The money was my brother's private property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not discharge a man on suspicion of the robbery - A. A man was discharged for stealing lead before the robbery. Nobody had any business in the room; I slept in the room myself. Two drawers were opened, but nine of them had the locks picked-the property was in two drawers. The prisoner had worked a month in the house, but never had any business in that room. I had seen the property about three months before.</p>

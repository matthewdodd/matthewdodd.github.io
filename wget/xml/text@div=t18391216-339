On the 13th of De<lb></lb>cember, about ten minutes before eight o'clock, I was on Tower-hill, and saw the prisoner pass me with a coat over his shoulder, and a paper in his hand like a bill—I saw him turn his eye, and look at me, and suspecting what he had was not his own I followed him, and saw him roll the paper up in his hand, and put it into his pocket—I followed him to Rosemary-lane—he kept looking back at me—I went up, and asked what he had got—he said, "Two bladders of lard"—I said, "Where did you get them?"—he said, "In Thames-street," that he bought them of a hawker—I asked where he worked—he said, "For Mr. Reynolds, in Thames-street"—I asked him to go there with me—he said no, they would know nothing about them—I said, "If you bought it in the street it is a <hi rend="italic">plant</hi> on you; you had no business to buy things in the street"—I took him back to the prosecutor's.</p>

The prisoner has been in their employ eight weeks as porter, and was so at the time in question—I cannot swear to the lard—it is impossible to do so, having no private mark on it—Mr. Reynolds bought a certain quantity of lard on the 1st of November, and when the prisoner was brought to us we counted them, and found two short, but when we open a cask of lard we frequently find bladders short, and blad<lb></lb>ders over—I have found ten over, and I have found two short—we miss two by the number on the invoice.</p>

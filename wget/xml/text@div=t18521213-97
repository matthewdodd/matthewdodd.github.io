                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the first thing you saw? I saw them coming from the mews, and they were quarrelling together—I thought there was something the matter, and I followed them out of the mews to see what was the matter—I was washing some harness, and followed them out of the mews into Harlington-street—I then saw the man hit the woman, and try to get away, and then the woman hit the man again, and then the man threw her down—that all occurred at the same time.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you see any basket? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I first saw the basket after she was picked up—she was in Harlington-street then—it was on her arm, close to where she was knocked down—she was taken from the road on to the pavement—it was on her wrist when she was picked up—I do not know the prisoner; there were not a great many people about at that time; very few at first, but they soon gathered round—I saw the basket on her arm, when she was taken on to the pavement—that was the first time I had seen the basket—she was thrown down in the middle of the road—she was taken from the road to the pavement, and when she got on the pavement I saw the basket on her wrist—as soon as the prisoner had thrown her down he ran away, up Church-street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You heard quarrelling going on, before you saw the woman thrown down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; for about two or three minutes—I was close to them; they passed by me as I was washing the harness—the basket had two handles to it—it was just on her wrist—when she came to her senses I heard her say she had been into a public house, and changed a sovereign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she say when she had changed it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No;</p>

               <p>she said she had been to a public house, and changed a sovereign—she did not say anything about any loss—yes, I think she said she had lost 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say she said she had been to a public house, and changed a sovereign—are you able to speak quite positively to the words she used? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she did not say she had a sovereign in silver—I am quite sure she said she had changed a sovereign; I cannot be mistaken about it—she also said she had lost 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—she did not say who had taken it, she said she had lost it—I am sure she said nothing about its being taken.</p>

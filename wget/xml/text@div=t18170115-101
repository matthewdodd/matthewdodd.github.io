            . I was commander of the Duke of Wellington, East Indiaman, we arrived in the Docks about the middle of July last. On the 20th of July, we began to discharge our cargo, part of which consisted of bandana silk-handkerchiefs; on the second day, we found a chest of bandanas had been broken open. The 21st was Sunday, and on the 22nd we did not work. There were three or four pieces of bandanas remaining in the chest, which were rather damaged by the sea water.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I received information, which made me examine to see if I lost any thing. I had seen the things safe on the night of the 20th; I cannot say, that I had seen the chest before; I cannot swear that it contained bandanas, it was marked bandanas, and had three or four pieces remaining; I have not the least doubt, but that it contained bandanas.</p>
               <p>EZEKIEL BARTLET. I am an officer of the customs; the Duke of Wellington got into Dock, in the month of July, and commenced her delivery on Saturday the 20th, she did not work on the 21st or 22nd. On Tuesday, the 23rd, I was called into the hold by Mr. Warry, who is foreman to the company; he gave me a piece of bandanas which he had found. Soon after the broken chest of bandanas, was brought on dock; there was one side of it raised sufficient to put your fingers in, it appeared to have been plundered; I immediately sent for the superior officer, who examined it. We found it had been robbed, and had only two pieces of bandanas in it, they were damaged; I found some bags of ginger, and temaric in the chest; these things are not usual to be packed in chests.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. The cargo consisted of indigo and other things; the chest was not marked bandanas; they were reported to be bandanas; I do not know what it contained, but from the Company's books, nobody could tell by looking at the outside there were bandanas in it.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN JOHN HOWARD re-examined. I have been in the East India Trade ten years, and have never known temaric, or ginger, to be packed with bandanas.</p>
               <p>JOHN WARRY. I am superintendant to the East India Dock Company. On the 23rd of July, I was in the main hatchway of the Duke of Wellington, about eight o'clock in the morning, I found one piece of bandanas loose, it excited my suspicion; I soon after found another piece between decks, I looked further, and found the chest; I had it hoisted upon deck, there was a corner of it loose; I thought it might have been done by accident; I found eight or nine small bags of ginger and termaric in it, and two pieces of damaged bandanas; these things are never packed with bandanas; I believe the chest had been broken open; the cargo consisted of ginger and other things, some of the ginger was loose, and some in bags.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I cannot say, whether the chest was broken in her voyage, or at home; the bulk is not broken, till the ship comes into Dock; at sea, the hatchways are barred down, and the crew are turned out of the ship before they are broken.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CURTIS. I have known the prisoner, Hatton, twelve years. I have not much knowledge of Murray. On Sunday morning, the 21st of July, Giddons and Hatton came to me; they told me, that they had seen the man belonging to the Docks, who had told them, that there was some bandanas on board the Wellington, which they might easily get at. Hatton then lived at Rotherithe; they saw me at my house, No. 1. Marine Crescent, Bermondsey; I agreed to go with them, on the Sunday evening, to get the handkerchiefs from the Wellington; they told me, that they had got a ladder, which was hid in a potatoe-field, near Bromley Hall-field, which was in the way from the Commercial-road, to Bromley; there is a way from the field, to the East India Docks, by going across the marshes. We went to the field, and took the ladder; Giddons and Hatton were both with me, we got over the wall with the ladder, and then drew it over into the docks, got down the wall on the other side, with the ladder; we then went round to the south-side, where the Wellington lay; we all went into her, and rose the hatchway-bars by a rivet of wood; we went down below, and struck a light; we had a tinderbox and matches with us; we found the wooden case of handkerchiefs, we took them out, and put them in our bags; we cut the cords of the case, and opened it; it was only tied with cords; we easily lifted the head up took out the handkerchiefs, and put them in three bags;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150046"></xptr>we put some gummy bags, and some ginger bags into the case, which were laying in the hold near the case; we brought the handkerchiefs upon deck, replaced the hatch bars, and came to the ladder; Hatton got over first, and carried the bags up, and Giddons lowered them down to him on the other side; we pulled the ladder up, and got down on the other side; we could get across the marshes with the ladder, by laying it across the ditches; we returned the ladder to the potatoe-field; Giddons's wife was at the bottom of Cut-throat-lane, with a cart and horse; we expected to meet her there, it was about a quarter of mile from the Docks. John Gardner, her son, was with her, we put the three bags into the cart; she and her son went across the water, to wait till the cart came round; we three came over London Bridge with the cart, to my house; we found them there; we then lotted the bandanas out into three parcels, they were damaged with, I think, sea-water, there were two hundred and seven pieces in all; we each had sixty-nine pieces; I sold my parcel to a man of the name of Gates. On the Thursday or Friday following, I met Murray at the half-way-house, at the George, Hatton and Giddons were with me at the time; I had never seen Murray before. Hatton gave him 3l., Giddons 3l., and I gave him 4l.; I gave 
               <persName id="t18170115-101-person778">Murray</persName>
             the money myself, nothing was said about what it was for. In the month of September, I saw Murray, at the Green Dragon, at Stepney; I went there, expecting to see him. Giddons and Hatton were both there at the time; there was some conversation about the Wellington-he, Murray, told us, there was a watchman in the Docks now, and that there had been a piece of work, about the robbery of the Duke of Wellington, and that he would let us know, when the watchman was taken off; I gave him 1l. more than the rest, because they had bought the ladder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. I am in custody now in the House of Correction. I have been a thief for five years. Murray was a stranger to me, before this. Giddons and Hatton, both said, the ladder had been hid in the field. I struck the light and helped to take the things out. Hatton held the bag; it was a coarse wrapper bag that I had; each carried his own bag. I do not think the chest was nailed down. I have been admitted as evidence against Giddons and others.</p>
               <p>JOHN GIDDONS. I have known the prisoner, Murray, six years, he was working in the East India Docks in July last. I have known Hatton ten years, he resided at Black-wall. We met about going to see if there was any watch in the docks. We bought a ladder in Mile-end-road together, it was in July - I do not know the day of the month, it was on a Saturday; we gave 1l. for it; we were to give 1l. 1s., but they trusted us a shilling. I do not know the name of the man whom we bought the ladder of; when we got the ladder at night, we went directly to the docks. Hatton and I went by ourselves, it was on a Saturday night, we did nothing there that night; when we came out we put the ladder in the potatoe-field just by Bromley-hall-field. The next morning I and Hatton went to Curtis's house, and told him, we had been to the East India Docks, and that if he would go, there was two bales of bandanas down the hatchway; Murray had told us that the Wellington was in the Docks, and that it had two bales of bandanas in the main-hatchway; he was a labourer in the Docks. We agreed to go in the evening. We went and got the ladder out of the field about ten o'clock at night. We went through the marshes to the Dock-wall. We got over the ditches by the ladder. When we got to the wall, we laid along the bank till all was quiet. We then got over, pulled the ladder over, and got down on the other side; we went round to the ship,(Murray had told me where she lay). We got some hand-spikes and glutted the hatchway and went down. We found the case of bandanas; took them out and put them into three bags. We filled the case full of ginger bags, put the hatchway back again, and got out of the ship, and over the wall; we put the ladder in the field again, and took the things to Cut-throat-lane, and put them into the cart. My wife and son were waiting there with the cart; I told them to come there. I sent them across the river and drove the cart round. I overtook Hatton in the Commercial-road; we went home together. We took the bandanas to Curtis' house. We had about seventy pieces for each ones's share, they were very much damaged with sea water, some were quite rotten. My wife sold some of them to Walker of Deptford - I took them to him myself. I met Murray again, at the latter end of the month, at the half-way-house, in the Commercial-road-Curtis and Hatton were there; Murray came to be paid for the handkerchiefs we got out of the Dock. Hatton and I gave him 3l. each-Curtis gave him 4l., making 10l. in all; Curtis gave him 4l. because we had bought the ladder. After we had robbed the ship, when we were laying the ladder in the field, the man who belonged to the field, asked us what we were doing to his crop; Curtis was with us at the time. We had put the ladder down and were looking for it, to see if it was safe.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. When we met on on the Sunday morning, nothing was said about the cart. It was dark when we got into the ship, we had a tinderbox and dark lanthorn. Curtis was my partner in thieving. My wife went with me to sell Walker the handkerchiefs - I did not sell them all to him; my wife received the money.</p>
               <p>Court. When you was before the magistrate, did you have one of those handkerchiefs round your neck - A. I did, it was one that was taken from the ship.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I worked for Mr. Mann, who is a farmer. Last summer I was mowing the weeds out of the potatoe-field and found a ladder; it did not belong to my master. I took it away, and sold it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Was it July, as near as you can tell - A. The weeds want cutting down about that time; the road parts our field from Bromley-hall-field.</p>
               <p>MR. MANN. I am a farmer at Bromley. I have a field near Bromley-hall field, the road parts it. In July last, I remember two men coming across my field - I asked them what business they had there. I rather think, that the prisoner, Hatton, was one of them - I think I should know the other if I saw him. I think that is the man,(pointing out Giddons from amongst several more) I think it is his voice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Can you swear to either of them - A. By no means. I only say, that I think they were the men. I rode a great way with them. Giddons spoke very sharply to me, his saying so much, makes me think I should know him better than the other; it was day-light. Giddons has remarkable features.</p>
               <p>CAPTAIN JOHN HOWARD re-examined. The property was under my care as owner of the ship.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The moment the ship enters the Dock, she is reported, and considered under the care of the Dock Company. The officer comes on board before we break bulk; she is considered in the hands of the Dock Company. I am still commander of the ship, but I consider the cargo under the direction of the Company, and myself not responsible.</p>
               <p>JOHN PURTON. I was foreman to the Dock Company. Murray was employed under me the whole of July.</p>
               <p>GILMORE. I am an officer. I produce a handkerchief which I took off Giddons's neck, when he was under examination; it is sea damaged. I went to Walker's and found some handkerchiefs which correspond with the one on Giddons's neck. (I produce them.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. If the damage had been done by aqua-fortis, they would be yellow.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HARDING. I am an officer. I apprehended Murray, at the Docks. I went to his house and found some silk handkerchiefs there - They were not damaged.</p>
               <p>Hatton's Defence. They have committed depredations themselves which I know nothing about.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 12th of May last do you remember seeing the prisoner - A. Yes; I saw him in my loft up one pair of stairs; it is on the same floor with my accompting house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner any business in your loft - A. None, whatever. When I came down the lower loft I saw him as it coming from the accompting house; I asked him what he wanted; he made no reply that I could understand. I believe he is a Spanfard. He passed on and went down stairs; I immediately went to the accompting house and missed these ten claspknives; I had seen them there not above five minutes before. I called John Metcalfe, an apprentice of mine, he is no relation, he went and fetched him back. The first place that I saw him afterwards was at the Thames police; the office was by; they took him in there; he delivered the knives up to the boy.</p>
               <p>JOHN METCALFE. Q. Your master bid you go after the prisoner, did he - A. Yes. He overtook the prisoner in Lower Gun-alley, about half a mile from our house; as soon as I spoke to him he immediately gave me the knives; I took the knives before the magistrate; they have been sealed up ever since.</p>
               <p>The property produced and identified.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the knives of a man up in the loft, I gave him five and six-pence for these ten knives; this boy came and over-hauled my pockets; he told me to come along with him; and if I had five hundred knives I would have given them to him sooner than go to a prison.</p>

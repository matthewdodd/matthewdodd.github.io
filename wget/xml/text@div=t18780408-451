                  </hi>. I was formerly a clerk to Messrs. Barnett and Buckler, shorthand writers, of 89, Chancery Lane—in August or September, 1876, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> for a clerk, in consequence of which I went to 1, Victoria Street, where I saw the prisoner Arthur George Newton, who told me he was the managing director of the company, that he only wanted a boy, but that there was a vacancy for an assistant-architect, which would be advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Builder</hi> on the following Saturday, and he offered the vacancy to me—I was to pay 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the company—I saw the advertisement—this is it.

I wrote letters to Arthur George Newton and received these five letters in reply—I know his writing—they are all signed by him—I also received this prospectus.

Arthur George Newton said the company was incorporated under the Joint Stock Companies' Acts, that there were directors, and 1, Victoria Street was where the company's offices were—in consequence of my belief in his statements I executed the agreement of 22nd September, 1876—I also paid him 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on the following Monday the balance, making 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received a letter of allotment in December—the day after I executed the agreement I went wtih Arthur George Newton to Tottenham to see some buildings there—I remained at Victoria Street about two months—I saw no business done—</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). I apprehended the younger pri<lb></lb>soner on 11th January, at 17, art Street, Bloomsbury—a prospectus was put on the door of the Telephone Private Wires Construction Com<lb></lb>pany, and his name—I asked him and he said he was not Arthur George Newton—I told him I should apprehend him for uttering a cheque for 10 guineas—he said, "What a stupid fellow you must have been, I have not left Newton a minute. Didn't you see me speaking to a gentleman at the corner?"—I said, "Yes, come with me and find him"—he began to hurry on—I said, "I can't go so fast, I am too old, I think I have got Mr. Newton"—he asked me if I had a warrant—I said, "No"—we got into a cab to go to the station—on the way he said, "Will How press the charge?"—I said, "That is a matter for How, not for me"—he said that he had securities for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his pocket and he would give Mr. How those if he would not press the charge—he produced an agree<lb></lb>ment between a Mr. Greenwood Atkins and himself and another, from G. H. to A. G. Newton—at the offices in 17, Hart Street, I found me<lb></lb>moranda and papers relating to various companies, and a set of books with no entries in them—I found on him a notice of an appeal from an adjudication in bankruptcy of 18th December, and several writs—I also received from Mrs. Lewis seven cheque books on seven different banks and a pass-book of G. H. Newton on the Imperial Bank—I took the elder prisoner on 28th February, in the Marylebone Road—I asked him if his name was Newton, he said "No"—I said, "I happen to know you, and I have a warrant for your arrest"—I read the warrant, charging him with obtaining 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Waller—he said, "I do not mind that; I expected something much worse than that"—his wife was with him—he passed her some papers—I tried to prevent him, a struggle ensued, and the papers were torn—I collected what I could, but nothing could be made of them</p>

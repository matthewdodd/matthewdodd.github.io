He gave some By-Word and immediately the Prisoner jumped out of the Ditch, and ran a Pistol against my Face. I had no sooner turned myself about, but he snapped his Pistol twice, and damn'd it because it missed Fire. I desired him not to use me ill, for what I had he was welcome to. He then took from me my Hat and Wig, a Rule, a Pair of Compasses, a Socket, and a Pencil. While he was searching me, the Fellow that cut Mr. Peacock came up to me, and on my holding up my Cane to defend myself, he cut it almost asunder with the same Instrument with which he wounded Peacock, and I fell into the Ditch.</p>

               <p>Mr. Mason. It was a hazy Night, but it was Moon-light enough, so that I could see them 50 Yards after they left me.</p>

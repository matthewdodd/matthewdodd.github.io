               <p>Or that if he would not confess, it would be worse for him? - I told him it was incumbent on him to give an account of it.</p>
               <p>Why? - For no reason in the world.</p>
               <p>No threat or promise? - No, I do not recollect I did, he said it had been brought to him the night before by a boy whom they called Dust, he could not recollect what he gave for it, I believe by his account of it, he gave about eleven shillings for it, at first he said he had given a penny a pound which was the price he gave for old lead.</p>
               <p>What does old lead generally sell for a pound? - I do not know, I believe it is worth three halfpence.</p>

               <p>You enquired his character before the house was let to him? - He was recommended to me by the preceding tenant, who always paid his rent very regularly, and I accepted of him as a tenant.</p>
               <p>And the general character that he bore from other people was that of an honest young man? - It had been told me that he was so.</p>
               <p>Had you any reason to doubt of the fairness of his account? - He hesitated about the quantity, probably it might be from ignorance, I believe he gave a fair account of it.</p>

               <p>This lead was stolen off a work shop belonging to Mr. Pultney, in the morning of the 23d the lead was gone, it was on, on the 22d at eight o'clock, when I left the shop, I searched for it the next morning, and by seven or eight a neighbour acquainted me that the prisoner Broderick was carrying two loads of lead, as he supposed to one Davis's, I went and followed him with a third load to Davis's house; when I went there that lead was just turned out of the scale, Broderick was then there, I asked him where he got the lead, he said, he bought it, he hesitated sometime and at last said he bought it of one Dust, which is a nick name; then we took the lead back to the builting and it fitted entirely.</p>

               <p>Where did he say he had it? - I had not time to question him.</p>
               <p>Did not you think it right to question him? - Yes, but I had customers in my shop.</p>
               <p>Have your former dealings with Broderick been in buying of lead? - Only once, which was a very small quantity: having customers in my shop, I could not examine him, but as soon as I was at leisure, I went into the back place and desired: him to let me see the lead, and this gentleman came in and called me, and asked me, if I had not lead offered me, I said yes, I said here is the man, and I said at the same time, I had a suspicion it was stolen by the size of it; I asked him who he bought it off, but they came in so quick he had not time to make me an answer; the prisoner Broderick went into the shop to speak to Mr. Prescot, and said, as he was a young beginner he hoped he would not be hard with him; Mr. Prescot said he made no doubt he would not be hurt, as the gentleman would have his lead again; he then said he had it of one Dust.</p>

               <p>I was the constable that took this party up, on the 23d of August, I saw the lead at the shop, and I followed it from there to the street where it belonged to, I afterwards found Dust, and he said he was sorry for what he had done, he was called out of his bed and should get nothing for it, for the other boy had run away with all the money; I only asked him how he could be guilty of it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Broderick called two Witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

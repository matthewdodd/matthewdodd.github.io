                  </hi>. I am a market-gardener, and live at Merton, in Surrey. On the morning of the 5th of November I gave directions to Hughes, my man, to take my chesnut mare to a meadow belonging to Mr. Milton—I missed it the same evening—she had a short tail, and had a white mark on the face—she was about five years old—I saw her again nine days after I think, in possession of West, at Buntingford, in Hert<lb></lb>fordshire.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, and live at Merton. On the 5th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the mare running about at Merton, in the public read, going towards Lon<lb></lb>don—there was nobody with it—I saw it till it went out of sight—it was running—it was about a mile from the meadow it had been put in—the same road leads to the meadow—about five o'clock the same afternoon I saw her again—I know it was the same mare by a white streak on its face—it was a chesnut mare, and the one the prosecutor has claimed—I have seen it since—when I saw it at five o'clock it was coming in a direction from London, a very little way from the same spot, and the prisoner was running after it—I stopped it—the prisoner came and put a bridle on it, and led it away towards Wimbledon—he said that he knew the owner living at Wimbledon, and he would take her home—Wimbledon also leads towards where the mare was kept—Eyton was with me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

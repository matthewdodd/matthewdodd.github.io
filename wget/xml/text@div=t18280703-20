            . I am constable of St. Sepulchre's without. On the 4th of June, about eight o'clock in the morning, I went to No. 21, Peter-street, to apprehend two prisoners for another robbery; I was searching for the property in the room, and discovered this bundle of clothes - the prisoner was in the room; I asked her who rented the room; she said she did, and had done so for some time - I said, "Whose clothes are these?" she said they were her brother's, and that he was in a school; I asked what school he was in - she hesitated, and said I did not understand her - it was her brother-in-law's son; I said, "What school is he in?" she did not answer, but sat down, and began to cry; I said, "I have no doubt the things are stolen - you must go with me;" she then said, one Charley, a pot-boy, who lived in Holborn twelve months ago, left them with her the night before, and was to call for them that morning; I found the clothes belonged to St.Luke's school; her house is about a quarter of a mile from Noble-street; I went to the prosecutrix, who said she had also lost a black silk gown and apron; I went and saw Millen find the gown and apron in the same room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He took a young woman named Matthews out of my room; the property was not in the room then; it was brought there between the time of his taking her and returning. I mentioned nothing about any school.</p>

The prisoner said the clothes belonged to her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182807030021"></xptr>brother, who was in a school, and then that they belonged to her brother-in-law's son - I am sure she is the woman who claimed them; I cannot say what occurred before I went into the room, but I told her myself that it was very curious that a pot-boy should leave the clothes - she said it was Charley, but before that I heard her say they were her brother's, and then her brother-in-law's son's.</p>

            . I live with my father and mother. - On Wednesday morning, the 4th of June, my father went out at six o'clock - I went out myself at ten minutes after six, and left my mother asleep; I shut my mother's bed-room door after me - it shuts with a latch; I heard it latch: I found the street door standing open - we always leave it open; the latch of the room door has no handle to it - it fastens inside; it cannot be opened outside without a piece of wood being put into a little hole - that lifts it up; I am certain I latched it, and tried it afterwards.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About half-past seven o'clock in the morning I was standing at my street door; that gentleman had taken a young woman out of my room to the watch-house; a lad came up to me, who I knew as a potboy at a public-house in Holborn; he had a bundle under his arm. and said, "Will you let me leave this with you, for I am going into the City, and will return for it?" I said, "I don't know, for I am in a deal of trouble, as a young woman has been taken from my house;" he said he would come for it at half-past four o'clock, whether he came or not I do not know.</p>

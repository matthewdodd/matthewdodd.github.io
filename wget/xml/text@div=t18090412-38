On the 13th of March, about four in the afternoon, I was serving two young women at the further end of the shop; I saw my young man waiting upon the prisoner; between us there was a pile of Irish linens on the counter; I looked over the counter; looking towards the door, I saw the prisoner, who had a little girl with her, move her great coat, I saw her strike her hand against the coat, I had no reason to suspect that she had taken any thing till I saw her going out of the door, then I perceived she had something bulky under her coat; I immediately ran after her; she had passed the next shop. I laid hold of her arm, told her she had got something that did not belong to her; she said she had not; I brought into the middle of the shop a piece of printed cotton, dropped from under her coat on the floor. Shephard came by the door, and took her in custody.</p>

            . On the 13th of March the prisoner came to Mr. Gray's shop; I shewed her several different patterns, but none of them she seemed inclined to purchase; I shewed her a pattern, which she took two yards of, she flung down a guinea; I went to the upper end of the shop to get change; there was a pile of Irish stood between me and her; at that time I suppose the woman must have took the print; she took the two yards of print at three shillings; I gave her eighteen shillings change; she went out of the shop. Mr. Gray went out of the shop and fetched the woman back, and after she got in the middle of the shop, I saw a print drop from under her clothes.</p>

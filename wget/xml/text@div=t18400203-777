               <p>should have entered the money and goods here—here is a soap account, which is not settled—that account began before the 28th of December—the last soap account that was settled was on. the 23rd of November—after he went to prison there was a sum of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. found—that was more than the money that was due from him for the soap he had sold—there was one cwt. of soap, which he had sold for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb., that would come to about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I believe—the soap account was not settled—that and the candle ac<lb></lb>count were kept distinct—they were not entered in the same book—the 10th of January was the first time I had reason to suspect he had done any thing dishonest, and I asked him if Mr. Sargeant had been lately to get candles—he said, "No"—I looked in the book, and found the last entry was in October—I asked the prisoner if he had had any candles since October—he said, "No"—I said, "Are you sure you have made no mistake, and there is no forgetfulness in the matter?"—he said, "Cer<lb></lb>tainly not"—I am certain I asked him if he had received money for can<lb></lb>dles from Mr. Sargeant during the month of December, and he said, "No."</p>

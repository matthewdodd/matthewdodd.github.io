                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Harris, a town carman, of Catharine-wheel-square, Bishopsgate—I know the two prisoners—on 27th Dec. I was near a chapel in Maze-pond, Bermondsey, about half-past two o'clock in the day—I had a van with me—the prisoner Davis came to me—he was carrying some sacks which were put one in another—he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> them in the van—he gave me an order—(I had been ordered to meet him there, by Mr. Harris—I usually stand in Bishopsgate-street)—this is the order—King was with Davis at the time—Davis told me to go to East-lane, Bermondsey<lb></lb>wall—I was to get wheat in the sacks—I went to the wharf, and delivered the order to the foreman—King stopped in Maze-pond—Davis went on with the van and showed me where the place was—after he had shown me the place he said he would go and get me another horse—I gave the order, and got the wheat loaded in the sacks, and then as Davis did not come I drew out with one horse—I saw Davis but he had not got the horse, and he and I went on together till we got to Maze-pond—I saw King, he took me in a public-house to get a drink of beer—Davis said he would mind the van till I came out—we had a pot of beer in the public-house, which King paid for—I remained there with him about five minutes—I left him there, and came out by myself, and my van which I had left with Davis was gone, I looked everywhere for it, and could not see it—I went to King and told him—he said it would not be many minutes before it would be back—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes I saw the van again, and Davis was with it—the wheat was not in it—I asked Davis where he had been with the van—he said, "To the South Eastern Railway"—he paid me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my hire, and I went home—King had come outside of the public-house when the van came back, and I left him with Davis in Maze-pond.</p>

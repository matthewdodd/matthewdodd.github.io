               <p>WILLIAM REEVE. I live in Whitemore-terrace, Hoxton-new-town. On the evening of the 19th of June, I was passing Drury-lane, it was about half-past ten o'clock, when I met the two prisoners; who were strangers to me, they asked me to go with them - they took me into a house in <placeName id="t18330704-27-crimeloc144">Charles-street, Drury-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18330704-27-crimeloc144" type="placeName" value="Charles-street, Drury-lane"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What are you? A. A fancy trimming maker. I was out of employ, and had been out seeking a situation - I had been about the West-end of the town - at five o'clock I sat down with a friend of mine - I had part of a pint of ale at a house - I don't know the sign of it, it was not far from St. Giles' church; that was the only house I had been at - my friend went home - he is in the same line of business I am; I don't know his name - I have seen him several times before; I was sober when I met the prisoners, and all I had with them was a quartern of gin - I laid on the bed in their room - all my things were off, but my drawers - I tucked my watch in the waistband of my drawers, and fastened the chain round the waistband, without making any hole - I gave Harris the shilling to sleep with me, she went away, but Field stopped, and said, it was all as one.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Had you had nothing but the part of the pint of ale and of the gin? A. No; I was not intoxicated, I was affected and fell into a doze - the prisoners partook of the gin after me; I did not see anything put into the gin - I put my watch in the top part of the waistband of my drawers, I then rolled it round and fastened the chain three or four times round - I ran after them the moment I recovered from the blow - I had not my trousers on when I met the policeman - I then went back and put my trousers on.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you any money? A. No; only the fourpence I gave for the gin, and the shilling I gave to Harris.</p>

            . (police-constable, F 149). I live in Short's-gardens, Drury-lane. On the morning of the 19th of June, I was coming down Charles-street, about one o'clock - I saw the two prisoners running in a direction from No. 49 - I went on to No. 49, and saw the prosecutor in the passage, he said, two girls had robbed him of his watch; I told him to come round my beat and see if we could see them, but we could not - I waited till he was dressed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he seem to take it quietly? A. Yes, and I told him so at the time - he waited till I came to the door, and spoke quietly to me - he had no coat or waistcoat on - he looked rather drowsy, and as if he had been drinking in the fore part of the night.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had he his trousers on when you came to the door? A. Yes; but not his coat or waistcoat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Recollect yourself, are you certain about that; A. Yes, he had them on, and I waited till he put on his coat and waistcoat.</p>

             (police-constable, F 69). On the evening of the 19th of June, the prosecutor came to the station-house, and I went with him in search of the prisoners - we met them about ten o'clock in the evening - the prosecutor said, "That is the party;" I told him to go in front of them, and be sure - he said, Harris was one, but he could not be quite sure of the other - I took Harris to the station-house, and the next morning she said she had fetched the gin from the Sun, in Brownlow-street; Field came to look after her, and then the prosecutor said, he was certain of her, and she was taken into custody; she denied it.</p>
               <p>COURT to REEVE. Q. When you went to the door, were your trousers on or off? A. They were off - the policeman is mistaken.</p>

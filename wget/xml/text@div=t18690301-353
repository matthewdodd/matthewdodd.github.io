                  </hi>. On 1st February the prisoner came to our Ware-house—I did not know him before—he brought with him a Fetter, which he took away with him—(<hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY JOHN EASEY</hi>, <hi rend="italic">clerk to the solicitors for the prosecution, proved the service of a notice on the prisoner on Wednesday, in Newgate, to produce this and other documents; it was not produced.</hi>)—I read the letter, and have a distinct recollection of the contents, not verbatim, but substantially—it purported to be written to the prisoner by James Anderson, of Hibbert Street, Everton Road, Liverpool, stating that he had received a largo shipping order for fancy cabinet work, and would thank the prisoner to buy him twenty or thirty bundles of walnut birs, as they are called, that is, veneers from 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, also, ten bundles of plain; both to be good and sound, to be sent off at once, and the amount to be debited to his account—there was a postscript to the effect, "We are told," or, "I am told that they can be bought very cheap at Witt &amp; Wilkinson's place, Rathbone Place"—the letter was addressed to Garner, at the London and North Western Railway—after reading it, I said, "Are you a railway official?"—he said, "Yes," that he had bought veneers for Mr. Anderson for four years, to the extent of some thousands of pounds; that he had a very large manufactory at Hibbert Street—my partner showed him the veneers, which he selected—I knew there was a firm named Anderson in Liverpool, in Bold Street, and we telegraphed to that address—I asked where he had bought the veneers, and he said "From a man in the Hackney Road"—he selected veneers to the amount of 143<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—he asked our terms—I said we usually had cash, or a short bill; if the report of the firm was satisfactory, we would take their short bill—he said he usually drew on that firm at two months—he said the goods were to be delivered at the London and North Western Station—I had my suspicions, and went with the goods to York Road Station—he told me to deliver them there that night, at 5 o'clock—I put the goods in a truck myself—he did not want them to be put in a truck, but I insisted on it—I saw him at the station—when I went back to the warehouse, I found an answer to my telegram; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in consequence of that I went to the railway authorities, and got possession of the goods, and brought them back with me the following morning—they had been removed out of the truck, and put into a van, ready to come away—I saw the prisoner there—I told him not to ask any questions, but I had determined not to let the goods go, unless I went with them—he seemed astonished; he did not say much—I told him that the advice from Liverpool had not been satisfactory—the railway clerk got him to sign an order, or a delivery note, for the goods, and I took possession of them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was the letter dated from? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't swear to that positively—to the best of my knowledge it was Hibbert Street, Liverpool—he gave me the letter open—it was in an envelope, I have no doubt I had the envelope in my hand—I can't swear that it had come through the post; to the best of my recollection it had—he did not say he was in the employment of Messrs. Anderson—he never led me to believe it—he told me he was a railway official—I understood he was a clerk at the goods department, or something of that sort—he did not give me his card—I swear that—I don't recollect his showing it me—I won't swear it—I looked in the Directory—possibly it was his showing me his card, that</p>

               <p>made me do that—I can't swear I did not give his card to the solicitors for the prosecution—he told me that he also had a coal agency—I found in the Directory "W. F. Garner, coal-merchant, depot, London and North Western Railway"—I believed that he was a railway official as well as a coal-merchant—no one was present at our conversation next morning, when I fetched the goods back—he did not say "There are your goods, and you shall take them off the premises"—nothing of the kind—he said he had not sent them up—I was very peremptory with him—he said it would make no difference to him—I parted, with the goods on the faith that they were ordered by Anderson of Liverpool—I did not send the goods away before I sent off the telegram—I did before I sent one telegram, but I sent two—I let him have the goods, believing that he was commissioned by Ander<lb></lb>son to buy them—the van in which the goods came, belonged to a carter named Baker—I did not know that the goods could not be sent to Liver-pool from that station—we had some difficulty in getting a truck to put them in at first—I let him have the goods on the strength of the letter and his representations to me, which seemed highly probable, and the letter being addressed to the "London and North Western Railway"—not station—the word "station" was not on it—I took particular notice of that.</p>

               <p>that is his writing; that is all I con say—I have not got any of his signatures here—I have seen him write perhaps once a week, nothing but his signature—he had a clerk once, but not at that station—the prisoner pays 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a ton on all coal that he has—he has a considerable quantity, not every week, sometimes five or six trucks at a time, sometimes more—a truck holds eight or nine tons—he has been there about ten or twelre months, carrying on business as a coal merchant—I produced some of his writing at the Police Court—I have not got it here.</p>

               <p>"Your trunk is safe enough for what I know;" in a few days I went again, with a friend, and saw the prisoner - I said,</p>
               <p>"Can I get my things?" he said,</p>
               <p>"No, pay me what you owe me;" he said there was 12s. 6d. due - I said,</p>
               <p>"You shall get your money before I remove my goods; but I wish to see if my things are all safe;" he said he would not let me see my things till I paid the money; I went again with a porter, and paid the prisoner's wife the money - she then took a key, and opened the door: I saw my trunk broken open, standing on two chests, and the articles stated were gone from it; the pocket-book, which had contained the duplicates and a promissory note, was laying on the trunk - the prisoner came in while I was there, and I said to him,</p>
               <p>"I have been robbed - what a cruel thing it is;" he and his boy then bundled out my things on the pavement; I then taxed Mrs. Abercromble with stealing my property - she said, in the prisoner's presence, that she had not stolen it, but she knew who had; I have never found my property; I have searched respecting the property to which the duplicates had belonged, and some of them had been taken out of pledge.</p>
               <p>GEORGE STEVENS. I am a messenger at the King's Bench. I was employed by one Gonnell to go and put the prosecutrix on board of a steam-packet, on the 21st of June; when I went to the prisoner's house I saw a person, who I believe was Mrs. Abercrombie - she refused to let her take any thing away, because the rent was not paid; after some conversation they agreed that I should take a trunk away provided I lent her 5s.; after they had settled, and parted friends, the prosecutrix opened a trunk full of woman's apparel, and said there were papers in it of value, and wished them to take care of it, which they promised they would do.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not they tell her they had no more room? A. No - I heard her say they were welcome to make use of any of her clothes, if they would take care of her trunk; I did not hear them say they must put it into the kitchen.</p>

            . I work with a coal-waggon. On the 9th of December Mrs. Petrie asked me, between three and four o'clock, to help her move some goods from Mr. Abercrombie's; we went there, and saw Mrs. Abercrombie; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180024"></xptr>moved a tub and some other things, and the prisoner came in - I saw Mrs. Petrie pay some money; the door of the room was then opened - I saw a trunk and some chests; the trunk had been forced open and the hasp broken off; there was a few clothes in the trunk; the underneath chest was wet with the potatoes.</p>
               <p>MARIA PETRIE. I am the prosecutrix's niece - I lived with her at the prisoner's house; I know she had these things.</p>
               <p>BOYD SILVESTER. I took the prisoner on a warrant - he said he had stolen none of the things; there were some things there, but she had them when she came for them - he said there had been 17s. 6d. owing, and he had received 5s. before she went; he said he could not be accountable for these things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he say he did not know what she had left? A. Yes, but believed what she left she got.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney-at-law, and live on Fish-street-hill, The prisoner was in my service—I perceive by the Law list that he has been an attorney himself—I agreed to pay him after the rate of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, but as he conducted himself well the first fortnight, I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—(in consequence of an application from him I advanced him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he came into my service on the same day)—I received a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Peering and Mincett, late in the evening of the 7th of November—I placed it, with other cheques and bills, in my private iron chest, and locked it when I went away at night—it stood in my private room—the clerks had a right to go into the room for papers—it was my practice to open the chest in the morning, and unless I was going out for any length of time I left it open-no clerk had any right to go to my iron safe without my special directions—I had never directed the prisoner to go to it for this cheque—I did not examine my drawer till the afternoon of November 8th, and then I missed the cheque—I might have been fifteen or twenty minutes absent from my room on that day—my name is written on the back of the cheque, but it is in the prisoner's hand-writing—the prisoner was not at the office then—he had been there part of that day—I find by the book he had received in advance 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

               <p>the cheque out while I was there or not, but I never authorized you to take it out at all-your general authority was the law business of my office, and no other—the key of the iron safe was in it the whole of the day—the cheque was shut in the drawer—I am quite confident of that—it would have been a breach of trust for you to have taken cash out for office disbursements, without my special direction-you did not return the fol<lb></lb>lowing day—when you returned on the Saturday, I reproached you for your absence—I accused you of taking the cheque, and ordered you to make up your book—I do not recollect observing that I required all cheques to go through my bankers—I may have done it—I objected to your taking any thing out of my private drawers—I have got my letter book—I have no doubt there are many letters signed by you, of which I had no cognizance, but I saw them, and permitted them to go out in your hand-writing-you were managing clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing that I came to my duties on Monday, the 12th of November, would you ever have prosecuted? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If I had ex<lb></lb>amined and closely investigated your book, I should have followed up this prosecution-you have introduced two clients, one I have seen, the other I have not—I do not know whether they are clients or not—there was a policeman in the office when you returned, for some other purpose—I then taxed you with having robbed me to a considerable extent, and told the policeman to take note of it—I believe I requested you to call on the morrow, and you did, and having closely investigated your book, and seen a great waste of my money, I had you taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you were in the country did you leave your key? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I took it with me—no one would have had any authority to go to the safe.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Have I not to your knowledge, without your special permission, gone to the iron safe, and taken out deeds? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not aware that any one deed was taken oat without my special direction—I am not aware that I specially mentioned that you were not to go to my iron safe, but I stated that it was my private depository—the 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was entered, but not till after I had taxed him with the robbery—he did not return to the office till late on Saturday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the clerks in the London and Westminster bank. This is our cheque—we paid it—the cashier is not here, but I have his book to prove it has been paid, and charged to James Atkins and Son, who are customers of ours.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. Under any circumstances I should feel extreme diffi<lb></lb>culty in addressing a Court in the humiliating position I am in-from his lordship's hands I expect every thing that justice can give, and from your hands, every consideration it deserves; be your verdict guilty or not, it is to me equally indifferent. If guilty, I shall receive it with that deep humility which I ought to feel: if not guilty, I shall leave this bar with the painful reflection that I have been here a criminal, which is to me the same as guilty. I avail myself of this occasion publicly to thank the prosecutor for the clemency he showed to me during the short time I was with him. I do not say this with any desire that he should recommend me to mercy, nor do I beg his Lordship to abate one <hi rend="italic">iota</hi> of the punishment due to me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183811260042"></xptr>
               <p>There are those in Court whom I know, and who would willingly have rendered me their assistance, but I would not accept of it; I only wish you to decide on the facts of the case, and if you consider that in this transaction I intended to injure or defraud Mr. Shaw, find me guilty; if you think, on the other hand; I did not premeditate an injury to him, your verdict will be, not guilty; but knowing the indictment is not true, I would not plead guilty; having done the prosecutor right, I feel I ought not to do myself wrong; and before Heaven I declare, I meant not to injure Mr. Shaw. The charge is, that I took out of his iron safe a cheque for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; when I entered into the employ I entered as confidential clerk, as one acting for him, and under all circumstances as he would have done if present; on many occasions I went to the iron safe, and very frequently while he was in the office, and he never at all objected to my doing so.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLES SHAW</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> This was on the 8th? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and it was paid the same day, which was Thursday—on Friday he did not come—he came on Saturday—I charged him with having taken the cheque out of my safe—he looked confused, and admitted he had taken it, and then it was put down-all the receipts were me, and for office purposes he had a cheque marked "Office"—that was my invariable rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. Some observation has been made with reference to the time I made the insertion in the cash-book—I declare most solemnly that every evening when at the office, I made it up, and therefore I do not mean that Mr. Shaw intentionally says wrong in saying that it was not made up from the Saturday before, but it is wrong—I could not make the entry before I received it, and when I returned on the Saturday I entered it—the only observation Mr. Shaw made was in consequence of my making an obser<lb></lb>vation to him about two or three days before—I had made out the costs in a particular; action, and when I came on Saturday the 3rd, I asked him if the costs had been paid—the answer he gave was that they had been paid by cheque, and that that cheque was in his iron-safe—he went out in the course of the morning—on the 8th I had no money for disbursements at the Temple where I had to go—it was imperative that the business should be done, and I thought I could properly take it—I went and took it out, it was only over London-bridge a few steps, and I got it—I went to the Temple, and that is the head and front of my offending, no more-out of little things you may make great deductions—when I returned to the office, Mr. Shaw objected to my absence, very properly—I had been out—he looked over my book, and said there was a balance due to him—I said "Yes," and implored him to let me come to his office again—he said he would hot—I must, next morning, make up the balance due—I said I would do all I could—he said, "Call to-morrow morning," and he said to the policeman, "I shall give him into custody unless he brings the money to-morrow morning"—I said I was conscious I had not contemplated any injury, and I did return—that is all I can say—I am sure you will give the case that consideration it deserves, and ask yourselves whether I could intentionally have contemplated a fraud.</p>

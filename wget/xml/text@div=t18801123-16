I keep the Gunmakers' Arms, Canal Road, Mile End—on 15th October, at midnight, I served the prisoner with a pint of ale; she gave me a shilling, good, and I gave her the change—another woman was with her—two men then came in and said to the prisoner "Are you going to stand anything?"—she then called for another pint, and tendered a good sixpence—I gave her three-pence change each time—another woman then came in and asked for three pennyworth of rum hot, and tendered a half-crown—I gave her 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—they all five drank together—the lost woman went out first, and as the prisoner called for a quartern of rum in a bottle the men left—the prisoner gave me a half-crown, and I said "This is a bad one"—she said "Oh, it is all right"—I then went to the till and found the other half-crown was bad also—I gave them to the police and charged the prisoner.</p>

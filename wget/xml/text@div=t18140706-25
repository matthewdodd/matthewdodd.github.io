On Tuesday the 14th of June, the two prisoners came to Mr. Simpson's warehouse, about a quarter past six in the evening; they told me they wanted cambrics.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they speak English - A. I do not think they can speak English at all. I took them into the cambric warehouse, and shewed them fine French cambrics; they looked at several pieces. I opened three or four papers for them, each paper containing twenty-five pieces. After five or ten minutes, they looked at the same pieces again, putting the goods behind them, and slipping over packs; they laid them behind them. I then thought they were after thieving them. I waited a little while. I saw Boas attempt to put a piece under his coat. Boas had got part of a piece off the counter; he then saw I was looking at him; he put it back. A short time after that, Rochatz got further from me, took his place, and while I was talking with Boas, I heard five pieces fall off the counter; I then said, you will spoil all the goods. They both appeared very much agitated. My brother was with me; I told him I thought they were after thieving, and desired him to watch. I began to talk with Rochatz; he took out of his pocket a paper. I thought he wanted to take the numbers and prices. I told the porter to fetch him a pencil. While he was gone, Boas came near me; the other took his place. I was in a narrow place. Boas opened a piece of muslin, held it up before me, began talking about the width,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181407060015"></xptr>saying six quarters; he held it five minutes up; that made me suspect the other man was secreting something; it was impossible for me to see without rising upon my toe. I looked over the muslin, and saw part of a piece of muslin under Rochatz's coat. I immediately thrusted by Boas, and as I got to Rochatz, he turned round; I got hold of him, and pulled the piece of muslin from under his coat; I pulled it out, and threw it on the counter. I hallooed to my brother, and the porter to fetch Mr.

               <p>Q. I believe you are not able to say which piece it was - A. I am not. I can swear it was the one the constable has, or this. I should have no doubt only in their putting the muslin back, they put it out of fold. I afterwards found another piece rumpled. I cannot be sure whether it might not be the other. They are both muslin.</p>

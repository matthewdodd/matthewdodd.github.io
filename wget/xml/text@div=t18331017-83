               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written). Peculiar and pressing involvements so entangled me at the time of this unhappy occurrence, that I confess with shame, my having, in the first instance, contemplated the paltry theft of which I am now accused, and for this purpose, having removed the sheet from the bed. But reflection, my Lord and Gentlemen, while it reminded me of the unworthy and degrading nature of the crime, likewise induced me to abandon its commission.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, and live at No. 5, Angel-alley, White<lb></lb>chapel. On 31st May, in the afternoon, I was in Mr. Webb's public house at Whitechapel, selling <hi rend="italic">trotters</hi>—the prisoner bought two for three halfpence</p>

               <p>—he first took, what seemed to me, to be good money out of his righthand pocket, then put it back again and took a piece of paper out of his left pocket, opened it, and took 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in change—I had no more, and he said that he did not mind the other halfpenny—I put the shilling into my pocket; I had not a farthing there—in about two minutes I took it out, went over to the barmaid and said, "Please is this a good shilling, for I want change for it if it is?"—the prisoner was still within a yard of me—the barmaid tried it, said that it was bad, and returned it to me—it was not out of my sight—I laid hold of the prisoner and said, "Give me a good shilling, it is a shame for you to do such a thing"—he said that he did not give me a shilling at all—I said that he did, and he was still eating the <hi rend="italic">trotters</hi>—the landlord turned us both out—I still kept hold of the prisoner, and he said that he gave me no shilling—he gave me another shilling outside, which I showed to the barman, who examined it and said that it was bad also—I gave the prisoner in custody with both the shillings—as the policeman came up, the prisoner shook 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper into my basket.</p>

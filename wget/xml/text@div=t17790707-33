               <p>On Monday the 26th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came in a coach to our shop in <placeName id="t17790707-33-crimeloc165">Pall Mall</placeName>

I took the ear-rings to the coach, a pair of which he bought. He then gave me a guinea to change, which I was obliged to send out to change; he then asked to look at some gold watchchains, which I likewise took to the coach. He offered me eight guineas for an old fashioned watch-chain, which I asked nine for; I said I would go and look in the stock-book for the lowest price; I said he should have it for what it cost. On my going to get the stock-book down, he got out of the coach, and came into the shop; he agreed for a watch-chain, and told me he would call at night; that he had not money enough about him to pay for it. My mother seeing he had the appearance of a gentleman, desired I would go for the change. I went out, but could not get any, nor could my lad. When I returned, I saw the two show-glasses open, and my mother speaking to him.</p>
               <p>Were they open when you went out? - They were not, when I went in for the watchchains; nor did I see them open when I went out for the change; he afterwards found silver enough to pay for the ear-rings without changing; they came to five shillings; just as he was going away, a beggar woman came to the door to beg of him; he put his hand into his pocket and gave her something; he then got into the coach; he was hardly in the coach, when the beggar woman said to my mother that gentleman has taken something; I believe she said a pair of buttons, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>You heard her tell your mother that? - I did; upon that my mother called to me to run and stop the coach, for he had certainly<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177907070043"></xptr> taken something. I said it was a dangerous thing to stop him, as he had the appearance of a gentlemen, I would look first and see if I missed any thing; I looked among the buttons, but did not miss any thing; in a few minutes after, I missed the diamond stud. I went to Sir

             within ten minutes after, and gave information of it; and there were hand-bills printed, but I could hear nothing of it. I afterwards heard M'Kenzie was taken up; I went to Sir John's to see him; and when I saw him, I immediately knew him to be the person that was in our shop. The jewels are taken out every night, and put up in the morning; nobody had seen them before he came; I never found the stud again.</p>

               <p>I am a jeweller; I work in Mr. Bellis's house. On Monday morning, the 26th of April, I saw the diamond stud in Mr. Bellis's show-glass.</p>
               <p>Was there more than one there? - There were two paste studs in the same showglass, but never another brilliant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bellis. There was never another brilliant stud there.</p>
               <p>To Verdier. What time of day was it you saw it in the show-glass? - As near as I can recollect, between nine and ten o'clock; I was waiting to receive some orders, which occasioned me to look over the show-glass.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bellis. Have you any doubt of the person? - No, none at all.</p>

               <p>Do you know the prisoner? - Yes, he came into our shop on the 26th of April. I saw nothing of him while he was in the coach. When he came into the shop he asked to look at some gold enamelled fancy buttons; I took the two show-glasses out to him.</p>
               <p>Did he look at any buttons? - He put his hand in both drawers,</p>
               <p>Was there any thing besides buttons in the drawers? - Yes; ear-rings and fancy things.</p>
               <p>Was the diamonds there? - Yes, this brilliant stud was in one of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect whether you had observed the diamond stud there that morning? - No, I did not, I am but seldom in the shop.</p>
               <p>Are there more show glasses in the shop? besides these two? - Yes, a great many.</p>
               <p>But the diamond stud if it was there was in one of these two? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He did not buy the buttons? - No, my son returned, he could not get change and the prisoner paid for the ear-rings with silver, and immediately went away.</p>
               <p>Do you remember a woman begging of him while he was in the shop? - Yes; when he was gone out the woman said that man has taken something out of the glass like buttons.</p>
               <p>You cannot find that woman out? - No. I called to my son to stop the coach; he said he had the appearance of a gentleman, and it was a dangerous thing to stop him.</p>
               <p>How long was it before your son missed the stud? - A few minutes.</p>
               <p>What was the value of that stud? - 60 l.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bellis. It cost me 63 l.</p>

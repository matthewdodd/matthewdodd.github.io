                  </hi>. I live in Bryanston Cottage—I am servant to William Warburton and Co.—they are owners of the "London Conveyance Com<lb></lb>pany" omnibuses. On Saturday, the 15th of October, about a quarter or ten minutes before six o'clock in the evening, I got on the box of Mr. Morgan's omnibus, by the side of the driver, Old Bailey, while he pulled up to have the skipper put on the wheel—I continued on till we got to Compton-street,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183610240083"></xptr>
               <p>when Mr. Sanderson's <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> pulled up all on a sudden, in front of Morgan's omnibus—it was dark and foggy, but as far as I can guess, it was twelve or fifteen yards from us—they were going nearly between five and six miles an hour, as far as I can guess—when Sanderson's omnibus stopped, he pulled up his horses very sharp, and Morgan pulled up his omnibus too as sharp as he possibly could; in consequence of which, the horses came on their haunches, and the pavement was so greasy the driver could not stop them—the pole of Morgan's omnibus struck the deceased, Richard Cooper, on the back or near the left side—he is reported to be the son of Mr. San<lb></lb>derson—he had got on the step of father's omnibus—the prisoner was driving Morgan's omnibus—I got off the omnibus to assist in taking the boy into a doctor's shop—Sanderson's conductor had got him in his arms—when I hot to the doctor's shop he was dead—he died in one or two minutes—the prisoner followed the boy into the doctor's shop, and was taken into custody—I first saw the deceased near King-street, Holborn—the omni<lb></lb>buses were not racing—there was room for a carriage to pass on either side when they stopped, but they were more on the off than the near side—we did not stop between the Old Bailey and Compton-street—I do not know what caused Sanderson's omnibus to stop, whether it was a wagon or a brewer's dray.</p>

                  </hi>. I am conductor of Sanderson's omnibus, The boy got on the steps of my omnibus at Great Turnstile—I told him to get down two or three times—he would not; and we went on to opposite Compton-street, where the accident happened, and I had forgot all about the boy being on the step at the time—there was a wagon or dray coming out of Compton-street,—it came before us, which caused our omnibus to stop immediately—I gave a signal with my hand to the coachman behind—it being so dark and foggy at the time, it was not possible the coachman could see me give him the signal, before the pole of the omnibus behind struck the boy on the back—I was going five or six miles an hour—when the pole struck the boy, I heard the pannel of my omnibus smash—I was standing with my face to my own omnibus, but turning round, the other omnibus was within twelve or fifteen yards behind us, as near as I can guess—I was on the monkey<lb></lb>board at that time, which is my place on the omnibus—I took the boy into the doctor's shop—the other omnibus did not attempt to pass ours between the Old Bailey and Compton-street—we passed it in the Old Bailey, while they were taking up a passenger.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a piano-forte maker. On the day in ques<lb></lb>tion I was inside the second omnibus—I got in in Newgate-street, and went on to Oxford-market—I should think we went from six to seven miles an hour—it was a darkish evening—it was about twenty-five minutes to six o'clock when I got in—I was sitting in front of the omnibus, looking towards the horses' heads—I saw the first <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> stop suddenly behind a cart or wagon—I could not see which—the moment I saw it stop. I found the horses of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> I was in, thrown directly on their hind quarters, by the coachman checking them—I saw the collar considerably up the horses' necks, instead of being on the shoulders—I saw the conductor of the first omnibus</p>

               <p>get down, and take the boy in his arms into the doctor's shop—at the time of the accident, my impression is, our omnibus was from four to five yards behind the other—I was looking through the window—I cannot say whether the other omnibus backed at all—it stopped suddenly—there was another carriage coming down from St. Giles's church, which was the cause, I believe, of the man being obliged to pull up behind the cart, and it passed behind our omnibus just at the time the accident happened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was coming along Holborn, towards St. Giles's Church—I heard a crash, and immediately hastened to the spot—when I got there the conductor had boy in his arms—a gentleman said the boy was killed—the coachman was getting down from his omnibus—I said, "You must go along with me"—he said, "Very well," and seemed almost frantic—he followed me into the doctor's shop and the boy breathed his last as he got in—I cannot say at what rate the omnibuses were going.</p>

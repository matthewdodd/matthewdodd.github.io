            , No. 15, Hatton Wall. On the 20th of March, about half, past three o'clock I was in New Bridge-street, Blackfriers, I saw the Dartford post chaise come full speed down Blackfrier's Bridge; seeing it stop at the last coach in the rank, I stopped, I saw the coachman get off his box, he opened the door, and likewise opened the chaise door, took out the luggage and put it into the coach; on seeing him turn round from the chaise I observed him drop a yellow coloured watch, he picked it up, and put it into his right hand coat pocket, got on his box, and drove away towards Ludgate Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the coachman. - A. Yes, that is him, the prisoner at the bar, I am sure of it, I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the gentleman that got out of the chaise. - A. Yes, that is the gentleman. (pointing to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the gentleman that offered a reward of ten guineas for the person that convicted the prisoner of stealing the watch; what way of life are you in. - A. I am a bedstead maker's apprentice.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you out with a bedstead then. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were standing in the street, instead of going about your master's business; you never spoke to the coachman before in your life. - A. I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. You may have seen a great many other men; what the colour of the horses were, you cannot tell me. - A. One was a dark one.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know the number of the coach. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long afterwards was it that you heard of a reward. - A. I never heard of it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it that applied to you to come forward. - A. Trott, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. How came Trott to find you out. - A. My master went to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you go to the gentlemen when he got into the coach, if you thought the prisoner was doing a wrong thing; you heard of the reward, and so you thought you would go then. - A. I saw the prosecutor get out of the chaise into the coach.</p>

             sworn. I am an officer of Hatton Garden office. On the 25th of March, I received information from the last witness and his master, that induced me to apprehend the prisoner the next morning; he had been driving a coach exactly of the description which the last witness gave me; I saw the coach standing in Turnmill-street, near Mr. Fox, his master's, gateway; the last witness informed me where he lodged; Wellspring went into the tap, and saw him sitting by the fire, he came out and informed me, I went in and took him into custody, and searched him, nothing was found on him that led to a discovery of the watch; he denied any knowledge of it whatever; I took him to the office, and locked him up, being early in the morning; I received information that a person had been to take out some gold watch cases, which had been sent to Mr. Cox, a refiner, in the city, for six pounds eleven shillings and sixpence; I went immediately to the house of one Watson, in Clerkenwell, I saw Mrs. Watson, I challenged her of knowing something of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180604160033"></xptr>a gold watch that had been described to be found near the Old Bailey, her answer was, that her husband was out with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find the watch cases. - A. Yes, these are the cases. (producing them, and the inside of the watch separate.) After this conversation, she said she had some part of it up stairs; she went up stairs, I went up stairs after her, and there I found it, and the gold chain, which is broke; the capping of the watch answers to the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the watch chain and the inside part of the watch. - A. Yes; I took her into custody, and she then took me to Mr. Henshaw, he said he had sent his wife to Mr. Cox's to take them out; he afterwards brought them to the office.</p>
               <p>JANE FOX sworn. Q. Do you keep coaches, or your husband. - A. My husband, certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. How many numbers do you keep. - A. Three.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what numbers they are. - A. One is 410, 151, 830.</p>
               <p>Q. Now which number did the prisoner drive on the 20th. - A. I do not know, we never keep an account of the numbers the men drive, sometimes my husband drives morning man, and he drives night man; he has drove for us a fortnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more about this. - A. No more than he said he had lost a watch the Saturday before this.</p>
               <p>Q. (to Wellspring.) What kind of a coach was it the man drove. - A. A dark bodied coach.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Fox. We have got three dark bodied coaches; I cannot say whether he had the orange coloured one out, or the dark one.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that the watch that you afterwards gave the inside of to Trott. - A. Yes, I told Trott my husband found it; I gave the cases to Mr. Henshaw to sell, and the chain; he returned the chain to me, he said it was not pure gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a complete watch when you first saw it. - A. No, it was very much shattered, the works were in one paper, and the case in another; as soon as I heard it was advertised, I went to Mr. Henshaw's to get them back again, he said he would endeavour get them if the cases were not melted; he went to get them back.</p>

             sworn. I am a journeyman cabinet maker; I have worked for Mr. Beecham, in St Paul's Church Yard, twenty-three years. In returning from dinner to work, on Thursday, the 20th of March, about half past two o'clock, going along Giltspur-street, I crossed the road where I saw something lye, which appeared to me to be a bit of metal.</p>
               <p>Q. Laying where. - A. In the road, in the coachway between Cock-lane and St. Sepulchre's Church, when I picked it up, I found it to be the outward case of a watch very much bruised, and defaced; I put it in my pocket and then looked further to see if I could find any other part of it; at some distance, it might be a yard or two, I then found the inner case, that appeared as if a cart or a coach wheel had gone over it, the chain and seal were attached to it; the seal was bruised, and whatever stone had been in it was not then remaining in it, and several links of the chain were broken; I then took up that, and when I had it in my hand, in the act of going to put it in my pocket, a man whom I do not know, that was going along the foot pavement, I presume by way of joke, called out halves, I not knowing it to be gold made answer I did not know it was worth picking up; I kept it in my hand, it was very dirty, I put my hand in my coat pocket, when I arrived at Mr. Beecham's shop, our porter and the house maid were both in the front shop, near the door, I said I had picked up the fragments of a watch.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all you found. - A. Yes, I found first the outward case, then the inner case with the works in it.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not said any thing at all about the works being in it. - A. If I made a mistake, I ask your pardon; I found the inner case with the works in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose that any man alive believes a word that you have spoke. - A. I have spoke nothing but the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. Why the very thing contradicts you to your face. (his Lordship to the Jury.) Gentlemen, look at the cap of that watch: you see the cap of the watch which has been bruised, and you see the other things, they have been pulled to pieces, the marks of the bruises on the cap and the case, are in separate places, and the inside works are not bruised at all.</p>

               <p>Jury. They are bruised each in a separate place.</p>
               <p>- HENSHAW sworn. I am a watch and clock maker. On the 24th of March Mrs. Watson called at my house, I not being at home, she called the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive a watch from her. - A. Yes, in the same state that you see it now, she said that it was found by a friend who had come to her to dispose of it; I weighed them, and gave her a direction to go to Mr. Cox the refiner, as they had not been advertised; I asked her that, she said if I was going into the city, she would be glad if I would call, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of your own knowledge about this watch. - A. No. (The watch identified by the prosecutor.)</p>

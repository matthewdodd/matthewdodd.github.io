She used to tell me she brought them for one Mr. Scott in Hoxton-market-place, a man that deals in drapery.</p>

               <p>Delafore. I believe we may have dealt to the amount of about 20 l. Egan was never in my shop but once, and that was with Perkins; then she brought seventeen yards of muslin. She said it was worth 9 s. a yard. I lent her 3 l. 8 s. upon it. She told me that was Mr. Scott's. Egan never said a word: she said he wanted money to make up a bill.</p>

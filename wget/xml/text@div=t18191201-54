            . I live in Hartshorn-court, Cornhill, and work for Mr. Alderman Birch. On the 13th of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was going home from work, and met the prisoner just <placeName id="t18191201-54-crimeloc322">under the wall of Golden-lane brewhouse</placeName>

He pretended to be in liquor, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010039"></xptr>staggered against me; I made way for him but he would come against me. He folded his hands round my waist, hugged me, and held me about a minute, then made off with my seals - he went off very well then. I missed my watch, and immediately followed, and secured him; he made a shuffle, upon which some girls came up, and scratched and kicked me - they hurt me very much, and rescued him, but I never lost sight of him. A witness laid hold of him; I have not found my watch - the women went away. He said at the watch-house that he would mark me, and said he had never seen me. When he laid hold of me I thought he was drunk.</p>

            . I am a brazier, and live in Paul's-alley, Cripplegate. On the 13th of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was going up Golden-lane, heard the cry of Stop thief! went up the court, and the prosecutor said he had been robbed of his watch by the prisoner - two women were trying to rescue him from the prosecutor. As I took him down Golden-lane to have him searched, one of the women said,</p>
               <p>"Come home, he is no officer. You shan't take my husband." I shoved the woman away from him; he got from the prosecutor, and I secured him before he got out of my sight - we took him to the watch-house; he said there that he would mark the prosecutor. The women appeared to be loose women - they never came again.</p>

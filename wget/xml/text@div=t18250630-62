            . I am a watchman of Acton. On the 16th of June, at three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in a field opposite to Mr. White's house; he was then going up towards a mare; he took it by the forelocks, and lead it thirty or forty yards, to a shed at the corner of the field; I followed, and found him in the shed with the mare, and asked what business he had with her; he said he had no business, but he wanted to look at her age - I took him to Mr. White's house: there is no road through the field. There were two of Mr. White's halters in the shed - I found none on the prisoner - it was a bay mare - I cannot say whether it was Mr. White's.</p>

There were two hempen halters kept in the shed, to tie the cows up - there was a gelding and a bay mare in the field - I found them still there in the morning.</p>

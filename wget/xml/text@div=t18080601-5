             in possession of the house from nine till twelve o'clock; about the hour of twelve I returned again and my wife; at that time we knew nothing of what had happened; on the Tuesday morning following, I wanted to give change for a forty pound note; I went to my iron chest to get my money, and when I had introduced my key. I found it would not go round; I then pulled it and found it was open; and when I took the book out I found all the money was disconcerted; it was differently folded to what I generally put in the cash book.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it cash or bank notes. - A. It was bank notes in that book; on looking over the money I found a twenty pound bank note missing; likewise when I looked to the cash in my purse, I discovered two guineas in gold missing; upon examining the drawer of the iron chest I found it had been forced open; I sent for an officer; he searched the prisoner; some money was found on him in my presence, two one pound notes, a guinea and two seven shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know these notes. - A. I do not. He was then taken to the office and examined, and Mr. Conant gave me a warrant to search the aunt's house; we had a suspicion that the twenty pound note might be deposited there. The officer, myself, and another witness went to the aunt's house in Chandos-street, Grosvenor-square; in a pair of drawers we found a pair of corderoy smallclothes, five new shirts, two calico and three linen; the two callico shirts were taken away from my house that morning, on the 26th, a little before eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know. - A. By the information of his aunt; I had not missed them, nor had we any suspicion; likewise there were four pair of thread stockings found in his aunt's apartments. On the 28th he was brought up the second time to be examined; he there acknowledged that my twenty pound note he had secreted in a roll of blue cloth; I promised that if he would tell me where the money was, I would save his life.</p>
               <p>Q. Then we must not hear any thing more about what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of that did he direct you to go to any place where you might find the property. - A. He did; he told me that if I would let him go to my warehouse up stairs, in my house where he had deposited the money in such a roll of cloth, I might find the money that I had missed. On the officer and myself going to the warehouse at the top of the house, I found the twenty pound note, in the roll of cloth where the prisoner informed me, along with it were two guineas, with an additional sum of three guineas more; five one pound notes and a five pound note; that overplus quantity of money he said was his own; I charged him with having taken a twenty pound note and two guineas; he had been previously robbing me; he told me then the five one pound notes, and the five pound note, and the three guineas were his own; before Mr. Conant he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010007"></xptr>acknowledged that the whole was my money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take them at one time or how. - A. He did not say; about a fortnight before I missed my money in the iron chest; I left the keys in the hurry of my business.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss all this money at one time. - A. No, I only missed the twenty pound note and two guineas at one time; I charged him with it; he acknowledged taking it, and he acknowledged the remaining part of the money was my money, which no doubt it was.</p>
               <p>JOHN WARREN. I am an officer. On the 26th of April I went to Mr. Allardice's shop, he gave me charge of the prisoner for robbing him of a twenty pound note and two guineas; I took him into custody, he was committed for re-examination; on the Thusday following he asked me whether he could speak to his master; he asked his master if he would spare his life and he would tell him where all his property was; then we went to his warehouse, up in the garret, where the prisoner slept; in a bale of cloth we found the money, bank notes and cash; he told us where it was. I had a search warrant against his uncle's house in Chandos-street, there I found five shirts. Here is a twenty pound note, a five pound note, and five one pound notes, and five gnineas, I found in a bale of cloth in his master's warehouse; he said it was his master's property, that he broke the drawer of the iron-chest open with a fork; there was a mark of the fork on it.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He told his aunt that I let him have these shirts that were found at his uncle's as part of his wages; the notes I can say nothing to; I have no private mark upon them; all the things I found at his aunt's I can swear to; they have my private mark; these shirts are my shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth. - A. Ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This is my first offence; I leave myself to the mercy of the court; I beg for mercy.</p>

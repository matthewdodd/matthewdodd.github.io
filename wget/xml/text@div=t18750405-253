                  </hi>. I am mate of the ship <hi rend="italic">Artemis</hi>, lying in Millwall Docks—on 31st March, about 1.15 I was in the Commercial Road; it was after midnight—I was making water, and the prisoner came up and placed himself close to my elbow—I felt him touch my left side—I looked down and saw my watch guard hanging and no watch to it—I said "You have got my watch"—he said "I have not"—he ran away down the road, and I ran and caught him 30 yards off without losing sight of him—two men came up and said "Let the man go, he has not got your watch"—I was not calling out about my watch, but I had said that to the prisoner just before the men came up—they struck me on the head and knocked me down, but I still held the prisoner; we both got up again, and they knocked me down again, and the prisoner fell too, but I did not loosen my hold of him—I got up again and received a severe blow—I fell again, and lost hold of the prisoner, who ran away, and the other two men also—I could not see which way he went, I was so stunned with the blow—a constable came, and I gave information, and the prisoner was brought back in custody ten minutes afterwards—I said "That is the man that stole my watch"—he said "I am not the man"—I have not the least doubt of him—my watch was safe twenty minutes or half an hour before; the guard was round my neck, it being below my waistcoat—it was not hanging down when I undid my trousers—I had been with a lady before that, and had not parted with her a minute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I was not struggling with a woman at the corner of Cannon Street to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> away from her—she did not want me to go home and sleep with her—I did not promise to meet her at 11 o'clock next day—I had been with her an hour, and we had been to a private house—I never struggled with her.</p>

Shortly after 1 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, I was on duty in the Commercial Road—Coulson spoke to me, and I went in search of the prisoner through several streets—I saw him with two others not in custody, in Essex Street, and followed them to Charlotte Street and Fieldgate Street—one man ran away; I then ran and took the prisoner—I told him it was for stealing a watch from a man—he said "What do you take me for? I have done nothing"—I took him back and met Coulson in William Street—he said "That is the man who stole my watch"—the prisoner made no reply—I took him to the station, but found nothing re<lb></lb>lating to the charge—the skin was off his right elbow, and his coat was very dirty, as if he had been down in the road—the female is here.</p>

               <p>directly—I turned to look and found ho had gone—I then saw a disturb<lb></lb>ance, and saw two or three people on the ground—I had made no disturb<lb></lb>ance, nor had I pulled him about.</p>

Does it stand feasible that if I had been concerned in the robbery I should not have run away as the other two-men did. I was walking quietly with my hands in my pockets, and he came up and said "I want that man's watch." My clothes were as clean as they are now. The woman could hardly hold the man up.</p>

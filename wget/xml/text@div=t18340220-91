             (police-constable, C 182). I went after the prisoner to Rye, in Sussex - he was there, but I could not see him - I received information, and went to Ashford, where I found him - I called him by his name, and he answered me - I said I was an officer, come from London to take him - he said he expected it - he said the watch was pawned in Brewer-street - I said I knew that - I had had the duplicate from his brother.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not ask me to tell you everything, and say if I would substantiate the evidence against my brother, you would let me go free? A. Certainly not; I did not say that if you could get 30s. or 40s., the money would be of as much use in my pocket as in a counsellor's; nor that I would spoil the case if you could make up some money.</p>

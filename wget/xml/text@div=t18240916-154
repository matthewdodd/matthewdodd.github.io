            . I am servant to Mr. Allen; the barn was robbed on Monday night. I had seen it all safe the night before; between two and three bushels of wheat was stolen. I saw the prisoner the same night close to the barn; he appeared asleep - I had seen him about six o'clock in the evening, when I left the barn; it was locked outside, and pinned within - the thief got in at the window, which I found open.</p>

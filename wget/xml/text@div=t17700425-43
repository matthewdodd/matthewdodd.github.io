I did not perceive he had any weapon. It was very dark: there was no moon. I cannot pretend to say I have any notion who it was. There were two men brought to me; I could not fix upon one more than the other; they were both lusty men. The man that robbed me was tall, and, I believe, a blue coat on; whether he had his hair, or a wig, I do not know; it seemed to be very full of hair. I was advised to advertise the watch as lost, as the best way to hear of it again, which I did that very evening; and the next day the watch was stopped.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hill, a pawnbroker, in Carnaby-street. The prisoner brought this watch to me on Monday, the 26th of February, about eleven in the morning. I had known him upwards of two years. He used to be dressed in different sorts of clothes; sometimes a laced waistcoat, sometimes plain; sometimes a long tail wig, sometimes a round wig; sometimes with his hair curled behind. He was a customer to our shop with his clothes and things; he asked eight guineas upon the watch. I went backwards, and told my master here was a man had brought a watch which he thought was gold, and it was not: then my master came with me into the shop. Master asked him what he wanted upon it: he said eight guineas. Master asked whose it was; he said somebody had sent him with it, but did not say who. Master asked him how he came by it, holding it in his hand; the prisoner took hold of it, trying to snatch it; broke the chain. Then I got over the counter, and laid hold of him, and told him he should go before Major

When before the Major, he said, a man in York-buildings, that kept a chandler's shop, gave him the watch. When the prosecutor came, he was brought up again; then he said he found it in the Green-park: after that, they felt in his pocket, and found a key: he was asked what key that was; he said he did not know.

               <p>Prosecutor. I did not in my hurry miss it; but upon his running away, I put down my hand and missed it. That might be about half a minute after I was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel it go?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. The man put his hand to my pocket, and I felt a snatch; a quick kind of a motion; but did not perceive my watch move from me at the time, till I felt.</p>

               <p>I left my lodgings about six in the evening, and went to see an acquaintance at Westminster. I staid there till eight; I found this watch between Stable-yard gate and Spring-garden gate, going home. On the Monday morning I got up and got much in liquor, and did not know rightly what it was. I went to this man; he showed it to his master. I said I wanted eight guineas; he said, Is it your own? I said, That is no matter, if you don't like it, give it me again. He said, you must go before the Justice. I said, With all my heart. We went to Major Spinnage's; the Major knew me. I went to Tothill-fields Bridewell along with the Major's man, and no body else. The watch being advertised as lost, proves that I found it. (He produced the paper, with the advertisement in it).</p>
               <p>Court. The prosecutor has told the reason he advertised it in that manner.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did you not say before the Justice you never saw me before you saw me there?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I might say so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How could I rob him, my lord, if he never saw me?</p>
               <p>Court. That the jury will judge of.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been in the horse guards. I own I was very wrong in saying I had it of a man that kept a chandler's shop. I was very much in liquor. I ought to have kept it till it was advertised.</p>

            . I live in Union-street, at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177004250036"></xptr> top of Hill-street, Berkley-square, and am a mantua-maker. I have known the prisoner about nine months; he told me he had found a watch near Spring-garden, and went to pledge it, and it was stopped. On the Wednesday morning, going to see him, I went into a public house, and asked to see a news-paper; and, in the Tuesday's paper, I saw this advertisement. I took a pen and ink, and wrote it out. The prisoner said he believed the prosecutor lived near Northumberland-street. I was going along the King's Mews; I saw the master of a coffee-house; I asked him if he knew where the gentleman was that lost his watch. He said he lived at No. 4, in Northumberland-street. I went there, to know if he would take bail; the woman said no such-person lived there. As I was coming along Long-acre, coming back, I saw the gentleman riding down St. Martin's-lane very fast.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you do to know him?</p>
               <p>M. Eubridge. I was at Major Spinnage's with the prisoner, and the gentleman was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you examined there?</p>
               <p>M. Eubridge. No. At the Major's the gentleman said he could not swear to the prisoner. I desired a person to desire the gentleman to stop; he did. The gentleman came riding back. I said I should be glad to speak to you, concerning the person in prison. He said he would be very glad to speak with me, and desired me to go to his lodgings, which I did. Then he said he was very lorry for the man, and that he did not miss his watch for ten minutes after. I said it was very hard an innocent man should suffer in prison; he said so it was, and he would use all his interest to get him out of confinement. I told him there was sufficient bail ready. He said he was going out of town for eight days, and should be in town the Tuesday following, and desired me to come again. I went on the Thursday morning by ten; he said he was sorry he should be confined; that he really believed he was innocent, but did not care to interfere in it himself; and could do nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Do you recollect any thing of this?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I saw her at Major

            's, when the prisoner was there; then she passed for his wife. She came to me, as his wife, and cried very much, and said he had found the watch. I said it would appear upon the trial whether he had or not; and said to her, I am very sorry for you with all my heart; it is an affliction upon you. In regard to the man, I cannot swear to him, but as for telling her I did not miss my watch at the time, I did not say any thing to her at all about it.</p>

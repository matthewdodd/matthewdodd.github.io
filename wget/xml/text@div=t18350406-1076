                  </hi>. I am a chandler, and live in Fitzroy-crescent. On the 23rd of March, the prisoner came to my house for one penny-worth of plum-pudding—he gave me a shilling—I looked at it, rung it, and gave him the change—he went away—I again looked at the shilling which he gave me, and found it was bad—I put it in my till—there was no other money there but what was in bags—he came again on the 26th of March for one pennyworth of pudding—he put a shilling on the counter—I saw it was bad, and asked him where he got it—he said for carrying a gentle<lb></lb>man's trunk—I asked where he carried it—he said he did not know, now where he brought it from—I asked where he lived—he said he did not choose to tell me, but it was a long way from there—I said I had three more bad shillings, and recollected seeing him on the Monday evening, that one of the three I had taken of him, and I should give him in charge, which</p>

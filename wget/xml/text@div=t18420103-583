                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, in High-street, Brompton—I was in my uncle's workshop Jon Monday, the 3rd of January, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning—I met the prisoner coming out of the shop, after I had been in a few minutes—directly I came out, he struck me—nothing had occurred between us before, only I gave him some sharp answers—he struck me in the face—he was standing outside the door—he struck me, and gave me two black eyes—we were both sober—he knocked me down—I was senseless for a few minutes—in the course</p>

LUCAS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On your oath, was there no quarrel between you and the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I gave him no reason whatever—I dined with my uncle and aunt, named Stocks, on Christmas-day—I did not sit up the whole of the night—I slept up stairs at my uncle's—I saw the prisoner that evening, and we were the best of friends—I did not give him sharp answers out of ill—will or unkindness—nothing happened between me and the prisoner on Christmas night—I went up stairs about half-past one o'clock—the prisoner was down stairs, and I went down stairs and spoke to him for a few minutes in the kitchen—he had a glass of ale, and was smoking his pipe—he asked me to take a glass with him, and I did—I was with him twenty minutes or half-an-hour—he went out of the room once while I was there, and told me he was going to the water-closet—I said, "Go, and I will make up the fire for you," and I did—I did not go outside the kitchen too—I will swear that I said nothing to him as he was returning from the water-closet—he did not push me aside, or use any coarse language to me—he was gone ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I did not make a proposal of a disgraceful nature to him when he went to the water-closet—I did not follow him, with my small clothes down—when he came in from the water-closet he had his clothes buttoned up—the instant he came in I went up stairs, and wished him good night—he struck me with his right hand, I think—I was so surprised, I cannot tell exactly which hand it was—he struck me just as I got outside the door—the water-closet is just outside the door—he came out of the work<lb></lb>shop—I did not put my hand to his person at all.</p>

Norman is my nephew—I sent him into the shop to get two little horses and a small saw—he had not been out of my sight two minutes before I heard him scream—I ran out, and saw him on the ground, and the prisoner beating him with his fist—I went to separate them, and received what you see on my face—he said he would murder him—Thurtell saw him first, and I saw him next—the prisoner's mother assisted me in getting him away from him.</p>

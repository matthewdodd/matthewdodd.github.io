               <p>Flude. I took it with an intent to live in it, but upon my marrying about the same time I went to live with my wife at a small distance from it; I found the door and window-shutter broke open, which were left safe over night when we left work; we missed an iron burnisher, a back-screw to a leath, a pair of iron clams, two hammers, and a brass core; some of them were taken out of the ground floor, and some from a two pair of stairs room. The prisoner having worked with me about a month before, and hearing he had been lurking about my door, I suspected him. One Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175301110007"></xptr> Seale, the prisoner's landlord, came to my house on Sunday about two o'clock, and asked me if I had been robbed by the prisoner; I went with him to the house of

            , in Great-Arthur-Street, where I found this piece of iron mention'd, which is part of a rest to a leath. (The back screw, a pair of clams, and a brass core, produced in court and deposed to ) I took the prisoner about eleven o'clock on the 24th day, and then asked him what he had done with the burnisher ; he told me he had thrown it away under the gateway belonging to a handkerchief printer in Chiswell Street; I went there and found it; at the same time he told me he had pawned the two vices to Mr. Pain at the Three Golden Balls in Golden Lane for half a crown; so I went there the next day to inquire for them, but he denied having them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie in that house?</p>
               <p>Flude. No, I never did, I married soon after.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take it?</p>
               <p>Flude. I took it on the 25th of March; I used to work in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do any of your servants lodge in it?</p>
               <p>Flude. No, they do not.</p>

The prisoner brought all the things that are produced here, except the burnisher, on the 24th of Dec. he said they were one Seale's where he lodged, a very honest man and uses such tools; I lent him, I think, 20 d. upon them, and he had some trifling things of Mr. Seale's out at that time.</p>

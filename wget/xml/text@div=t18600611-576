I went to the Bricklayer's Arms in the Old Kent-road, on 8th May—I went into the room by myself and waited half an hour—I saw Window and a person named Cox come in—I saw Window in the act of selling some pawn-tickets, and he had these samples or patterns of calico—I got into conversation with them, and I asked Window if these were for sale; he said, "Yes"—I said, "What length are the pieces?"—he said. "About ten yards, the same pattern as this on the ticket"—I asked him what he wanted for the tickets; he said, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said, "If I buy them is it all right? "he said, "Yes;" I said, "Are you sure of that?" "yes;" he said, "I work for Mr. John Maples, an upholsterer, and I work two days in a week in the Crystal Palace for him, and I receive these things in lieu of cash for wages"—I told him I did not think that was at all likely; I said, "I am a policeman and I take you in custody"—I took him in a cab to his home, and searched his house—he told me it was his house and he took me there—I searched his house and found this piece of calico there, about twenty yards—I took him to the station, and the statement which he made there, that he bought it of Nash, caused me to go in search of Nash—I went and watched the warehouse and saw Nash steal the piece—when I took the duplicates I said to Windpw, "Why is not your name on the ticket? "he said, "I suppose it is that of a woman I sent to pawn it"—I found two pieces more at Cox's house, and I also found another piece and a duplicate at the house of a person named France.</p>

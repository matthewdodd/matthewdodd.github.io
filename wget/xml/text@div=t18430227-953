                  </hi>. I live in Plough-court, Fetter-lane. About one o'clock, on the 10th of Feb., the prisoner came to me, and I went out with her—I had four half-crowns, four shillings, and a handkerchief—she said she was badly off, and almost starved, and begged me to give her something to drink, which I did—when I came out she and I stood in the street together, and when I came home she followed me home, and asked for something to eat—I went up stairs, got her some tea and meat—she staid till four o'clock—I said I was going on an errand—I locked the door, and came down—she came down, and walked with me, and in going home she asked me to lend her some money—I said I could not, but I would give her some more to drink—I did so—after I parted with her, at the corner of the court, I went home, and went to sleep—at half-past eight o'clock next morning I had not a farthing to go to market with—I know I had the money when I went in-doors—I went and asked her for my money—she said she had not had it, or seen me since half-past eight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am fourteen years old, and live in this court. I was going on an errand at five minutes past nine o'clock—I saw the prisoner go up, and go into Mrs. Quick's room, and when I came back I saw her coming down.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

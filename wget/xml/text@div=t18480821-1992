               <p>of gin at the bar—there were three more persons beside the prisoner and I standing at the door—after I had called for the gin, the prisoner and I had a few words, and we began fighting—he said, "Recollect, if you and I fight this night, you will recollect it to the longest day you have to live"—I saw a knife in his hand, and in the scuffle I felt something at the back part of my thigh, which I thought was a kick—I pulled my trowsers open, and found a wound about four inches—he said, "Take that, you b----"—I was surrounded by his companions, and I began to fight as hard as I could for my liberty and when I found I could not get away I fell down—I was taken to St. George's Hospital, and the surgeon saw me that night—I was there three weeks—I am an out-patient now.</p>

            . Q. You are a watchman - A. Yes, of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. In Holywell Street the prisoner at the bar came to me as I was going the hour ten o'clock on the 29th of May; he ask me where my box was, I ask him what he wanted with my box, he said he should like to sit down and eat his supper in the box, he had some victuals in his hand; I asked him the reason he did not go home, he said his master and he had some words, his master had discharged him, he said that his relations lived at a distance from town, he would not wish to go till it was light; I told him it was very seldom I went in the box and sat this hot weather, he might sit in the box and eat his supper; when he went in the box he asked me what I would drink, I told him I had had my usual allowance I wanted no more; he said he had a crown piece, and somebody told him they would not give more than four shillings and three-pence for it; I looked at it, it was a very good one; I told him if he wanted a pint of beer to go to the public house, the landlord would take it; he went in the public house, and brought a pint of ale and a glass; I blamed him for spending so much of his money. After he had ate his supper, he asked me if I could find a bottle; a bottle was procur'd, he went and bought three half quarterns of peppermint, when he had ate his supper, he said he should sit at the bottom of the box and have a sleep. I left him in the bottom of the box apparently asleep, when I was going the hour of eleven he followed me, he said he could not sleep contentedly, he would rather walk by the side of me; in walking along he said he had got a very good find, he had got some yellow boys, he could not tell how many, he had not counted them; he put them out of the nutmeg grater and counted over fourteen guineas, he said he had no pockets. I told him it was not safe to carry them about without a pocket. I begged him to put it into my hands, I would take care of it till the morning for him; he said he had some pieces of paper, he could not tell the value of them, or whether they were good for any thing or not. When I came to the box I was short of candle, I asked him to get me a candle and a halfpennyworth of snuff; when he returned he shewed me the notes; I found them to be two five pound notes he said he had another, it was put up in two squares, but by some means or other he had lost it; he and I went in pursuit of this note; we could not find it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he suppose he had lost it - A. He could not tell where.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any more money about him - A. Two dollars and a shilling he shewed me; he told me he found them in one of Mr. Rhodes's fields, the notes the money, and the knife that he ate his supper with, he found them altogether in a rag; this is all the money he produced to me, he went to the public house to get some more liquor; the landlord came and asked me whether I sent him I said No, I desired the landlord to detain him while I went for the officer of the night. I delivered up the boy to the officer of the night.</p>

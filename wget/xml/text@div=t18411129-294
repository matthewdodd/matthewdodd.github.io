                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable P</hi> 172.)

                  </hi>. The prisoner has been in my service about three years. On the 13th of November he was taken into custody—I was present when he was searched at the shop—10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was found on him which he afterwards admitted was my property—I went to search his house with the policeman, we searched the coal-cupboard, and the first thing found was a pair of pincers, which were mine—when they were first brought out the prisoner said he had had them for years—I said I could swear to them—he then admitted they were mine—I had asked him for them several times within the last three months, and he said he knew nothing of them—the next articles found were a pair of names—he said he had them by him for years—I said they were mine—they belonged to a person named Bates, who had sent them to be repaired—he then said, "They are your property, master, I did not know they were there"—I searched up stain— we searched all round the bed—the policeman said he must have the bed moved to search the cupboard and the bed—the prisoner's wife was stand<lb></lb>ing by the side of the cupboard putting the child to sleep, she moved, and the cupboard was opened—the prisoner objected to the bed being moved, and said there was nothing more—I swear she said so—imme<lb></lb>diately the officer opened the cupboard he pulled out eight horse-shoes, and said, "Here is something here"—I said, "That is some of the things I have been looking after for a long time"—the prisoner said, "They are yours, master, I hope you won't give me in charge, if yon will let me go I will not show my face any more," as he was sure I should not employ him any more after that, and he would sell all he had and pay me whatever I demanded—I said it was out of my bands, I could not take any part in it—I gave him in charge—we went directly to the station-house—on the Monday following we went to Union-hall—before we had been before the Magis<lb></lb>trate the officer came to me and said the prisoner admitted it was my money—the prisoner said he had received the money that was in his posses<lb></lb>sion from Camden-lodge, which is a place where I shoe horses, and he meant to pay me—he was not employed to shoe horses on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. They were horses in the back fields. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. He was not employed there—he was not able to do anything on Saturday night, he was lame—it was part of his duty to do that work on Saturday night or Monday morning—they were brickmakers' horses—he used to take shoes from my place for that purpose—he used to shoe their horses every week—he used to look round to see if anything was wanted—he generally knew the week previous, or on the Friday, what was wanted—he bad been lame, and another man was employed to do the work that week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. My master knew the shoes were in my house three weeks; I never could get an opportunity of putting them on. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I had no knowledge whatever that he kept shoes by him longer than from Sa<lb></lb>turday night to Sunday morning—he generally took them from the shop on Sunday morning—he was to come to the shop and take what was wanted—I remember, three weeks previous to his being taken, that Smith's omnibus broke down, and it had a new spring made to it—I know of no shoes being taken from the shop that evening; but it is very probable they were.</p>

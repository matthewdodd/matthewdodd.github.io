                  </hi>. I am a brush maker, of Providence-row, Finsbury—on 12th December the prisoner came and said he wanted some brushes to show to a friend who was going to open a shop at Brighton; and wished me to send him some samples—he said, "Send them round to 3, James-street, Old-street, my place of business"—that is not very far from my place—he said, "My name is Imiss, and I am a wholesale milliner"—two days afterwards I sent him round fifty-nine brushes as samples, the value of which was about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., by my foreman, Thomas Wilson—the prisoner called on me about three days afterwards and said, "Mr. Child, I</p>

               <p>have brought you an order for fourteen dozen brushes, but you omitted to send any clothes brushes, and I want some samples to show my friend; I am going down to Brighton to-morrow morning"—I selected twelve, and be took them away with him—he said he should return in a few days, and would bring the samples back with a further order—he did not do so, and I did not see him again till he was at the police-court, about 17th December—none of the goods have been returned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Mr. Child's employ—on 14th December I, took a parcel containing 59 brushes, to 3, James-street—I packed them up myself—this memorandum (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was made of them and put outside the parcel—I delivered them to Agnes Smith—I saw the prisoner when he called at my master's; he is the same person.</p>

                  </hi>. In December last I was living with the prisoner at 3, James-street, under the name of Imiss—I received a parcel from Wilson and delivered it to a boy who used to carry out boxes in the millinery line, to take away—the boy was not in our service, but he used to run on errands occasionally—I delivered them to him, as I had a message to send the parcel back to Mr. Child—it is such a long time ago, seven or eight months, that I forget it—after leaving there, the prisoner and I lived in Ray-street, under the name of Hawkins—he carried on business in the Birmingham line.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had he carried on the millinery business at James-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I believe he has been separated from his wife some time—she is a violent woman, and he took the name of Imiss to prevent her from following him—I gave the boy instructions to take the brushes back to Mr. Child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am beadle of St. Luke's parish—I apprehended the prisoner on another charge, at 10, Ray-street, Clerkenwell, where he was living in the name of T. and S. Hawkins—I had had a warrant against him since December for leaving his wife and family—he was carrying on a Bir<lb></lb>mingham and Sheffield warehouse—there was a difficulty in apprehending him, he got on to the roof of the house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">was no case to go to the Jury. The Court considered that the prosecutor had parted with his property without having made proper inquiries, and therefore that he could not indict for felony.</hi>

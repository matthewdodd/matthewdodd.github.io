                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier, of 3, Little Grosvenor-street—on the evening of 12th November, in the course of my duty, I delivered some letters in the canteen barracks, Hyde-park, near the magazine, about 7 o'clock, or soon afterwards—I then took something to drink, by the invitation of a soldier who was sitting there, neither of the prisoners—I remained there till about twenty minutes past 8—I drank a glass of beer there, and there was also a pot of beer called for among five of us—I knew perfectly well what I was about when I left; I was quite rational—I had been in the prisoners' company the whole evening, and had spoken to Pearce several times—they asked me to show them the way to St. George's Barracks, and I agreed to do so—that is in Trafalgar-square—we crossed the park from the canteen to Grosvenor-gate—I walked between the two prisoners with my arms between theirs—I felt Pearce pushing me on my right side, as if he was in<lb></lb>toxicated and could not keep on his legs—he did that repeatedly, and when he did it Benning always stepped backwards or forwards, so as to allow me the chance of falling, but I retained my legs, and after being pushed three or four times, I asked him what his little game was—Pearce said that he would b—soon show me, and grasped me by the throat; Benning struck me violently on the face, and I was forced to the ground—they both knelt on me, and I directly felt Benning break my watch-chain, and also take my money out of my pocket—(I had taken my watch out in the canteen to tell them what time it was at half-past 8, just before leaving)—Benning said to Pearce, "It is all right," and I immediately felt a severe blow on the side of my head, and became insensible—I went to Grosvenor<lb></lb>gate and saw a policeman—that was about 9 o'clock; I made a communi<lb></lb>cation to him—next morning I went to the Wellington Barracks, Bird-cage<lb></lb>walk, and picked out the prisoners—I am certain they are the two men.</p>

I am a private in the 1st Grenadier Guards—I was on duty at the Canteen Barracks, Hyde-park on that evening—the prisoners were there—I am certain they are the men—they left about half-past 8; the postman was in the middle—they went towards the guard-room to answer to their names before they went out of baaracks—that is to see that they are properly dressed before they go out.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, A</hi> 222). On the evening of 12th November, I was on duty in Hyde Park, near Grosvenor-gate, and saw the prosecutor sitting outside the gate, on the stone coping of the railings—he could not walk straight; he was sensible, and gave a clear account of all that had occurred—he showed me marks of a struggle about half-way between Grosvenor-gate and the Magazine—I saw marks of a very severe blow on the right side of his face—I went to the Canteen Barracks, but the prisoners were not there—I went next day to the Wellington Barracks, and saw the prosecutor pick the prisoners out from ten or fifteen others.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Bennning's Defence.</hi> I was in the canteen with my comrades on the night of 12th November, and saw the postman drinking and singing; he appeared very drunk. About half-past 8, I went out of barracks, and he was going out at the same time. Pearce and I were together. The postman stopped and talked to two women, and I saw no more of him till next morning, when he came and picked out Pearce, and said that the other prisoner was not there, but I was there all the time. Afterwards he came, and finding that I was a prisoner, he picked me out, and said that I was the other man. I asked him at the Police-court how it was he did not pick me out the first time, and he said that we were dressed differently, having our white jackets on, which must be wrong, because we are not allowed out of barracks in white jackets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Pearce's Defence.</hi> I was with several comrades. The prisoner had to deliver two letters at half-past 7; he was to deliver them and come back. He came back, and waited in our company till half-past 8; some more pots of beer were had, and he got in liquor. We gave our names to the officer on guard, and left the prosecutor talking to two females outside—I saw no more of him till next morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Beresford Street, Woolwich—I work at the arsenal—on Thursday, 13th May, about 9.30 at night, I saw the two prisoners in Powys Street, Woolwich, with another man—they were handling the things about, and I noticed them—I saw them go towards the prosecutor's shop—George Holken stood on the other side of the road—the woman went across and brought him over, and he took a pair of trowsers, gave them to her, and she put them under her shawl and went away—I went and told Mr. Hosegood, and we followed them—we told a policeman, but he said he had to go off duty and would not stop—we watched the house the prisoners went into, went to the station and got three officers, and found the prisoners there—I knew George Holken before by sight, but not the woman.</p>

On this Thursday evening, a few minutes past 10, I went to a lodging-house in Rope Yard Rails, Woolwich, and there found the prisoners in bed together—I took them into custody—I charged them with stealing a pair of trowsers—they said they knew nothing about it.</p>

If these trowsers were stole at 9.30, where could I have put them away, or where was the money for them? I neither had the money or the trowsers. I am innocent, an could have proved it, only they would not send for the witnesses.</p>

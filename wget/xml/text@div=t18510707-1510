                  </hi>. I am a clerk to Messrs. Davis', warehousemen; the prisoner was in their service. On 26th June, Mrs. Horn, of Greenwich, called and gave me two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-notes in payment of a debt from her husband to Messrs. Davis—I gave the notes to the prisoner, told him what it was for, and asked him for a receipt—he gave me this receipt which I saw him write (<hi rend="italic">produced by James Horn</hi>), and the change, and I gave them to Mrs. Horn, who was in the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This is a printed receipt filled up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I am not aware that I made a mistake in the first instance, in stating to whom I paid this money—I had a little doubt as to whom I paid it, but it was very slight—I did at first say I paid it to Mr. Jolliffe—I was very much engaged at the time—I did not say so three times in Jolliffe's presence, and afterwards apologise to him—I said so once—the 26th June was Thursday, and the pri<lb></lb>soner's attention was called to this on the following Monday—he said he had no recollection of the circumstance, and wont with me to Greenwich to make inquiry of Mr. Horn, and look at the receipt, and he said if he had received it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185107070085"></xptr>
               <p>he must have paid it over in the usual way, or entered it in some book in the usual way—I did not go through the books with him—I went through my check—book by myself, but did not find an entry of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the shop cashier's book on Friday, 27th, I find an entry of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is in the shop cashier's writing, and is booked to No. 7, which is my number—we have not been able to find out directly to whom to apply that payment of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I have not over and over again, stated that I believe that to be this sum in question—it relates to a sale of goods over the counter, but I do not know to whom—they were fancy articles to the best of my recollec<lb></lb>tion—that would not in the ordinary course be entered in the day—book—the prisoner is not cashier—it is extremely difficult to know to what to apply this 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we have many parties come into the shop and purchase goods who we never see again—on 26th June, Mrs. Horn purchased goods to the amount of 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and those sums appear in my book, and in this green—book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was not a cash account, and would not appear in this book which is merely for parties buying over the coun<lb></lb>ter—if a person comes and purchases goods, which are sent home by the car<lb></lb>rier, the money pusses through other books—I swear this 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. has no relation to the 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—when I took this money to the prisoner he was in the counting—house writing—he was the only clerk in at the time—it was between 1 and 2—I did say first that I paid this money to Jolliffe, but the shop was full of customers when I was asked about it—we went to Greenwich two days afterwards, and the prisoner said he had written to the parties to ask them whether they would send up the receipt, and in consequence of receiving no answer to that we went down, and the receipt was shown us—the prisoner still said he had no recollection of receiving the money—when I gave him the notes he took one away and got change for it, but I do not know where—I was in the counting-house while he went away—two other clerks would come into the counting-house at 2, but I think Mr. Joliffe would not be in till half-past 2—the prisoner would leave at 2, very likely, for his dinner—I do not know whether there was any cash—box where the prisoner could put the money, as I am not in the counting-house—I should say decidedly that the notes would not be laid on the desk, and remain there all the afternoon—I never write receipts myself; any of the clerks do—any of the clerks who receive money ought to hand it to Mr. Jolliffe.</p>

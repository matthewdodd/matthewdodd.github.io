               <p>Q. Were you present when he was tried - A. Yes, I was; I took him to Portsmouth to be transported; I delivered him on board the hulk; I cannot say exactly the time. That is all I know. I am sure he is the same man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have nothing to justify myself. I was unwell while at Portsmouth; every thing was very disagreeable; an opportunity offering I made my escape, not with an intention of robbing, but on getting my living by an honest livelihood.</p>

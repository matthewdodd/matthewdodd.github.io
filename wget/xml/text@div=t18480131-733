                  </hi>. I am a cap-maker, at Walworth. The prisoner and her mother had been employed by me to make caps for men and boys—from information, I gave directions that when the prisoner came to my house on Saturday morning, 8th Jan., for work, she should not be left alone—I west up stairs, came down again, and found in the passage a bag, which contained her work, and these two caps—she was in the other room—I went to look at it—she said, "That is my bag, sur, and the caps in it belong to my mother"—I opened it—just at that time my young man came up, and with me took out of the bag these two caps—they are mine—this one had been lying on a bench with others—it was going to Blackheath; we should have missed it in ten minutes—this other was in a rack—my young man said, "One of these is a cap we were going to send off my coach"—the prisoner said, "I found them in the passage"—I said, "That could not be, this one was in a rack behind you"—she then said she had put them into the bag—my little boy was sent down, that the prisoner should not be left alone, but he told me she sent him out on an errand—he is not here—the prisoner did not tell me she sent him out—this is my writing to this deposition—I believe it was read over to me—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"The prisoner said herself that she had sent my little boy for an errand."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, P</hi> 102.) The prisoner was given in my charge—she first said Mr. Taylor put the caps there himself, or some one belonging to him; and afterwards, that she did take them, and covered them with the bag.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I did not; I sent his little boy for an errand, and while he was gone I put my work into my bag; I saw these caps in the rack; I looked at them, and saw his little boy coming, put them on my bag, and covered them; my master saw them; I said, "They are my mother's;" he said he would knock me down; I said, "They are our, I only took them to look at them;" he said I should sit there and finish my work; I was afraid to sit there, for fear of my mother, and then he sent for an officer.</p>

               <p>—I assisted—I examined it afterwards, it was damaged and useless for a time—I asked the prisoner if he had done it—he said, "No"—I asked if he had got any matches—he said "No"—we do not allow matches inside our gates—he turned out his pockets, and I saw half a match in his waistcoat pocket, the top part was gone—I said "How did this come in your pocket"—he said "I don't know. I bought the waistcoat last Saturday and I suppose it must have been in it at the time. I never had my hand in my pocket since"—he is fourteen or fifteen years of age—he has been with us, backwards and forwards for a few months.</p>

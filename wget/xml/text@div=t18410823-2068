                  </hi>. I am a builder, and have one partner. I live in Royal Hospital-row, Chelsea. I have some houses in Denby-street, Pim<lb></lb>lico, and a warehouse, where I keep nails and other articles—the prisoner was in my service as carpenter, and kept the key of the warehouse gene<lb></lb>rally—in consequence of missing nails I watched him, and met him, on the 13th of July, an hour after the other men had left work, coming from the warehouse—I stopped him, and said, "Have you just left work?"—he said, "Yes, here is the key"—I said, "What have you got in the bas<lb></lb>ket?"—he said, "Some little bits of wood"—he took out a few bits of wpod, and put them back again—I said, "You must have something else"—he said no, he had not—I said he mast turn it out, and I found in it these nails—there are upwards of 13lbs. weight of them—they are of a peculiar make, such as are not commonly used—I bought them twelve months ago of a gentleman who retired from business—I took the prisoner to the sta<lb></lb>tion—he had not got the key then—he had offered it to me at first, but he must have thrown it away on the road to the station.</p>

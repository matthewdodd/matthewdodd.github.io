                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a saleshop in Ratcliff-highway. The prisoner was my servant-of-all-work—she slept with me—I told her to get up at a quarter past seven o'clock in the morning of the 15th of Jan.—having gone down stairs, she came up again, and told me I had been robbed—I went down and there was the street door open—the things in my shop were all thrown on the ground—there were three watches on the counter, and a drawer—I sent for the policeman—when he came I did not miss anything—I</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable K</hi> 212.) I was called in to Mr. Samuel's—the prisoner was brought down stairs—I asked her what sort of a man it was it was she saw in the house when she came down stairs first—she said, "A short stout man, with crape round his face, or his face blackened"—I asked her where she was—she said, "In the kitchen"—she then said, after some other questions, "Perhaps you suspect me"—I said, "No, not at pre<lb></lb>sent"—she then wanted to go backwards, and I called Mrs. Samuel to watch her, but she was not out time enough—the prisoner came in again—I said, "I should like to know what you have in your pocket"—I found in her pocket this piece of pocket-handkerchief, and in the corner of it I found a shilling and two sixpences wrapped up in a paper—I said to Mr. Samuel, "There is not doubt the watches are in the water-closet"—I went there, took up the seat, and found these three watches.</p>

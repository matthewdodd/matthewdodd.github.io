            . I am a saw-maker, and live at No. 26, Crown-street, St. Giles'. I was at the parish church of St. Martin's in the Fields, on the 1st of June, 1824 - I have known the prisoner many years; I saw him there, on that occasion, married to

            , I think her name was - no, it was Rowe; I heard her called by that name - I have seen her since then; I see her every week - I saw her last week; I have no doubt she is the person - I do not know the clergyman's name who married them; I believe she is not in attendance here - I gave her away; my wife was present - the second wife has directed this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Now, do not you believe her name was Drew? A. No - I have a certificate which the second wife got; I did not know her name before she was married - I had seen her several times with the prisoner, who had worked for me several years - I did not recollect her name when I said Drew; I have heard her husband say her name was Rowe - I should be able to say, independent of this paper, that the name of the person I saw was Rowe, for she told me so herself, two or three weeks ago; I know it was mentioned in discourse when she brought work to my house - I cannot swear when I heard the prisoner state her name was Rowe, the time is so long ago; she said "It is my house."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I suppose you were told what her name was when you were about to give her away? A. Yes, at the church; and I saw the name entered in the book.</p>

            . I lodge at No. 21, New Compton-street, St. Giles'. I first became acquainted with the prisoner in November, 1829, and was married to him on the 5th of January, 1830 - he always said his wife was dead; he was living at No. 12, Mortimer-market, Tottenham-court-road - he was living there as single; he had no wife there with him - he did not say when his wife died; he said she was dead, and he had buried her in the Borough - I did not know any of his friends to inquire of them; we were married in <placeName id="t18310217-66-crimeloc412">All-soul's church</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are described as widow in the indictment; had you not been married? A. No; I am quite sure of that - Mr. Clark was never my husband; I have known a person of that name, but I do not know what he is - I have known a soldier of that name; he was in the 17th regiment, but that has nothing to do with this - he lived at Chatham, I believe, but he is nothing to me; I was at Chatham one day - I do not know whether I saw him; I never was inside the barracks there - Mr. Clark is across the water, I suppose; the regiment is gone abroad - I cannot tell how long.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you had never been married before? A. No; a young person, with whom the prisoner was acquainted, introduced him at my apartment - her name was

               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. What age is the prisoner? A. Sixty-three - my name is not on this paper (looking at one) - here is the name of E. Deeley; it is my hand-writing - I know a gentleman of the name of Lynch; it is hard for me to say whether I have lived with him as his wife - I never lived with Clark as his wife.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you ever married to Lynch? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I assure you, Gentlemen, if I had known what had become of my first wife I should not have done it - I was three months walking about to look for her; I searched every where, and examined all the papers - I have been extremely ill-used by this woman and by the first also.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You used the expression "it would be hard to say whether you had lived with Lynch as his wife?" A. I lived in the same house with him, and worked for him.</p>

               <p>Q. I do not ask if you were married, but were you ever supposed to be married or represented as Lynch's wife? A. No - I did go by the name of Lynch, because I did not want the prisoner to find me out; he was continually annoying me day and night - that was since I married him; I did go by the name of Lynch before I was married, but I was by myself; I knew Lynch by working for the same shop - I did not go by his name as his wife; I went by that name in the lodging, and by his getting me into the same shop he worked for - I went by that name, because I did not wish to go by my own name; I never went by the name of Mrs. Lynch - I lived ten or twelve weeks in the same house with him.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you this question, and take care how you answer it; did you never go by the name of any man before you married the prisoner? A. By the name of Lynch I did for two or three years, but I was not reputed to be his wife - he was not long in London; I went by the name of

               <p>Q. Then, do you mean to say that the prisoner had no authority from you to describe you as a widow, and that you never were treated as a widow in any company? A. No, my Lord, he had not, neither did I know he did so when he put the banns up.</p>

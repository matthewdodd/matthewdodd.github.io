            . I am a street-keeper. I was talking to March, and saw the prisoner and another close behind a gentleman - I said, "That fellow is picking a gentleman's pocket;" March ran across, and took him -I could not cross quick enough myself; I saw him pick the pocket - when I got across, March had got hold of him: the handkerchief was in the gutter - I had seen it fall from him; I took him to the watch-house and searched him, but found nothing on him - he was dressed as he is now; I called out to the gentleman, but could not make him hear, or if he did he took no notice - I am lame, and could not go after him; he appeared unconscions of its being taken.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did the prisoner throw it down, or drop it? A. He dropped it, 
apparently intentionally.</p>


               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to see my aunt - I was returning along Fleet-street; they laid hold of me in a rough manner - I asked what was the matter; they said,"Never mind, we have been watching some of you;" they knocked my hat off, and the handkerchief fell out of it - he took it up, and said, "Who has lost a handkerchief?" I said I had not picked any body's pocket - he said, "Never mind that, you may take your leave of Fleet-street."</p>

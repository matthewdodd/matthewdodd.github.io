            . I was employed on these premises. On the 12th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and paid a few shillings which he owed me. He then insisted on standing treat. He sent for two pots of ale. Other men were there. I do not think he drank a drop himself. He then sent for half a pint of gin, and drank some of that. My tea came; I offered him some; he took about half of it - then said he wanted an ironing-board, and one he would have; I then thought of an old deal board, which I recommended to him, and said that he might have that as it was an old cast off painted board. It was then half-past seven o'clock. He wished us good night, and went away. I and Preston went home, and was sent for in about ten minutes by Mr. Astor, and missed a piece of mahogany from four pieces, which were safe in the workshop at four o'clock in the afternoon. It was cut for the cover of a piano-forte.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You pointed a board out to him - A. Yes. It had been used as a shelf. I brought it out and shewed it to him. He could not mistake one for the other.</p>

            . I work with Cummins. His account is correct. The prisoner would drink no ale. Cummins recommended him some tea, to do him good and bring him round. Cummins shewed him the old deal board which he might take. It was not worth a shilling. The mahogany boards were not like that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far was the mahogany from the deal board - A. About sixteen inches. He was tolerably drunk. One board laid down, and the other stood up. I do not think he could take it by mistake.</p>

            . The premises were mine. I continued on them up to the time in question. I did not authorise the prisoner to take anything away. I saw him in Sun-street, about a hundred yards off, between seven and eight o'clock at night, with a mahogany board on his shoulder, going towards Finsbury-square. I immediately went to the manufactory, and missed one. I sent for Cummings. The prisoner did not return.</p>

               <p>Give the Court and the Jury an account of what the prisoner at the bar did to you, and the time when, as near as you can, and relate all the circumstances of it. Speak out, and don't be afraid. - Mrs. Russen is mistress of the charity-girls; when her daughter went upstairs to mind the children, he asked her to let me stay below with him when he went to sleep after dinner, for fear he should fall into the fire; when she was gone upstairs he took me upon his knee, and then put me down and put up my petticoats, and put his finger up between where I make water.</p>
               <p>Where did he put you when he put you off his knee? - Close to him; he sat and I stood for a little while; then he laid me on the kitchen-chair, then he took up my petticoats, unbuttoned his breeches, and put something up the inside of me.</p>
               <p>In what situation did he continue? Did he continue standing up or how? - He laid across me; afterwards he gave me a red and white handkerchief to wipe me with; then my mistress's daughter came down, and he told her he could not get any sleep.</p>
               <p>Did he say any thing to you before that? - He said if I told my mother, or sister, or any body of it, that he would flog me severely.</p>
               <p>When he laid down upon you, what was it that he put to you? - His private parts.</p>
               <p>Did he enter your body? - Yes, he put his private parts quite inside of me.</p>
               <p>Did you feel any thing come from him? - Yes, all wet.</p>
               <p>Where did that come from? - From my master.</p>
               <p>Were you at all hurt by this afterwards? Were you sore or hurt? - I was sore, I could not make water for five days.</p>
               <p>Do you remember in what month this happened? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you remember how long ago it is? - I know it was when my mistress lay in.</p>
               <p>Was it before or after? - It was in the time of my mistress's lying-in.</p>
               <p>Did you mention this afterwards to any body? - No; on Thursday he went out to dine with a gentleman, and he gave the boys half a holiday; when he came home, he had three boys to do some work in the garden; then he sent the boys for some horse-dung to the church; then he called me to him, and laid me across the committee-chair in the committee-room; when he was getting on me he heard somebody come, and he got off from me and looked at the door, and there was nobody coming; then he did the same to me as he had done before.</p>
               <p>You must mention what it was he did to you. - The same as he did before.</p>
               <p>Did he do the same as before? - He lay upon me, and some stuff came from him; but there was not so much as there was at first.</p>
               <p>Did you after this tell this story to your mother or sister? - My sister went to wash my linen, and she saw the stuff on my shift; the first time Mrs. Pearce washed my linen she thought I had some sore; when my sister mentioned it to me I told her what I have told now.</p>
               <p>Was it shortly after the first or second time that you told your sister? - After the second time.</p>
               <p>Then your sister's observation must have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150004"></xptr> been within a few days after this happened? - Yes; my mother was at work, and did not know it.</p>
               <p>Not till your sister told her? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your mother look at you when she came home? - No.</p>
               <p>What! not at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Did your mother at no time look at you, to see if any thing was the matter with you? - She went to a doctor in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Do you know what his name is? - No.</p>

               <p>Was it in hot weather or cold? - It was in hot weather.</p>
               <p>Did they use to keep in hot weather the door of the school-room shut or open? - It was shut sometimes and the window open.</p>

               <p>Were the other girls up in the school? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did your master go up to the boys as usual? - He gave his daughter the watch, he asked me what it was o'clock; I told him it wanted 25 minutes to two; he said his watch went too slow.</p>
               <p>Then it was before the school began in the afternoon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It begins about two in the afternoon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he go up when the usual hour began into the school? - Yes.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150005"></xptr>You went about that business as usual? - We used to take it by turns.</p>

               <p>Were there any girls bigger than you in the charity-school? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you cry out? - No; I tried to get off the chair, and he took and leaned hard on me; I told him so, and he did not mind it, as if he did not hear me.</p>
               <p>How came you not to cry out when he hurt you; was it the bearing hard upon you that hurt you? - Yes, and something else hurt me.</p>
               <p>Which hurt you most? - Not his leaning upon me.</p>
               <p>It is a wonder you had not cried out when he hurt you, if he hurt you much? - I was frightened at the first, and I told him of it and cried, and he did not mind it.</p>
               <p>If he had hurt you very much, you must have cried out; but you did not cry out at all? - No.</p>
               <p>You cried, but did not cry out for help? - No.</p>

               <p>What time of the day was that? - Between four and five in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Were the boys and girls all at home at that time? - The boys had half a holiday that time, the girls were up in the school.</p>
               <p>The girls school is not far from the entry? - No, you go into the parlour, and go up into the girls school.</p>
               <p>Then, from this entry, there is a door into the girls room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And no other door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was this in the entry that leads to the girls school? - No, the boys.</p>
               <p>Where was the place it happened the second time, in the entry or committee-room? - In the entry that goes into the committee-room.</p>
               <p>COUNSEL. Suppose you go up stairs and go through the boys school, do you pass thro' the school to go into that entry? - No, you go down; the committee-room is down below.</p>
               <p>Is it up one pair of stairs? - No.</p>
               <p>How far is that entry from the girls school? - A good bit.</p>
               <p>There is no door, but the door of the school-room? - The parlour-door as you go into the entry.</p>
               <p>Then, as you go through the parlour, you go through the committee-room, without going into the boys school? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This entry is not up one pair of stairs then? - No, down by the committee-room.</p>
               <p>Now, how far is the committee-room from the kitchen? - Three or four yards.</p>
               <p>You say that was about five in the afternoon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect who was in the kitchen at that time, or who was about the house? - My mistress's daughters were below stairs, he went and shut the door.</p>
               <p>Was your mistress below stairs then? - No, she was up in the school minding the girls.</p>
               <p>You did not make any noise the second time more than the first? - No.</p>

               <p>Till your sister found it out you did not speak of this to any body? - Mrs. Pearce<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150006"></xptr> would not let me go to school, she sent one on the other side of the water to my mother.</p>

               <p>Did she say how long a distance of time it was between the first and second time? - There were three times, twice in one day; he shut the door, he thought he heard somebody coming; he came again, and shoved her up against the boys wainscot, and wiped her with a red and white handkerchief: I told Mrs. Pearce, and she told my mother.</p>

               <p>When was that? - Of the Saturday; the day after my sister and I went together; we would not go in either of us; he begged and prayed we would tell him where my mother was; I said she was at work on the other side the water; I could not tell whether she had done work or no; he asked where my father was; I said, I believe he is at work; he said, I beg for my sake you will tell me where your mother or father is, for I shall not rest all night.</p>

               <p>You wash for the school I believe? - I do not: her mother is a poor woman; has a back room in my house; as her mother was out at work I washed the child's shifts now and then; I saw something upon it; I thought the child had a sore; the child was very loth to go to school, and played a truant a great while.</p>
               <p>About what time was it you made the observation? - I reckon it must be about nine months ago.</p>

               <p>Was the linen shewn to you at any subsequent time? - I used to wash it; the child had played a truant a great while; I told her father and mother; they used to beat the child unmercifully, because she did not go to school; I could not bear to hear it, so I did not tell them the last time; I told her she must go to school: her sister was about washing her linen; she saw something; she told me, and I told her mother.</p>
               <p>Was the linen shewn to you the second time? - I did see it, but I did not mind it at all; I am a single person; I did not take notice.</p>

               <p>Where did you examine her? - At the Justice's house.</p>
               <p>When was it? - On Saturday the 20th of last month I think.</p>
               <p>You will speak as a fair man what observation you made upon it. - I was sent for by the Justice, that he desired to speak with me; when I went I found Mr. Russen and the parties there; the Justice told me the case, and desired me to examine the girl, which I did accordingly did: it did not appear to me that there had been any violence used; there was not the least laceration that I could porceive; and, if I understood right, there was a young man there that said he was a surgeon, that the Justice knew something of, at the time, that was with me; I desired him that he would introduce his finger into the pudenda; the child could not bear it; we both agreed, that no violence had been used.</p>
               <p>Do you mean by that, that there had been no offer of violence; was there no appearance that any violence had been offered the child? - There was no laceration.</p>
               <p>Probably not, at that distance of time; but was there no mark of any violence of any sort? - None that I perceived.</p>
               <p>Did you recollect how long that was from the time that the girl alledged that she had been ill used? - I remember the child said, she had been ill used about last January; I then blamed her for not speaking of it; she gave me no satisfactory answer.</p>
               <p>If there had been any inflammation, it would have subsided before that time, and nature would have provided for any laceration; it would have healed? - It would.</p>

               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Had she any appearance of that disorder upon her? - No.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. If any man had entered the child's body, must not the hymen have been broke? - Yes, and a large effusion of blood would follow it.</p>
               <p>Upon that person's introducing his finger she cried out? - Yes; she cried out, and I desired the young man to desist; she could not bear it.</p>
               <p>Though it was done as gently as possible? - Yes.</p>

               <p>How long have you known Mr. Russen? - near 20 years.</p>
               <p>What has been his general character from that time to this? - For the latter part of his time I can say but little about it, for the time that I knew him, when he did business for me, he was always a man of good character, as far as I know; I have known little about him of late, no farther than seeing him occasionally.</p>

               <p>Was he absent from it a month in the whole? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>JURY. Did you keep no holidays at Christmas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What time did you open your school again in January? - A fortnight.</p>
               <p>What day? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Russen in the school when the children came the first time after the holidays? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He was well and attended his duty then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he relapse after that? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Do you remember his having a fore throat and fever? - Yes; the beginning of February.</p>
               <p>Was not he confined with that? - Yes; he kept his bed.</p>
               <p>Can you tell how often you attended for him? - No; when he sent for me I came.</p>
               <p>Then you did not live in the house?  - No; my principal business was to go with the children to church on Sundays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and saints days.</p>
               <p>Then there might be no school for what you know the other days of the week? - No.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. Russen might be confined and not attend the school without your knowing it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Could he have been confined two months without your knowing it; at those times when he did not attend himself, did you always attend for him? - Yes, when he sent for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150012"></xptr>Did he usually send for you when he could not attend himself? - Yes.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. I must refer to the worshipful Justice Wilmot to set that matter right, his worship knows according to the rules of the school.</p>
               <p>COURT. If after the children came to school again after the holidays he had been confined for a month or six weeks, could that have been without your knowing it? - I believe he always sent to me if he wanted me.</p>
               <p>Did you attend for him six weeks together after the children came to school again? - No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you usher of this school? - No further than seeing the children to church on Sundays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and saints days.</p>
               <p>JURY. Is there any other usher besides you? - No.</p>
               <p>Then who attended the school in the prisoner's sickness; did you attend the school for a week together? - No.</p>
               <p>JURY. I suppose the boys must have somebody to look after them in the absence of the prisoner? - I believe Mr. Russen begged leave of Justice Wilmot for the school to be alone for so long a time; Mr. Russen told me that he had begged leave for a week or two of Justice Wilmot.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. At Christmas we give them the Christmas week and a fortnight, which advanced pretty far in January, during which time I was very bad; at the end of that time I sent for Mr. Hawkins, one of the trustees, and consulted him what I should do; I was not able to keep the school; he said, it was better to give the boys a fortnight longer holidays, rather than have any difficulty in the school; the fortnight holidays were granted, which brought me into February before I opened school, which was on the second Monday in February, during which time Mr. Robbins only came to go to church; Mr. Haines attended me then at different times; my wife was brought to-bed about the 10th of January: on the other hand, the second time the girl accuses me with being in the boys entry, I was employed in the garden with three boys, who all before Justice Wilmot, Justice Spiller, Justice Durden, and Justice Bosworth, declared that I was never out of their company a moment of time while she stood in the boys entry, which was proved, and Justice Bosworth, Justice Spiller, and Justice Durden saw through the evil of it, and acquitted me from the charge; it is nothing now but a piece of spite to try me now for my life, when I was honorably acquitted by those four magistrates, and I was sent home; this was on the Tuesday after I was charged on the Saturday: Mr. Haines was at the office when the examination was, and remembers my discharge; Mr. Wilmot bid me be peaceable about the matter, and go home; this was fairly proved; Justice Durden told the prosecutors that if they ever troubled me any more, that he would imprison them for life.</p>
               <p>From the JURY to Mrs. PEARCE. Did you observe much blood upon the shift when you washed it? - I did; but it was upon the side, that is the reason why I thought it a fore.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the mother of this girl.</p>
               <p>Were you used to wash her linen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time make any observation of her linen? - No.</p>
               <p>Did she at any time make any complaint to you of any sort? - Yes; of her being fore.</p>
               <p>About what time? - Just before her birthday.</p>
               <p>COURT. How long before her birth-day? - I really cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>What did you do for her? - I gave her some fuller's earth, and she put it herself to the part.</p>
               <p>Did you examine her? - I did not.</p>
               <p>How came you not to do that? - As she was a child, I thought it was by her running, and the heat of her water.</p>
               <p>So you treated it as a common thing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it a usual circumstance to happen to children to be in that state? - Some may more than others.</p>
               <p>You never examined her yourself, nor took any more notice of her, till the prisoner was apprehended? - No.</p>
               <p>I believe, after he was apprehended, you examined the child? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long ago did you examine her? - I don't know what day.</p>
               <p>How did she appear to you at that time? - She looked very red and much inflamed.</p>
               <p>Did you take her to any surgeon? - Yes; Mr. Gilson examined her.</p>
               <p>Was that on the same day you examined her yourself? - I examined her afterwards.</p>
               <p>You thought she had chased herself with running? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. GILSON sworn.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when this girl was brought to you to be examined? - I believe it was on the 30th of September (refers to a memorandum) it was on Tuesday, September the 30th. I thought the Vagina was rather wider than I expected to have found in a girl of that age; but, upon introducing my finger, I found that the Hymen, which is a membrane that generally gives way by copulation, was not broken.</p>
               <p>Did you make any other observation? - No.</p>
               <p>Did any degree of inflammation appear? - There was a trifling inflammation.</p>
               <p>COURT. The inflammation was merely external? - Yes; there could have been no copulation, at all; as the Hymen was not broke I judged there was no immediate entrance.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean that there could be no degree of penetration without the Hymen being broke? - Very trifling.</p>
               <p>But do you say that there could be no penetration at all without the Hymen being broke? - I do; not into the body.</p>
               <p>Mr. HYMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>COURT. You are a surgeon? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I will ask you the same question I asked that gentleman; whether there can be no degree of penetration without breaking the Hymen? - It is impossible he could have entered the body half an inch without breaking the Hymen, or the Carunculae Myrtiformes; the Hymen is not in all children nor in all women.</p>
               <p>But where there is a hymen it is impossible to enter without breaking it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Has it never been known by surgeons, in their experience, that there has been a conception without breaking the Hymen? - It is impossible to admit that in the nature of things.</p>
               <p>COURT. Does that membrane cover the passage completely? - In some degree; but there is a small perforation left for the passage of the menses to come from the womb, that is left open by nature.</p>
               <p>Do you undertake to say, that there cannot be a conception without breaking it? - It is impossible without breaking through the Hymen or the membrane.</p>
               <p>How far within the Vagina is the Hymen? - About an inch or an inch and half; the Vagina may be four or five inches, according to the different make of women.</p>
               <p>I am not asking the whole length, but the depth to the Hymen; you say it is an inch or inch and half? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150016"></xptr>Then the lips of the Vagina may be penetrated to the extent of an inch and half without breaking the Hymen? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then when you say that there can be no penetration without breaking the Hymen, you mean only that they cannot pass that membrane without breaking the Hymen? - The Hymen will appear very soon upon withdrawing the outward lips, so that it is impossible for a woman to be ravished without that is broke through, it can be only an attempt.</p>
               <p>Where do you live? - In Ratcliff-highway: I was subpoenaed here as a witness.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Who by? - By Mr. Russen, to appear to his character.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>The present charge I am innocent of; it is a real combination, as it would plainly appear, if my counsel had done me justice, and opened the case as it is; there is a leading clue throughout the whole.</p>
               <p>COURT. Your counsel are not at liberty to state any matter of fact, they are permitted to examine your witnesses, and they are here to speak to any matters of law that may arise; but if your defence arises out of matter of fact, you must yourself state it to me and the jury, and we are ready to hear you.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Here is a written defence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Is it in your own hand-writing?</p>
               <p>PRISONER. No, it is a copy from my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then you must read it yourself.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. With regard to the first case?</p>
               <p>COURT. I am sorry to stop you: you must say nothing with regard to the first case; I am now trying you for having deflowered one

             gives this day, is as variously different to the account she gave before Justice Wilmot, as light to darkness; she there said, I never attempted any thing of this sort till on the 19th day of September last; now they have taken it back many months; I cannot tell what the bottom of this matter is for; I am really used exceeding ill; there is not one concurring circumstance to prove that ever I had to do with her either from the appearance of her linen. or any thing else; but one day there were three or four of these things done through a private pique of some of the gentlemen in the parish, and they have brought this to pass: her grandfather came to Newgate with a view to see me, I believe, but his conscience struck him, he would not see me; he called upon a Mr. Murphy in the ward where I was confined; he is an old acquaintance; he told Mr. Murphy that he was very sorry for the prosecution; he said, the prosecution which I am constrained to enter into against that man, so torments my conscience, that I cannot sleep night or day, but I must do it, or lose my bread; he brought up the same word as soon as Harris was gone, and the counsel, I believe, has the copy of what he said, or at least the attorney has; the grandfather of that child is bound over to prosecute me.</p>
               <p>COURT. What is his name?</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Harris; he was bound over to prosecute me.</p>
               <p>COURT. There is no such man appearing as prosecutor.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. But Justice Wilmot has been ingenious enough to alter the whole scheme; he was at Justice Durden's last Monday; he told him he was inclined to mercy, and would do all he could to throw out the indictment; but on hearing that my friends were determined to move the cause to the King's Bench, that he should not have his ends, he then made three capital charges more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you any well-grounded reason for imputing either to Mr. Wilmot, or to any one else any ill-will towards you?</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Yes, for above a twelvemonth past; Justice Wilmot about a twelvemonth ago summoned all the subscribers to vote me out of the school upon a private pique between him and I; it was about pedigree; one of the churchwardens had talked to me against his worship, and his worship against me; he tried to vote me out; he could not carry his point; and from that time to this he has set his face<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150017"></xptr> against me. A little before this happened, I had some words with the curate of the parish, reproving him for keeping bad company; the curate told the parties that I accused them of being whores and rogues; I only observed that the man that lives next door to me lives with another man's wife; that the reverend Mr. D. had a bastard child; he went to Mr. Wilmot, and went to the Commons to get a libel against me; he said, if it was possible to have my life he would have it; they told me they would make me stand in a white sheet for calling a woman a whore; upon this Mary -, the witness to the sister I had accused with taking a pair of Dresden ruffles from me, a little girl, went to the pawnbroker's to see if she could find them; when I was brought before Justice Wilmot that evening, nothing appeared of any signification, the Justice bid me go home, if I would promise to appear again on Tuesday; the curate of St. Stephen's, Mr. D -, appeared after I was dismissed by four justices of the peace, Mr. Durden, Mr. Spiller, Mr. Bosworth, and Mr. Wilmot; I was honorably acquitted of this charge; they pursued me like blood-hounds, and went round the parish, the curate and some more of them, and got a deaf, foolish girl to come and lay such a charge, and she pretended she could say I had to do with some more besides her; I went and surrendered myself to Mr. Smith of Tothillfields Bridewell; I said there was something amiss, I should be glad if he would take me as a prisoner; Mr. Smith did; the next day I sent to Justice Durden, and desired him to write to Justice Wilmot, and inform him, that if he had any thing against me, I was in custody; he sent and brought me next day before his Bench; there appeared these girls, this silly girl and the others; after I had been in prison a week, this girl was raised up through his insinuations by her grandfather, upon Justice Wilmot threatening him that if he did not conform to his will, he would turn him out of his bread; so I have been pursued for near a twelvemonth by Justice Wilmot with all venom in the world.</p>
               <p>COURT. You speak of there having been an examination before four justices of the peace? - There was.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you desired any of those justices to come here to speak for you? - No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were those examinations taken in writing? - I believe they were.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are they brought here? - I believe my attorney has them; the examinations were all taken down verbatim; they were given to Mr. Naylor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Was this girl examined there? - Not till a week after I was in prison: on the Saturday after I was confined, I with my family were turned out in the street; supposing I had been guilty, they should not have treated them in that manner; in order to prevent my getting assistance from any attorney or counsel, they stopped my money, and paid all my debts illegally, though I said I would not pay any body; I wanted the money in my present distress; I received but 6 l. 12 s. instead of 18 l. odd: Mr. Chetwood knows I sent a gentleman to retain him no longer ago than last Tuesday, because they stopped my money; they have taken every method to take away my life, and deprive me of power to help myself; I was a fortnight in Newgate before I could make any application at all; and Mr. Smith, the keeper of Tothillfields Bridewell, out of complaisance to Justice Wilmot, told him our intent, and then Mr. Wilmot, after talking of being inclined to mercy, the next day behold he found four bills against me of this sort; they were only called assaults before; they are now capital, in order to try me for my life: the reason was because on Monday he upon the bench had planned out what punishment I should have; he said he would have me stand nine times in the pillory before the school, once for every fact; no man living has been used so ill by that gentleman as I have for a whole twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>COURT. I have listened very attentively to all that you have said; I am sorry to say that it does not seem to the point; it seems to point to nothing. What witnesses do you wish to call and examine?</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Whether application was not made to the justices by the curate of the parish and Mr. D - of St. Stephen's Walbroke?</p>
               <p>COURT. The Justice being here, I dare say he will have no objection to being exaamined, and answering your questions; but<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150018"></xptr> it is a dangerous appeal; you suppose the justice not to be your friend? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you desire to have such a question asked him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. If you will give me the question I will ask it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Whether the curate of the parish; and Mr. D - of St. Stephen's Walbroke, did not apply to him for an action against me?</p>
               <p>COURT. That is foreign to this business; any thing that belongs to the subject of these accusations, I shall gladly enquire into, but as to quarrels between you and other persons coming before a justice, that has no connection at all with this subject.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. It was proved by a surgeon that stands here, that I was the whole time in bed at the time of the first charge against me; with regard to the second, it was proved I was not out of their company at the time she charged me.</p>
               <p>COURT. If you desire to have any question asked of Mr. Wilmot respecting this charge, I will ask it.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. The whole parish have been incensed against me from the report given out at Justice Wilmot's office; there is no other foundation in the world for it.</p>
               <p>COURT. If there was such a thing I should be glad to assist you in tracing it, but all that you have said upon this subject is very vague, indeed it points to nothing.</p>
               <p>COURT to the counsel. Have you any witnesses for the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Prisoner. Only to his character.</p>
               <p>COURT. They have been examined before.</p>

               <p>Did he ask you at any other time to go with him any where? - He used to tell me where to meet him; to go and meet him at St. Paul's church, and from thence to the Lock.</p>
               <p>Did he repeat this at any other time? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Were you examined by any surgeon? - Yes, the surgeon in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him when he offered you this violence in the coach? - I desired he would not do it; I tried to get away, but could not.</p>
               <p>You said you did not cry out? - No, I tried to get away, but I could not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you observe any appearance upon your linen after the first time? - No; he wiped me with his handkerchief as soon as he had done.</p>
               <p>Where do you say it was that this fact was done? - In the coach coming along.</p>
               <p>You never told any body till he was taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>How long was it before he was taken up? - I believe it is about two months ago since it happened.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was the coach at that time? - I don't know; it was along the streets.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177710150019"></xptr>Don't you know in what part of the town It was? - No.</p>
               <p>Was the coach standing still, or going along? - Going along.</p>
               <p>Were the windows up or down? - Up.</p>
               <p>What sort of windows were they? - Glass windows.</p>
               <p>What time of the day? - It was in the evening.</p>
               <p>Was it light or dark? - The lamps were lighted.</p>
               <p>You say he took up your petticoats and entered your body, are you sure of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What else did you perceive, did you feel any thing? - I felt something come from him into my body.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. I should be glad your Lordship would ask who bid her say that, she did before the Justice declare the contrary.</p>
               <p>COURT. Who told you to say so? - Nobody; I said it of myself; when I was before Justice Wilmot, I did not know what he meant.</p>
               <p>Did you say before Justice Wilmot that nothing came from him? - I understand better now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Who has explained it to you since? - Nobody.</p>
               <p>Mr. GILSON sworn.</p>
               <p>Did you examine this girl? - Yes, on the 2d of October.</p>
               <p>What sort of observation did you make? - I was of opinion that force had been used, there was a laceration of the parts.</p>

               <p>Was the Hymen entire or broke? - It was broke.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the girl's mother.</p>
               <p>When did she make any complaint to you of this? - Not till the defendant had been in custody, that was the first I knew of it.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Relate the manner in which your daughter told you of it.</p>
               <p>She came in a sad fright, and said her master was taken up; that surprized me, as I always took the gentleman to be a worthy man; she kept urging me to know what sodomy was, somebody had told her master was taken up for sodomy; I did not satisfy her: at last she said there were 6 of the boys and 6 of the girls at the office; I could not discover what that could be; to make short, she said at last, if it is for meddling with the girls, I am afraid it is true; I did not let that word drop; I insisted to know what she meant by it; then she said he had used her very ill coming from the Lock, and she confessed how he had used her the last time she was with him at the Lock; she related the matter to me much in the manner she has related now; she has never been with him since; she told me it was the last time that she went with him; she had been used to go with him often.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. Did you, upon being told this, go to the justice? - It was a neighbour next door told the girl first of it; I ran to the office about 4 o'clock; there was no one there; I went next morning and made a complaint.</p>
               <p>No one solicited you, you went and made the complaint upon what you had heard from the mouth of your daughter? - Yes, I did indeed; I had no thoughts of asking her such a question of Mr. Russen.</p>
               <p>PRISONER. Whether any body told you any thing besides your daughter? - Concerning my daughter no one did, I have had it from her mouth and no one else.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the Crown. How has your daughter behaved herself with you; she lives with you, does not she? - She always did: she has behaved like a sober, honest child; she is rather babyish of her age, and Mr. Russen must be sensible of that; she is not womanish at all of her age.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I can say no more of this than the rest, it is all of a piece: the examination before Justice Wilmot of this girl was different to what it is now; Justice Wilmot himself was my author, that she told him in his private room, that I asked her to let me have her maiden-head; she said, I might if I would; so, he said, here is consent; this is nothing then: after that she charged me with entering her body; she declared upon oath then, that I never did enter her body: his worship sits there and hears what I say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Are you desirous that I should ask him that question?</p>
               <p>PRISONER. I beg your Lordship will.</p>

               <p>Did she declare, that she gave her consent? - No, she did not say any such words; she did not then declare, that he entered her body; she said, he lay upon her; she said, that she was with him in a coach coming from the Lock, and he asked for her maiden-head; she refused, or rather did not understand what he meant by it; she did not say, that she gave her consent; but she said, she did not cry out; she said, he lay upon her; but she did not declare, that he entered her body: I told the parties, that no one need be bound over, for it did not appear capital, as she did not say her body was entered.</p>

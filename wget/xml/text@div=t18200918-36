I thought I could have reached the door-post, to have drawn myself into the shop, and tried all I could to do so, but they prevented me. I found my arms raised up, and several of them were close round me. About this time I felt somebody pulling at my watch - I was desirous of getting my hand down to prevent its going. The tugging still continued, and I saw by the muscles of the person's face that he was doing it with great force, I then felt it go; and the next moment the party who drew the watch out turned round and quitted.</p>
               <p>Q. How many do you suppose there were - A. I was much alarmed, and unable to count them, but suppose there were twenty or more. They threw themselves into the crowd, so as not to leave me altogether, by which means they concealed each other from my view - they ran away. I could only see the shoulders of two or three of them. I instantly walked into the shop and told of my robbery, and while I was so doing Taylor came in, and threw my pocket-book on the counter - till then I did not know that I had lost it, I then felt, missed it from my inside coat-pocket, and knew it to be mine - nothing had been taken out. I have never recovered my watch; it was worth 35 l. with its appendages. The pocket-book contained a receipt for 287 l. 10 s., which I was carrying to my banker's, to receive the money that day - it was to be paid on the production of that receipt; there were also seven 1 l. notes and some loose papers. I lost my purse from my right-hand breeches pocket, with 15 s. in it. I have no knowledge of the prisoners, they were both apprehended in about a minute after, Taylor produced the pocket-book. It happened between eleven and twelve o'clock, just as Sheriff Parkins's carriage was going by with the procession.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. James's, Clerkenwell. On the 15th of August, as the City were going up with their address to the Queen, I was on the alert with other officers, and took particular notice of a gang and followed them from the corner of Bridge-street, Fleet-street, as I knew several of them. I saw them what they call ramping every gentleman as they went on. They kept rather a-head of the Sheriffs' carriage; they kept the foot pavement to themselves. When they came to the end of Southampton-street I heard Mr. Middleton cry out</p>
               <p>"The scoundrel has got my watch!" I was then in the middle of the road close to the Sheriffs' horses. Mr. Middleton was surrounded by them. I saw them all in a cluster together. I think he was dragged off the foot pavement. I made an effort to get to assist Colton, who was with me - he had got hold of the person who robbed Mr. Middleton. As I was forcing my way in I saw a pocket-book come from a man, who, to all appearance, was Hopkins; he said,</p>
               <p>"Here, take it!" - it was thrown up above the height of a man. To the best of my knowledge it was Hopkins - it was not the man whom Colton had hold of, but to the best of my judgment the prisoner is the man, but I will not swear it. The book fell down, and I scrambled in among them and picked it up - the person it was meant for missed it. I was making my way out from them, and they sung out</p>
               <p>"Chiv him!" which means to use their knives. I got a cut over the knuckle, my hand was all over blood. I then got the pocket-book into my breast. Two or three persons said the gentleman was in the shop, I went in and found the prosecutor there. He described the contents, it was returned to me, I have had it ever since. I then found Smith in custody of Colton and Gook, we took him to Bow-street, and got him secured, we then went after Hopkins, and found him at Kensington with the same gang, opposite the Sheriff's coach. I pointed him out to Gook, and said,</p>
               <p>"That is the man." As soon as he saw me he kept dropping out of the gang. I said</p>
               <p>"I think he wants to be off" - we went into the mob and took him, he was walking away very quick. I told him what it was for, he said he knew nothing of it, and was not there. We found nothing on him, and took him him to Bow-street. I did not see him with the gang till we came to Kensington, as I did not get up with the head of the gang till then, but we overtook them about Knights-bridge, they were then keeping at the head of the Sheriff's carriage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What time did you first see the Sheriff's carriage at Bridge-street - A. I should think between ten and eleven. The gang kept in a body by themselves.</p>

            . I am a broker. I was in company with Taylor before the procession came - we went into Fleet-street, and saw the gang waiting; we proceeded on to Southampton-street - I kept my eye on them. I saw them lay hold of a gentleman about the middle of the Strand, who escaped from them. I then told Taylor to be on his guard, and in about two minutes I observed they had got a gentleman up in the corner, it was Mr. Middleton. There was a board round a house which was repairing, which obliged persons to pass out of the great path; they got the gentleman in the corner, on the footpath; I pushed in among them, and heard one of them say,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, do you mean to rob me?" and trying to get the pocket-book into his side-pocket - it was the prosecutor's book. The man put it into his pocket as if he was in danger - it was neither of the prisoners. There were twenty-five or twenty-six in the gang, as near as I can tell, and were all young men, and many of them genteelly dressed. The man could not get the book into his pocket, being rather thick, he put it under his arm. I collared and held him, he lifted up his arm to strike me, and then the book fell. I was struck, knocked down several times, and got injured. What became of the book I do not know. The corner was rather clear for a short time. After I got out I went in pursuit of Smith - I am sure he was among the gang. I did not notice the prisoner, Hopkins. - I got hold of Smith as he went on, he was about the last of the gang. I got him down Cecil-street - all the rest of the gang immediately came down to rescue him, and cried out,</p>
               <p>"Chiv him." Several of them who knew me before pointed to me. I had a pistol of Taylor's, and with that I kept them off, detained Smith, and took him away, with assistance, to Bow-street. The gang all left. I am positive I had seen Smith endeavouring to prevent the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182009180021"></xptr>prosecutor from getting into the shop. We afterwards followed, and got up with the gang about the half-way house, they were then rather before the Sheriff's carriage - Taylor pointed Hopkins out, he immediately dropped back, slackened his pace, and separated himself from the gang. Taylor seized him, and gave him to Gook.</p>

I met the procession opposite Somerset House, and saw the prosecutor at the time, the gang surrounded him; I saw Smith keeping them up with his shoulders as they surrounded the prosecutor. I saw the prosecutor's coat turned up, but did not see the pocket-book taken out; he was close to the prosecutor - one man was half between them, and he was keeping that man up to Mr. Middleton, who called out,</p>
               <p>"You have got my watch, you rascal;" or words to that effect. I then heard a cry of he has got the book. I saw Colton knocked down in the mob, and ran to his assistance - there was a call of Stop him! Stop him. I saw Smith running round the board from where he had been, I ran round a waggon, and caught him as he ran away. The gang were rather behind him in a body, when I took him. Considerable resistance was made, but Colton had recovered, pulled out a pistol, and they left - we secured him. I went on to Kensington, and took Hopkins, whom Taylor pointed out.

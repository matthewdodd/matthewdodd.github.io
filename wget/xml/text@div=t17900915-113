I said, I believed I could: he was a stranger to me: I put my hand in my pocket, intending to do so: he gave me a shilling that I have got here now; I looked at it, and told him it was a bad one; it looked a good one on the face of it: he stood arguing about it: I said, it was a bad one: Spinosa came up: I gave the prisoner the shilling again: Spinosa asked me what was the matter; I told him: Spinosa knew him; and he took the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179009150153"></xptr>shilling out of the prisoner's hand: he was searched, and a great deal more found about him; I have had the shilling ever since: he was committed: Spinosa gave it me.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner: I took the shilling from the prisoner: I searched him, and found sixteen shillings, a half crown, and four six-pences. On the 18th of August Fonseca went with me to serve a warrant in Thames-street; I went to look for my prisoner; I came back, and saw the prisoner, and Fonseca, and two or three; I asked what was the matter? he told me the prisoner had asked him for two sixpences for a shilling, and that it was a bad one; it was then in the prisoner's hand; I took it out, and I said, Mr. Badley, you are on your old tricks; I searched him, and found some more bad silver: he said, he bought it for four shillings and a penny, and was going to Cox, the refiner's; I marked the shilling with the head of my staff, across; I kept it till the 20th, then I returned it to Fonseca; I gave it him when the prisoner was committed; I should know it again. (Deposes to the shilling.)</p>

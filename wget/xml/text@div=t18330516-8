             had hold of the tails of his coat, one tail in each hand, he (Cooper) was stooping; Davis was trying to get out of the stable; they were in the stable, and the door of the stable was open; Davis succeeded in getting away, and left the tails of his coat in the hands of the deceased; Cooper then fell on his right side- my window is about eighteen yards from the stable - I could see as I stood there a little blood on Cooper's smockfrock - when Davis got away my husband went down stairs- Cooper looked up at me while Davis was making away towards Bloomsbury-court, and made an exclamation - I can't say whether the exclamation was loud enough for the prisoner to hear, I heard it from my window - Davis was about as far from him as I was - I heard it quite distinctly, he said, "O God! George has shot me" - I went down to Cooper to the stable-door - I saw him last Sunday at his own house in 37, Brownlow-street, Holborn, dead - I am certain he is the same man as I saw in the stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Your window is eighteen yards from the stable? A. Yes, as near as I can tell - had heard no quarrel, nor any noise, before I heard the report - I had been at the window about five minutes before, but was not there when I heard the report; I went to the window when I heard it - they were in the stable, I could see distinctly into the stable, they were about the corn-bin, dragging towards the door - I saw John Burrows come out, he was there at the time - I have seen Cooper day after day, living in the neighbourhood for three years - I am certain I afterward saw the same man at Brownlow-street - I had been to the window, and asked Cooper what was o'clock; it was half-past five when he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a stick in his hand when you saw him in the stable? A. I never saw him with one - at the time he made the exclamation, the prisoner was going to make his way down Bloomsbury-court; he had not turned the corner, he had got across the road - I knew the prisoner by sight before - I did not observe his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Your reason for saying he is the man then, is from seeing the skirts of his coat torn? A. Yes, and I knew him well before.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You saw the deceased go into the stable about half-past five, he had no stick then? A. No; I had seen the prisoner go into the stable that morning; I saw his face then, and saw him endeavouring to get from the person who was holding the skirts of his coat, and am perfectly certain he is the man.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. On the morning of the 2nd of May, I remember hearing the report of a pistol; I was up stairs in my room with the window open - my wife was at the window; immedilately after hearing the report I heard an exclamation twice over, "Oh Lord, Oh God, George has shot me!" I went to the window (it was while I was at the window I heard him cry out) - I saw the prisoner run out of the stable-door into the street, wanting to make his escape; I opened my loft-door and looked out, and saw him running away with the pistol in his hand - I went down to Cooper's assistance, and went for a doctor, and when I was at Mr. Ireland's, the doctor's door, I saw the policemen bringing the prisoner back; that was 600 or 700 yards from the stable in Hart-street; I observed the skirts of his coat were torn off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you known the prisoner before? A. Yes; I have lived opposite for two years and a half; and I knew Cooper before - I did not hear the least noise or words before I heard the report - I saw no stick in the deceased's hands when I came out, nor did I see a stick near the door.</p>

            . On the 2nd of May, I was in the service of the prisoner's father. His father had told me to come to work that morning - I sleep in the stables - I was cleaning the horses about half-past five that morning; the deceased came to the stable at the same time, which was his usual hour - I did not see the prisoner about at that time, but about five or ten minutes after the deceased came in, the prisoner came in and was standing against the corn-bin - the prisoner said to me how long have you been up? I said I had just got up; he said it only wanted a quarter to six; the deceased made answer, "it wants half an hour to it yet, Sir:" and that was all that passed between them - Cooper stooped down to lace up his boot, and the prisoner took and fired at him immediately as he was stooping to lace up his boot - I did not see the pistol till after he had shot him - I was in the same stable as they were - Cooper had no stick when he came in; he used no stick at all at any time - he did not attempt to strike the prisoner with anything - he was in the act of stooping to lace his boot - when I heard the report I turned round immediately, and saw the prisoner running out of the stable-door with the pistol in his hand - the deceased had hold of the tails of his coat; he dragged the deceased to the stable-door - the door is about twenty yards, as near as possible, from the spot I first saw them at - when I turned round on hearing the report, the deceased had not hold of the skirts of his coat, he was going to run away, and then the deceased took hold of the tail of his coat; he dragged the deceased to the stable-door - the prisoner got away, leaving the tails of his coat in the deceased's hands - I heard the deceased say, "Oh Lord!" putting his hand to his left arm; I could not see whether he was wounded - Mr. and Mrs. Ward were the first that came over; Mr. Ward was the first - the deceased was lying outside the stable, just by the stable-door - the prisoner was brought back in about two minutes by two policemen - the deceased was immediately taken to the hospital - I went before the Coroner's Inquest and saw the body of the deceased; it was the same man as I had seen in the stable; he was wounded in his left thigh; the inquest was held at the Middlesex hospital.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You were in the stable when the deceased came first in the morning? A. Yes; I was cleaning a horse at the time the prisoner came in; he placed himself at the corn-bin; which is about a yard from where I was - I was engaged at the stall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the horse and the stall between you and the party? A. Yes; there was no conversation between the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160014"></xptr>prisoner and deceased as to whether he was not too late; he said it was a quarter to six, and the deceased said to me, it wants half an hour to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the deceased doing anything to the prisoner? A. No; I saw no scuffle at all - I heard the report of the pistol and came out of the stall.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot say whether the pistol went off by accident? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. If there had been any scuffling or any stick used, must you have observed it? A. Yes; there was no stick used, nor any scuffling.</p>

             (policeman E 97). I knew the prisoner before this - on the 2d of May, between five and six o'clock, I was in Holborn, between Lion-street and Bloomsbury-court - I was about two hundred yards from the prisoner's father's stable, and heard the report of fire-arms; it seemed to come from Silver-street, from the stables - I proceeded to the corner of Lion-street, and on turning round I saw the prisoner running from his father's stable- I did not observe anything in his hand - I ran into Holborn and saw the prisoner cross Holborn; I went right against him, and caught hold of his hand and took him into custody; I did not then know what had occurred - I brought him back to the stable, and saw the deceased lying on his right side, a little within the stable-door - when I took the prisoner, I said, George, what have you done? he said, "I have done nothing;" that was when I first came up to him; I searched him on the spot, and found a pistol under his left arm; I took him back to the stable, and then, for the first time, saw Cooper lying in the stable-door - I saw his left arm apparently black and burnt with powder - the pistol was not loaded; I looked at the pan; the flint was down, and it had been recently discharged - the pistol was under his left arm, in the inside of his coat - I did not notice the deceased's leftthigh until he was taken to the hospital - when I brought the prisoner back, I stooped down and said to the deceased, loud enough for the prisoner to hear, Thomas, what is the matter? (I did not see any blod at all) he said, "George has shot me, I give him in charge:" I afterwards took the prisoner to the station-house in George-street, Bloomsbury, and searched him further, and found two leaden bullets in his right-hand trousers pocket - I found nothing else - nobody else searched him in my presence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you got the tail of the coat? A. No, I have seen a powder-flask in possession of Driver, another constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I see this pistol is in very bad condition, it is impossible to keep it at the full cock? A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it very likely to go off by accident? A. You cannot keep it back at full cock; I had known the deceased for the last eight months - when I took the prisoner he looked very wild; I have on many occasions observed something extraordinary in his manner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed circumstances so extraordinary as to induce you to give information to his father? A. Yes, I have done so, on two occasions.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you previously seen him go about the street with a brace of pistols in his hand? A. Never with a brace - he had a pistol, but it was out of repair - there was no hammer to it - I once saw him dressed in a long cap - three or four months before this it was a cocked hat- I have not seen him about the streets with different figures on his arm.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him in the cocked hat, did you consider him a person of sane mind? A. No; I consider he very often acted like a madman when he got beer - I cannot say but that when I have seen him in his sober moments he always conducted himself well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether for some time after he has been in a state of intoxication his conduct was that of a man of sound or unsound mind? A. He always avoided me when he was sober - on this morning his manner appeared quite wild - it was about half-past five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were induced to make a communication to his father, was he drunk or sober? A. He neither appeared drunk nor sober, he had been drinking - his conduct was so extraordinary then as to induce me to make a communication to his father.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He then appeared neither drunk nor sober, but as if he had been drinking? A. Yes, he was in the habit of drinking at times - sometimes to excessbut I never saw him rolling drunk - I have seen him in a kind of stupid drunken way, he could walk very well; when he had the cocked hat on he appeared to me more drunk than I had ever seen him before - on the morning in question, he did not appear to be drunk nor sober; he appeared as if he had been drinking, a sort of stale drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. That is, as if part of the debauch had left him and he was recovering himself? A. Yes, apparently - I never saw him conduct himself different to other persons when he was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, when sober did he appear to you a man who knew right from wrong? A. He appeared so, but I never had much conversation with him when sober - all the observations I made on his conduct as extraordinary were on occasions when he was either drunk or had been drinking - this pistol will go off at half cock - (trying it); it requires the trigger to be pulled - it will not go off of itself - when I took it from him the pan was entirely down - if I let go of the cock at full cock without meddling with the trigger, it will go to half cock, but only to that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160015"></xptr>- that would not discharge the pistol - but if I put my finger to the trigger at half or at full cock, it will go off.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. A pistol made property will never go off at half cock? A. No; but this can be fired at half cock.</p>


               <p>ROBERT DRIVER. I am a policeman. I produce a powder-flask which I found in a coat pocket which I got from the deceased; it was the tail of the coat - he gave it to me about ten minutes before six, before he was taken to the Middlesex Hospital - I also produce the other part of the coat which I took off the prisoner at Hatton-garden the same day; the tails agree with the top of the coat and have formed part of it.</p>

            . I am the house-surgeon of the Middlesex Hospital. On the morning of Thursday, the 2nd of May, the deceased was brought to the hospital about half-past six - I examined him a short time afterwards, and found a gun-shot wound on the left thigh, and the upper left arm slightly grazed, apparently by the same ball; it was the interior part of the upper arm, which was quite a superficial wound, not of any serious consequence - the wound in the thigh had penetrated the skin and muscles by the lower part of the upper third of the thigh - the ball had struck against the bone, and pursued its course up the thigh immediately in contact with the bone; the ball remained in the thigh - the grazing in the arm must have been from the ball first striking the arm and penetrating the thigh; if the man was lacing up his boot or shoe that might happen - I did not at first consider it a dangerous wound; it was attended with a certain degree of danger, but I thought he would ultimately recover - a gun-shot wound is very likely to bring on erysipelas; the contused wounds are peculiarly likely to be followed by erysipelas - he went on tolerably well until the Saturday, and then he had an attack of erysipelas, which I should imagine was produced by the wound he had received by the ball; he died on Wednesday morning, the 8th of May - the erysipelas was undoubtedly the cause of his death - the ball was extracted from the thigh the same morning - I discovered nothing at that time that led me to suppose he would be attacked with erysipelas except the gun-shot wound.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many years have you been in the profession? A. Five; the situation of house-surgeon of the hospital is frequently held by students - I have not seen many cases of gun-shot wounds - erysipelas was certainly the approximate cause of his death - he died of erysipelas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time discover any thing to induce you to think he was a person likely to be attacked with erysipelas? A. I did discover appearances which would be likely to produce erysipelas - I have seen a great many cases of erysipelas; it is a complaint, the external appearances of which, frequently come on suddenly, the subject being previously pre-disposed to such a complaint, and when it does appear, death has followed in as short a time as it did with the deceased when there has been no wound.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether, at the post mortem examination, from the constitutional appearances you observed, might not death have happened from erysipelas, and that erysipelas arise independent of the gun-shot wound? A. Certainly, it might; but I cannot say it did.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. In your judgment, was it in this case produced by the constitutional causes you observed, or by the gun-shot wound? A. It was produced by the gun-shot wound; but I should say the man was pre-disposed for it, from the chronic disease which I found on the post mortem examination - in the state of chronic disease I found him, he would be more likely to be attacked with erysipelas if he received a gun-shot wound than without it; erysipelas would be more likely to follow a gun-shot wound with a person so situated than one in good health - the appearances I disovered after death, warranted the conclusion that he would be a likely subject for erysipelas, and more likely to be attacked with it if wounded than another man.</p>

               <p>MR. LEE. Q. Is there anything to show a medical man when death arises from erysipelas alone, or when it has been produced by a gun-shot wound? A. I have never been able to distinguish - I have seen but very few gun-shot wounds.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the chronic disorder you discovered from which erysipelas might be called into action? A. He had chronic inflammation of the lining membrane of the air tubes - he had a disease of the valves of the heart on the left side, and of those immediately at the commencement of the large artery leading from the heart - one of the membranes of the brain presented also an unhealthy appearance; this last I believe is frequently caused by the agonies of death - that is all I observed.</p>
               <p>Q.Supposing the wound had not taken place, were there any appearances from which you should have said the death would have originated? A. Not at the precise time at which it took place - not in so quick time certainly.</p>
               <p>EDWARD PRING (policeman). I went to the spot between half-past five and twenty minutes to six, with Cayford - I saw Cayford come up to the prisoner, and take the pistol from him; I assisted in taking him to the stable- I saw the deceased.</p>

            . I lodged with my father and mother, at 21, Little Russell-street, Bloomsbury. On the morning of the 2nd of May I was at a public-house in Broad-street, St. Giles', at half-past five - I have known the prisoner many years - he was at the public-house that morning drinking gin; he had a half-pint measure and a glass; I had one glass with him - he showed me a powder-horn and two bullets, and told me he was going to make away with himself; I laughed at him, because he had said so once or twice before, and I took no notice of it - he was rather in liquor, but not drunk; he has not been in liquor when he made these observations before - he used to get tipsy; that was pretty well his habit - I afterwards left, and he overtook me at the corner of Museum-street; he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160016"></xptr>good bye, I said good bye, and opened my master's door and went in - he was then not drunk, but in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have heard him threaten to destroy himself when sober, as well as in liquor? A. Yes, he has said it in our shop at Mr. Blandford's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing at all to say - I don't recollect anything about it.</p>

            . I am a collar-maker, and live in Bloomsbury-court, Holborn. I have known the prisoner upwards of sixteen years - I have observed a difference in his conduct within the last three months; he has passed me at times and never noticed me, though I have known him so long and we have never had any words; that was about three months ago - I have observed nothing of the sort except for the last six weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. From the conduct you have observed, have you formed an opinion of his unsoundness of mind? A. I did, and named it to his father; the last time I had occasion to communicate anything to his father was about three days before the 2nd of May - I recollect the prisoner coming into the work-shop of Mr. Paliser, a harness-maker, in Finsbury-pavement, about three weeks ago from this time; there were two men at work there - I observed his paleness and a wildness about his eye which made me mention it to the shopmen.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way had he come into the shop? A. When he came in he said, "Halloo Harry," in a friendly way, holding out his hand - I said, "Halloo George, who should have thought of seeing you here" - he said, he had left his father - I said I was sorry to hear it; and said "Never mind, George, we will go and have a drop of beer;" we went together and had two pints of half-and-half, and he told me he was going to shoot himself.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. At this time was he working with his father, and living with him? A. He had been, but it appears he left him that morning - I don't know how soon he went back again; I have not been to the beer-shop with him lately.</p>
               <p>Q. When you observed the paleness, and wildness in conversation, was he drunk? A. I cannot say he was drunk; I should say he was sober - I cannot say he had not been drinking.</p>
               <p>Q.Don't you know he is a dissipated young man? A. I know he will drink - I never heard that he was a dissipated character.</p>
               <p>Q.Constantly intoxicated? A. I don't know that he was constantly intoxicated; I believe he has been so frequently lately.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you observe anything extraordinary or wild in his conduct or features till he began to drink? A. I don't know that I have.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE. Q. You have observed the wild appearance and manner about him at the time he was sober? A. I think I have.</p>

            . I am the wife of John Forward, who works for Mr. Fender of Holborn. I have known the prisoner seven or eight years - I have observed a difference in his conduct within the last month, and consider his conduct that of a man of unsound mind - I remember his coming to my house; I think it was three weeks or a month ago, and he seemed not to be in a sound of mind at all; he said he was going to make away with himself; he seemed to me in a very queer state of mind - he did not attempt to do anything that night, but a night or two afterward he called and appeared strange; he took up my husband's razor and said he would go and make away with himself - I and my husband took it from him by force - about a week after this he had a tidy velveteen jacket but not a new one, and he parted with it for an old tattered one and fancied himself a sailor.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had you frequent opportunities of seeing his conduct and behaviour? A. Yes, I lodge over the stable where the man was shot - he was not in the habit of drinking that I know of; I never saw him - I never knew him in the habit of drinking - I saw him very often when he has been at work for his father; he has left his father's employ about ten days; they were not on good terms.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath has not his father refused to see him in consequence of his dissipated and drunken habits, and don't you know it? I know he seemed in an insane state of mind - I never heard that he was dismissed his father's employ in consequence of dissipated and drunken habits.</p>
               <p>Q. About three weeks ago he took up a razor and said he would kill himself, is that what induced you to think he was of unsound mind? A. Yes; he was working for his father at that time - I did not communicate this to his father at that time - I told my husband, George could not be sound in his mind - I did not communicate my opinion to his father till after the man was shot; his father let him go about the street and do his work as usual - I thought he could not be sound in mind, because he talked of destroying himself or shooting himself - I never saw him attempt to destroy himself; I only speak from what I have heard him say - I don't know whether he had quarrelled with his father at those times - I suppose they had been quarrelling, he looked in a strange state of mind.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him drunk in your life? A. I did not say that.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, the last time you saw him before he was taken up, was he not drunk? A. He was very strange to me; I do not know whether he was drunk or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell whether he was drunk on any other occasion when you say he looked strange and seemed wild? A. I do not know; I have not seen his father to-day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you seen him employed by his father just before this happened? A. Not for ten days; till then he was working for his father and keeping the accounts.</p>

            . I am the husband of the last witness. I have known the prisoner between seven and eight years - I have worked with him for his father - I first observed a difference in his conduct about a month or six weeks ago- I frequently saw him at my house; he always looked wild.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you observed this wild appearance when you have known him to be sober? A. Yes, I have; I was going to shave myself in my apartment, and took the razor from him - he got it to destroy himself; I took it from him, and told him if he wanted a razor to go home to his father and get his father's - I was present when a jacket was disposed of, it was not a very good one nor very old - he parted with it for a ragged one and said he was a sailor.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183305160017"></xptr>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing whether he was sound or unsound in mind? A.Unsound mind.</p>
               <p>CLARKSON. Q. When did you first observe this unsoundness of mind? A. In my apartment; I told him if he wanted to destroy himself, to get his father's razor and not mine - I don't know whether his father has a razor; I am neither barber nor clerk; I don't know whether the prisoner shaves himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you went to his father and told him his son was of unsound mind? A. I saw him to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. And told him to get his father's razor if he wanted to cut his throat? A. Of course - I did not tell his father he was unsound in mind, and unfit to keep his accounts - I told him nothing of this till after the prisoner was charged with this offence; his father lives at No. 40, Museum-street; I lodge over the stable - I saw his father sometimes twenty or thirty times a day - I have not worked for him for the last four years - I have had frequent opportunities of seeing the prisoner's conduct during the last three weeks or a month; I saw him at the stable every day - I have seen him driving a cart, and about his usual occupation, but still he looked wild - I have drank with him; the last time was four or five days before he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was he not in the constant habit of getting drunk? A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you seen him drunk often? A. I cannot say anything about it; I never saw a drunken man unless he could neither stand nor walk.</p>

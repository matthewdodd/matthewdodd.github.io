               <p>Q. In consequence of any suspicion that you entertained did you mark any guineas? - A. I marked sixteen and put them in a drawer, in my parlour, in the front of the house; the ground floor consists of the shop, the parlour, and an accompting-house; I saw the lock of the drawer fastened on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. At what time on Saturday night? - A. About eleven o'clock when I went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you number the guineas? - A. From one, two, so on regularly to sixteen; the first eight I put in a purse, and the other eight loose in the drawer, on Saturday the eighth of June.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. That was last Saturday month? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has any other gentleman an accompting-house adjoining that parlour? - A. Mr. Turner; it is separated by a partition only.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a clerk of the name of Tagg? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire Mr. Tagg to take a view of what was doing in your accompting-house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any person, by making a hole in that partition, see what was doing in your parlour? - A. Yes, the back of the person would be towards the hole, if they were doing any thing at the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. The drawers were on the opposite side from that hole? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon the next morning did you receive any information that induced you to come down stairs? - A. About a quarter before eight on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came down, you found the prisoner in the custody of the constable? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You desired Mr. Turner's clerk to watch that room on the Sunday morning? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You found the prisoner in the custody of the constable when you came down? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look in the drawer for the purpose of seeing what money was there? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In the first place, did you find the lock of the drawer safe? - A. No, I believe it was wrenched open.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it open when you went to it? - A. It was not fastened so completely as it was before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to have been forced open by a crow? - A. I could not tell, the lock had been forced.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of the money gone? - A. I found there were five guineas gone; I have got the remainder of the guineas here.</p>


               <p>Q. What were the numbers that were gone? - A. The numbers that he took were, one, five, seven, eight, and fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course the others were left? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you found the other eleven guineas quite right? - A. Yes, four was taken out of the purse, and one from the loose parcel in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time when you came down, and you searched the drawer and found the five wanting - were the five guineas shewn you by the constable in the presence of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those, which were so shewn you by the constable in the presence of the prisoner, five of those which were in the drawer the preceding night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And were in the drawer with the other eleven you have now in your hand? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What parish is your dwelling-house in? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100006"></xptr>A. The parlour is in St. Edmund the King, and the other part is in St. Mary Woolnoth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Is the whole of the parlour in St. Edmund the King? - A. The whole of the window is in St. Edmund the King, and it runs off to a narrow point at the other end of the room.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is that part where the drawers stand in St. Edmund the King? - A. I am sure it is.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any partner? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are clerk to Mr. Turner, of 'Change-alley? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of any information from Mr. Blake, did you look through any hole? - A. Yes; previous to that I heard this young man come to Mr. Blake's door, it was then about a quarter before eight; I was standing behind the wainscot of the shop, in Mr. Turner's accompting-house, and heard the prisoner ask for John Row, the apprentice of Mr. Blake's; the boy answered that he was up stairs; the prisoner at the bar desired him to call him, he said he wanted to speak to him; I heard the lad go up stairs; then I immediately applied my eyes to the hole which we had prepared for the purpose of perceiving the prisoner's motions, which commanded a full view of the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive the prisoner do any thing? - A. I saw the prisoner in the parlour; I immediately applied my eye to the hole; he appeared to have come from the shop to the parlour at the moment I put my eye to the hole.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He could not have got into the parlour but by the shop? - A. No other way; I saw him take something out of his pocket (his back was towards me,) with that he got the drawer open, either by wrenching or picking, I do not know which; he took something out of the drawer, in doing which he dropped a paper that was in the drawer; he put something in his pocket; then he stooped, and picked up the paper, and replaced it in the drawer; then he immediately shut the drawer too, and returned momentarily into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you think this took up? - A. I do not think it was more than five minutes, he went into the shop before the lad came down again; immediately upon the prisoner leaving the parlour, I went out of the accompting-house to meet the lad who called the apprentice, and sent that lad for a constable in a slow whisper; the boy went immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you speak to Mr. Blake's boy? - A. At the bottom of the stairs; there is a communication from my accompting-house to Mr. Blake's shop.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Had Row come down by this time? - A. He had; the constable was some time before he came, I suppose near a quarter of an hour; the prisoner was at that time in conversation with Row. In consequence of the lad being so long gone, I was fearful; I went out, and met them; I told the constable the circumstance, and I came back to the house with the constable, the prisoner was then in the shop; the constable went in before me; I communicated to the constable what had happened; I saw him searched, he found nothing upon him; I said I saw him go to the drawer, and take something out, in the prisoner's hearing; upon which Mr. Blake replied, you saw him go to the drawer, did you - if you are pretty clear, I will go and see what he has taken out; Mr. Blake went immediately in the presence of the prisoner, the constable, and myself; he said he had taken five guineas only now, the time before he took four; the prisoner did not say any thing. The constable then said to the prisoner, it is of no use denying it, come here, I will strip you, for you must have money about you; the constable stripped him to his shirt, but found nothing upon him; the constable then looked round the counter, and found five guineas, and said, here are the guineas; they were upon the shop work-board.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon their being found, what did the prisoner say? - A. He requested that Mr. Blake would not be hard or harsh, it was in a slow tone, I am not sure which; he did not say any thing more; but cried.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the five guineas? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find that they were marked? - A. I did not, because it required a magnifying glass; I took down the numbers that were missing when Mr. Blake counted them; that was all that passed.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You are a City constable? - A. Yes: On Sunday, the 9th of June, I was sent for to Mr. Blake's; I went there, and found the prisoner at the bar in the shop talking with the apprentice, 
               <persName id="t18050710-3-person82">

            . The moment I went into the shop, he turned round, and said to the other apprentice, good morning, John, I will bid you good by; I said, stop, you are not going yet; I took him by the arm, and turned him round towards the shop-board, and said, I must know what you have got; I waited a few moments before I searched him, till Mr. Blake came and gave me charge of him; I proceeded to search him, but found nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you searched him, had you observed him to do any thing? - A. I observed him to go to his master's shop-board, and put his hand to a dirty cloth that was there; I did not hear any thing jink.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had searched him, did you go and look under that dirty cloth? - A. I did, and found five guineas there under the same dirty cloth which I had observed him put his hand on.</p>
               <p>Q. You took possession of them - have you kept them ever since? - A. I have; they were examined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180507100007"></xptr>in the prisoner's presence; he did not say any thing all the time he was there till I was going to take him to the Compter; he begged for mercy of his master; I produce the five guineas, they are the same; I have had them in my possession ever since.</p>


               <p>Q. (To the prosecutor.) You have examined those five guineas with the magnifying glass? - A. Yes; there are three of them visible without a magnifying glass on, No. 8, 5, and 15.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. What age is this young man? - A. I believe now he is near twenty-two.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the person that pays the rent for this house? - A. I am the householder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. On the constable coming into the shop, I immediately bid my fellow-apprentice good morning, on account, as I thought, that the constable was come on business; he immediately said, you cannot go; he turned round to me, and said, I shall want you, let me see what you have got in your pocket; I said, you are very welcome to see what I have got in my pocket; he took from my side pocket a pocket-book, which contained the copy of my freedom; he went to the shop-board to look over the pocket-book; I then followed him to the shop-board, and said, be so good as to take care of the things that are in there; O yes, said he, they shall be taken care of. By that time Mr. Blake came down stairs, and after he came to the place where I stood, Mr. Tagg said that he saw me go to the drawer; the constable turned round to my master, and said, I have searched him, and he has got nothing in his pockets; then he said I must strip myself; immediately I pulled off my clothes, one by one, and stripped myself properly; he searched my clothes, and found nothing upon me; he said to Mr. Blake, there is nothing upon him; Mr. Tagg said, I do not care what there is upon him, he has got it; then they searched about the shop, and in the course of a little time they found the money on the shop-board, near the place where Mr. Blake was.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

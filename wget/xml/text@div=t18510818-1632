                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, F</hi> 283.) In July, I received directions from Messrs. Fosters to watch their carmen. Their stores are in Castle-street East, Oxford-street, and their horses stand at Mr. Woolley's stables in the next street—on 12th July, I saw Noble, who is one of their carmen, come out of Mr. Woolley's stable in Titchfield-street, driving a cart of Messrs Fosters', which had their name on it, both in the front and at the side—he drove to Beasley's shop in Well-street—it is a milk-shop and old bottle-warehouse—I followed—he got out of the cart, took out a large hamper containing twenty-seven bottles, and put it down on Beasley's premises—his premises are entered by a private gateway, and the shop is a small projection some little way down the gateway—Beasley was at the time looking through the little window of the milk-shop—he could from that position very easily see the cart in the street, and see Noble put down the hamper in the archway; after Noble had pot down the large hamper, he went back to the cart, took a small basket out, and put it down by the side of the other—I saw Beasley at the time the small basket was put down—he was looking through the milk-shop window—Noble looked at Beasley, and Beasley nodded to him just as he was going away—Noble then was getting on the cart, when I stopped him—I said, "Where did you get those bottles from?" pointing to those under the archway—he made no answer, but looked amazed—I said, "I must take you into custody on a charge of stealing these from your master"—he said, "Don't do that; it is the first time I ever did such a thing in my life"—from the position in which the cart stood with reference to the archway, Beasley could see the name of Foster on the cart—it was exactly opposite the window; I should think six or seven yards from it—I took possession of the hampers—one contained twenty-seven bottles, and the other twelve—I took Noble to Mr. Foster's—I returned to Beasley in twenty or twenty-five minutes—I found him at home—Mr. Foster, who was with me, asked him if he had been in the habit of buying bottles of his man, and if he had bought any that morning—he said he believed Noble had left some there, but he was not in the way—I do not think Noble's name had then been mentioned—Mr. Foster asked if he had bought any of his other carmen—he said he did not know them—I asked if he had any of Mr. Foster's baskets on the premises—he said, "You are welcome to look."</p>

               <p>the gateway—it is level with the ground—the cart was exactly opposite the gateway—I was on the opposite side of the street—I saw round the tail of the cart—I was in such a position that I could see behind the cart and up the gateway—I was nearer to the cart's tail than to the horse's head—I cannot say that I was exactly opposite the gateway; I could see down the gateway, and to the window—I might see from rather an angle—the horse's head was towards Oxford-street—the gateway is on the left-hand side going to Oxford-street—the horse's head was away from the window—I was on the pavement on the other side—I cannot say what is the width of the street—it is a narrow street—it leads out of Oxford-street—the window was partly open—it slides back—I should conclude Beasley was standing close up to—the window—I had known him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, as bottled ale and porter-merchants; our counting-house is in Brook-street. Noble has been our carman rather more than six months—we have two other carmen—they drive separate carts, which have the name of our firm on them in letters about the length of my finger—they are hot exactly similar—it was Noble's duty, when he took out articles to customers, to bring back empty bottles—when in consequence of business the carmen did not return till after business hours, I told them to take the baskets and bottles round to Mr. Woolley's stables, and we would unload them in the morning—that has been the habit for some time, whenever they came in late—that happened to be the case on the night of 11th July—when Noble came back, I desired him to take the cart and baskets to the stable, as it was too late to unload them after taking the account of what he had brought, from his own lips—next morning I was at the cellars at 8 o'clock, my usual time, and Noble was brought in custody about half-past eight by the policeman, who had been employed by our firm to watch our carmen—we had before that missed bottles; in taking oar stock we found great deficiency—the officer said, in Noble's presence, that these two baskets were what he had delivered at Beasley's—I said to Noble, "Henry, whatever is this?" he said, "O, it is a mistake, Sir"—"A mistake," I said—he said, "It is the first time, Sir, I ever did such a thing; I must go down on my knees to you, and beg of you for the sake of my wife and family to look over it"—I said, "This is a dreadful thing, Henry"—he said, "I must go down on my knees to you," he kept repeating that over and over again—he said, "I hope you will not lock me up, I never did such a thing before"—I said, "Why, you did it yesterday"—he said, "Me, Sir, Lord bless you, it is quite a mistake"—I said, "You don't know that the police have been watching you for some time, and saw you do it?"—he said, "I assure you, Sir, it is the first time I ever did such a thing in my life"—I counted the bottles in the cart, there were twenty-five dozen, and one, not including the thirty-nine which had been taken to Beasley's—Noble had repre<lb></lb>sented to me the night before, that his cart contained twenty-six dozens—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185108180066"></xptr>
               <p>I have the entry here in his own hand-writing to three different customers—here is eight dozen, twelve dozen, and six dozen—after this I went with the officer to Beasley's—I have known him for some time—he carries on the business of a bottle-merchant, and has a shop where he sells milk—I had been to his premises before—there is a room some distance up the gateway which projects across the gateway—the room has three windows—Beasley was it home when we went—I believe he came up from the lower-part of the yard towards the archway—we met him—I think the officer spoke first, he called out loudly, "Mr. Beasley," and he appeared—I said to him, "Have you bought any bottles of our carman this morning"—he said, "I don't know but I believe he has left some, for I was not in the way at the time"—I said "How came you to buy bottles of a man that was our carman?"—" O," be said, "I used to deal with him when he was in business on his own account"—I said, "But you knew he was our carman"—he said, "Only lately"—I think I asked him how many times he had bought bottles of him—(I believe I first mentioned the name of Noble to him—I am certain I mentioned the name)—he said two or three times—I asked if he had bought bottles of any of the other carmen, and he said, "No, I don't know them"—when I asked Beasley whether Noble had left any bottles that morning, he said he was not in the way—the officer said to him, "Why I saw you, and you nodded to him"—Beasley said, "Saw me! why I have not been out of doors this morning"—the officer said, "I suppose you don't call this out of doors"—(we were then through the archway, just in the open air)—he said, "I tell you I have not been out of doors this morning; I have only just comedown-stairs; I have been ill nearly all night"—it was then about nine o'clock—I saw him shortly afterwards at the station—he was sent for, and the inspector said, "You are charged with receiving these bottles, knowing them to be stolen"—he said, "I know nothing about their being stolen"—I do not remember that he said anything more—I afterwards searched the stable, in company with the officer; in one of the stalls we found a sort of well with an iron grating over it, and in that we discovered seventeen bottles in some straw—I examined the bottles which had been left in the archway at Beasley's, and two of them had my name on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> It is not uncommon for bottles with your, labels to find their way to other houses? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at all—Beasley has said through<lb></lb>out that he had been ill that morning, which kept him from coming down so soon as usual—he told the Magistrate he had taken castor-oil—the officer said to him, "We shall expect you to attend at Marlborough-street, at ten o'clock"—he said, "I will, if I can"—I did not give him into custody; the acting-inspector did—the officer took him on his own responsibility, by the direction of his superiors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Noble.</hi> These two dozen of empty bottles are not Mr. Foster's; one dozen of them belong to his own man, who is now in his employ, of the name of Christopher. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I believe most positively that they are my bottles—two of them have my label on them—there was one occasion when there was something very suspicious in the book, where you received a quan<lb></lb>tity and only put down a certain number—you have been entrusted with money which has been found correct.</p>

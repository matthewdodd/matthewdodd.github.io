               <p>Jane Simpson. I went out of Town, and left my Things safe at my Lodging, and when I came home, I saw my Gown and Stays lying on my Trunk. I sent the Prisoner into my Room, to turn down the Bed, and she came out seemingly very much frighted, and said, that she had seen a Man go out at the Window. I went down Stairs, and told the People, that I believed I was robbed, and they said it was impossible any Man could get out there. I went up again, and looked into my Trunk, and missed other Things; so I had the Prisoner taken on Suspicion, and she confessed the taking them. She lodg'd in the same Room with me, and had been there Half a Year before I came.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown, Constable. The Prisoner brought a Pair of Stays to me to pawn, on the 2d of October, and a Gown the 3d. Mrs Simpson came to my House and own'd them. I afterwards took the Prisoner, and she own'd that she had taken them, and had given the other Things to a Woman to sell for her.</p>
               <p>Mrs Simpson. These Things were taken off my Trunk, and were the first I missed, after she had said there was a Man gone out of the Window. <rs id="t17401015-42-verdict221" type="verdictDescription">

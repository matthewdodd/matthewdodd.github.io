                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 35, Trinity-square, Southwark—on 14th September, I was in Fleet-street, about 1 o'clock, and saw the prisoner with his hand in a gentleman's pocket—he drew it out with a silk handkerchief in it, and began to wipe his face—I seized his hand, and took the handkerchief—he ran away—I ran after him; another witness caught him, and he was handed over to the police—this is the handkerchief (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>) <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> were here not several persons collected at the corner of Bouverie-street, and did not you have to wait on the kerb? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No I did not stop the gentleman, because I had to run after you—he was gone before I caught you.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor's dork, at 1, Serjeant's Inn—I was in Fleet-street, on the left-hand side, and saw the prisoner going towards Temple-bar—Mr. Ditton leant forward, and I saw a handkerchief in his hand—the prisoner immediately crossed towards Fetter-lane—Mr. Ditton cried, "Stop him"—I caught hold of him—he dropped on the ground side-ways, to throw me over him, but I lifted him up—he slipped his coat, in the hope of getting out of my hands, but I held him—before Mr. Ditton came up he said, "I picked it up; I was only wiping my nose with it"—he begged me very earnestly to let him go.</p>

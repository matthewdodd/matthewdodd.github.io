                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Thomas Alford, of Cumber<lb></lb>land-row, Newington-butts. The prisoner was his servant, and was in the habit of going to Mr. Miller, of Lant-street, Southwark, a horse-hair manu<lb></lb>facturer—we send him with a printed order for a certain quantity of stuff to be sent by him—he has to bring the order back, signed by Miller, as executing the order—on the 6th of July I sent him for some stuffing, and gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay for it—when the orders are brought back receipted, they are always torn up—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to bring 1 doz. of stuffing—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for one dozen; it seems he only brought half-a-dozen.</p>

                  </hi>. I manage the business of Mr. Miller, of Lant-street.

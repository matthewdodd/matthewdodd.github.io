            , she was with me. I met the prisoner by appointment, for the purpose of purchasing some counterfeit three shilling pieces. I was employed by the Bank. I had but few words with Phillips. I met him by appointment at ten o'clock; and he appointed the same hour on Sunday morning, Saturday being their sabbath. I met him accordingly at that hour, the next morning, we did not say a word. We walked up the lane, and he gave me two dozen three shilling pieces, and I gave him two one pound notes. He sold the counterfeit pieces at half price; and he gave me four shillings change. I was parting with him, when I heard somebody cry out,</p>
               <p>"a nose" meaning an informer. Immediately Phillips turned round and knocked me down, beat me most violently and a whole mob of jews gathered round; every one of whom had a knock at me. The prisoner ransacked my pockets, and took out the four shillings, and some of the others took from me a tobacco box, a knife, and a pocket handkerchief. There was a general cry of</p>
               <p>"a mad dog, kill him, kill him." I received a severe injury in my inside, from the various kicks and bruises which I received.</p>
               <p>The witness on his cross-examination could give no particular account how he got his living. He had been in service; he had been before a magistrate about stealing a handkerchief and fighting. At length he so much prevaricated and contradicted himself, that Mr. Serjeant Bosanquet, who was counsel for the prosecution, was oblidged to forego any further proceeding.</p>

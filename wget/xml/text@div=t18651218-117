                  </hi>. I am a clerk out of a situation, and live at 9, Patriot-square, Cambridge-road—last Saturday night or Sunday morning, at a quarter-past twelve, I was in the Mile-end-road, going home towards the City—I met nine or ten young men in a group on the pavement—one of them struck me on the top of my hat—I was then seized from behind by a person who placed his hands on my mouth, nose, and throat—a person in front turned my waistcoat pockets inside out, inserted one hand in my left trousers pocket, and took some papers out—when they let go of me the lot of them scrambled after my money, which was rolling on the pavement—I then saw the prisoner picking up some, and was quite certain of him—they went in the same direction, towards Bow—I kept the prisoner in sight till I met a constable and gave him in custody—I was perfectly sober—I had never seen the prisoner before to my knowledge—he had a cap on, and most of the others had <hi rend="italic">wide-awakes.</hi>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 359). The prosecutor gave the prisoner into my custody last Saturday night—he said that he had had his pockets picked by eight or nine young men, and the prisoner was one whom he saw pick up part of the money—the prisoner said that he was innocent, he saw a mob and merely went to see what was the matter—the prosecutor ap<lb></lb>peared sober—I found on the prisoner 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper.</p>

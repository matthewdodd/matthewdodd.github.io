                  </hi>. I am a student of the Rev. Mr. Herners, St. Paul's Road, Thornton Heath—on 30th March I was at the Victoria Station, in the refreshment-room, waiting for a train—the prisoner was there—he turned to me and said "It is not fine, in my country it is much finer; I come from Australia, it is very hot there—he asked me where I came from, I said I came from Spain, and he said it was very hot there, too—he said "Spain ought to be the richest country in the world—I am not sure whether he said "richest" or "nicest"—he then asked me where I was going—I said "To Thornton Heath—he said "I am going to the Palace; I believe it is the same way; we shall have to wait two hours;" and he took me out—he did not ask me to go for a walk, but we went out together—going along a man passed and dropped a purse—I stooped and picked it up, and handed it to the man who had dropped it—he opened the purse and took out a sovereign—I saw some bank notes in the purse—he shook hands with me, and offered me the sovereign—I said "I don't take money, I am a gentleman"—the prisoner said "My friend has rendered you a great service, you might invite us to a glass of something—the prisoner pointed out the Bricklayer's Arms, and we went there—I had a glass of sherry, and the other men had some beer—they did not seem to know one another</p>

               <p>at that time—we went into the coffee-room and sat down together—the prisoner said "My friend has rendered you a great service, you had better give us a ring; I shall be gad indeed to wear it"—and I said "Yes, I shall be very glad indeed to wear it"—they did not say anything more about the ring, and the man who dropped the purse said "Gentlemen, I had an uncle who left me," I don't know how much money, but a great deal of money, "for the poor; if you show me that you are worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will give you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the poor—the prisoner said "Well, I can show you that I am worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—the prisoner then said to me, "Are you sure you can get 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Yes; I can get even 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I like—the other man said "If you get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will give you 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "I am afraid the office is closed now, and I can't get it"—it was about 5.30 then—I said "I know someone else who will lend me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—and the prisoner said "You had better go and fetch it"—I said "It will be very nice if he gives us 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," but all the time I was suspecting them—I said I was going to get 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from my correspondent, and I should tell him what it was for—the prisoner said "Oh no, don't say anything to him, because this gentleman says that you ought not to say anything about it"—I said "I am not sure that I shall be back for two or three hours; I am going to New Bond Street"—I then left—I was away about two hours and a half—I went to the police-station in a cab, and brought two policemen back with me to the Bricklayers' Arms—I went inside and saw the prisoner as I was coming out—he said "Have you succeeded?"—it was about 8 o'clock then—the police were behind me at the time, one was in uniform, and the other in private clothes—he asked me twice, "Have you succeeded?" and I said "No—I think be then recognized the policeman, and I thought he was going to run away—I saw a man coming up a dark street, and I thought it was the other man—I then called the policeman up, and gave the prisoner in charge—the other man ran away.</p>

The prosecutor made a communication to me about 8 o'clock in the evening, and I followed him, with another constable, to the Bricklayers' Arms—I saw him go to the door—he then left the door, and the prisoner joined him—I walked up to where they were standing together, and heard the prisoner say "Have you suc<lb></lb>ceeded? "—I think he then noticed me, and they went further away—I then went and took him into custody—I told him I should take him for trying to defraud a man of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was then on the left side of him—he said, "All right; you know me; we can square this—I had never known him before—he put his right arm under his coat—I then shifted from his left side to his right, and pulled his hand out of his pocket (he had his pockets made just under the back buttons of his trowsers), and pulled out</p>

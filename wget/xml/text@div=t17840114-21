             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable of Shore-ditch, on the 6th of January I was sent for to the King's Head, near Haggerstone, a farmer being there who had lost a horse from South Mims, and had found it in a stable there, I went and enquired for the farmer, he was then at the stable door, that is the prosecutor, I asked him his business with me, and he told me he had been robbed of a horse about six weeks ago, and that he had seen it come out to water, and that it was then in a stable, and he knew it to be his horse; I asked him by what marks he knew it, he said his name was branded on the hoofs. I dispatched a man for Mr. Tibbit, and he came and told me he bought it of Mr. M'Clara; Tibbit very readily went with me to the Justice, the farmer made oath of his property, and the justice granted a warrant against M'Clara; on the Friday he came to the Public Office and surrendered himself up, in the mean time he also apprehended the prisoner that he had bought the horse off, and he was examined before the sitting alderman; the sitting alderman took the prisoner's own word for his appearance on the Saturday, when he was examined again; then a letter was sent by Mr. Wilmot to the fitting alderman, and an examination was taken again, then M'Clara gave such a satisfactory account, that the justice thought there was no occasion to bind him over.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the horse produced? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosec utor. You saw the horse before the justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was M'Clara there at the time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the prisoner owned to the selling of the horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Scott councel for the Prisoner. You say that upon the first examination before the alderman, the alderman discharged him on his bare word to appear again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140028"></xptr>Court. This may hurt a man's character, or else I should not upon this evidence sum up to the jury.</p>
               <p>FOR THE PRISONER.</p>
               <p>- TAVERNER sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Harlow.</p>
               <p>Do you know the prisoner Lightman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know Mr. White? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did Lightman and White come down at any time to your house? - Yes, they came to my house about half an hour after three o'clock, the 27th of November enquiring for lodgings, that was the day before the fair.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect seeing Lightman purchase a horse on the 28th? - Yes.</p>


               <p>Do you recollect what the colour of the horse was? - Yes, it was black, a long raw honed horse with a long tail, I believe his off eye was out, and one hoof behind was off to the best of my knowledge; he wanted change for a guinea, I gave him 5 s. in part of change, and he gave me a guinea, he then went to pay him: it is the custom in these times to sell a little beer, and he called for a pint or a pot of beer, and he took his horse, says he I do not know what to do with him; says I, put him into my yard.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was your horse a long tailed black horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had he an eye out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Upon the evidence for the prosecution, you find the prisoner directly owned where he had the horse, and this was five or six weeks after he was stolen.</p>

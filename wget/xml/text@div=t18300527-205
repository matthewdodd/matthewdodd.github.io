               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How many persons were within five yards of you? A. Eight or ten; I cannot say - he was the nearest; he began to run alone - I kept my eyes on him; I did not see the handkerchief drop from him - he did not walk some yards before he crossed the road.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner running, and heard Stop thief! called - I saw him take this handkerchief from his bosom with his left hand, and throw it over his shoulder; I was close to him - no persons were so near as Mr. Mayo and myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you a regular officer? A. Yes; I belong to Farringdon-ward; the prisoner was ten or fifteen yards before me when I heard the alarm -I was sitting at my dinner at the corner of Warwick-square; he tried to knock one or two young men down; there was not a soul to be seen, but the mob who were following him - I took him in Warwick-lane, near Amencorner.</p>

               <p>MR. MAYO. I believe this to be my handkerchief - it is the same pattern.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not a common pattern? A. Yes; but I believe it to be mine; there is no difference between this and the one I lost.</p>

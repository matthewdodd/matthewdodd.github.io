                  </hi>. I live at 7, Prince's Street, Drury Lane—it is a lodging-house—I am the deputy—on 29th May, the prisoner was lodging there—between 7 and 8 o'clock, I asked him for the money for his lodging—he said "Who are you that I should give you the money'"—I said "All right, if you do not give me the money you shall not go upstairs to sleep"—I went to my duties—about fifteen minutes after I heard him ask a lodger named Regan, if he was an Irishman, and "Do you call this man an Irish<lb></lb>man?" meaning me—Regan made no reply; a few minutes afterwards the prisoner said "I'll do for thee," and ran at me, I fell down—on getting up I found I was stabbed in the arm, and my arm and my head were bleeding fast—I have since been in the hospital—on running out of the house I heard Leonard call out that he—was stabbed—I did not see the knife then, but I have since.</p>

I am a labourer living at 7, Prince's Street, Drury Lane—on the 27th May, between 7 and 8 o'clock p.m., I was in the kitchen, the prisoner was standing near the window—Gleed was near the sink washing up some things—I heard the prisoner say "You—I hate you and your b——country, before you leave this house I'll put you on the fire and roast you to death"—Gleed crossed to the other side of the kitchen, saying "You will do for me will you, I want nothing to say to you, I have heard of you before"—the prisoner then ran and caught hold of Gleed, and stabbed him—I rushed between them, and putting my hand up received the blow on the back of my hand which was cut—the prisoner then fell to the ground with the knife in his hand; I missed Gleed at that time—I said to the men in the kitchen "He has stabbed me too"—I gave him in charge in the street—my wound was bound up at the hospital—the prisoner had been drinking.</p>

I am an assistant surgeon at the Charing Cross Hospital—I examined Gleed—he had a scalp wound at the back of his head, caused by a fall, also an incised wound in his left arm, crossing the elbow joint, 5 inches in length and 1 1/4 in depth, and dividing an artery—he would have bled to death if it had not been stopped.</p>

            . On the 29th of December I saw the prisoner with another lad coming out of my house in Dorset-street - the prisoner's mother lives in my house. About three weeks before that, I lost a pair of sheets from the passage, since which I always watched him, and on the 29th of December, about eight o'clock, I heard him come. I ran up, and saw him and another boy with each a bundle - they ran out in great haste without shutting the door. I ran up the area steps, followed them, and when they got about fifty yards two girls ran from the other side of the street, and took the bundles from them; they then went on as fast as they could, and the girls crossed over. I overtook the girls, and took the bundles from them, as I suspected he had been robbing his mother who was not a home. I asked the girls what they had got there? They said it was nothing to me, and I had no business with it. The prisoner then came across, and said I had no business with them, for they were his and not mine, and he would go back and shew me that they were his; he said he would follow me home. I took them back, and found that it was wet linen, very much frozen, and with the pins sticking in them - they were torn off the line. Next morning the prosecutrix claimed them. The prisoner said he tied them up in two bundles because one would not hold them all.</p>

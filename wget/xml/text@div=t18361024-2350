                  </hi> The prisoner came to my son's shop on the 29th of September—he is in partnership with his brother, Peter Mudie—when the prisoner left the shop, some circumstance occurred which induced me to run out after him—I stopped him, and brought him back—I said I had long suspected him, and I was positive he had a book of my son's in his pocket—he said he had no such thing, he took the book out of his pocket, and endeavoured to throw it into the street, but I got hold of it—this is it—it is my son's book, and his partner's—he did not throw it down—I caught hold of it just as he was going to throw it away.</p>

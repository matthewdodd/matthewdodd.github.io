               <p>Q. What day did you leave town - A. On Tuesday evening, the 17th of October, between five and six o'clock. I went with my husband. I made all the fastenings of the house perfectly sure, I took the key with me, I locked the house up myself, and I am sure I made all the fastenings safe. It was rather dark when the tide swelled, I locked the door, me and my husband went together, leaving no person in the house. I returned in about a week, we were detained in the Downs by contrary winds. I received a letter on the Sunday, I returned on the Monday, I think the 30th. When I returned to my house, every door and every lock of my house had been broken open, and every part of my property was taken away. They broke in at the cellar window, the street door was locked; it appeared as if a crow had been put in, and the cellar flap wrenched up, there was the mark in the wood work; there are stairs come down into the cellar from the street, and go up into the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, every door in the house had been broken open - A. Yes, the doors had been locked, all of them; and the part of my goods that were left were in the cellar, packed up ready to be removed. I went into the house at the street door with my own key; I unlocked the door.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost a great deal of wearing apparel and household furniture - A. Yes; I lost all the articles in the indictment, and a great many more; it is not a third part of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose four China images, a glass, two aprons, three table cloths, eight pillow cases, a blanket, three handkerchiefs, a counterpane, a table cover, a looking glass, seven napkins, a quilt, a pair of stockings and a candlestick - A. Yes, and a great deal more.</p>

On the morning of the 18th I heard a slight noise, it was like the scuffling and putting on a pair of heavy shoes in Mrs. Duncan's house; I paid attention to it; immediately afterwards the watchman called past four o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Shadwell Office. On the the 12th of January, I went to Murry's house, in Queen-street, Wapping; he is a coal-heaver. It was about two o'clock in the day time; I found Mrs. Murry there. I went in company with Mrs. Duncan and Hope, another officer. I acquainted Mrs. Murry, that I had a search warrant to search the house for things that Mrs. Duncan had been robbed of. As soon as I went into the house, Mrs. Duncan pointed out a pair of China images on the mantle piece, (there are them.) We searched the house, and found out this property, which Mrs. Duncan pointed out to be her property: here is two hats, two aprons, a black silk skirt, a gauze cloak, three silk handkerchiefs, a table cloth, a table cover, a quantity of thread, three towels, a pair of pillow cases, a curtain, a counterpane, a piece of old bed furniture, and a looking glass; these are all the things that I found.</p>

            . I am an officer of Shadwell. On the 14th of January, about twelve o'clock at night, in company with Partridge, I went to Lambeth Marsh to apprehend the prisoners; the house is situated in a field by itself. I knocked at the door, I could not get any admittance; I heard a scuffling up stairs; I broke open the bottom shutter.</p>
               <p>Court. Did not any body answer you when you knocked - A. Yes; a woman answered me below. They seemed alarmed, I jumped in at the window, and Partridge followed. I secured Upton, he was secreting himself in the coal-hole: we searched the house, Dufty was not in the same place. I found two images standing on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181002210028"></xptr>the mantle-piece, a small table cloth, two pillow cases, a quilt, a pair of stockings, a pair of pillow cases, and two caps. I found them in the room in which Upton slept, in the drawer. I apprehended Upton, and he was left in my custody; he said, he had been doing nothing, he did not know what he was apprehended for.</p>

            . Q. You were with Partridge - A. Yes; I afterwards went to Dufty's house and apprehended him, about one hundred and fifty yards from Upton's house. I found Dufty in bed, I secured him, and on searching the room I found this property: this is a piece of cotton bed furniture, this is part of a gown piece, this is a piece of cambric muslin, a pair of pillow cases, a table cloth, three towels, a white neck handkerchief, and a cap.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate to Dufty what you apprehended him for - A. Not at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the night was it when they came - A. I cannot tell, I was in bed; I generally go to bed about ten o'clock; I was awoke out of my sleep when they came. It was night, and dark when they came. I have never seen my husband since I was taken up.</p>
               <p>Upton's Defence. All that I know of this good woman and her husband is, I had a writ out against me for money that I owed, I went to a townsman of mine that lived at Shadwell to get me a lodging till I could pay the money; he said, he could not; if I would go to his house of call, he would ask that woman's husband to let me have a bed; he said, yes, if I would give him one shilling and six-pence a week for the bed. I was there about three weeks; that is all I know of this woman. I never see any thing amiss of him, nor he of me; and what things were taken out of my premises, I can give a good account of.</p>
               <p>Dufty's Defence. I never was in Murry's house but twice in my life, that was two afternoons; I was going past. I am perfectly innocent of what I am charged, and what is more, I was on hospital duty that night.</p>
               <p>Dufty called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>, I reside at Liverpool, and am managing partner in the firm of Rylands, Seddon, and Co.—I recollect the ship <hi rend="italic">Richard Rylands</hi> leaving England last summer about June or July—she was bound for Calcutta—the prisoner was the captain—J. Ogle and Co. of Calcutta were the consignees—the prisoner would receive the freight, and give a receipt for it—it would be his duty to remit it to us in bankers' bills—these letters are the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">These letters were dated Calcutta</hi>, 5<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1863, <hi rend="italic">and 9th January</hi>, 1864, <hi rend="italic">to Messrs. Rylands and Co. Liverpool, the first stating that in conjunction with Ogle and Co. he had chartered the ship with rice for the Mauritius, and enclosed a</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l. Bill of Exchange, forwarded by another captain</hi>)—This other letter of 8th February, 1864, is the prisoner's writing—it is dated The Hoogley, Calcutta (<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—I believe this paper, purporting to be the appointment of Mr. McFarlane as captain, is the prisoner's writing—it is dated 5th February, 1864—I was not aware of that appointment until made aware of it by the agents—we were not made aware of it by the prisoner until he arrived at the Mauritius—this letter is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated Mauritius</hi>, 5<hi rend="italic">th April</hi>, 1864; <hi rend="italic">it alluded to the appointment of Mr. McFarlane as stated in a previous letter, and stated that the prisoner's own health was so much shattered that he doubted his ever recovering; that small pieces of bone came from his leg, and wounds in his neck and cheek were still open</hi>)—This letter refers to a previous letter, communicating the fact of Captain McFarlane's appointment—I never received such a letter—the other letter, dated Aden, 17th August, is the prisoner's writing, and this memorandum—(<hi rend="italic">The letter stated that his health obliged his remaining at Aden, and that he had forwarded the Calcutta accounts and vouchers</hi>)—(<hi rend="italic">Memorandum read:</hi> "I received 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the agent at Mauritius, and lodged it in a mercantile bank, in exchange for which I received a bill on myself; three days after my arrival I called at the bank,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186407110004"></xptr>
               <p>and got the bill endorsed, and afterwards had it cashed; the proceeds I lodged in two banks at Stockton-on-Tees for safety; 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Stockton and Darlington Bank, and 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Backhouse's. This amount, 3,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. belongs to the owner of the ship, with the exception of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. belonging to myself. I paid 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the broker in Loudon for discounting the bill")—I first heard of the prisoner's arrival at Marseilles from the French police—I do not remember the date—I heard of his arrival in England from the police; I can't remember the date; I think it was after the 13th—he never communicated with us after leaving Aden—I never saw or heard of him till he was arrested—it was his duty upon receiving the Bill of Exchange at the Mauritius to endorse it and forward it to us—supposing he had neglected his duty and brought it with him to London he ought to have forwarded it to us immediately on his arrival in London; he had no authority to discount it—I know nothing about this letter (produced—I never wrote it—the signature is an imitation of mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> At the time the statement was made by the prisoner were you aware the money was in the Stockton Bank? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had obtained that information from Inspector Carlisle of the Liverpool police—I have received the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. minus the discount, since the prisoner has been in custody—there was nothing due to him for wages, I am certain of that—he had a certificate of service—he had never served for us before—this was the first voyage he had been on our account—the voyage was from England to Calcutta-Messrs. Ogle and Co. were the agents for the charterers at Calcutta—they were not our agents; they were agents for the ship—when the prisoner left Calcutta for the Mauritius he went as supercargo, from his statement—the captain he appointed is not here—there is no one here from the Mauritius; I believe Mr. John Ogle is in London—the vessel was chartered from Calcutta jointly by Ogle and Co. and the prisoner—this 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill was sent by the captain of another ship through the prisoner—the prisoner did not remit any more than one Bill of Exchange from Calcutta—I do not know whether upon a fresh captain being appointed abroad the agents write to the Registrar-General—I have been in the shipping trade from ten to fifteen years—the balance of the freight was left in the hands of the agents at Mauritius—it still remains there—I can't speak to the amount—the agents advised us of it, and paid the disbursements of the ship out of it—I don't recollect the balance; it was a small balance—it was more than 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Does that balance and the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. make up the whole of the freight? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and the money the prisoner advised us he had received—he sent us an account accounting for the money he received in Calcutta—the freight which he received at Calcutta was nearly 5,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that is all accounted for-in the captain's account he only accounted for 165<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received in the Mauritius-that was the account sent from Aden.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Fletcher, Parr, and Co. ship brokers, of Leadenhall-street-we were brokers to the Rylands—I chartered the vessel myself, and have seen all the accounts sent from the agents at Calcutta—the accounts before me do not give any credit for the freight at Calcutta—this (marked G) is the captain's account; it only gives credit for 485<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the other document is merely a freight list, showing that 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was the probable freight to be earned by the vessel from Calcutta to the Mauritius, receivable at Mauritius.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

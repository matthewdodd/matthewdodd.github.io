I was sent for down the High-street, Poplar, at a quarter to 2 o'clock in the day of the 27th of De<lb></lb>cember, and saw a great number of people assembled round the Harrow public-house—I went up, and saw the prisoner standing close by—she had blood on her face and hands—I went up to her—she said, "I have stabbed him, I have stabbed him"—she had been drinking, but knew what she was about—she was under great excitement from liquor—I said, "Stabbed who?"</p>

I examined the pro<lb></lb>secutor a little after two o'clock, on Monday week—there was a small in<lb></lb>cised wound on the upper part of his scalp, about an inch in length—there was another wound on the right ear also—it appeared to have been made by a sharp instrument—such a knife as this would make the wound—there had been a considerable hemorrhage of blood from the wound in the scalp, but it had ceased when I got to the station—both the wounds seemed to have been done by some sharp cutting instrument, not as if he had fallen on a fender—it would have been a contused wound if he had.</p>

I went out on the 20th of January, about three o'clock in the afternoon and returned again about six, when I saw West at the window, looking into the shop; when he saw me, he shifted his place, and went on the other side of the way. I went into my house and drank tea, and then, as I suspected West, I went to see what was become of him. Then I perceived that half a pane of glass was taken out; the pane was cracked before, and there were two pair of shoes gone, that lay against that pane. The hole was big enough for a man to put his arm in at.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain that you lost two pair of shoes?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; I am certain I lost two pair. I searched for the piece of glass, but could not find it. I saw no more of West that night. Then I went to the pawnbrokers, and informed them how I was robbed, and desired them to stop the shoes if they should be offered.</p>

            . The prosecutor came to me on the 20th of January, and informed me he had been robbed of two pair of shoes. On the Tuesday following a woman came to my shop with the shoes Mr. Smith had desired me to stop. I told her, I must stop her. She said, she had them of one West. She went away, and West came, and said he bought them in Rosemary-lane, for 3 s. 6 d. I told him I would enquire of Mr. Smith, before I delivered the shoes to him; and that if he, Mr. Smith, did not claim them, he should have them the next morning. The prisoner went away.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Was the shop door shut?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes; but I took no particular notice of the window at that time, as my attention was fixed upon West.</p>
               <p>White. West came again, and Kirk with him; but Kirk said nothing about the shoes.</p>
               <p>Smith. When Kirk was before the Justice, he had a pair of pumps on, which I am positive are my property; they were remarkably thin; they were made to go abroad. I generally sell them for 5 s. 6 d. but they are not worth a shilling for this country's wear.</p>
               <p>West's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am a sailor. I happened to meet an old clothes-man in Rosemary-lane. I was going to sea again, and wanted some things; so I bought these shoes of him.</p>
               <p>Kirk's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am a cabinet-maker; I changed a pair of shoes with a shop-mate for these shoes. I told the Justice, if he would give me till Monday, I could find the man; but he committed me.</p>

            . I live in Spur-street. On the 3d of January, between nine and ten o'clock, I went to my plumber's-shop, and saw several persons there; Mullins, who was my <rs id="t18270111-96-deflabel538" type="occupation">servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18270111-96-defend986 t18270111-96-deflabel538"></join>, was there - I went in, and saw two plumbers and two labourers there; Mullins was one <rs id="t18270111-96-deflabel539" type="occupation">plumber</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18270111-96-defend986 t18270111-96-deflabel539"></join>, and one Bayley the other; I saw some lead in the scale, and asked what job it was for; Mullins said, "It is for my job in Charles-street, St. James'-square;" I said, "For what part of the job?" he said, "For the bridge of the cistern;" I said it was too large; he said the carpenter had made it wider, and that was the proper size; I then saw a smaller piece - he said that was for another part of the job. I went into my counting-house, leaving them in the shop. Mullins and the labourer took this lead in the truck, and went down Whitcombe-street. I went out, to go to Panton-street, but changed my mind, and went along the Haymarket; when I got there I saw my truck stopping, nearly opposite the little Theatre - Mullins held the handle while the labourer took this roll of pipe-lead out of the truck, and this small roll - he put one on each shoulder; they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182701110049"></xptr>then nodded to each other, and Mullins turned the truck to go into Charles-street; the labourer walked towards Pall Mall, keeping the opposite side to Charles-street- it did not strike me that it was a robbery; I thought it might be for another job. I watched the labourer up Suffolk-street, across the mews, into St. Martin's-lane - I lost sight of him at the corner of St. Martin's-lane. I began to think I was robbed, and did not wish to follow him so close. I went to a plumber's-shop in St. Martin's-lane - it is a kind of warehouse, with double doors; the prisoner Baron carries on a plumbing business there; I looked through the window, which was very dirty, and saw my labourer lay down the pipe and piece of lead close to the mould in the shop; I had not been there long when I saw a man in the shop, and the labourer looking stedfastly towards the door; I did not know it was Baron then, but it turned out to be him - I immediately flew from the door, to hide myself; I crossed the road, then went over again, and hid myself in a door-way, about two houses off, and in about five or six minutes I heard the latch of a door pulled - it proved to be the private door of the house belonging to the shop, and I saw a person's head put out at the door, whom I did not know at the time, but from circumstances since I think it was Baron - I would not wish to swear it, but if I did I should say Yes. After looking up and down the street, as if to see if anybody was watching (or for what purpose best known to himself) the labourer, whom I have not found, was coming out at the private door (this was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning); I stepped forward, fearing he might make a rush, and run away; I had seen nobody in the shop but him and the man whom I suppose to be Baron; the labourer saw me, drew in, and the door was shut with violence; that door communicates with the shop; I immediately went to the shop, and the labourer, whose face was towards the door, turned to look into the mould, putting his back towards me; upon coming near him I said, "Pray what do you do here?" he said, "I am come to look for a labourer;" Baron was in the shop, and they stood near each other; I said, "Pray what have you done with the pipe and piece of lead which you stole from me?" he hesitated, and made no answer, but pointed to the scale, where the pipe and lead were; I scolded Baron - I believe I called him a thief, and worse than a thief; I used very strong language; I said, "You thief, you are a receiver of stolen goods - where is your master, where is Mr. Baron?" he made no answer; I repeated the question several times; I was very much agitated at the time; the labourer then said he came to ask for a labourer, and said to me, "You know you wanted a labourer - I came in to ask for one;" I asked Baron if he would go for a constable, or get me one to take the man up; he made no answer till it was repeated several times; then the labourer said, "You may get a constable - I am not afraid - I shall not run away - I have done nothing;" I said I would take care he should not till I had got a constable, but I moved a little way from him; I again begged Baron to get a constable, or assist me in taking him - the labourer escaped while Baron and I were talking: Baron was in front of him, and made no attempt to stop him; he either said he could not or would not assist in taking him; he got out at the private door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long has Mullins been in your service? A. Three months - I know such lead as was put into the truck was wanted in Charles-street; there is this weight of lead entered in my book for that job, but the entry is dated the 2d instead of the 3d. The prisoners were both admitted to bail, and have surrendered to-day; no person out of my employ was admitted at Charles-street - I have a porter there; I wanted another labourer and plumber; I did not hear Mullins say the labourer was to give the lead to the man he was to fetch, to allow him an introduction to the works.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are the master, and employ people to work under you? A. Yes; the men enter all the lead they take out, before they go out - they have no right to sell it - it remains my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you saw your man go into the shop, you peeped through the window? A. Yes; I did not see him go in - I saw him deposit my lead by the mould; I could not see what was going on in the shop after I crossed over - I was there five or six minutes; I do not recollect saying at Bow-street that it was but a minute or two; there was nobody else in the shop when I went in. I have often looked out into the street myself, to see if my men were coming.</p>
               <p>Q. Directly you entered the shop you began an attack on Baron, supposing him a journeyman? A. Yes; he said he was Mr. Baron. and master of the place, but that was after the man had escaped. I did not say at Bow-street that he gave me that answer directly I asked for his master - I said there that he hesitated in answering my questions; my journeyman was a strong man, six feet high.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CUSS. I am an officer. I was sent for, and apprehended Mullins, at work, in Charles-street, St. James', between ten and eleven o'clock. I went and found Baron in his shop; Parker said, "I have come to demand my property;" Baron said, "There it is," pointing against the mould, where it stood; Parker said, "You need not take him - he is to be found at any time." I only took the lead.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge with us on a Wednesday, and on the Monday following I went out about one o'clock, leaving nobody in the house - I locked my door, put the key into my pocket, and fastened the window with a fork, as it had no fastening to it - it is a sash window, which throws up: I am positive it was shut down close - I got back about ten minutes past three o'clock, and found the window a little way open; one prong of the for was broken - I had left the key of my street door at Mr. Pryor's; I got it from there, and let myself in with it, when I came home - I found the parlour door open, which I had left locked, and had the key in my pocket; I missed a sheet off the prisoner's bed on the first floor - if she had got in at the window, she must have gone through and opened the parlour door to get to her room; I missed a bedgown, a petticoat, a child's watch, four pairs of stockings, a shift, a handkerchief, a night-cap, a pinafore, and a pair of sleeves; (Cooper here produced the property) these are mine - this bed-gown is not mine - I have not found the petticoat or watch.</p>

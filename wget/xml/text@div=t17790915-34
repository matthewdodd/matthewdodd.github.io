               <p>Upon the second of November or thereabouts, the prisoner, who lodged in the house where I lodge, was turned out of her lodging; I gave her leave to sit in my room all night, that she might not be in the street. She went away about nine in the morning or after, and I missed a pair of stays and a cloak. I never saw the prisoner for a great while after. About a month ago I met her in the street; I charged her with having stolen my cloak and stays; the prisoner owned it, and said she had worn the stays out, but she would return the cloak, which she did. She told me where she lived. She was afterwards taken up on a charge of robbing her master, and her master sent for me last Thursday.</p>

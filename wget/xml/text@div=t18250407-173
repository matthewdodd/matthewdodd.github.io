            . I am a horse patrol of Bow-street. I apprehended the prisoners on Monday, the 21st of February, about ten minutes before twelve o'clock at night, at Arlington corner, opposite a public-house, about six or seven miles from the Great Park; they were driving the asses before them; I asked whose they were, and Lamb said they belonged to his partner's father - I asked Slaughter if they belonged to his father - he said Yes; I asked what they were going to do with them; he said to take them to Smithfield market to sell; I said</p>
               <p>"What, on Friday, do you mean?" they said Yes; I said</p>
               <p>"What, keep them till Friday?" they said they had a man there who would receive them of them; Lamb said he was a bricklayer's labourer, and Slaughter said he was a farmer's man. I took them to my own station, about three hundred yards from the place; kept the asses till the next morning, when they were claimed by Phillips, as Lord Harcourt's property - I saw the marks on their hoofs, and have no doubt they were made with this branding iron.</p>

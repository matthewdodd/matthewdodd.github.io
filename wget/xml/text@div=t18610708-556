I cannot say the exact amount; it was over 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I had had transactions with the defendant some years prior to my petition in November last, to a large extent—I have known and dealt with him ten years—on 9th Novem<lb></lb>ber last, I received from him a barge load of wheat, 260 quarters—it was brought to me in the prisoner's sacks—he had been in the habit of selling me corn by sample—I always buy by sample—I saw the defendant on 27th August at Mark-lane—he showed me some samples of wheat—I bought 594 quarters of him then, and paid him on that occasion 1,927<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by cheque—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—only twenty-one quarters of that corn was delivered to me—he said the corn was at his place at Uxbridge—I believed that statement when he made it to me—part of it had been delivered at Mr. Kelsey's mill on my account—no; that was not the parcel—on 17th September I saw the de<lb></lb>fendant—on that occasion he obtained from me a cheque for 796<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this is the cheque (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)—that was in respect of 245 quarters of wheat bought on that occasion, the price agreed on was 65<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter—the prisoner did not say anything particular in respect of the bulk of that, not at the time I bought it and before I gave him the cheque—I always understood that he had the wheat by him whenever I purchased—if he had not it by him, it was coming in next week, perhaps, what he had bought the previous day or two.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You said just now that, at the time of each bargain, there was nothing said about where the wheat was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he would bring samples, and say I have bought so and so, or I have so and so to sell—I did not always ask him the question as to where it was—I expected he had got it, or that it was about to be delivered to him.</p>

Q.</hi> I suppose the transactions you have now mentioned were conducted in the same way as your other dealings with him for up<lb></lb>wards of ten years? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; just the same—my dealings with him have amounted to about 25,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per year, upon an average, for the last six years—it has all been delivered to me correctly previous to this—I asked no particular questions on those occasions—it always had been carried out right, and therefore I thought this would—between 27th August and 10th November, I should say there were upwards of 1,000 quarters to be delivered—nearly 2,000—that would be about 5,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—the three sums in question amount to about 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—between 1st October and his bankruptcy, I think I received about 900 quarters from him out of that—there were a great many fluctuations in the prices of corn last year—in April I think I gave him 52<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and it went up to 78<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was, I think, in November—in June I gave him 53<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and in October 67<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—it was 62<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 63<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in August, 65<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in September, and 67<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in October—the price kept advancing almost every week after 1st October—I know Mr. Nash—I recollect bargaining with him for some wheat, and my saying I would rather it came from Bassett—I saw Bassett in London on the eve of the declaration of insolvency—I think it was on the 9th—he then told me that he had not any more wheat that he could send me—he said that he was in a very wretched state of mind about it—the price of wheat was going up at that time—I told him I thought he had about 1,200 or 1,300 quarters of my wheat to deliver—he asked me to go down to his place and take possession of all he had got—I believe he said, "I wish you to come down to-morrow morning and bring your solicitor with you"—I do not think he said to take possession of all he had—I do not recollect that—I think it likely that he might say so—he seemed in a very distressed state of mind—I think, on one or two occasions, there were one or two little parcels of wheat delivered inferior to sample, and some deduction was made—I did not hear the bankrupt examined—when I purchased a lot of wheat of him it was scarcely ever delivered at one time—it ranged over some interval—I did not go over his books when I went down to his house—he did not show them to me—he showed me a statement that he had—I do not recollect its appearing from that statement that he had sustained losses of nearly 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within the last year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186107080018"></xptr>
               <p>then that the declaration of insolvency was made—the conversation on the 9th was in consequence of his telling me that he had no more wheat for me—I had been pressing him to send wheat faster—he had not been sending it so fast as usual—he had offered me a fresh lot for sale, on 5th November in the same way—by sample—I declined to buy that; and told him I wished to have the wheat he had in hand delivered before I bought any more, in consequence of the price having got up so much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you always believe that he had the control of the corn you purchased? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; or that he would have it in a short time—I had no distrust—I believed when I bought it that it was in his power to send it to me—I always expected that he had either bought it or had it by him, that he had either contracted for it or had it—I do not think that any of the 2,000 quarters delivered between 27th August and his bankruptcy were upon the contracts that I have been speaking of—I think they were upon previous contracts—some of them were made in June, and there were two or three parcels bought in the beginning of July—notwithstanding the delivery of those 2,000 quarters, I am still left fully 1,200 quarters short—I should say nearly all those undelivered 1,200 quarters are upon the three contracts that I have mentioned.

On 10th October I met him in Uxbridge-market, and sold him 100 quarters of wheat at 72<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter—I delivered it on the 11th and 12th; 150 sacks or 75 quarters on the 11th, and 50 sacks or 25 quarters on the 12th—according to the practice I should have been paid for that on the following market-day—I saw the defendant the next market-day, the 18th, and asked him for payment of the 100 quarters of wheat—it was 360<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said it was not convenient for him then, as he was busy, but if I would call in the afternoon he would pay me—I told him I could not call in the afternoon as I was going down to Weston-super-Mare by the 2 o'clock train—he then said, "Well, I suppose it will do as well if I pay it in to your account at Hull's this afternoon"—I said it would do as well—he had done so several times before—on the following Thursday, 25th</p>

               <p>October, I saw him again—I had not then seen my pass-book—I sold him another 100 quarters of wheat on that occasion at 75<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., amounting to 385<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I delivered 40 quarters of that on 26th October, 40 quarters on the 27th and 20 on the 29th—I did not at that time know that he was in difficulties—I believed he was dealing as a tradesman in the ordinary course of business.</p>

                  </hi>. I have an estate at Denham, near Uxbridge—I am a member of the Bar—I have been in the habit of dealing with the defendant, and so was my father before me—I placed samples in his hands, leaving him to effect sales, and then deliver according to sample—prior to 2d November I had placed samples of corn in his hands for the purpose of effecting sales for me—that was done through my steward on 2d November—I gave my steward directions about the price—on 3d November I received this letter from the defendant, dated the 2d—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Uxbridge, November 2d, 1860. Sir,—I have sold your wheat at 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the best, and 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the other; I have sent to your steward about delivering it, as he wished me. D. Basset.")—In consequence of receiving that letter I gave instructions to my steward to deliver the bulk according to the samples—I should not have parted with the bulk unless I had believed the prisoner had sold it for me—the value of it was about 291<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think—I have not received any portion of that, except a dividend of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—part of the corn went to Mr. Kelser's mill, I believe, after the declaration of insolvency, and was ultimately recovered, but not from the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to follow them so? - A. I suspected the two men that were with the prisoner; he stopped at the foot of London-Bridge, and went to Billingsgate; I told him I would feed my horse, and take care of his while he was gone; I looked into the cart, and saw some lead; and when he came back, he said, fish was very dear, and he would go over into the Borough; I said, no, you will not, I shall stop you, for you have got lead in your cart; he said, was I in earnest; I told him, yes; then he said he was a ruined man; then he said he would tell me where he got it; he said he found it upon a dunghill at Butcher's-grove, just on this side of Cranford-bridge; he said he had got down to ease himself there; he said it was Monday afternoon, and he left it till Wednesday morning, and then took his horse and cart, and went and fetched it.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was the 15th? - A. Wednesday; he said he left Twickenham at three o'clock, and had been to Butcher's-grove, and loaded it; it is about four miles from Twickenham to Butcher's-gove, and about ten miles from there to Hammersmith, and he was at Hammersmith as soon as me; I could not get a constable, and a man came up, and he told him, that he had got some lead, and that I wanted to be busy, and had stopped him; the man asked if I had got a constable; and he said, no; then the man said, he could not stop me; the prisoner then said, he would knock me down if I offered to stop him; I told him, then I would follow him, I followed him in my cart, and he in his, over London-Bridge, where I got a constable, and took him.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You knew Hanson before? - A. Yes.</p>

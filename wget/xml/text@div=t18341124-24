                  </hi>. I am a mariner, and lodge at the Ship, Bell-wharf stairs. Early in the morning of the 21st of November, I was in company with my shipmate, and fell in with the prisoner—another girl joined com<lb></lb>pany with me—she took us to her house, No. 2, Upper John-street, and in about ten minutes asked for something to drink—we went out and got some drink—I changed a sovereign—I then had seven sovereigns about me—we had one pot of beer and a pint and a half of gin, which came to nearly 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we went home and drank, and Moss laid down—the young woman who he came with, wished him to go to her lodging, but he would not, and she left—I went to bed with the prisoner—I gave her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put my pantaloons under my head with a purse, 7 sovereigns and 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. In it; and about five o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by feeling something over my face—I made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi>, And caught the pantaloons, and found there was nothing in the pockets—I seized the prisoner's hand, and asked her for my purse and sovereigns, and said, "You are robbing me"—I directly took out of her hand 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I made an alarm, and sent Moss for an officer, as the candle the landlady brought nearly went out—the officer came, and found the purse outside the fender, and two rings inside the fender—I found no more of the money, except what the officer who took her found.</p>

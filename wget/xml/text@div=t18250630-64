I was not quite certain of him at that moment, because his hat was off. I did not wish him to be taken till I was more convinced; the officer led me down the street where he thought he might see somebody who answered more fully. The prisoner came out of the public-house directly after he had seen me, with his hat on - I then told the patrol I was convinced he was the man - he immediately left a person whom he was with, and bolted up a passage; the patrol called him back, and he was taken. I am convinced he is the man. My reticule contained two 10 l. notes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not the landlord say the prisoner had been sitting there, drinking, for two hours? A. The landlady did. He looked me stedfastly in the face for a length of time when he robbed me. Nothing was found upon him. I was not so certain of him, but I wished a more convincing proof.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the other man come out of the public-house with him? A. I do not know, my Lord.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 7th of June I was on duty near Great Russell-street, and was informed this lady had been robbed - I met her soon afterwards; she described the man. I took her to this public-house - she went in, and pointed the prisoner out herself; he and two others were there: she said she had every reason to believe he was the man - I desired her to be particular; she said she was not confident, but had every reason to believe he was the man. We went out to see if we could find any one circulating the notes, and in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner with two more, standing, talking together, by the passage door - the prosecutrix said there was the same young man as was in the public-house - his back was towards her; he went into the passage. While we were going up towards him I called him back - he came to the door, and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want with me - why did you not take me when you was in the public-house." The prosecutrix, her husband, and another gentleman consulted for a few minutes - she then said he was the man. He lives at the house which he went into.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He went up the passage before you went up to him? A. Yes. The lady did not speak positively to him till after the consultation. The landlord of the public-house told me there was nobody there who I wanted, for those persons had been there for a considerable time.</p>
               <p>CHARLES RAINSFORD. My wife came home after this happened - I went out with her; we saw three men in Church-street - she said one of them was the prisoner: we walked towards him, and he ran across the street, into the passage of a house - the patrol called him - he came back - she looked at him, and felt confident that he was the man - he said he was going up to bed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent.</p>

            . I keep this public-house. I recollect the officer and this lady coming there - the prisoner had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300022"></xptr>come in about half-past eight o'clock, and went away about twenty minutes to ten.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What made you observe the time? A. When the lady came in my wife observed that every body had been there for two hours. I had seen him there on the Sunday before. I cannot say that he had not been out between these times.</p>

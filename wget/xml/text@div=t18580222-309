                  </hi>. I keep the Old Star and Crown, Broadway, Westminster. On 29th Jan., the prisoner and another man came in, between 1 and 2 o'clock—the prisoner called for half a quartern of gin; it came to 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half sovereign, and I gave him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—as soon as they had drunk the gin, they went away—as soon as they were gone, I looked at the half sovereign more particularly, and found it was bad—I sent Kelly out after the prisoner, and he detained him—I went out, and saw him—a constable came up, and I told him he had given me a bad half sove<lb></lb>reign; the prisoner said, "If I gave you a bad half sovereign, give it me back, and I will return you the change"—I said, "No, I shall wait till the constable comes"—the constable came, and I gave it to him—the prisoner hit the constable's hand, and knocked the half sovereign out, and it fell on the ground, and the prisoner made a kick to kick it down an area, but it did not go down; I picked it up, and gave it to the constable a second time.</p>

               <p>to go and detain them; I followed them, and overtook them about 300 or 400 yards off—they were together all that time—I went and spoke to the prisoner; they were then in Dartmouth Street—I asked the prisoner if he had been into a public house in the Broadway; he said he had not; he denied having been into any public house at all; he said, "I know nothing about it"—Mr. Welch turned the corner, and called to me to detain them, they were the men; and directly the prisoner saw Mr. Welch, he said he recollected being in a public house in the Broadway—Mr. Welch came up, and told him he had given a bad half sovereign—the prisoner thrust his hand into his pocket, and said, "Give me the half sovereign; I will give you the silver"—Mr. Welch refused to give him the half sovereign; he gave it to the constable, and the prisoner knocked it out of his hand, and tried to kick it down an area.</p>

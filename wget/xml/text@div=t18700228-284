I am the wife of Samuel Burton, and live at 2, Coronation Place, Brewhouse Lane, Hamptead—my husband is a labourer—on Friday, 28th January, I was going home about 7.30 in the evening—I met the pri<lb></lb>soner coming down stairs—she was the worse for drink—I stood about twenty minutes or half an hour in conversation with her, and then I went up stairs—I lodged in the room opposite the prisoner, on the same floor—my mother, Mrs. Powell, lodges with me—the prisoner came up almost directly after me—I smelt burning after I got up stairs—the prisoner came to my mother's door and asked for a candle—my mother gave her one and she went to her own room—mother afterwards called me and I went into the prisoner's room—the room was full of smoke, and I saw a bundle burn<lb></lb>ing on the floor—the prisoner looked at the fire place, there was no fire there, she turned her back round—I picked up the bundle from the floor, she took it out of my hand and chucked it out of the window—she did Dot say anything—the curtain was not set fire to when she threw the bundle out of window—I am quite certain it was not—it was put clean out of the window, without having time to catch the curtain—I went away down stairs to her mother—the bundle was not flaming, it was embering away—I told her mother, Mrs. Day, what had taken place—I saw the bundle flaring on the tiles and I got out of the window and got the bundle off the tiles—they were smouldering—I put it in the sink and threw some water over it—it was a very small bundle—about the size of a hat—it looked like small pieces of lining—I went up stairs again, after I had put the bundle out—when I went up the prisoner went down, and when I looked out of my window she was breaking her mother's windows—she put her fist through them—she broke three or four panes—she came up stain again and asked my mother for some lucifers—my mother gave her some and she went into her own room with them—she left her room after, and I smelt fire again—I looked out of my window and I saw some flare coming out of the window of the prisoner's room—she asked the man in the yard for some lucifers after my mother had given her some—when I saw the flames coming out of the window she wad down in the yard—she looked towards the window as if she was surprised when she saw it—my mother then went into the prisoner's room and I went in after her—the muslin curtain was in flumes, my mother pulled it down with her hand, and put it out—that was about half an hour after the bundle was on fire on the floor—the prisoner came up stain again after the fire was put out—she was very drunk and seemed greatly excited—she used very bad language—the paint of the window sash was just scorched.</p>

On Sunday the 26th of September I went to bed and fastened the house as usual, the house was shut up at eleven o'clock; I dare say I got into bed as the clock struck twelve; on the 26th in the morning, I was alarmed by hearing some person in the bar; I struck a light and came down stairs with a candle in my hand and saw nobody in the bar; I went to the tap-room door and heard a noise, I supposed there must be somebody in the room, I went up stairs and alarmed my wife, saying, there were thieves in the house; she looked out of the window and alarmed the watchman, I then came down stairs again and went towards the tap-room and heard a bustling, I waited till a lodger came down to open the door to the watchmen; then three watchmen came in, they went into the taprooms and found the prisoner there, he was taken in custody, he begged for mercy, saying the property that he had got on his person all belonged to me, he would surrender it up, he emptied his pockets, pulled out four silver spoons, a plated sturer, a quantity of halfpence, some bad sixpences, and a Spanish dollar, they were all in my possession on the over night; a dial was taken from the bar, and put against the tap-room door, with a bundle containing all the articles in the indictment; we then took him to the watchhouse.</p>

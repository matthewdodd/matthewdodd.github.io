                  </hi>. I live at 14, Lismore Road, Kentish Town—I have known the prisoner for twenty years, or something like that—about the 14th of March the prisoner's clerk Anderson brought me this bill—upon that I went to the prisoner with it, and said, "Mr. Curnock, this acceptance seems rather different from what your brother's usually is"—of course I had done a few for him before—he said, "It is all right, it is my brother's acceptance "—he said the bill had been given for manure, I believe, and gravel—upon that I gave him a cheque for 137<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., less 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. dis<lb></lb>count—I gave him 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in two cheques, one of 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the other of 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that bill was dishonoured—I afterwards went to the prisoner and saw him about it—I heard there were forged bills out, and I asked him whether that was a genuine bill, and he said no, it was a forgery—I then asked him how much had been forged—he said, "About 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Mine is more than that"—he said he hardly knew then what amount his</p>

               <p>clerk had done it for, but I said, "Mr. Curnock, you are the drawer of the bill; this is your handwriting, and you endorsed the bill; he could not do it without your knowledge"—I asked him who wrote the body of the bill, and he said, "Edward," meaning his clerk Anderson—I held at that time about 570<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or something like that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do I understand that you had discounted bills with George Curnock as drawer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I think, from what I can see in my book, I had discounted about 15, 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. prior to this transaction, with the 570<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I held—those bills were taken up—they were paid—the acceptor to those bills was Thomas Curnock—drawn by George Curnock, endorsed by Thomas Curnock, and duly paid when they became due—I had never seen the brother write—I did not know his writing at all, but this looked to me different from the other bills—I compared it with some bills I had got by me—the prisoner has been contractor for the parish of St. Pancras—I can't say whether the prisoner is an illiterate man—I don't know that his clerk took the management of his business—I believe he did—I should say this bill is drawn by his clerk—I should say the acceptance is in a disguised hand—I should say the person who wrote the body of the bill wrote the acceptance—I should say the acceptance is not in the prisoner's hand-writing—it appears to me all to have been written at the same time, by the ink—Anderson is not here; we cannot get him—attempts have been made to get him—I was in hopes you would have produced him to-day on your side—I did not serve the prisoner with a writ, or his brother—I did not attend a meeting of creditors at any time—he was not given into custody till September, I believe—if he had gone away, and taken his family away altogether, I don't think anybody would have prosecuted him—he did not go away—I believe he petitioned the Court of Bankruptcy—I don't know that the whole of his property was divided amongst his creditors—I think he said "I will pay the bill out of the money I shall receive from the parish"—I don't know whether we should have prosecuted him if he had paid the money—I did not wait to see if I could get my money—I made up my mind that if he did not leave the country I would try to get him out myself, to do my best to get him away—I mean leave the country voluntarily—I heard there was a meeting of creditors—this bill was left at my house during my absence, for the purpose of being discounted, and the next day I took it down and gave Curnock a cheque for the money—sometimes Anderson brought me the bills on former occasions, and some-times I have called on Mr. Curnock—he handed me the bills several times—generally I have given him the money for the bills personally, and he has handed in the bills personally—this bill was left—he did not say it was for work done, for manure, I think—when I went to him and said, "Is this a genuiue bill?" he did not simply say, "No, it is not;" he said, "It is a forgery"—he used the word "forgery"—I can't say where Anderson was at that time—he had not gone away then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stone merchant, carrying on business in High Street, Camden Town—I have known the prisoner as a neighbour about fourteen years—I recollect Anderson the prisoner's clerk bringing me this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he brought it to my office, and I gave him a cheque for the bill—I watched him across the road, and saw him go towards his master's office—I live just opposite—I felt rather uneasy about giving the young man the cheque, and I went down the steps after him and met the prisoner—I said, "I have given your clerk a cheque, and, as it is a large sum, I thought I would come down"—he said, "It will be all right"—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186609170074"></xptr>
               <p>I gave the clerk this cheque for 188<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when the bill became due it was dishonoured—the day after, on the 11th of June, the prisoner came to me and asked me if I had got the bill—I said I had, it had been in my desk all the while—he said, "I am very glad of that; I shall take up the bill as soon as possible"—I was not well at that time, and I went away—when I came back I found the prisoner was a bankrupt—I attended a meeting of his creditors—he came up into the room when he was asked—I was chairman—I asked the prisoner if the bills drawn on his brother were all forgeries, and he said, "Yes, all of them"—he said that in the presence of the whole of the men—his brother was there also—another gentleman present put a question to him as to a bill drawn on Mr. Bowen—that was the only question that was put to him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you discounted any similar bills to that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never—I knew Anderson—Mr. Curnock has borne the character of a very respectable man up to this—from what I have seen of his writing, I should not consider him an educated man—I believe Anderson went into his service as a boy—I only know the prisoner's writing from seeing the endorsements—the acceptance to my bill is not his handwriting; it appears to me that the filling up and so on are the handwriting of a person more schooled than himself—Anderson delivered the bill into my hand on the 8th March, and took the cheque away from me—I watched him go to Mr. Curnock's office—I had not the bill in my hand that I know of when I met Curnock—he called on me before 11th June; he asked me if I could do another bill for him—at that time the money market was high—I believe the Bank of England were charging ten per cent.—the prisoner said he should have some money bye and bye, and he was to take the bill up—I consented to wait—my clerk presented it on the 12th June—it was pay<lb></lb>able at his own house—I did not know at the time he told me he should have some money that it was a fictitious acceptance—I only knew after he was a bankrupt—when he was a bankrupt I put the bills in the hands of my solicitor, who served the prisoner's brother Thomas with a writ, and it was when the brother made an affidavit that I knew it was a forged bill—I believe he made himself a bankrupt—he did not show any concern what-ever at the meeting of creditors—he seemed totally indifferent—the ques<lb></lb>tion was put to him, and he said outright, without any hesitation," They are all forgeries, those bills drawn on ray brother Thomas "—he did not appear to be ashamed of it—he did not say at the time that Anderson wrote these bills—I have heard him say so since—he first said that in my hearing, when we had him in the cab, in charge, in the presence of the policeman—he said it was his clerk had got him into this trouble—that is the only bill I discounted—I am not a bill discounter—I did it as a neighbour, as a neighbourly act—I was only present at one meeting. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why did you not give him in charge at the time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I don't enjoy very good health, and I thought there were others, greater sufferers than myself, in the meeting who perhaps might take it in hand, but I made the remark at the meeting that I had lent the money to the prisoner as a friend, but I should prosecute him as a felon—that was in June—I did not take steps till September, but I have been out of town—if I had been able to attend to my business I should have taken steps to have brought the prisoner here—it was not the promise that the bill would be taken up that prevented me—there was no promise made to me that the bill would be taken up.</p>

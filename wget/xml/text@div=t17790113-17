               <p>I was met by the prisoner and another girl on the 20th of September last. They came up to me, and asked me to give them something to drink; I said I would not. They asked me to go with them; I said no. The prisoner said to me, my dear, you had better come with me. I went with her and her partner to their lodgings, in the house of Mr. Burn, in <placeName id="t17790113-17-crimeloc98">Buckler's-street, St. Giles's</placeName>

There was no light; the prisoner said, young man, we have have eat no victuals all day, nor drank any thing. I said I had eat and drank enough, thank God, and put my hand in my pocket, and gave the prisoner a shilling; the other girl went down stairs, and brought up a loaf, some meat, and some beer, and a candle lighted. I stripped and went to bed; they were eating their victuals when I was in bed. I put my watch on the mantle piece over the chimney; it was a silver watch; the maker's name Bland, No. 2839. They eat enough as they said themselves; then the other girl came to bed. She pulled off all her clothes, but her smock. I was in bed. The prisoner pulled off her petticoat, her bonnet, and shoes. She went to my watch, and took hold of it; I asked her what she did with that, and bid her let it alone. O, my dear, said she, I am only putting it farther on, that it may not fall. She locked the door, put out the candle, and laid down on the bed without pulling any more of her clothes off; this was between ten and eleven o'clock. Soon after that I fell asleep; I awoke about one o'clock; I said I would see what o'clock it was, and put my hand over this way (describing it) and missed the prisoner. I awaked the other girl, and said where is your partner, I cannot find any of my things? just so. I got up in my shirt and felt about as well as I could in the dark, and found the door open; the other girl got up, and could not find her gown, one of her shoes, and one of her stockings; the prisoner had run away with them; so I came down as well as I could in the dark. I began to feel about the place down stairs till I came to the landlord's door; he called out, who is there? I was feeling about every where for this woman; the landlord asked, who is there? A friend says I; he said, what do you here? I said, indeed, I am robbed, I have lost all my things up stairs by one of the women. He got a light; I went in in my shirt. He said to his wife, God's blood and zounds, what is all this? what lodgers do you keep up stairs? His wife said, what brought him into my house, send him to the round-house? I said it was a pity to send me to the round-house, at that time of night, when I was naked; I said do not do it. The prisoner could not be found for ten weeks after; when she was taken I was at work in Grosvenor-square. The constable sent for me to Justice Welsh's office.</p>
               <p>All your clothes were taken away? - I was in my shirt. I searched the room, and all my clothes were gone but my shirt and my shoes. I went to the justice's at five in the evening, the day the constable sent for me, and saw the prisoner coming from the round-house. I knew her in a minute.</p>
               <p>How came the constable to know that this was the girl that robbed you; had you given a description of her? - Yes; at Justice Welsh's office the next morning; the other girl could not go with me for want of her clothes. I went to the justice's with the prisoner; he bid her tell what the had done with the things; she said she did not lie at home that night. The justice asked me if I knew her to be the person; I said I did. I have seen many women's faces. I knew none to be the woman, but this. She was sent back to prison till Wednesday to see if she would tell where the things were. I went again to the office at five o'clock on Wednesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177901130019"></xptr> night, and the prisoner would not tell any thing about it. She only laughed at the justice; the justice told her she was a hardened wretch, and he would commit her to Newgate; she laughed, and said that was the place she wanted to go to. I was desired to come to Hick's-hall the 11th of January.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find any of your things? - Not a halfpenny worth.</p>

               <p>I went to the prisoner's house with four other officers, and was let in by Appletree; I acquainted him I had a warrant to search the house; he was secured with the other two men; I saw them in a back room on the right-hand side, without their coats, and without their hats, they all three appeared in a very great heat; I went down stairs with Wray, and found a stamping-press, with candles a-light, which I left in the possession of Wray; I found some counterfeit halfpence in a box, finished, up one pair of stairs from the cellar, which were coloured and finished, the key was in the possession of Mrs. Appletree, and some farthings in the same box, which I have had in my possession, Wray had the dies and press; I saw the different apparatus which has been produced.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you observe their hands? - A. From their hands, they had been very recently at work; and, at the fly, it is necessary to have three people at work, one to seed, and the other two to pull, and then it receives the impression.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. That halfpenny, when you took it out, was not in a situation in which it could circulate? - A. No; I found a great deal of dirty saw-dust, and a few halfpence by the side of the press on the one side, and a great quantity of blanks on the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cullen. Q. Look at these finished ones;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179606220081"></xptr>do they correspond with the impression upon the die? - A. Exactly.</p>
               <p>Court. Would these on the side of the press circulate? - A. No; they had not been in the pickle, they had not been through the trounsing bag.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I found this bottle of liquid, and this net up stairs, and this pot (producing a large iron pot); the liquid, in this bottle, is some that I took out of the pot; they boll the halfpence in the liquid, in a net, to change the colour of the halfpence, to make them fit for circulation; and I found two blanks cut out for sixpences.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Armstrong). Are these things compleat for the coining of halfpence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these halfpence, and see if they are counterfeit? - A. Yes, they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Are they in such a state as they might pass? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Where did you find these halfpence? - A. In a box, of which Mrs. Appletree gave me the key.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were there any halfpence fit for circulation found in any other place besides the box of Mrs. Appletree?</p>
               <p>Ferris. Q. There were two, in a paper that was found in Reynolds's pocket, (produces it); it contains blanks for farthings or sixpences.</p>

               <p>Armstrong. This is counterfeit, and is in a state of circulation, which I found in Reynolds's pocket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How many of the same kind may you now have in your pocket? - A. I might have a dozen in a day in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Richard Appletree's defence. I am guilty of this but not of the other.</p>
               <p>Reynolds's defence. I had not any thing at all to do with it; I had removed my loom into his room; it had been there three weeks; I never saw this young man do any thing of that sort; my wife being ill, and I getting in liquor, and being uneasy in my mind, I did not see him at work at all; I was coming down stairs with my hat under my arm and my coat, and hearing the gentlemen say they had a warrant, I thought it was a warrant that my wife had sent against me, and I ran into that room to hide myself.</p>
               <p>Brown's defence. I called to see Mr. Appletree's wife; I have lived with Mrs. Paget these twelve years, and as she had this child, she asked me to call that day to help her carry the child home; I have had the child in my care for these two years.</p>

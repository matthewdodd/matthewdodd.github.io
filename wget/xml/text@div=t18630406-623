                  </hi>. I am a midshipman belonging to the Peruvian Corvette <hi rend="italic">Arica</hi>—on Thursday night, 20th March, I was officer of the watch on board the <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi> hulk—it is the practice to have twenty-four hour watch for each officer—I had commenced my watch at 8 o'clock that morning—some of the soldiers were allowed leave on shore that day; I don't remember how many—the prisoner was not one of them—two of them returned to the ship about 11 o'clock—about 11 o'clock I found the soldiers in their berths with lights, playing cards; two of them were quarelling—Cabaro, the sergeant on guard, went below with me—I desired him to put one of those who were quarrelling into confinement, which was done—one of the soldiers took up a bayonet—after they mutinied, I went into my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in to get my sword—when I returned with it, I found Perez, Mango, Mesa, and another one quarrelling, and I went with my sword in my hand to stop the quarrel; the soldiers had bayonets at this time—I then went and gave in a report to the officer in command—the Commander-in-chief was not on board—I came back between decks with the officer in charge—Perez and Mesa told us they were going ashore by force or by goodness; it was Perez that spoke—the sailors were then all asleep in their berths—they were called up after the soldiers went to their arms—that was about an hour after the row began, we could not keep the soldiers below, they got up between decks and took the arms from the armoury, all the lot—the armoury is between decks—I did not lock the armoury: I put a sentinel there—shots were fired at this time; when they wanted to come up, the sailors and the officers stopped them—Sergeant Vargas was the first that fired—the shots were fired at the sailors from below—the sailors got their arms—this state of things continued till half-past 12 o'clock—the soldiers afterwards came up between decks—the sailors were keeping the hold to prevent the soldiers from coming up—they got up through a hole in the fore part of the vessel—after the sailors retired from between decks, the soldiers came up through all the holes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who came and attacked them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first was Sergeant Vargas, Corporal Mango, Corporal Mesa, Perez, and other soldiers—they got up the fore-hatchway—upon that, six of the sailors retired to the upper part of the deck, and the others ran away to other parts of the vessel—the soldiers then got possession of the main deck, and they fought on the deck—Oliva was in the bottom part of the vessel, but he was taken out of there and armed; the others let him out, I don't know who they were—Oliva was the man that was put in confinement at first—when I saw him up he was armed—I only saw him when the soldiers came between decks—I recollect an attack on midshipman Iladoi—Perez was there then—Mess, Oliva, Callejas, and Mango—Callejas was between decks with Perez, Iladoi, and all the others—I did not see Callejas stabbed—Oliva was sober as far as I could tell.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time when this affair began, about how many were on board, soldiers and sailors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About eighteen sailors and about fifty soldiers—the sailors took the part of the officers; all were engaged on one side or the other—some of the soldiers were on the part of the sailors—Callejas the deceased was a corporal—the prisoner was placed in confinement at twenty minutes past 11—it was about half-past 12 that I saw him on the deck—I could see below, down the hatch<lb></lb>way—there were lamps, some were hanging in their proper places, and some the men had got—Iladoi is very ill, he is not here—he was not armed—he had no sword with him—Perez and Mango had muskets and bayonets, and Mesa also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So far as you could see, was not Mesa the person who made the rush at Iladoi? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All the lot that have been named, they came together to attack him—Mesa was the person who was most prominent.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was Mesa taking a more active part than the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the prisoner was not armed when he came between decks—he had his strap and his bayonet, but not his musket—he had his bayonet in his hand.</p>

I am drummer and second corporal of the corvette <hi rend="italic">Arica</hi>—I remember the 20th March—the soldiers were below playing the guitar and playing cards—the officer in charge came down and requested them to leave off, and took the cards away from them—I did not arm myself and come on deck, because I was ordered to retire to my berth by the corporal; the sailors were all up above, on deck and we were below—I was placed as sentinel by Sergeant Garra, to prevent the others from coming down—I remember seeing Mr. Iladoi—the man that was killed, Callejas, ran to throw himself in front of him—Oliva was below at that time among the others—I was standing there when Callejas placed himself before Iladoi, and Oliva was present, with his bayonet charged in that way (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>), and I came and attempted to interfere, but the other pushed it forward—I don't know whether he ran it into his breast; olive stab him, but I don't know where—I was standing behind Oliva, who had his bayonet charged—I attempted to restrain him, but the others said no, I should not, and he pushed it on into Callejas—Callejas was before Iladoi, with his arm round him, holding him, to guard him—Oliva came with his bayonet, presented it at Callejas, and ran it into him—Callejas said to him, "Oh, you have run the bayonet into me!" and with that I went on, because I was on guard.</p>

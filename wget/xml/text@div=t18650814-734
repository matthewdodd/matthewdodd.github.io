He said "I cannot give it, it was taken away from me"—I said "you must tell me the particulars"—he said "Three fellows followed me out of the bank, one took me by the arms and another by the throat, and another took the money out of my waistcoat pocket"—I asked his sister at what time he arrived there—she said at ten or fifteen minutes after 2—his mother said, "Help your master"—he was very cross with her and refused to speak to her—I gave him in custody.</p>

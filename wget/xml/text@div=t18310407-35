On the evening of the 17th of March, about half-past five o'clock, two men came to the shop - I was at home; they asked for some jackets - I showed them several, to which they made objection, and wanted me to show them something else - the prisoner was not one of those men; he was at the door at the time - I had a jacket hanging near my door, within reach of a person outside - while the two men were engaging my attention I saw that jacket go - I laid hold of the two men, who were in the shop, and put them out; I saw the prisoner by the light of the next shop putting my jacket into the breast of his own jacket - I am sure he was the person doing that; I pursued him, and just as I got up to him he threw it at me - I did not pick it up; I followed him, and just as I was taking him the Policeman met him, and took him - on my return to my shop I took up the jacket; this is it.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q.Was I in your shop that night? A. No- I saw you with this jacket; you were placing it under your own jacket, and when you saw me coming you threw it at me - I still pursued till you were taken - I did not say four or five persons came into the shop - I said only two; I saw the jacket go, but I did not see you take it - it has a tear where it was torn from the line it hung to; I was not quick enough to take you when you threw it at me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single and live at 2, London Place, Bermondsey—at about 4.15 on the afternoon of 31st August I was in Holborn, standing just outside a crowd, when I felt the prisoner taking my watch out of my belt—I took it from him—it was fastened to a jet chain—a policeman came up and I gave him in custody—he had got some way off before he was taken—I have no doubt that he is the same person—he was close to my side and I saw his face—I looked at him and he looked at me—I live with my parents—I was then going to see my sister.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There were a great many people, all pretty close to each other, looking at a grindstone being lifted into a cart—there was no one with me—I did not see another young man in front of the prisoner also walking away—this is the chain (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is not broken—it was tucked underneath my waistband and out again.</p>

I am a foundryman—I was in Holborn on the afternoon in question—there was a crowd, and I saw the prisoner near the prosecu<lb></lb>trix, so close that I suspected him and watched him for about half a minute, and with his right hand he drew her watch out of her belt—I saw the watch actually leave the belt—I identify the prisoner as the man who took it—I had time to observe his face—the prosecutrix took the watch from him and he walked leisurely away, after which I spoke to her and he was given into custody.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had never seen the prisoner before—there might have been another man there with a felt hat on—I was not in work at the time, but was looking for employment—I know that the prisoner has got about fourteen witnesses here as to his character.</p>

About 4.15 on the afternoon of 31st August I wag in Holborn—Simpson pointed out the prisoner to me, who, when he saw me coming, started to run, and turned up his coat collar—I stopped him and took him into custody—I did not see any one else running in front of him.</p>

The prisoner is my eldest son—he is 22 years of age—I live at '14, I field Road, West Brompton, and am a plumber and house decorator—the prisoner has always been under my roof unless he has been on a country job, and I have always found him honest—on the 31st August I told him to call upon me at 1 o'clock, to see me where I was at work in Water Lane, City—when he came to me it was 1 o'clock, and I sent him to see a Mr. Fisher, the foreman of the plumbers' work—he would have to go to Vauxhall Bridge and then to Bedford Square—he then called at the Holborn Restaurant and saw one of the workmen there he went to enquire about—I have made enquiries since and find he went there about what the men call "beer-time," that is about 3 or 3.30—he was under my roof and in my employ at the time—he had his own pocket picked of a watch in November last, and I believe he gave notice to the police.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a detective officer of the City of London police—I took the prisoner into custody on 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi> December, in Great Guildford-street, Borough—he was occupying one small room there—I read the war<lb></lb>rant to him that I had previously obtained from Guildhall Police-court, and I told him I was a police-officer, and I apprehended him for obtaining a quantity of tablecloths from Mr. Moorhead, who was then with me, under false pretence, in the name of Lovell, Son, &amp; Co.—he said he was only a servant in the matter—I asked him who he was servant to—he said, "Lovell &amp; Co."—I said, "Can you tell me where Mr. Lovell is to be found?"—he said, "I cannot"—I said, "What have you done with the tablecloths?"—he said, "They are in pledge"—I said, "Have you the duplicates?"—he said, "I have some"—he took from his pocket twenty-eight duplicates—I have produced some of them; they were pledged at fifteen pawnbrokers—several have given up the property—I found a trifle in money on him; 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or some<lb></lb>thing like that.</p>

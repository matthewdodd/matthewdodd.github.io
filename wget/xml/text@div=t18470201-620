                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and lived in Vauxhall-street, Lambeth. Last Nov. the prisoner came to my shop—I observed her so as to be ac<lb></lb>quainted with her features—she came again the same week—I attended to her—she purchased articles to the amount of 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and tendered me a half-sove<lb></lb>region—I gave her 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., counted out 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave her 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to make her full change—while I was counting out the 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. she said she wanted all small change, as she had got a card party that night—I said I would give her four sixpences, and I took two shillings from the nine shillings—I turned my eyes from her, and opened the till to get the four sixpences—I put them down with the rest of the change, and then saw that there was a shilling gone—she said, "How much do the things come to?"—I said 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said, "You have given me one shilling short"—I said, "I gave you the proper change; this is the second time you have swindled me; if you are not out of my shop directly I will lock you up"—she immediately took up her things, and the change and went out.</p>

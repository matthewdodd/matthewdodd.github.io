                  </hi>. I am clerk to John William Nyren and another—they deal in charcoal. On the 17th of Sept. I was in their counting-house—the two Rowe's came into the yard with a cart—after some time John Rowe came to me and requested a note for the delivery of eleven bags of charcoal, and four bags of charcoal-dust—the prisoner Jason Jonathan Rowe, who is his father, was in the yard—Taylor was in the yard, but I could not see him then—I made out the delivery-note for eleven bags of charcoal, and four of charcoal-dust for John Rowe, and be paid me—parties come to me for the quantity they want—they pay me, get a delivery-note, and then take the note to Murphy, who delivers the charcoal and dust—the total value of the eleven bags of charcoal, and four of charcoal-dust was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw the cart leave the place, but did not observe whether it appeared full—my attention was called to it by Mr. Nyren, and I gave him an Account of the number of sacks I had mentioned in the delivery-note which I gave to the prisoner.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner a little while; I am a confectioner, and live in Middlesex-street, Aldgate. On the 28th of May, the day after the robbery, or shortly after, I spoke to the prisoner about the robbery, in consequence of what Langley told me, I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing of the notes; this was at my house, he was in the habit of coming there, his son was at home at the time - I could not find him - I asked the prisoner what Langley was taken up for, he said he could not tell me; I went to the gaol and asked Langley, he(Langley), told me that he had stolen the notes "himself" and given them to the boy. The prisoner said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards ask the prisoner about it? - A. He never told me he had the pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he tell you? - A. He said he knew nothing about the pocket-book-at another time he said he had a 10l. note, which he offered me for 9l.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner, or did he not tell you where he got the 10l. note - A. He had it in his hand, I told him I thought it was the note that was stolen from the coach - He made no reply, but took it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he never acknowledged to you that he had the pocket-book - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever tell you any thing about the pocketbook, or did he always persist that he knew nothing about it - A. He always persisted in knowing nothing about it. I am no relation to the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Alexander Chambers, in Horse Shoe Lane—it is a lodging house and a beer shop—I know Evans as a former lodger—on the 20th December last I was in the bar, and the prisoner Gordon came in between 9 and 11 o'clock—he tendered me a shilling for a pot of beer—I put it in my pocket—I gave him the change for it—he then went away—I looked at the shilling after he left, and found it was bad—I also found three other bad shillings—there were four in all—I can't say from whom I had received the others—on Monday, 21st December, the prisoner came in, in company with another person—I saw a passing of money between the three—the one that got away passed it to Gordon, and Gordon to Evans—Evans tendered a bad shilling for a pot of beer, which I broke in their presence—I said the money was as bad as those who had passed it—I kept it in my waistcoat pocket—I then went out for a constable—the prisoners remained in the bar—as I was returning they were running away—I pursued them and called "Stop thief!"—Evans was stopped by a constable—I followed Gordon, and he went into an unfurnished building in Cross Street—the constable searched the house for an hour and a half—I was outside while the constable was inside—I charged Evans with passing bad money, and he said nothing—I gave the bad money to the constable, going to the station.</p>

I was on duty in Wilson Street, on 21st of last December—I heard a cry of "Stop thief"—I saw the two prisoners running, followed by the prosecutor—they ran out of Hone Shoe Alley—I caught Evans in Eldon Street—I then saw Gordon brought in custody—the, last witness charged them with passing bad money—Evans said that a man gave him a bad shilling that evening, and if he was to come forward he would not say that it was him, he would rather suffer for it himself—Mr. Bullen gave me five bad shillings—one was broken in half.</p>

On 21st December, I was on duty near the prosecutor's house—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw Gordon running, he was followed by Mr. Buller—I searched a building after receiving a description—I found him in a hayloft, in an adjoining building—he was concealed under five trusses of straw—I said I should take him into custody for passing bad money, in connection with others—he said, "I could not help it"—I searched him and found a shilling, three sixpences, and three half-pence, and a farthing.</p>

             sworn. I am a constable belonging to the police office, Shadwell. On Friday the 30th of May Mrs. Bedford applied to me between the hours of eight and nine in the morning, she told me her place had been broken open and she had been robbed; I went to her house with her, I met the woman prisoner in the alley, she was very much in liquor; I told her I was come after her, she said she was very glad of it, I told her to go up stairs and shew me her room; Mrs. Bedford, me, and the woman prisoner went up stairs together; in searching the room, at the foot of the bedstead I perceived some dirty linen, under which was this hammer, there was a large jar stood in the room with a small top to it; in that jar I perceived there was a pair of drawers and some other foul linen; it smelled in such a manner we could not take it out, I kept the hammer in my hand, I told the woman prisoner and Mrs. Bedford to go up stairs before me, that I might see in what manner the room was broken open; I then found the box was broken open with the claws of a hammer; and with the hammer that I have got in my hand; I fitted the claws to the marks on the box, it corresponded exactly in two different places, I then examined the door post, and there was the print of the claws of the hammer there; I brought the box and the woman down stairs: Mrs. Bedford followed us. A gentleman of the name of Palmer came over, he said that is my hammer, he said the woman prisoner borrowed the hammer of him about five o'clock; I told him that hammer had broken open this box. (The box, hammer, and shift, produced.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this conversation in the presence of the prisoner. - A. It was, Mrs. Bedford said she had a shift in such a state she could not well make away<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180607020008"></xptr>with; the next morning I went down to the premises again at her desire, and I searched the premises, and in this jar where the soul linen was, I found this shift in the right thigh of a pair of flannel drawers; Mrs. Webb took the shift out, and Mr. Rogers took out his knife and cut it across the bosom, and gave it to Mrs. Webb in the presence of me and Mrs. Bedford, and after it was clean she returned it to Mr. Rogers again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if I understand you right, the shift was in the thigh of the prisoner's trowsers; where did you find the pitcher when you saw it a second time. - A. I saw it in the same place where I had seen it the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the day before there was a shift lost. - A. Yes, but it was in a very awkward situation for me to search for it; there was an Irish woman there, she put her hands in, it smelt so I turned my head round and went to the other part of the room.</p>

On the evening of the 30th the prosecutrix came up to the office and enquired for Mr. Brown, I told her he was not in the way, and whatever was necessary I would do for her; I went to the pawnbroker's, where I found a big Irish woman with the key of her room, I examined the bundle she had got, they appeared to belong to the prisoner; I went with the prosecutrix to the prisoner's room, I opened the prisoner's room door with the key I received of the Irishwoman who had gone to pawn the things, I searched the room and looked into this pan as described by the other evidence, I saw something that looked like drawers, it smelt so bad I went away; the next morning Brown and I went down with a search warrant, Brown went-up stairs, and the prosecutrix and the last witness; the prosecutrix shewed me a dirty shift they had brought down stairs, it was in a very wet disagreeable state (I produce the shift), I took a knife and cut this mark in it, I told the prosecutrix to mark it; she stitched some yellow thread in the breast of it, I told them to put it in a clean state and return it to me, which they did in about half an hour; I have had them in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that mark you find there correspond with the mark you made. - A. Exactly, and here is also the yellow thread.</p>

            's Defence. When I came in there was a great alarm, Mrs. Bedford said she had been robbed and I well knew it, she had lost every thing; I said we had been out ever since seven or eight o'clock, it is now twelve o'clock; she had a pint of gin on the table, and there were four or five people sitting with her; she said they left her nothing, what says I, have they left you nothing, why the green gown that you pulled off is there hanging up; yes, says she, they have left me that to change. On the morning that Mr. Brown came I had borrowed a washing tub, and Mr. Brown took the things out, and the girl that stood there put them in one by one, the tub belonged to her; as to the things that were put in this jar I know nothing of, nor do I know of Mrs. Bedford's room being broken open; there were two foreigners that slept in that room.</p>

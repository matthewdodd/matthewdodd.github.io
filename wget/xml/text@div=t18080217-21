On the 19th of January the two prisoners came into the shop, between the hours of six and seven in the evening; they asked me to shew them some ribbons; I took a drawer from the counter and shewed them, they did not like them. I took a second drawer and Williams choosed one.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they standing together. - A. They were standing close together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you cut her off any ribbon. - A. I did not; she pitched upon the ribbon and desired I would measure it, I did; it was six yards and a half; Bailey said there were seven and a half, I told her I would measure it over again to convince her I was right; while I was measuring it over again, I observed a hand in the box, I told her I was right, it was but six and a half; I cannot say whose hand I saw in the drawer, but I am certain it was one of the two; there was no person near enough to put a hand in but one of them two. They told me they wanted more, it was for three sister's bonnets; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180802170016"></xptr>must be ten yards, and they wanted it all of one piece; I offered to get it for them by ten o'clock in the morning, that would not do. they wished to go; I told them to stay, I thought I had lost some ribbons, I wished to look them over to see what was missing; they were agreeable to stay, and did stay.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find there were any ribbons gone from your stock. - A. I could not say positively what ribbons I had missed; I sent for an officer, during the time the officer was gone for, I heard a ribbon drop on the floor where they were; I heard the second piece drop, I could not say it was ribbon; I saw Bailey put her hand into her gown or apron that was pinned up; I told her that she had throwed it either out of her gown or apron, she positively denied it, and said it came out of neither; then the constable came. I told him that I heard the sound of two pieces of ribbon falling on the ground; the constable has had them ever since. I am positive they are my husband's property.</p>

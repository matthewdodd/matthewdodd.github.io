On the first of June, I saw these two young fellows, and a young woman with them, they went into the Bedford nursery field; in about half an hour after that I saw Moore coming with a bundle; I asked Moore what he had got: he said what is that to you. I said you know me very well, I have a right to enquire; I seized him by the collar; the other two went across the ditch, and Crouch threw a bottle of wine away;

We went about six yards further, there he and me had another scuffle, we went down again; I begged my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181307140067"></xptr>boy to take the wine up. He took hold of the apron, and the bottles fell in the ditch. We went a little further; we were down again; he got hold of me by the throat, and I got hold of his throat; he tore my throat and neck all to pieces; at last I secured him by the assistance of a baker: he resisted desperately; I took him to the watchhouse.</p>

I did, at a stone-mason's yard, down at the hollow in Fitzroy-square; that was by the direction of the boys that I went there. I took Crouch the next day; I found these five bottles on Moore, and these six bottles we found in the drain.</p>

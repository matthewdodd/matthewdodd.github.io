                  </hi>. I was going up Fenchurch Street, about 12 o'clock, with two friends, and as I passed along London Street I saw the prisoner on the opposite side of the road, meeting me in a very hurried manner from between Fenchurch Street and London Street—about half a minute afterwards I heard a call of "Stop thief!" from the prosecutor, who was about 100 yards behind—I pursued the prisoner, and as I got close to her she doubled her pace—she got over an area grating, and threw something from her hand, which I saw distinctly pass down her dress, and heard it fell, and a second fall underneath—I pursued her, brought her back to the place, and the prosecutor came up, with his chain hanging—a policeman turned his light on, and there was the watch in the area.</p>

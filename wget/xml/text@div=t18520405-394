On 24th Feb., in consequence of information, I went to the house of William Ayles, 33, St. Andrew's-hill, who showed me two pieces of lead weighing about 42 lbs.—I marked it—I then went to the top of the house, No. 22,. Earl-street, Blackfriars, and discovered that a quantity of lead had been taken from there—on 25th, I sent Lee to fetch the two pieces from Ayles; he brought me two, these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I compared them with that on the top of the house, and they corresponded—they had been cut away very roughly.</p>

I am waiter at the Old Shades, Thames-street, and rent the house, 22, Earl-street—I compared these two pieces of lead with that left on the top of the house, and they corresponded—I think 60 lbs. were found, and there was another piece found the following day—the prisoner's wife is ray sister—in consequence of circumstances which it is not necessary to enter into, I took this house three years ago, and put my sister into it to manage it—it is a lodging-house—I paid the rent—I never gave the prisoner authority to take away any lead.</p>

                  </hi>. On the 2nd of October, about one o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing, I was, on my beat, right opposite Christ church, blackfriars-road Surrey, and saw three men going along very disorderly—the pri<lb></lb>soner is one of them—I met them opposite the church, walking on the pavement-two men were coming on, arm in arm—the prisoner knocked down one of them, he got up, and I stated to him, "If you wish to give that person in custody for striking you, I will take him to the station-house, for I saw the assault"—he said he should not be able to attend in the</p>

               <p>morning, as business would not allow him—I followed the prisoner and the others as far as Edward-street, and then said to them, "If I have any more of this I shall take you down to the station-house," the prisoner then turned round, and struck me with his right-hand in the chest—I fell, and my hat went into the road—I got up, and saw the three going down Edward-street—I saw my brother officer Wheatley at a short distance—I called to him, and told him to go up the next street—I went up another street, and the three parties met me again, and the prisoner knocked me down—I got up and caught hold of him—he tripped me up, and was down on me—I had him and a man named Rooks upon me—the prisoner got up, kicked me in the right eye, and gave me a black eye—I was springing my rattle, which I took out of my pocket, and Richard Bone came out of his house, and came up to me as I was down on my back—the prisoner was alongside of me at the time, and the other men close by, but neither of them on me at that time—Bone said, "Give me your rattle, and I will spring it for you"—he took it and sprung it with both hands—the prisoner then <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> away from me, and said to Bone, "You old b——, I'll stop you from springing that rattle"—I saw him strike Bone with his right-hand on the left side—Bone had done nothing to him—the prisoner kicked him on the right leg, and then he fell, and when he was down he kicked him on the right leg and then on the left side—Wheatley left me with the other prisoner—the pri<lb></lb>soner went away from Bone about 100 yards—the other two men were on the spot at the time, one of them scuffling with me and <hi rend="italic">pitching into</hi> me—Wheatley said, "You take care of the other prisoner, while I go and see what has been done to the old gentleman"—I then heard Bone say his leg was broken—the prisoner had then run away from him about 100 yards—I saw Wheatley leave Bone, and go and take the prisoner into custody—Bone was left with Mrs. Holding—I saw two other constables come up while I had Rooks in custody—Wheatley took the prisoner away—Bone was taken on a stretcher to the hospital—no other person kicked him or struck him but the prisoner—he gave him a slight kick on the leg before he fell—the kick on the leg was a severe one, and the one on the side was rather sharpish—the prisoner had low shoes on, not very thick, but not what you would call a light shoe—I saw no other kick given to Bone—I saw Bone afterwards at the hospital—MR. Goodwin, the surgeon, attended him—we left him at the hospital—I saw him after he was dead—he died about a fortnight after—the prisoner was not quite sober—he had been drinking—Bone was sixty-five years of age, and was a private watchman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 2nd of October, a little after one o'clock, I was on duty, and saw Ross between George-street and Charles-street—he said something to me—I afterwards saw him again in Robert-street, at the corner of Charles-street—he was then standing up, and three persons along with him, two of whom were striking him—the prisoner was one of those who struck—before I got to Ross he was knocked down by the prisoner, and when I got up to him he was down, and two men over him—one on each side—I took hold of Rooks who was nearest to me—the prisoner came round to try to get Rooks from me—I then laid hold of him, and was tripped up, still keeping hold of the prisoner—Ross was in the act of getting' up when the prisoner kicked him, and knocked him down—I then tripped Rooks up, and a scuffle ensued between Ross and Rooks on the ground—Ross had just got his rattle out of his pocket when Bone came up, and said, "Give me your rattle, I will spring it for you"—Bone got the rattle, and ran away some distance with it—I was endeavouring to get Ross off the ground—the prisoner broke from my hold, and I heard him say, "You old b——, I will stop your springing the rattle"—I looked round, and saw him beating Bone, who was then standing up—I said, "Good God, he is beating the old man"—I said to Ross, "You <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> to this one"—I left him, and went towards Bone and the prisoner—I saw the prisoner kick him on the leg—he saw me coming behind him, and he jumped on Bone's leg with one foot, and ran on the opposite side of Robert-street—I asked Bone, who was lying down, if he was hurt—he said his leg was broken—I immediately crossed the road after the prisoner—he shifted from there about 100 yards, where I overtook him, and apprehended him—we had a scuffle, and other assistance came from my brother constables—we had a deal of trouble—it took seven of us to take the prisoner and Rooks to the station-house—we sent a stretcher for Bone, and I met them bringing him down Union-street—I went with him part of the way to the hospital—I saw Mr. Goodwin examine him at the hospital, about ten minutes after we got there—I saw no one strike or kick Bone but the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dresser at Guy's hospital. Bone was brought there on Friday morning, the 2nd of October, between two and three o'clock—I examined him, and found a compound fracture of the shin bone of the right leg—I examined his left side, where he com<lb></lb>plained of considerable pain, but no bruise was evident, nor was any bone broken—I found no other injury—he was immediately put to bed, and proper attention paid to him—his leg was laid on a pillow, but I had no<lb></lb>thing else done to it, except the application of some lotion—he died on the Sunday night week, following the accident—I attended him till three days before he died, when I left town—from the first, the leg assumed a bad appearance—inflammation took place, and it became gangrene in two or three days—when I left him, he was in a very bad state—I scarcely ex<lb></lb>pected he would live through the night, as mortification had commenced, and he had an attack of pleurisy in the side—he was said to have been kicked two or three days previously—I left him on Friday morning, and returned on Monday afternoon—he was then dead—his body was not ex<lb></lb>amined—it was the opinion of the surgeons that mortification of the leg caused his death—when I left him, there was no probability of saving his limb or his life—he was not in a state for amputation, which was the only chance of saving his life—nothing had occurred in the hospital to injure him up to the time I left him—he had caught no fever or fresh disease—at the time I left him I thought his life in great danger—there was nothing else dangerous about him but the wound in his leg, and the pleurisy in his side—the leg might be broken either by a kick or a man stamping on it—the pleurisy might be occasioned by a kick in the side, although it produced no external mark.</p>

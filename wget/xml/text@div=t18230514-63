               <p>"This is not the way to your shop," and told me to bring four more mackarel to Mr. Eames, with change for a sovereign. I went and master gave me change. I was coming with it, and she met me and said</p>
               <p>"Where is the change and the three mackarel. I gave them to her, she said she was to give me a shilling each for the mackarel, which was the price. I gave her the change - she told me to make haste back for the other mackarel, and she would wait there for me. I returned with it, and she was gone - she never gave me the sovereign. I did not see her again till Saturday.</p>

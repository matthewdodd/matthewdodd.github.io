My promissory note was payable to the Church and Empire Insurance Company or bearer; it has not been dealt with; I may have to pay it; it was at three months after date from 13th June—my age is 24, I am quite sure of that—I am not agent for other Companies—I was agent once for the British Provident Life and Guarantee Company—I ceased to be so four months before it became bankrupt, and that was conducted by Mr. Ingham, he got the management of it two months before its bankruptcy—I knew that he had become connected with an office which had become bankrupt, and he said he had lost 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it—I did not contemplate an Australian Company, because it was partially formed already, it was only a board of directors—the capital was subscribed already in Australia, but they wanted it to be registered in London, with one office in Melbourne and another in Sydney—I seriously contemplated that, and I mentioned it to Ingham, and said that it only wanted direction, and he mentioned it to Stanley, who he said would get directors for the company—I knew that some articles of association were printed with Stanley and Ingham's names as directors—I knew that the memorandum of association was printed—I saw them and agreed in the terms of them under his respon<lb></lb>sibility—I signed them, it was for advancing money on security in Austra<lb></lb>lia; the chief office was to be in London under his responsibility, because he was to take the management—I know that he paid for printing them.</p>

The first I knew of Mr. Ingham was when he endeavoured to save the British Provident from bankruptcy—I did not solicit to be made agent of the British Provident; I wanted to set my shares—I went into it before I knew Mr. Ingham—I did not want him to take off the loss for me—at the age of twenty-four I have taken shares in three companies, rather too many for my pocket—I took shares in the Glasgow and Caledonian Railway, and the North British, in one or two building com<lb></lb>panies, and in the British Provident Insurance Company—I cannot recollect whether I was a shareholder before I was twenty-one—I was not made con-tributory for the debts of the British Provident, because my shares were paid up in fuli; I had 100 paid-up shares—I joined it before Ingham knew the company—they made a claim on me for a balance of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and I paid that—I said that I held a receipt for the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have had no further trouble except that they have not sold my shares—I would sell them to anybody who would buy them just now, I would not sell the purchaser of the shares, but I have sold myself—I said that I would sell them because they are worthless, nobody will buy them—200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was subscribed in Australia for the Australian Company—Mr. Stanley may have put it as millions—I did not pay the printer, but I saw him paid, and Mr. Stanley was managing director—the 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was subscribed in Australia—I repre-sented to Ingham that my brother's mortgages were to be disposed of by the company; the company were not bound to take over the mortgages, there was no contract, but 'they were to be at liberty to take over my brother's mortgages if they liked—ho wanted the company to do it because if the land was sold at a public sale it would run up—he is older than me—he is not in this country—I told Ingham that if he showed me the names of the directors, and they were substantial, I was quite prepared to guarantee</p>

I am Secretary of the Church and Empire Fire Insurance Company, I received this draft letter from Mr. Ingham—I copied it and sent it to Mr. Macfie—the defendants were managing directors, and the business was carried on at 164, Queen Victoria Street—the Government Security Company have also their office there—Martin &amp; Co. have not, but there are several offices there—as secretary I was not aware of the existence of any bank belonging to the company—Ingham had a private banking account at the Central' Bank, Newgate Street—my salary was 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year payable in shares—I was not paid 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—I have the scrip for my whole twelve months' salary—I paid all cheques I received to Mr. Ingham; they were the payments of agents for premiums—I never saw a banker's pass-book there—this cash-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not in the writing of any of the clerks in the office—there were three clerks besides myself, Mr. Walker, and two others—I put myself in communication with different provincial newspapers—they were paid by fully paid up shares in the company—this "Monroe, 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," in the cash-book is my salary—I kept this share ledgor with the agents accounts—I see."Beach, 17th May, 1876, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 27th May, 79<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., Beach was one of the agents—I handed those cheques to Mr. Ingham.</p>

Mr. Adderley was manager of the company, for a very short time after I joined—he left on 9th February—I was perfectly satisfied to take the payment in shares for my year's services—I am not at all acquainted with the principles of life insurance—I know that the mutual principle is applied to life insurance, but I believe this is the first time it has been applied to fire insurance, it is a new idea—I was in the habit of writing the letters, not a single letter went out of the office which was signed by Mr. Stanley during the last two months—I never received any instructions from him with regard to sending letters—that would cover the letter written in May to Mr. Macfie—I know that Mr. Stanley was absent the whole day on several occasions—I never knew him except as Mr. Stanley, he never to my knowledge received a single 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in salary from the beginning to the end—Stanley had nothing to do with filling up the allotment papers produced by Mr. Macfie; and I am certain that Stanley and Macfie did not meet till 30th June—people are very anxious to be agents for these insurance companies in towns—I am aware that by the memorandum they were authorised to raise in the first instanee 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and afterwards 27,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and they were afterwards authorised as insurances went on, to create a guarantee fund up to 495,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

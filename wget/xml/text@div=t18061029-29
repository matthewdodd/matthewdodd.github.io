             sworn. I am clerk to Messrs. Bracken and Williams. On the 1st of this month, coming into Packer's court in the evening between six and seven o'clock, I turned round to make water, I saw two men at the upper end of the court, apparently making exchange of something from one to the other; they immediately came forward, I saw that one of them had a piece of flannel under his arm, I immediately turned round and asked them what they were going to do with it; I was answered it was nothing to me; I attempted to catch the man that had the flannel, he immediately throwed the flanuel across my legs, before me, so that I could not go forward till I had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Q. They attempted to make off. - A. Yes, as soon as I got the flannel up I called out Stop thief, almost immediately the man was brought back, and by the voice that I heard, it was the man that had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180610290025"></xptr>spoke to me, it was the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the prisoner was the man that had the flannel. - A. I am sure the prisoner is the man that answered me, by his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of knowing his person. - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure by his voice it is the same man that answered you, it is nothing to you when you asked them where they were going with it. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot identify his person any otherwise. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was he brought back to you. - A. One minute I presume, not more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Curwood.</p>
               <p>You say you had not an opportunity of knowing their persons. - A. I had not, it was too dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Soon after the prisoner was brought back to you, will you undertake to swear that the prisoner was the person that passed you. - A. I will undertake to swear that it was him by the circumstance of his voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before, or hear him speak before. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You undertake to swear that the prisoner at the bar is the man, by these few words, having never heard his voice before. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Curwood. Then I will say no more to you, I will leave it to the jury to judge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 112). On 23d Oct., I was on the watch in Caledonian-street, and saw footmarks on the railings, as if somebody had got in at the window, which was unfastened—I went in, and missed the boiler and a quantity of lead pipe—about nine o'clock, I and Walter went to the prisoner's house; Walter asked if there had been a copper brought there last night—the prisoner said, "No"—Walter said he was satisfied there had—the prisoner said he had stopped a copper at nine the night previous, which was brought there by two boys, but he should not know them again—I asked him to let me look at it—he unlocked a door under the stairs, and brought it out from the closet—I put a mark on it and left it there, telling him to take care of it—I went again about half-past two with Walter, and Walker, the landlord's agent—we told the prisoner we came for the copper—he said, "What am I to do? a man has been here for it, who says he sent the boys with it"—we took it away and fitted it; it corresponded.</p>

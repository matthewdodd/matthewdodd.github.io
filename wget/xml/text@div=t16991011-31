                     <interp inst="t16991011-31-verdict158" type="verdictCategory" value="notGuilty"></interp>
               acquitted
            </rs> of it; but as to the second Indictment, the first Evidence deposed, That about the 18th or 19th of July last, he met the Prisoner to Lincolns-Inn-Walks, who told him, That he had a business would do him a kindness, and that he had a Bank Bill, but it was not fairly come by. With that he ask'd him, If it was one of Arthur's Bills? And he replied, No. Then he told him, If he could get him some Exchequer Bills, he had a Friend that could make a 5 l. Bill a 10 l. but he would have 30 s. for his pains. With that they parted, and the Evidence communicated the matter to the Trustees of the Exchequer, and got an Exchequer Bill of 5 l. and brought it to the Prisoner, and they agreed together, and he was to have 10 l. for his share, which he afterwards received of the Prisoner. Another Evidence deposed, That the Prisoners Wife, and one Mrs. Easton, came to his Shop with the Exchequer Bill, the first by the Name of Hill, and the other by the Name of Holmes, and bought as much Linnen as came to 20 l. odd Money, and offered the Bill in payment which was made 40 l. upon which he went out to advise whether it was a good Bill or no, and being told it was a good Bill, he look'd upon it against the Light, and could not see any thing amiss in it; upon which he paid them the rest of the Money. However, being disatisfied, he went to the Exchequer to know the truth of it, being come found it to be only a 5 l. Bill altered, the same the first Evidence produced to the Prisoner; who being taken up, and brought before Secretary Vernon, and being examined about it, after an hours hesitation, he ask'd if there was any Mercy? Upon which it was replied, It was not long since he had received Mercy. Upon which he freely confest the Fact, and said, That no body did it but himself, and showed by what way he did it. It appeared that he was in the Robbery with one Arthur, who robbed the Mail sometime since, who was formerly Executed for the same, and by that means he got the Bank Bills. The Prisoner objected against the first Evidence, and would have had it believed as if he had done it: And for his Confession, he said, That it was an old Maxim in the Law, that what a Person should confess before a Justice, should not be given in Evidence. But it was replied, If there was such a Maxim, it was so old that it was forgotten, but was ask'd, If he could produce any such Record? He replied No. The Jury having considered the matter, found him <rs id="t16991011-31-verdict159" type="verdictDescription">

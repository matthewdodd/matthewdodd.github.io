                  </hi>. I live at Dowler-street, Camberwell—on 21st February, at 8 in the morning, on coming downstairs and opening the middle door in the passage, I found my son's overcoat on the floor—it had been hanging up the night before—on unfastening the window and shutters, I found the room in great confusion; work-boxes and drawers of every description had been turned out, and all sorts of things scattered about—I called Mr. Savage, who lives in the house—I missed an umbrella, a scarf, a watch-guard, my wife's purse, and a coat—this is the umbrella (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and these other articles are my wife's—this watch-guard was hanging up, with a watch, over the mantel-piece—the watch went with it—this is a piece of woollen stuff that was left from my child's frock—I missed it from the house on this occasion—the house was bolted and looked securely the night before—I did not find any locks broken—the entrance was effected by a flap in the back garden—that would lead into the cellar, and then by raising a trap they would get into the kitchen—the cellar flap was not fastened—it only had a weight upon it.</p>

Yes; the floor of the bar is lower than the tap-room - the fire-place where I was sitting, is at the back of the bar - there is a little screen which prevents everything being seen inside, but I can see people's heads - I could have seen their heads if I had looked - there were some coppers in the till, which were separate from the silver.</p>

On the 9th of March I went to bed at half-past ten o'clock - my place was all safe then - at five o'clock the next morning my servant called me, and said she heard some person in the shed - I went down to see, and found the staple of a lean-too shed was drawn - it is in my yard, which has palings all round, and adjoins my dwelling-house - I went in the shed, and missed a copper which had been taken out of the brick work, also the lid of the copper - the prisoner lived about 200 yards from me.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Bow-street. On the 10th of March I went with a warrant between nine and ten o'clock, to the prisoner - I found him at work - his trowsers were in a terrible black state - I searched his house, but did not find the copper - I asked the prisoner how his trowsers became so black - he said the chimney had been on fire the day before - I went and looked about - I found some soot on a gap in a hedge, and some soot on the grass on which some one had been kneeling, and the marks on the soot exactly corresponded with the corduroy breeches which the prisoner wore.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner say that his landlord's chimney had been on fire the day before, and he assisted to extinguish the fire? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I dirtied my trowsers by the chimney being on fire the day before - I did not get up till six o'clock in the morning on the day the copper was lost.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him go into the garden? A. Yes; after he had put out the fire - I did not see the copper found - the gap in the hedge had been made a long time before - we used frequently to go through it.</p>

On 21st March I was on duty at Holloway, about a quarter-past one o'clock in the night—a number of people were assembled outside the Cock public-house, singing, hallooing, swearing, and making a great disturbance—I said, "I hope you will go quietly to your homes"—they said, "You b----r, what do you mean?"—they got round me and knocked me down—both the prisoners were there on the kerb, but it was not by them—I was knocked down again, and then a third time by Empy—there was no other constable there—my face was cut with a fist, I belive, and nearly covered with blood—the third time some one said, "Kick the b----r"—they kicked me, and ran away—a good many kicked me—there were twenty or thirty assembled—after they ran off I sprung my rattle, and they all turned round on me, up a lane leading from Holloway-road to Horn<lb></lb>sey-road—I went after them—they said, "You b----r, go back, or else I will murder you"—the prisoners were there then—they all turned back, came into Holloway-road again, and went towards London—I followed, met two con<lb></lb>stables, and gave two or three in charge who had assaulted me first—the pri<lb></lb>soners cried out, "A rescue!" and began throwing stones—one struck me on the left temple, and I fell, bleeding—they rescued the men, and they began throwing stones as bad as the others—I got up and saw one of the N division on his back, and men jumping on him, kicking him, and crying, "Murder the b----r, slaughter the b----r, and we will soon do for the other"—I went up as quick as I could—one of them, who had got his truncheon from him, struck me on the left temple, knocked me down, kicked me, and said, "Murder the b----r"—I was insensible some time—I after<lb></lb>wards followed the [arty into Brand-street—the prisoners went into two different houses there—we broke in, and took Pickett behind the street-door—I saw the prisoners in the mob the whole time till we got to Brand-street.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, at Highgate. On 21st March, between two and three o'clock in the morning, the officer Pickett was brought to me—he had two wounds on the head and a cut on the eyelid, about an inch and a half long, nearly through the lid, which I think was from a stone—the would in the temple was am inch and a half long, it was through the skin to the bone--there is nothing beneath the skin there—I should say it was caused by the blow of a stick—it was very much contused and cut—he was confined to his bed two days—it was a Fortnight before he could do duty, as he could not wear his hat—the wounds were not dangerous—the stone need not have been thrown with force—a slight blow would split the integument there.</p>

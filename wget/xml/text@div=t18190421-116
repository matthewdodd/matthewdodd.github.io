            . I am patrol of St. John, Hackney. On the 12th of February, about half-past four o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to me in Grove-street, Hackney, and asked me what o'clock it was? I told him; he had a cow with him. He asked the nearest way to Kingsland? I told him, and walked with him to Hackney; he said he should know his way then. I asked him where he brought the cow from? he said, from one</p>

I knew Mr. Bellows kept a good many cows about fourteen years ago, but not then. I observed that the cow was tied down with a small string instead of a halter, and that she was dry. As we were going along, I asked him where the calf was? he said it had been gone six or seven weeks - we had then got near the watch-house; I collared him, and took him in. I found that the cow was very heavy in calf - about seven months gone. Rainham is above twelve miles from where I met him. I sent to Bellows, and in consequence of what he said, I detained the prisoner.</p>

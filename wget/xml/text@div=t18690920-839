I am a church decorator, of Wellesley Terrace, Plumstead—about 7 o'clock, on the morning of 17th August, I was in Gray's Inn Road, and turned into an urinal there—when I came out, the female prisoner asked me to give her a trifle—I put my hand in my pocket, and took out some half-pence—I had a purse in my coat pocket, containing a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in one compartment, three sovereigns in another, and there might be some silver—I had scarcely parted with the coppers, when</p>

               <p>I received a blow on the eye, and saw two men before me, one tall; and the short one of them struck the blow—I will not swear beyond a doubt to Burmiston; but I described him to the police sergeant, and identified him at once—the blow knocked me down, and bunged my eye up—when I arose my sight went away—I also received a blow or a kick on the elbow—I saw the parties ran into a house near—I called "Police!" "Murder!" and saw my puree lying on the pavement—I picked it up, and missed from it 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; but three sovereigns and some silver remained in a small compartment, which was closed—I saw a policeman directly, and described the parties—in consequence of what I told him, we went to the house where I had seen the parties go in who had struck me—we went up stairs—the prisoner opened one door; but the male prisoner was not there; he opened second door, and I saw Burmiston in bed, and recognised him as the man who had struck me, and gave him in change.</p>

               <p>I live at present at No. 11, Arundel-street, Strand; on the 27th of September, I took a coach opposite Mitre-court; the prisoner was the <rs id="t17881022-49-deflabel221" type="occupation">coachman</rs>

I went from there, I think, into Wellclose-square, or somewhere thereabout; it was too long to put in my pocket, and I laid it on the side, upon the seat; the prisoner sat me down in Arundel-street; there was another gentleman in the coach with me, from the beginning; his name is Mr.

            ; I went up stairs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178810220053"></xptr>and called the prisoner up, and paid him his fare, which was 5 s. the prisoner then went down again, as I understand, to his coach; I had some olives in the coach, which the gentleman and me had been eating, and I desired the maid to take them out, they were taken out; I then took the bracelets, which I had in my pocket, and was looking at them, when I remembered the pin, which I had left there; I then went down to see if the coachman was gone, and I found he was; it was not longer than eight or nine minutes; I did not know his number, and I went to the coach office to find him; I was advised to take a coach and drive after the prisoner, and I found the prisoner at the stand at the Mews; it was not more than two hours and a half after; I knew the coach by the horses, having observed their harness; when I found the coach, I opened the door and looked into it, thinking, perhaps, the coachman had not seen it; the coachman was at dinner, and a waterman fetched him; I recollected the prisoner, as coachman, and I asked him for the pin; I recollected him, because he had on a pair of red breeches, and a yellow edging round his hat, I will not say it was gold, and a mark he had over one of his eyes; I described his hat at the office; I asked the coachman if he had seen the pin? I think, I asked him if he had seen a pin, that I left in the coach? he then denied his having it, or having seen it; I then, I think, offered him a reward, or if not then, I did sometime afterward, and to think nothing more of it; he said he knew nothing of the pin, and had taken up a gentleman and set him down, since me; I think he said, the corner of St. James's-street, or Pallmall; I then left him on the stand; he told me I had called him from dinner, and prevented him from finishing a pot of beer; I went to some friends at George's Coffee-house; and afterwards, I think, I found his No. was 945, and I got referred to the master of the coach, in Rupert-street; while I was speaking to his master, desiring him to persuade the man to return it me, the coachman, with the same coach, drove in; I then again asked him after the pin, and offered him a reward of four, five or six guineas; he again denied having it, or having seen it; in about seven, eight or nine days after, a man, like a coachman, came to my lodgings, and gave me some information, in consequence of which, I went to Sir Sampson Wright's, this coachman was there; I think the pin was not then produced; I desired another day might be appointed, and on the 7th of October, I went to the office, where the pin was produced; I think, I saw it in the hands of the pawnbroker. I never got my property.</p>

               <p>If you ever return the value of this pin to the lady, (supposing it to be lost) I dare say, you will look upon it a matter of honor, not of legal obligation? - Certainly.</p>

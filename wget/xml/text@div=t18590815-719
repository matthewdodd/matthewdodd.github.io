                  </hi>. I am a worsted spinner. I have mills in York<lb></lb>shire—No. 8, Lillypot-lane, are my offices in London—I opened them in the spring—the prisoner was my clerk and manager there—I was in the habit of being very much out of town—the prisoner had the goods to receive—he had to sell, and to receive certain accounts, according to the instructions given him—there was a lad at Lillypot-lane, named Brierly—the prisoner kept the books, and received orders for goods, and he was to write to me if they were not in stock; but if goods were sold in London, it was his duty to enter them all—Brierly was a lad; I sent him out of the country—he was about 16 or 17 years old—the books were in the prisoner's charge—on the receipt of money, it was the prisoner's duty to take it to the bank the same evening, and send word down to me—he had a cash-book, and it was his duty to make an entry of the money received in the cash-book—I had a customer named Knight—I believe I was in London on 14th June—the prisoner suddenly disappeared about 14th or 15th June—I believe it was on the evening of the 15th, and I did not see him again till I saw him at Guildhall—I believe he was not taken till the latter end, or the middle of July—in this cash-book I believe there are entries in the prisoners writing, under the date of 4th June—here is no entry of the receipt of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Sibley on or about 4th June—the prisoner has never accounted to me for the receipt of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Sibley on that day—here is no entry in the day-book of goods sold to Mr. Knight on 7th June, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the cash-book here is no entry on 7th June of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, or any entry subsequent to it—the pri<lb></lb>soner has never accounted to me for the payment of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd from Mr. Knight about that time—after the prisoner left I did not see him again till he was in custody—on the receipt of money it was the prisoner's duty to deposit it in the bank, if he received it before the bank closed, the same evening—it was not his duty to keep money and pay it in a lump—his duty was to pay it in whenever it amounted to 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the receipt of any money it was his duty to advise me of it's receipt the same evening, and to advise me of the sale of goods the next day—he did not advise me of the sale of goods to Mr. Knight, and the receipt of the money, or the receipt of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Sibley—after 14th June the prisoner wrote to me from Gravesend.</p>

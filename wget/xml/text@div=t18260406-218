The prisoner was in my employ, and entrusted to receive money for me - he never paid me 3l. 12s. 6d., which he received of Martha Spencer. I sent him to receive some money of her on the 21st of February - he returned; I was up stairs, as I had a child died that morning; he went away to Wapping, and I did not see him till the next day, when I went and asked him about it; he was going to Scotland; he had been with me seven months - I know nothing amiss of him.</p>

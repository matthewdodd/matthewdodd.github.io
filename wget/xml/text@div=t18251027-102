I purchased of him, on Saturday, the 15th of October, a shirt, a waistcoat, a black stock, a pair of gloves, and a silk handkerchief. I got the waistcoat on Sunday, and the others on Monday morning. I went to Hanley to get work, but could not - I returned and missed my articles - I pursued the prisoner to Highgate, and got an officer to take him - they were found on him - he said he would give me them to let him go, but the officer would not let me do so.</p>

            . I am the officer. The prosecutor came to me on Monday, the 17th of October - I went with him to South Mimms - in the afternoon we found the prisoner on the Birmingham coach - he began to cry, and said "Jack, take your things, but don't hurt me."</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He did not buy the things of me. I came from Liverpool with him to get work, but could not. I asked him to assist me to return to my friends, and I would give him some of my things. He said he did not want my things, but gave me 12 s. on the Saturday night, and said he wished he could do more for me. I got up on the Monday morning, and went away.</p>
               <p>JOHN FOX re-examined. Q. What did you say to him when he asked you to take them of him? A. He said he would sell them for 12 s., and we agreed about them; both our clothes were kept in one chest of drawers, but not in the same drawer.</p>

            . On the 13th of July I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock, and secured the back and front doors; I did not look at the windows; I was the last up. About three o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by my fellow-servant, she was up before me. I went down below, and found the shoe-room window, which looks into the backyard, open-it was day-light; I missed the articles stated in the indictment out of the laundry, which communicates with the shoe-room. I had seen them safe the night before.</p>

             re-examined. The house appeared to have been entered by putting the sash of the shoe-room window down; I observed it at three o'clock in the morning. I do not know whether it was fastened the overnight or not; there were no marks of violence on it. There is a private bolt, which goes across the laundry-door-it goes by the kitchen-door, through the wall, into the laundry-door; it is impossible for any one to enter the laundry without getting the bolt out. I found the crossbolt on the ground in the kitchen-the kitchen and laundry-doors were open, and one of the back-doors, which goes out of the laundry. We were not alarmed till the servants came down in the morning to wash. Mr. Fry is one of my assistants. All the things were taken out of the laundry. The property was worth four or five pounds at the lowest.</p>

On the 13th of July, between four and five o'clock in morning, I was coming-from Kentish-town to Covent-garden-market, and met Mr. Smith's son, he told me if I met the prisoner (he described Macdonald Smith), to apprehend him; about half-past seven o'clock, as I returned from Covent-garden, I met the prisoners, Gutteridge and Smith, at the end of Pancras-street, Tottenham-court-road, each of them had a bundle - I stopped my cart, got down, and asked Smith what he had got in the bundle? he said he had his clothes. I told him they were stolen, and he was my prisoner, and I must apprehend him. He attempted to run away; I overtook. and secured him with the bundle. Gutteridge ran away with his bundle. As I was taking him to the watch-house, I met Squib. We took him to a public-house, and took two silver table-spoons, one tea-spoon, a knife, a rummer, and the hat-lining from his pocket.</p>

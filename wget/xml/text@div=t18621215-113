                  </hi>. I am a baker of 6, Park-terrace, Hammersmith—on 20th November, about 7 o'clock in the evening, Williams came and asked for a twopenny loaf and change for a two-shilling piece—he gave me a florin and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—he walked quickly out of the shop, and I then discovered that it was bad—I kept it in my hand, looked in the till, and found another—I saw him join Donovan, who was about thirty yards off, on the other side—they walked together straight down the road towards town, and I followed them and gave them in custody to a constable, who brought them back to my shop fifteen minutes after Williams had bought the loaf—another small loaf was found on Donovan, which I had told to another party about seven minutes before Williams came: that had been paid for with a bad florin, which was in the till—Donovan also had a penny loaf him which did not come from my shop—I marked the florins and gave them both to the constable—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was a little cottage loaf which I sold to Williams—it was black, and I had cut a little bit off underneath, by which I know it—I had sold a good many of the same kind that day, to all kinds of people, but when Williams came in, I had only that one left—Donovan was not in the shop—it was a little brick loaf that was found on him—the prisoners walked quickly, and talked as they went on.</p>

Mr. Ritter spoke to me on the the Hammersmith-road, and I followed the prisoners for a quarter of a mile to the night house public-house—they then saw me coming, and walked away as quick as they could—I overtook them in the Broadway, and asked Williams whether he had got a twopenny loaf—he said, "Yes"—I asked him where he got it—from a baker's shop down town—I took them back, and when we got twenty yards further on, Donovan dropped this loaf on the pavement, and it rolled into the road—I asked a boy to pick it up and carry it, and sent to the station for assistance—while I was in the shop Donovan passed a penny from under his coat, on to a little green plate on the counter, with a red book on it—he laid the money on the book—I made inquiries, but could not find out anything about it—Mr. Ritter said that the</p>

On the 1st of July, about five o'clock in the afternoon, my master called to me; I went into the parlour, and found the window up - I missed four silver salt cellars off the side-board, also two gravy spoons, four salt spoons, three table spoons, and three dessert spoons - we had used them about two hours before.

            . I was working on Newington-green, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Thomas's house. I saw the prisoner and another running across the field by his house; two men pursued them, crying Stop thief! I joined in pursuit with Wilson - Marsh got through a hedge into a nursery ground, I lost sight of him then; I am sure he is the man - I then followed Kerns, and found him in a brick field, laying down concealed among some corn, which grew at one end of the field, and about twelve yards from him, I found two silver salt and one silver dessert spoons, which I delivered to Wilson. I saw a brick-maker find another salt, and a gentleman's servant found another spoon. I saw them pick them up, and give them to Wilson. They were twelve or fifteen yards from Kerns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner KERNS. Q. How far was I from the hedge when you first saw me - A. Four or five yards.</p>

            . I am a constable. Mr. Thomas's house is in the parish of St. Mary, Islington. I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the three men running, the prisoners and another, they came over a gate about nine feet high; I pursued them both, and had to jump over a ditch. Kerns ran into a field, and Marsh into a nursery ground; in about ten minutes I saw Kerns laying among the oats in the field, and took him. I saw the plate picked up twelve yards from him. While I was pursuing Kerns, I saw him throw a handkerchief into the ditch; I stopped to take it up, or I should have had him then - I produce it. I found Marsh afterwards at Mr. Thomas's house - I found nothing on him. Kerns denied that the handkerchief was his. I am sure of both of them; I was close to all three, and saw their faces. I think the salts worth 20 s. each, the dessert spoons 5 s. each, and the table spoons 30 s. - they are not found. The tea spoons are worth 5 s. each.</p>

               <p>MARSH'S Defence. I went to seek for work in the country, and about two o'clock, finding myself tired and dirty, I went to the river to wash; I afterwards heard the cry, and ran across the field, as any one else would; I got over into the garden and went to sleep.</p>

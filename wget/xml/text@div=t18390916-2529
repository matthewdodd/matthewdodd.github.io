                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. John Rutty, a timber<lb></lb>merchant at Paddington—the prisoner was employed in one of the barges. On the 8th of September, he was in a barge on the Canal by the wharf—it had come from Cowley, and was to start the next morning—I sat up that night to watch, and about twelve o'clock at night I saw the prisoner coming from Mr. Rutty's stable—there is a hayloft over that stable-*—there is a small trap-door from the loft to the stable, and there is another door from the loft to the area—he had a truss of hay on his back—I called a policeman, and we asked what he had got there—he said, "Forgive me, it is the first time I ever took any"—he asked me to let him put on his shoes and his smock-frock, which were behind some timber—I found the loft-door open, and two trusses of hay down where they had no business to be—it is the practice for the captains of the barges to come to me for hay about five' o'clock in the morning—they have no right to take hay from the loft—Mr. Freeman is captain of the barge on board which the prisoner is—he hires him, but we pay him—the captain was not on the barge, he was at home—I went on board the barge, and found two more trusses of the same sort of hay there.</p>

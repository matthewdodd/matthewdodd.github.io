             came into Mr. Lee's shop with another woman and asked to look at some silver shoe-buckles. I took out a drawer of shoe-buckles and showed them; they said there were none of those that would do. I took out another drawer and showed them. While they were looking at the second drawer, Potten and Spencer came into the shop and enquired for some gold wires for ear-rings; I desired them to wait till the other women were served; they said they were in a hurry.

             went beside them, and said as they were in a hurry, they would wait while I showed them the gold wires. I saw one of the two drawers I had left in the glass-case moved, and some buckles gone, and I missed the buckles. Smith and the other woman who came in first said, there were none that would do, and they went out of the shop. I went after them and took hold of Smith by the cloak, and desired them to come back. Spencer and Potten were in the shop; I desired them to stop likewise. As soon as Smith came into the shop one silver buckle dropped down between her and the other two prisoners, on the floor, and one catched by the chase in the apron of Spencer. Smith was close to Spencer when she came in. I missed three buckles; the other was not found.</p>
               <p>The other woman did not come back? - No; I did not suspect her.</p>
               <p>(The buckles were produced in court and deposed to by the witness.)</p>
               <p>Taylor. I charged the prisoner Smith with taking the buckles. She said she knew nothing at all of them, and expressed her surprise at my charging her with any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Did you charge the others? - No, I desired them, as they were in the shop, to stop.</p>
               <p>Did Smith and the woman who came in with her seem to have any acquaintance with the women who came in afterwards? - Not in the least that I know of.</p>
               <p>Did Spencer and Potten submit to be searched? - Not till they came before the justice. There was nothing of Mr. Lee's property found upon them.</p>
               <p>Was Smith searched? - Yes. There was nothing of Mr. Lee's found upon her.</p>
               <p>From Smith. Did not I desire you to search me when I was first brought back into the shop.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Yes, I believe she did.</p>
               <p>Might not the buckles drop out of the drawer without any body taking them out? - It was impossible; the drawer was shut close in, and the top of the glass-case down.</p>
               <p>One of the buckles was quite lost? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And one of the women went out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Smith. The woman I went in with had nursed me two years ago; I met her, and she asked me to go with her to buy a pair<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230065"></xptr>of silver buckles. We went in and looked at the buckles; he asked twenty shillings for them; she said they were for another woman and she would tell her.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. Taylor and another person brought the three prisoners to my house. In the way to the justice's, and before the justice, Taylor accused them, as he has done now. I searched Smith; she had no money. I asked her how she was to buy silver buckles without any money? She said she did not go in to buy, only to ask the price. Potten and Spencer had only a shilling between them. I asked them how they were to buy gold ear-rings, when they had no money; they made the same answer, that they did not go in to buy, only to ask the price.</p>

               <p>To Taylor. Are you sure the buckles were in the drawer when the prisoners came into the shop? - I have no doubt of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I and my father are solicitors, and reside in Billeter-street; we are secretaries to the School for the Indigent Blind, which is incorporated; as the President, Vice-president, and Members of the School for the Indigent Blind—I have the Act of Parliament. On the 14th of December the prisoner came to our office, and presented a letter in a sealed envelope—neither me nor my father were within when he came, but immediately I came in he presented the letter, which I now produce—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Langley Priory, Maidstone, 13th Decem<lb></lb>ber, 1841. Sir,—Having lately been favoured with a report relating to the School for the Indigent Blind, and anxious to render aid to that afflicted and truly deserving class of our fellow-creatures, it is therefore my intention, and Lady Filmer's wish, to subscribe two guineas per an<lb></lb>num. Having occasion to send my steward to London, I have directed him to wait on you respecting the subject in question, and he will pay you the amount alluded to, and receive your receipt. Yours, &amp;c. <hi rend="smallCaps">M. W. FILMER</hi>."—I opened it myself, and this order on Messrs. Drummond for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed "M. W. Filmer," was in it—I observed to the prisoner that the cheque was for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said, "Does Sir M. Filmer intend to subscribe 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for each, or is it two guineas?"—he stated that they were two two-guinea subscriptions, that he had something to purchase, and was to take 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change—I di<lb></lb>rected my clerk to make out two receipts—while they were making out I had some conversation with the prisoner, and remarked that the signature was "M. W. Filmer," that I knew something of Sir Edmund Filmer being member for West Kent, and was he dead?—he said the present baronet was Sir Matthew, that the late one was Sir Edmund, but he was dead—the clerk then brought the two receipts; and just about that time I asked the prisoner if he was Sir M. Filmer's steward—he said "Yes"—I then went to my tin box, gave him half-a-sovereign and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. change, and the receipts for two guineas each, and he left the office—we have an account at the Bank of England, and finding the cheque was payable to Charles Dodd, and not or bearer, I waited till my father returned to the office—his name is Charles Dodd—he endorsed it in my presence—I paid it into the Bank myself, with other cheques to the account of Dodd and Son—it was after<lb></lb>wards returned from the Bank.</p>

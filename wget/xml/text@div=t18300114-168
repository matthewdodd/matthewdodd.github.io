               <p>THOMAS HERDSFIELD. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner last Tuesday, in St. Mary-axe, and told him the charge - he said he was very sorry, that he was in great distress, and that I should find the looking-glass at Bassett's, in Queen-street, Long-acre; I found it there -I asked what he had done with the books; he said he cut the covers off and burnt them, cut the books in two, and sold them to two cheesemonger's in St. Giles'.</p>
               <p>JAMES BASSETT. I am a pawnbroker, of Great Queen-street. On the 28th of September this looking-glass was pawned with me for 20s - I am not certain of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>(Glass produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>HENRY BARRETT. I am a cheesemonger, of High-street, St. Giles'. I bought of the prisoner three or four times printed books, as waste-paper - there was about 5lbs. each time: I gave him 4d. a pound; I used it in my shop, and did not read it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I merely did it out of necessity; I was to have 2s. a week to stay at the chambers every day from half-past ten o'clock till two, to receive letters and forward them - I had no other employ, and was much distressed; I went and asked Mr. Thomas, a friend of the prosecutor's, to advance me 5s. of my wages - he wrote to master to know if he might; master wrote that I was not to have a farthing, and I made away with a few things.</p>

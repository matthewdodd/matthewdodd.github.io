               <p>Prosecutor. In consequence of this information, I had the prisoner apprehended; I suspected Boulton, and got a warrant to search his lodging; I saw his wife, she fetched him, and I found the property on Boulton.</p>

               <p>I went down to Westminster, with six bundles of small hand paper; I put it on the bench, the corner of the public-house, in Downing-street, where Mr. Pitt lives; I went into the house, to go backwards, and a gentleman said he would take care of the load; when I came back, the load was gone; I came back to Parliament-street, and King-street, and Charles-street to look for it; and could see nothing of it; the next morning, as I had the bill, and the stampt receipt, I went to one Mr. Cartwright's, and borrowed three bundles; then I went to Mr. Greenland's in the Little Sanctuary, he lent me three more, I was to make them good; I carried them at twice, to Mr. Wilkinson's, the linen-draper, I brought home the money next morning; our shopman asked me where I had been all night, and I gave him the money; I did not know what to do about this paper; Mr. Cartwright said he would trust me, and I told him of the loss, and when I came back again home, the next morning, I did take these two bundles of paper, and gave to Mr. Boulton; I was going to take them down to this Mr. Cartwright; I went with three the next morning, which the shopman sent me down with to Mr. Greenland's the Little Sanctuary, I brought back the money safe, I never defrauded my master before.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is there any mark on the paper? - There is the King's mark.</p>
               <p>Court. That is on all paper? - The same number is not on any other papers but these, because the same officer does not survey any other bill but mine, I can swear positively not only to that, but the hand writing upon it.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know any thing of this story? - I am apprehensive that he lost some paper, and I really believe the reason of his taking away this paper was to supply that loss.</p>

Lewis &amp; Lewis, on the same date—(<hi rend="italic">This was a notice to produce all documents found on the de<lb></lb>fendant when apprehended, particularly an agreement between the defendant, Louada and Simpson, with reference to rifles, and a cheque for</hi> 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">of David Forrest</hi>).</p>

On Sunday morning, 17th March, about six o'clock, I stopped the prisoner on the north quay of the London Docks; he had a Bible under his arm, and was dressed in two suits of clothes—I asked him whether the book was his—he said it was—I asked him whether the clothes were his, and he said, "Do you think I stole them?"—I said it was very suspicious, and I should take him into custody—he said, "If you go on board the <hi rend="italic">Rainbow,</hi> you will find I bought them"—I went there, and found the cabin had been broken open.</p>

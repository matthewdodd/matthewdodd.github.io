On Wednesday, 10th June, I was standing in Lower Thames-street, about 9 o'clock in the morning—Thorne came up to me and asked if I wanted a job; I said, "Yes," and went with him a little way—we came up to an empty truck; he told me to take it and go to the bottom of Harp-lane—he then brought me a paper (which I delivered to Boddy), and directed me where to go—he said that I was to take the goods, which I was to have in a few minutes, to Mr. Peacock, and told me to go to the bottom of Harp-lane and wait there, and perhaps I might be beckoned by a man—I walked up Harp-lane, and saw Boddy standing at a door; he asked me for the paper, and said, "Come in here;" into Mr. Jones's warehouse—he pointed out a cask and said, "That is one"—I rolled it to the bottom of Harp-lane to the truck, and went back for some more—Boddy helped me—I did not meet Thorne again, but I took the cask at his direction to Mr. Peacock, in Vine-street, and returned the truck to the place where I found it, having gone back and fetched the second cask—I then went back to be paid for my labour, but could not find the prisoners.</p>

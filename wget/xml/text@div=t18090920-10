            . I work for Mr. Dodd, I saw the prisoner come in the shop, she asked to stand up out of the wet, I saw the boots hanging up when she came in, she staid about four or five minutes, when she went away the boots were gone, my master pursued her one way and I the other. I found the property upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might she be off. - A. About two hundred yards, she had got them wrapped up in a pair of pantaloons in her apron. As I was going out of the door I saw her drop some potatoes out of her apron, and one of the boots. I picked the boot up, I saw that she had got the other wrapped up in a pair of pantaloons; I took her to the shop and sent for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these boots inside of the shop - A. Yes; I am sure they were inside, within the door.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It rained; I happened to go into a public house and called for a pint of beer, a woman came in and brought a bundle with some potatoas, four lemons, and a small mutton kidney; she said she was not able to wait; she asked me to stop till she came in again; I thought her long, I went out in the street; I happened to slip the potatoes, and one boot dropped from me, somebody came up to me, they said the boots belonged to them. They took me to the house; I do not know where it was.</p>

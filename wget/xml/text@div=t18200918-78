I did not miss this property, but in consequence of information which I received I went to Harrison's, the pawnbroker, in Tottenham-court-road, and found the property stated in the indictment, all of which I knew to be mine. The piece of cambric was worth 4 l. I had seen them safe in June. I gave the prisoner in charge, and told him it was for felony - he said nothing, but next morning I received a letter from him, which I knew to be his writing - I had said nothing to induce him to confess. He left my service the latter end of June. At the time of the robbery 6 l. or 7 l. was due to him for wages.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He was going to be married - A. He had left me six weeks with an intent to commence business; he was twelve months with me. The fourteen yards of cambric were in two pieces, one of which cost me 84 s.; it was of a particularly fine quality. It was never sold.</p>
               <p>(A letter from the prisoner was then read, confessing his guilt, and expressing sincere contrition.)</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in Shoreditch. About two months ago the prisoner came to my house, and said he had left Mr. Craig about a month; that he had been to a sale of unredeemed pledged, and bought a lot of goods very cheap. Next morning he called with them, and I bought them of him. A day or two after he called, and said he had bought some duplicates, I said I would have nothing to do with them, and that evening I sent for Mr. Craig to the Feathers, in Hand-court, and shewed him some cambric. We went to Harrison's, the pawnbroker.</p>

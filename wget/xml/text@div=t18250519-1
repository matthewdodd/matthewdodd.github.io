            . I am a Bow-street patrol. On the night of the 9th of May, between twelve and one o'clock, I was on duty, and met the prisoner in Green-lane, near Winchmore-hill, in the parish of Edmonton - he was leading a black gelding; I asked where he brought it from; he said from Potter's-bar, and was taking it to Mr. Kimpton's, at Highgate. I took him in charge - he said his name was Sedgell, but afterwards that it was Benyon, and said his master, Mr. Westley, of Potter's-bar, had bought the horse for eighteen guineas, of Kimpton, at Smithfield-market, and he was taking it back because his master should not pay the deposit money; I went to Potter's-bar, and could find no Mr. Westley - on my return my brother officer directed me to English.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the morning of the 10th of May, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was on the road near Southgate, about a mile from Winchmore-hill, and met the prisoner with this gelding; I asked where he brought it from; he said from his master, Mr. Westley, at Potter's-bar, and was taking it to Mr. Kimpton's, at Highgate - that his master had brought it home the night before, and tried it in harness, that it kicked, and he was going to take it back, to save the deposit money. English claimed it that morning, in his presence. I told him he was very wrong in sending me to Potter's-bar when there was no such person there; he said voluntarily, "If I had known you were going there I would not have sent you, I would have told you all about it - I took the horse from Mr. English;" English lives about a mile and a half from where we met him. I left the horse in the stable while we went to Potter's-bar; Fitch had the key. I afterwards took the prisoner with the horse towards English's house, and met him on the road - he claimed it in the prisoner's presence. It is particularly marked.</p>

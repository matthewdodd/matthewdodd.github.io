               <p>"I saw you very busy with that young man's pockets." The constable happened to come in, and I gave charge of her. I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150034"></xptr>received this money on the Saturday night. I went to bed about eleven o'clock. I was quite sober.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went into the house, and saw the prisoner pulling the man about; there were other women of a low description there. I was speaking to the landlord when the prisoner came and asked him to take of 8 s. 6 d., and some copper, which she laid on the counter. Quinlan immediately charged her with the robbery; she said she had been out all night, and got the money from different people.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been in another wine-vaults - when I got there the prosecutor was fighting with two men; I was then going out, but the landlord said,</p>
               <p>"Stop till the piece of work is over;" the prosecutor then said he would give me 2 s. to go with him - he gave me four sixpences instead of two shillings - he then said if I would go with him and stay all day he would give me more, and asked me if I would have some gin. I was quite in liquor, and so was he; he gave me some more, but I was so intoxicated I do not know how much he gave me.</p>

                  </hi> I am a hosier. I carry on business, and occupy a house in the parish of St. Mildred the Virgin, in the Poultry. On Friday afternoon, the 2nd of July, between four and five o'clock, the prisoner came into my shop with another man, and a woman—the other man who acted as an interpreter, asked to look at some goods—he desired to have some red and white silk handkerchiefs—I showed him some—the prisoner looked at them, and they talked together—they pointed at another pile of handker<lb></lb>chiefs—I produced them, they looked at them, and each man pulled a piece of handkerchief out of the fold, and spread it all over the counter over the other goods as if to look at it—the other man then said he would take five handkerchiefs; which I cut off, and did up in paper—they were cut from dif<lb></lb>ferent pieces—the prisoner then offered me a foreign coin, I said I could not change it—the party who was acting as interpreter said they would call again—the prisoner took back the coin, and they went away—they did not take the handkerchiefs—in about ten minutes I missed some handkerchiefs—I then heard that one of the party had been taken—I went to the station, and saw the prisoner there, and some handkerchiefs, but none of them were mine—I could not tell how many I missed, because we have a very large stock, but I thought I missed some—I heard nothing more of my hand<lb></lb>kerchiefs till the Saturday week following, when they were brought to my shop by a policeman, who stated that they were found in Coleman-street—there were forty-seven—my young man examined them, and saw</p>

               <p>they were all mine—they had my mark on them—these are them—I can identify every one of them—I examined my stock between that Fri<lb></lb>day, the 2nd of July, and the Saturday week following, and ascertained that I had missed some, but I could not tell the number that were gone, or exactly of what sort, we have so many sorts—these are all my handkerchiefs, they have the tickets on them with the mark in my own writing—this is one of the pieces that I showed to the prisoner and the other man—this is one piece from which I cut a handkerchief off for them—there were four handkerchiefs on this piece, I cut off one handkerchief for them, and here are now three remaining—my impression is, that these others are the same that I showed to the party, they all bear my shop-mark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Walbrook-row, East-row, Shoreditch. On Thursday night, the 4th of June, I went to bed about ten o'clock, leaving my lodgers up, but nobody else—they are a man and his wife—I secured all the doors and windows at usual—I locked my door, bolted my window, and fastened it inside—I locked and bolted the Kitchen door and put a chain across it—there was a clothes-horse in the kitchen, which I lefl full of things, which I had ironed the day before—I got up at seven o'clock in the morning—I found the kitchen door unlocked and unbolted—the chain still remained across it—I found the window-shutters thrown open, and the window thrown up to the top—this was on the ground floor—that window and shutters had both been fastened the night before—I missed a'dress, three pincloths, and three books—I had left the dress hanging on the horse with the pincloths—the bag hung by the fire-place on a nail, with the books in it, the night before—I found every thing taken off the horse and scattered about the place—I had left a piece of soap under the table, and it was moved, and put outside the door—I had not heard any thing in the night—the house facet the road—I called Mrs. Galton, my lodger down, and showed her the state the room was in—I unchained the door and called a policeman in—he took possession of the things which were scattered about.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable N</hi> 129.) On the morning of the 5th of June, I was on duty in Kingsland-road about a quarter after four o'clock, and saw the prisoner some distance from me, across a hay<lb></lb>field—it was quite light—I do not know Walbrook-row—he was about a mile and a half, or a mile, from Shoreditch church—I was about two bundred yards from him, when I first saw him—he was crossing the hay-flelds with a bag in his hand, looking very cautiously around, as if he wished to avoid being noticed—I saw him throw the bag behind a haycock; and after looking round again, he laid himself down behind the haycock—I got over the fence, and went up to where he was lying—I asked him what he was doing there—he said he was waiting for a boy who he was to assist in mak<lb></lb>ing some hay—I asked him where he got that bag from, and what it cos<lb></lb>tained—he said he had just found it at the foot of a tree, in the adjoining field—I asked him his name—he said it was Light; and knowing from his name that he was a reputed thief, I took him to the station-house.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined, Q</hi>, When he gave the name of Light, did you know to whom he belonged? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not—I found his father—he lived at a small house in Harford-road—when he gave the name of Light, I con<lb></lb>cluded he was his son—he was about a hundred and fifty yards from his father's—I took him to the station-house, and then to Worship-street—he had an examination there, and was remanded until the following Wednes<lb></lb>day—on the first day he was at Worship-street, his mother was there, after he was put back—I did not misreprent to her the time he was to be brought up for re-examination—I do not recollect that she asked me the question—she wanted an interview with her son, and saw him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On Friday, the 5th of June, about seven o'clock, I was called in by Mrs. Evans—I went to the house. and saw the window-shutters wide open, the windows thrown up, and the blinds thrown back—before I entered the door, I saw this cloth, and some bread and cheese in it, up in a corner by the kitchen door—I saw the things all scattered about the kitchen—I examined the front part of the house</p>

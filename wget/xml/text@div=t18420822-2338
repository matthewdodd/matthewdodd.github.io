                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a news shop in Dean-street. On the 2nd of August, the prisoner came to my shop, and brought three books called "Selwyn in Search of a Daughter"—he offered them for sale for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I would give him four—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of it at that time—he came again on the 4th, and brought three more, for the same price—I was not present at the time—he left them with my little child—on my return I found them at my house—they were "Uncle Horace"—I saw him the same night—he said he had had some clothes from the tailor, and wanted to pay for them, and that was the reason be sold his books—that his sister was in service, and had twelve months' wages due to her, and had to take it out in books—he came again on Friday the 5th, with three more books, and pressed me very hard for the money—I said I could not pay him then, but would on Monday night—he pressed me for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I was to give for the books altogether—he had 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from me then—on Sun<lb></lb>day the 7th, about twelve o'clock, he came and asked me to lend him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave it him—my suspicions were excited, and if it had not been Sun<lb></lb>day evening I should have endeavoured to find out the owner—on Monday the 8th, about five o'clock, he came and asked me to pay him the money, as he was going after a situation a little way out of town—I said I could not till eight o'clock—in the mean time I searched out who the books belonged to—a policeman was sent for, and Mr. Churton came and identified the books—I gave them to the policeman—the prisoner was at the back of the shop, when the name of Mr. Churton was men<lb></lb>tioned, but he did not speak to me, nor I to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am barmaid to Mr. Back, in Milk-street. On 9th Nov., between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the bar for half a pint of porter—it came to a penny—he paid me in coppers—he then asked me to give him two shillings for four sixpences, which I did—I can swear that the two shillings I gave him were good—he said one of the shillings I gave him was not good—he returned me two shillings, and I gave him the sixpences back—I looked at the two shillings he gave me, and one was bad—I am ready to swear that that was not one which I had given him—he very much abused me, and told me the reason why he wanted the sixpences changed was because he had a small hole in his pocket—I kept the shilling till the constable came, and gave it him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Freshwater, a grocer. On 9th Nov. the prisoner came, about 8 o'clock in the evening, for two ounces of tea and half a pound of sugar—they came to 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a shilling, which I put in the till—I noticed that at that time there was only a half crown in the till—I gave the prisoner 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and he walked out—the officer came in immediately, and from what he said I examined the till, and the only shilling I found in it was bad—I marked it, and put it on the desk in the shop—I afterwards took it to Bow-lane station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many tills have you in your shop? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two; one is about half way down the shop, and the other near the end—I do not know what money was in the other till—it was not after the officer came in that I noticed there was only a half crown in the till; I noticed it when I took the shilling—a young man who had been at that till had just given change, and there was no other money in that till but the half crown.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>). I was on duty, and saw the prisoner in a court in the Old Jewry, about two hundred yards from Milk-street—he came out of the court, and went to Mr. Fresh water's shop—he went to the front window in a position where he could see behind the counter—I then saw him take something out of his waistcoat pocket in a small piece of rag, or paper, which I found afterwards to be a rag—he went into the shop with what he took in his hand—I saw that he pur<lb></lb>chased some trifling thing with what he bad in his hand—he came out, and I immediately went in, and from what passed in the shop I went after the prisoner—I stopped him in Corn hill, and told him I should take him into custody for passing a bad shilling at a grocer's shop in the Poultry—he said, "have certainly been in a grocer's shop, but I am not aware I passed a bad shilling"—I found on him this bag, with some tea and sugar in it, and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in good money and this small piece of rag—I went to Mr. Back's, and got this other shilling there.</p>

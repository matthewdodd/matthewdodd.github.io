I am a widow, and live at Chase-green, Enfield—I am in the habit of employing Thomas Young, a carrier, to convey goods for me—on several occasions I have delivered goods to the prisoner, to be carried by Mr. Young's cart—on the 9th or 10th of February, the prisoner applied to me for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for his master—there were two bills, which amounted to 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which was a mistake of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I pointed out the mistake to the prisoner, gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave him the bills for his master to correct—he said his master should come and rectify it.</p>

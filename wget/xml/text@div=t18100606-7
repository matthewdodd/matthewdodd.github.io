            . I am headborough. I apprehended the prisoner at the top of Hoxton, about three quarters of a mile from Mrs. Bartley's, about five o'clock in the morning, he had a sack under his arm; I asked him what he had got there, and felt outside; he said it was lead, he had found it as he come from the Whitmore's Head. I took him into custody. The lead appeared to be fresh cut, it was quite bright.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 1st of May I was ordered by the magistrate to find out who had lost any lead; I made enquiry at Kingsland, I found this lady's house had been stripped of lead; I matched it; here is a nail-hole in the lead, and the nail was left on the premises; it fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About five o'clock in the morning as I was going through Hoxton town, I picked this lead up in the street; I turned back to take it home, I met the watchman, he put me into the watchhouse.</p>

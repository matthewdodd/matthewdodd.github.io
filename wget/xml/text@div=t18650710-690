                  </hi>. I am the master of the <hi rend="italic">Arabista</hi>—on 16th May we were on the high seas, homeward bound—she is an English ship—while we were at tea, three men rushed into the cabin and said something to me—the mate went up stairs, and I went into my state cabin to seek for pistols, but it being dark I could find them—I went into the cabin, and the men came and said, "You will have to shoot this man, captain"—I went into the state-room again, found the pistols, and laid them on the table, but went on deck without them, requesting the people to follow me, to put the man in irons—I went towards the prisoner, who placed himself in a position to receive me with a violent blow on the head—he had this iron belaying pin in one hand and this knife in the other—he struck me on the forehead with the belay<lb></lb>ing pin and the same blow struck my shoulder—I fell on the deck insensible, and must have lain so still as to receive three blows on the crown of my head, from which the blood flowed—I also found a scar on my cheek—my jaw was very much swollen for many days, and I had a tooth broken—I was prevented from attending to my work for two days, and was obliged to keep in bed—we were sixty or seventy miles from the Cape Verde Islands—there was no surgeon on board—the mate attended to my wounds—Samuel Lock was wounded much worse than me.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner come on board at Bathurst, in West Africa? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the chief mate had the direction of the prisoner's duties—I was aware of his being changed from the starboard to the port watch—I gave directions to the boatswain two days before to change one man, but I did not say who—the prisoner had behaved most respectfully up to that time—he understood English, and spoke it fluently—he is a native of Basso, fifty miles from Bathurst, and has worked for the owner, Thomas Francis Quinn, Esq., for many years, who is a colonial merchant—the ship is Regis<lb></lb>tered at Bathurst—I have not got the register—the prisoner has not the the same intelligence as the English members of my crew—he did not complain to me about being changed from the watch, but he came aft the evening before and said that everybody must die in the ship, but that God was not going to kill anybody—he had made no complaint to me before that of any grievance—those words were the only thing like a complaint—I have not threatened to throw him overboard, nor has the mate in my hearing, or anyone else—I have had no words with him about his work—his two hours at the wheel were up at six o'clock, and he left it.</p>

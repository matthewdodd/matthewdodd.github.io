At about one o'clock, in the middle of the day, on the 5th of October, the prisoner came into my shop, and requested a pennyworth of white cotton balls. When he first came in, I was in the parlour, adjoining the shop; I went out into the shop to him; he seemed very much confused. I suspected all was not right. I told him we had no balls of cotton. I did not see him do any thing that created any suspicion, nothing but his being confused. During the that he was in the shop, a piece of stuff fell; I don't what occasioned it to fall; the prisoner was at least two yards from it and appeared very much frightened. I thought as he went out, I saw him take something from the door, but I was mistaken, and missed nothing thence. As soon as he had been gone about two or three minutes, I missed a piece of silk handkerchiefs; I asked Mrs. Walker if she had sold this piece of handkerchiefs, and she told me not. I immediately went to the corner of East-street, and saw the prisoner running: he then looked back, and I cried stop thief; he then turned along Blandford-street, into Manchester-street, and through a court, into a mews. the persons who were in the pursuit, as well as myself, made a motion for me to go along South-street, into which the end of the mews runs. I got to the end of the mews, and the prisoner ran into the side door of a pawnbroker's shop; I ran in at the front door, and so secured him. I searched him, but did not find any thing on him. I thought perhaps he might have thrown them away. I took him down the mews, in order to find the property, if he had; a few doors from the pawnbroker's side door, the handkerchiefs were picked up; a coachman picked them up, in my presence, and gave them to me immediately; the constable was present at the time they were picked up; they were delivered to him, as well as the prisoner; the constable's name is Hunter.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was sitting in my parlour on the day of the robbery, and saw the prisoner run by, with the prosecutor after him. I saw the prisoner taken just by the pawnbroker's. I also saw the handkerchiefs picked up; they were delivered into my charge, with the prisoner. Here they are.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. They are my property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to my master's house, and he told me to call upon him at two o'clock for some work. I met a person I knew, he told me to go to Mr. Smith's; I went into the prosecutor's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181510250015"></xptr>shop to purchase some cotton balls; he had none; while I was there, a piece of stuff fell down, and that made me jump. I was going along, and heard a cry of stop thief; I knew it could not be after me; I went into this mews, and made water; seeing the crowd come rushing along, I just put my foot on the threshold of the pawnbroker's side door, to button up my small clothes; whilst I was there, they took me for the handkerchiefs, and I declare I know no more about them than the child unborn.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called several witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

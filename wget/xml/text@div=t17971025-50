               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I am told that two of these men are licensed horse-slaughterers as well as yourself? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that they are? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you never applied to take away their licence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never applied, before this charge was brought against them, to take away their licence, or desired other persons to apply for that purpose? - A. I have heard talk of such a thing, but I have had no hand in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon you oath, have you never been the means of any application to take away their licence? - A.Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have you indirectly done so? - A. No; any further than Mr. Spencer said it was a nuisance, and he asked me about it, but I did not advise him any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you never desire any body to interfere about the licence? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were before the Magistrate, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179710250033"></xptr>made this complaint, did you not desire the licence to be taken away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nothing was said about it? - A. The Magistrate said, there was no stopping of their licence.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it said any thing about it? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not present? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were you not present? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think about it? - A. It is so long ago I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Come, answer like an honest man, do you believe you were present? - A. I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you believe it? - A. I cannot say; if it was the last day I had to live I could not tell.</p>
               <p>Q. These men, I believe, have got a great deal of business lately? - A. That has not affected me any.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have they not been increasing in business? - A. It is a business I do but little of.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you may as well give us a plain answer to a plain question? - A. I have not troubled my head about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not their business been increasing? - A. They had a great deal of business the very first week they did begin.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that it has increased? - A. Why, I did not look after their business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know they have? - A. They might have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know they have? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took these men up on the 6th of June, did you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Not the day you found it out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take them up; was it not a month after? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, was it not in July? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, was it not in July? - A. I could not say if it was the last day I had to live, I believe it was three weeks, or a month, before they were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in July; just a little before the July Sessions? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. The Magistrate, I believe, admitted them to bail? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And you walked home pretty nearly together, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were bound over to prosecute at the next Sessions? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you prosecute at the July Sessions? - A. The trial did not come on, we attended.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you prefer any bill of indictment in the July Sessions? - A. I do not know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, were you not bound over to prosecute at the July Sessions? - A. We did it as soon as it could be done.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you preferred a bill of indictment as soon as possible? - A.According to the rule of the Court at the Sessions-house.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you prefer your bill of indictment? - A. I never understood that we were to take a particular account of that time, only the time that we were robbed, and therefore I did not take an account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, do you not know that you did not prefer a bill against him in the July Sessions? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you never took them up a second time? - A.Upon my life I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you indict them before September Sessions? - A. I do not know whether I did or not; I have not been well, nor have not had my recollection about me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you take your witnesses before the Grand Jury; is it a week, or a fortnight, or a month? - A. It is a great deal more than a month, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that? - A. It is about a month, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. These people were taken up about the 6th of July, and you let them alone till September Sessions? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take them up once or twice by a warrant? - A. I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, were they not admitted to bail a second time? - A. I cannot tell, upon my word.</p>
               <p>Court. You must bring better witnesses than these; you cannot prove the loss nor any thing else but by this witness, who has so disgraced himself.</p>

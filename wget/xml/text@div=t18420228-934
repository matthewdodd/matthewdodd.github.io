                  </hi>. I am a file-cutter, and manage my father's business, in Chenies-mews. About half-past twelve o'clock at night, on the 12th of February, I was in North-crescent, Cheynies-street—I saw the prisoner—she came up, and accosted me—I told her to go away—she came up again, and put her hand into my coat-pocket—I had three half-crowns and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

               <p>—it was there three minutes before—I missed three half-crowns and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 61.—the moment she had got it I accused her of it, she struck me in the cheek, and said she would call a policeman—the policeman came, and I gave her in charge—she did not say any thing, and the officer took her to the station—I had two old half-crowns and one new one.</p>

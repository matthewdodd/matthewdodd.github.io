               <p>FREDERICK PROPSTRING. I am a patrol. On the 26th of April, about four o'clock in the morning, I went to Mr. Newman's back premises, and saw the prisoner with a sack on his back; I followed him to the Black Horse public-house, which is about two hundred yards off; he went on one side of the pond on the common, and I on the other - I there secured him, and asked him what he had got; he said it was corn to take to his house, and he hoped I would forgive him. I secured him, and took him to Dawkins - He begged of us to forgive him, as it was the first time he had robbed his master. We desired him to take the corn to where he got it from; he took it back to Mr. Newman's yard. I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS DAWKINS. I am a patrol. On the 26th of April, the prisoner was brought to me, he said he took the corn out of his master's stables. I told him to take it back, which he did, and put it in the binn; he said it was the first time he had robbed his master, and begged forgiveness,</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Martin, a labourer, and live at 5, Howard-road, Hornsey,—on 18th January, the prisoner came to my house—she told me that she was ill—I put her to bed—I had seen her twice before, of a Sunday afternoon—I do not keep a lodging-house—I was staying with my mother—I do not know how she came to come to us—I did not exactly know where she lived—she had been living in service up to that time—I asked her for the keys of her box to open it—she said she</p>

               <p>had dropped them in the cab—she had come with her box in a cab—I found the keys in the pocket of her gown, after I had put her to bed—she appeared to be very ill at the time—I told her I had found the keys, and I was going to open her box—she said, "No"—she did not appear to want me to open it; she said so—I did open it, and there just saw the dead body of a child—it was in the box, with one of her gowns laid over it; it was folded up smoothly over it—I sent for Mr. James, and when he came, I showed him the box.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Nelson-terrace, Stoke Newington—I was called to the house of the last witness on 18th January, about half-past 10 in the morning—I found the prisoner there in bed—she was flooding frightfully; the after-birth had not been removed—I first attended to her, and was then shown the child's body in a pie-dish in the box—it was dead—it was a full-grown child—I found a scar on the forehead, an abrasion of the skin—it was a recent one—it was a tearing of the skin, about the size of a shilling, as if it had been rubbed against something, or as if it had fallen on the ground—I discovered that the throat was cut—it was a superficial cut on the left side, and deep on the right side, cutting even into the bone—it cut through the windpipe and gullet—those were the only marks I saw—next day I made a post-mortem examination with the assistance of Dr. Horner—the lungs were fully inflated—I should say the child was born alive—I judged sp from the lungs being inflated—I found no blood in the body; it was perfectly bloodless—the umbilical cord or navel string had not been tied—I should imagine the child had been born a few hours; the after-birth was still attached to the woman—the umbilical cord not being tied, there would be hemorrhage from that, from the child—supposing the umbilical cord to continue untied for some little time, the flow of blood would be quite sufficient to cause the child's death—the throat being cut might also have caused death—it would be quite sufficient to account for death—I cannot say from which of those two causes death ensued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was there anything about the wound, or the appearance of the flesh, which would enable you to say whether the cut on the throat was made before death had ensued from the hemorrhage? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is utterly impossible to say—it might be cut immediately before or immediately after death, with the same appearance—it may have been that the death ensued from the hemorrhage from not tying the umbilical cord; and the cut of the throat may have been after death—it must have been immediately after death—it may have been made immediately after death had ensued from the flowing of the blood from the navel string—it must have been done by a sharp instrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose the abrasion might have resulted from the child falling from the body of the mother? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not know the prisoner's age—I should say she was about seventeen or eighteen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at 9, Spencer-road, Stoke Newington—I assisted Mr. James in the post-mortem examination of the child—the muscles on the right side of the throat were cut completely through—I have heard Mr. James' evidence—I agree with him that death</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186104080052"></xptr>
               <p>might have ensued either from the non-tying of the navel string, or from the cut in the throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was the wound in the throat such as might have been made with a sharp instrument? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not think it is possible for the wound to have been done, unless by a sharp instrument—I have no means of knowing whether the wound in the throat was caused before or after the hemorrhage from the navel string.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

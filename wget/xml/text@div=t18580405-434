               <p>we went in—we went into two or three public houses—I do not know the time—I am quite sure it was in one of the public houses I saw it—hesaid he must get rid of it, because he wanted money, and it must go for some price—I never saw the watch after he went into Tutt's shop—I have never seen it since—it appeared to be a gold watch—I have been an ordinary seaman—I have been a porter two or three months since—Bennett did not tell me that Eliza Jones was going to Mr. Carless' house to rob it—Ido not know what Bennett meant when he said he wanted money—I went to Eliza Jones one Sunday evening, to ask her to come out and speak to Bennett, which she did—she was there about a week—I did not stay five minutes—I saw her leave—I was not there to meet her—I had left Ben<lb></lb>nett a few minutes before she left there, in St. John Street—I saw Eliza Jones; she went in a different direction to me—I saw her between Waterloo Bridge and Rupert Street; Bennett had made an appointment to meet her on the Surrey side of Waterloo bridge at 7 o'clock, and not finding her there, he came back and went towards Rupert Street—I saw her between Waterloo Bridge and Rupert Street—I cannot tell where, for I do not know myself; it was between Waterloo Bridge and one of the turnings in the Strand; they then went over Waterloo Bridge to the Victoria Theatre; I went with them—whenwe met Eliza Jones, she had a bundle with her, containing some of her clothes—she did not carry the bundle to the theatre, she left it at a coffee shop, where she stopped all night, on the night she went to the theatre—I know that, because we went there with her, and left her there—I was just sociable with her, that was all—I do not know her so well; she is not so near a relation to me as he—I did not go to Rupert Street that night, I went a few days afterwards, to look at a bird that he had got—I saw the bundle after she had left the coffee shop the next morning—when they took furnished lodgings in Waterloo Road, she had the bundle with her—I did not see it opened—after leaving the sea, I first lived at No. 3, Earl Street; that is where I lived before I was married to Bennett's sister—when Bennett said to me in Tutt's shop, "I have sold the watch," I said I did not believe it, because I did not know that Tutt was a receiver of stolen property, and I knew that was stolen, according to Bennett's admission—I did not go to a beer shop that evening in which I saw Tutt—I have no watch of my own—Inever had a watch yet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was the name of the man who had bought the watch in the morning? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I did not hear Oliver tell the name—I was not above two minutes in the place—I heard him say he came from a man who bought a watch for 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the morning, but did not hear him mention the name—I had seen Oliver before at Chelsea; I had a faint knowledge of him—I do not know what a cameo brooch is; I call this a cameo brooch because it was exhibited to several persons in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood in my presence—it was not exhibited in the shop, it was in the case behind the counter—I cannot say that I saw it there, but I saw it taken from the case, this large cameo, and it was exhibited in the bar of a public house—Isaw him take it from the place behind, and he took it away in his pocket—thetime that Oliver came was between 2 and 3 o'clock; it was in the middle of Jan., a time of year that I have nothing to do, and I am continually in at Mr. Jones'—I heard William Jones say, "I don't know that I am doing right, but as you have brought them for the person who paid the 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will take them," and he rolled them up and put them on one side, and Oliver took the watch—I think Oliver was in about an instant before me—I heard him say he came to deposit these things for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was at the police court every day, but I was not examined; I was there eight or nine times—I believe William Jones had an attorney before the Magistrate; Mr. Solomon—Ispoke to him before the Magistrate—I was not there every day, I was missing about two days; I was engaged in the City, in my line of business—Iwas not to know whether Mr. Solomon was attending there every day—Iknow he was engaged in the first commencement for William Jones—I went to one party and to another, and I introduced Mr. Solomon to the case—I was sent by William Jones' wife to Mr. Solomon; I saw him at his own house, that was the night previous to the attendance before the Magistrate—I heard what Oliver said—I was not examined as a witness—I told Mr. Solomon all this about nine weeks ago—I did not hear Oliver give his evidence before the Magistrate; I was outside minding the pony and cart—I believe Oliver was examined the last day—I knew Oliver was going to be examined, because I saw him there continually—I heard he was to be examined—when Oliver came in I believe no one was in the shop, but Mrs. Jones was in the parlour—the Hand and Flower was one place where this brooch was exhibited—therewas the place full—I suppose he brought it to show that he had such a valuable thing in his possession—when he took this jewellery he gave up the watch—I did not see him make an entry in his book, for he can neither read nor write—many times when I have been out with him I have receipted his books for him—he carries on a large business, and buys at Debenham and Storr's, and keeps no books—I am a ginger beer manufacturer, but that is not my only trade—I have various trades; an undertaker for one.</p>

               <p>that Oliver brought—I suppose it was about the following day I saw it—a lady offered to buy it—she said, "Mr. Jones, what is the price?"—he said, "I don't know the price, it is not my property, it is not for sale"—the public house was next door to him—the persons who were there were nearly all neighbours—it is a large house for engineers—I was at the police court ready to be called, if they had pleased to call me, but Mr. Dayman fully made up his mind to commit—I have known William Jones sixteen years, he has borne the character of a respectable man; very much so—he has been respected by the neighbours.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warder at Horsemonger Lane gaol. I know that a shirt was brought in to me by Oliver's wife—there were several shirts passed through my hands—the shirt that was found on Bennett by the officer on the 13th, was brought to him by his sister, who is, I believe, the wife of Oliver—Itook the shirt in; the female brought it on the 9th—I passed it to Ben<lb></lb>nett, and they wished to have the dirty one returned, which it was when they came on the following day.</p>

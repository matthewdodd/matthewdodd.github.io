I presented my pistol at them. One of them said, D - n your eyes! what have you got there? I thought it more prudent to make no answer, but to endeavour to get off. I began to run, keeping my eye upon them; and they, seeing me watchful, with the pistol in my hand, were fearful to come up to me; in a few yards two more men started up; upon that I thought it better to stop: I stopped, and then they surrounded me; they pulled my hat over my eyes, and threatened me if I looked up; then they took from me a pistol, a swordstick, and some money; I don't exactly remember how much, but I am positive there were four shillings. They were with me, while they were robbing me, for about three or four minutes. After they had quitted me, one returned to me, and asked me how much money I had: I told them I had a guinea and a few shillings. I had a new shilling in my fob. Then they went away. I believe the prisoner to be one of the first three that I saw; I had a full view of those three, during the time I presented the pistol at them, before they robbed me: they were then about the distance from me that I am now from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What sort of night was it? - It was rather dark.</p>
               <p>I understand you don't mean to swear positively to the prisoner? - I will not be positive to him; but I believe him to be one of the first three: he was dressed much as he is now; his hair was curled round: I believe him to be the man, from his dress, and by his size. I had a strong suspicion of him when I heard him speak, when before the justice; I told the justice, I thought from his voice he was one of the three that spoke to me.</p>

               <p>Upon the 7th of August, I found this pistol (producing a small serew-barrel pistol) in the prisoner's room: I saw him come down the stairs of that house, and he ran across Holborn into a house in King's-Head court.</p>
               <p>How do you know that was the prisoner's room? - I knew it to be his lodgings: there was a girl he lives with in bed in the room. When I took him up once before, he claimed some clothes that I found in that room.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any other man in that room besides the prisoner? - No.</p>

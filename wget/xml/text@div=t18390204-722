                  </hi>. I live in St. Paul's Churchyard. On the 12th of January I was in Finsbury-place, between five and six o'clock—I saw the two prisoners eight or nine yards before me, in conversation with one another, and presently they paused for a moment, before Mr. Prior's shop—Jones entered the shop, and suddenly decamped, with a piece of pocket-handkerchiefs—he rolled it round his hand, as if to give it to Wade, but he had not time—I pursued, and the boy from the shop came, and called "Stop thief"—I ran and caught Wade, and another person caught Jones, in the act of throwing them down—Wade was close to the door when Jones went in, and in view of him.</p>

I was passing the prosecutor's shop, and saw Jones coming out, with a piece of handkerchiefs in his hand, and partly on the pavement—Wade was standing at the shop-window, and they went away together—I saw them taken back into the shop, and I heard Jones ask the prosecutor's wife to forgive him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Edward Prior, a hosier, in Finsbury-place. I saw a piece of silk handkerchiefs being pulled down from the door—I ran out, and saw these two boys going along—Jones had one end of the handkerchiefs under his arm, and part on the ground—Mr. Walter took Wade, and they were brought back—Jones asked Mrs. Prior to forgive him—he said it was his first offence, and he would not do so again—Wade said he had nothing to do with it—they were running at first, but when I came up they were walking, and Jones was about to throw the handkerchiefs down—they were close together—these handkerchiefs are my master's.</p>

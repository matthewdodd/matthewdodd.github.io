               <p>Q. What time of the day. - A. About a quarter after six in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What manner were you travelling. - A. With a single horse chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen as you were travelling along in a chaise between Hampstead and Highgate. A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Is that the lane by Caen wood - A. I believe it is, I am a stranger to that part. In the lane there is a kind of a turning almost like an elbow, and just at the elbow there is a rising ground; the horse was walking up the rising ground, the prisoner came round that turn, and came up very near to my horse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Did he overtake you or did he meet you. - A. He met me, he was on horseback, he came very near my horse; I saw him put his hand in his pocket and pull out a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time how near was he to you. - A. I suppose about the distance from me to you on the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. On pulling out the pistol what did he do. - A. I thought I saw him cock the pistol, he came still nearer to me; he came close to my horse, and as I understood him, he said Surrender; my horse walked very slow and I did not stop him; he called out a second time the same way.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stop then. - A. I did. Upon my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180609170074"></xptr>stopping, I asked him what his pleasure was, he held his pistol up, I then understood him, he said, Your money. I told him that I was very sorry that he was so very much mistaken, as I had not hardly money enough to pay my turnpike to London; he said, Give me your money, sir, give me what you have got.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that give him your money. - A. With a little hesitation; I repeated to him the second time, it is not worth your notice, I have hardly got any money at all, I should be ashamed to offer it you. He repeated and said, Give it me instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you upon that give it him. - A. Yes, I pulled out my canvas bag, in which I had got two one pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give it him. - A. I did, afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any money in the bag. - A. Two one pound notes, a seven shilling piece, and two dollars; I was endeavouring to give him the two five shilling pieces, and keep back the other. When he found me doing that, he said, Give me your bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him the whole. - A. I did; when I had done so, I told him that I was a very poor man, I had no money to pay on the road; I asked him to return me the money again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he return you the money. - A. He said his father was in jail, give me your address, I will pay you again. I think he said his father was in Newgate, but I will not be positive. I begged of him to give it me a second time, or a part of it, he then gave me back one five shilling piece (a dollar), and the canvas bag.</p>
               <p>Q. How long time did that take place. - A. I think about five minutes; it might be about half after six, quite light.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that it is the same man. - A. I am very sorry to say that I am.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. From all that took place on the occasion the man behaved very well. - A. He did, in his situation.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never seen the young man before. - A. Not to my knowledge; as he came near to me I thought he looked like one of my neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. Still you are certain that he is the person. - A. Yes, I am very sorry to say that I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You was somewhat alarmed. - A. I was something alarmed, or else I should not have given up my property.</p>
               <p>Q. This man's life is at stake upon your evidence. - A. I know it.</p>
               <p>Q. From the alarm that you were in, do you mean to swear that that man is something like one you have seen before, and having only that opportunity of seeing him, do you mean to swear that he is the same man. - A. I do; certainly I cannot avoid it, without doing a great injustice to my country and to myself, I should be very happy if I could have done otherwise.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAY sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. I live at Friern Barnet.</p>
               <p>Q. You apprehended the prisoner. - A. I did, I apprehended him in a lane leading from Edgware in the Edgware road; I apprehended him on the 7th of August, about eight o'clock in the evening. I searched him no further than I took from him a brace of pistols, I took one pistol from his left hand breast pocket, and the other from his left hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine them. - A. Not instantly; I did afterwards, they were loaded. I gave the pistols to Bridget, who came up some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the pistols were loaded, there was no priming in them. - A. There was priming in one and not in the other.</p>

             sworn. Examined by Mr. Gleed. I am one of the horse patrol of Bow street, stationed at Edgware. In consequence of information I went in pursuit of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to him you found him in custody of Mr. Tay. - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon him, and what you did, produce. - A. I found this purse as it is, in his breeches pocket; here is in the purse two one pound notes, a dollar, a seven shilling piece, and a six pence, this was loose; in the same pocket, eight shillings, seven sixpences, and two seven shilling pieces. In his waistcoat pocket I found this key, and a pair of black silk gloves in his right hand pocket. I found this smelling bottle full of gunpowder, and a bullet also; here is the powder that was in the pistols, and the two bullets; these are the pistols. I found this watch on him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him. - A. No, he was at the Bear at Hendon when I came up to him.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel, called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

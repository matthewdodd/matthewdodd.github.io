                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City—policeman</hi>). From information I received, I went with Baker, another officer, to Mr. Kirby's premises in Aldersgat-street, on Saturday, 30th May—he is a tailor, and the prisoner is a cutter in his employment—while watching, I saw the prisoner leave the shop about a quarter to 9 in the morning—he went to 14, Edmond's—place, Aldersgate-street—when he left I went in there and received from a man, named Rush-brook, these two pieces of cloth—I believe he is the landlord—he is a tailor, and works for Mr. Kirby—I then returned with Baker to Mr. Kirby's shop—Mr. Kirby, jun. was present, and the prisoner—I told the prisoner we were two detective police—officers, and he might consider himself in custody for robbing his employer that morning, of the materials for a waistcoat, and leaving them at Rushbrook's, in Edmond's-place—he said, "Yes; I have; I</p>

                  </hi>. I live with and assist my father, Thomas Freestone Kirby, of 30, Aldersgate-street—the prisoner was in our employment as a cutter for about eight months I think—these two pieces of material (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belong to my father—they are both pieces of fancy coating—the prisoner had no authority whatever to remove such things—he had to go on the morning in question to Rushbrook's in Edmond's-place, to take a coat which he had cut out to be made—he had no authority to take these articles to Rushbrook's, or anywhere else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman tailor, at 14, Edmond's-place—on the morning of 30th May, the prisoner bronchi me materials to be made for a coat—these two pieces were tied up in the materials—he took them out, and said, "I will lay them on one side," and he did so—he said that one was out of Mr. Thomas' coat; I suppose one he had previously cut—he then went away—Bull came in almost directly, and I gave him these pieces which the prisoner had brought in—such pieces as these would not be put in as waste cloth—they were not required to make up the coat I had in hand.</p>

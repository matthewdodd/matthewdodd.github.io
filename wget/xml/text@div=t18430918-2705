                  </hi>. I am a grocer, and live in Whitecross-street. The pri<lb></lb>soner lodged in my house when I took it—in August I had an interview with the policeman, and on the 27th I marked some money—I marked some Paper, and strewed it among some tea—between two and three o'clock that afternoon I and my wife went out—I returned, and found tea taken from two different bins and three canisters, and great part of these papers were gone—I called in Brannan, and went up to the prisoner's bed-room—he and his wife were in bed—we tapped at the door—the prisoner came out, and said, "What is the matter?"—Brannan said I had missed a quantity of tea—he said,</p>

               <p>"Mr. Paddon don't suspect me, docs he?"—I said, "I have no one to suspect but you, you are my only lodger"—Brannan said, "We shall search the premises"—we went to the front room, and Brannan found a tea caddy on a side-table—we turned the tea out, and in it we discovered three pieces of the marked paper—I am sure they are pieces that I marked, and put in among the tea—I said, "That is quite enough,"—the wife flew at Brannan, and tried to snatch them out of his hand, and, I believe, did destroy some—we then went through the house, but did not find anything else—while we were taking the prisoner through the passage, his wife said, "Jones, you had better confess where the rest of it is"—we went to the station, and Brannan questioned the prisoner about the rest of the tea, and then he consented to show where the rest of the property was—he came back, and said, "There is the rest of the property,"pointing to a chest, under which were two flooring boards that lifted up, and under them was tea, coffee, plums, and every thing in the grocery line—I counted my money, and missed 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which I had left in the till—Brannan told the Magistrate that he was going to make another search, and appointed with the prisoner's wife to make another search in her presence—he came, but she did not, and he did not search that day; but the next day he came with another officer, and in the upper room we found a child's money-box, and in it 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of my marked money—I can swear it was some that I had marked before.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 20.) I received information from the prosecutor, and directed him to do something—I accompanied him to the prisoner's apartment—I knocked at the door—the prisoner was in bed with his wife—I said I belonged to the police, and Mr. Paddon had missed some tea—the prisoner said, "I hope he don't suspect us"—I went into the front room, and asked if he had any tea—he said, "A few ounces"—I found a tea-caddy, and emptied its contents out—I found in it marked pieces of paper—Mrs. Jones snatched one from my hand—I asked the prisoner if he had more tea—he said, "No"—I went down, and his wife said, "Jones, you had better tell where the rest is"—I went to the station, and said A was not satisfied with the search—the prisoner went back, and pointed to a box under the table—two boards came up there, and I found this box and jar of tea—I had told the prosecutor to put an H or a P on the papers—he marked one piece before me, and showed it to me, and it was marked exactly as I told him to do it.</p>

               <p>No—he marked a piece, and showed it to me, and asked if it would do—I said, "Yes"—I positively swear I did not give him any marked paper—I asked him to mark several like these—I think the prosecutor's wife was serv<lb></lb>ing in the shop—I think no one else was present—I called there another time with a brother officer, who was in the habit of doing plain-clothes duty—the prisoner was quite quiet—he said he only had a few ounces, and when I came back, and found this other, he said, "That is not his; I have had it by me some time"—he did not say he was innocent, or any thing of the kind—he was admitted to bail.</p>

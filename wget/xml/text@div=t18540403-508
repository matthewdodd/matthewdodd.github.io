                  </hi>. I am a constable of the London and North Western Railway Company. I was on the line, near Primrose-hill, between 5 and 6 o'clock on Saturday evening, 26th Feb., at the mouth of the Primrose-hill Tunnel—I saw the prisoner there nearly the whole of the afternoon—about 200 hundred yards from where I am stationed I saw him get on the line at five minutes past 5 o'clock—I called out to him, and he went off the line—the 5 o'clock express came down a few minutes afterwards; as soon as that had passed and entered the tunnel, he came on to the line again; and about a quarter or twenty minutes past 5 o'clock, I saw him placing bricks on the line—as I knew that the quarter past 5 o'clock express was coming out directly, I ran up the line and caught him as he was getting up the wall to get away—I pulled him back across the line,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185404030051"></xptr>
               <p>and made him knock some of the bricks off, and I knocked some off myself—they were on the rail—there were two bricks on the down main line, three on the up main line, and three on the goods down line; one of them just in at the end of the point—before we had got them off the down express was coming; it came past in a moment—it was coming through the arch of the Camden station, at the time I had hold of the prisoner: there was an up train coming through the tunnel at the time—it was about two minutes' distance from the spot where he put the bricks, and there was a down engine coming down the points to get behind a cattle train, on the goods line—the brick on the goods line was placed between the points, so that they could not close, the consequence of which would have been that the engine would have been thrown on to the up main line, and there would have necessarily been a collision, as the engine would have been thrown in front of the train that was coming up—I saw passengers in the carriages.</p>

               <p>Mr. Tattersall's.

About half past 2 o'clock on the morning of the 18th I heard a great crash in the Edgware Road, and the falling of a shutter on the pavement—I saw the prisoner run from Mr. Tattersall's window, and heard somebody call "Stop thief!"—I pursued him—hewas not above a yard from the window when I saw him—I did not lose sight of him at all—after running some time, another constable, who was on duty on the other side of the street, ran across and clasped him round the waist, and they both fell together—they got on their feet and both ran; I kept the prisoner in sight, and he was stopped by Sergeant Edwards—I only lost sight of him for an instant, when he turned the corner of Chapel Street and ran into the sergeant's arms.</p>

               <p>I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw the prisoner running—I stopped him in Burn Street; he threw something out of his right hand through a cellar flap, within a yard of where I stopped him; in fact, we were on one part of the cellar flap—I told Bowden to examine the cellar, and took the prisoner to the station—I found this brass rod (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and some price tickets lying a few yards from the shop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you find anything in Burn Street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; a crowd of prostitutes came up, and I told Bowden to keep them back, and take the light and examine; Burn Street is a den of prostitutes—the cellar flap comes out about a foot, there is an opening of six inches, and there was a watch lying there—I remained there until there were sufficient men to keep the prostitutes back—one of the policemen said, "I see watches."</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and was residing at 9, Arlington-street, Islington, on 6th February—on that afternoon, about half-past 4 o'clock, I entered an omnibus at Camberwell-gate to go to the Monument—I went to the very top of the omnibus, near the driver—there was nobody in the omnibus when I entered it—some lady entered and sat at the bottom, next the door—I cannot tell who came in next—after a while the two prisoners came in—one sat opposite me, and the other on the same side as myself, next but one to my left hand—I was sitting on the right hand side seat, as you enter—a lady was between me and Smith—when close to the Monument the omnibus stopped for me to get out—I was getting out, but had some difficulty in passing the prisoners; one of them put an umbrella across the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and that detained me some few minutes—the conductor said, "You will keep me here all night"—before I got out I saw a notice <hi rend="italic">atop</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, "Beware of pick-pockets, both male and female"—I got out, and, as I went to feel in my pocket, I found my purse was gone—seeing the bill induced me to feel in my pocket—I hailed the conductor to stop, which he did, and he put me into the omnibus—when I first got in my purse was safe—I did not take it out when I got in—it was in my pocket—I did not require it then—I felt for it to see that it was there—it contained 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and some silver—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the purse—I did not see it when it was found.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Woodland-terrace, Trafalgar-road, Green<lb></lb>wich, and am a city-missionary—I was in the omnibus on 6th February—I got in a little this side of King-street, Walworth—I rode from there to the Monument, where the prosecutrix got out—the prisoners got in after me—they came in together—Burton sat on my right hand—my wife sat next to the prosecutrix, and Smith sat next to my wife—I was not on the same side as the prosecutrix—I sat at the top of the omnibus opposite the prosecutrix—upon the prosecutrix leaving the omnibus she was very much obstructed; she could not get past the prisoners; they sat nearly opposite each other—she was detained some little time—I lifted up her shawl with my left hand and saw Burton’s hand very near Miss Mullett's pocket, at least near her right side, where I supposed her pocket was—she got out, and in a few moments, before the omnibus had scarcely gone on a yard or two, she came back and was introduced into the omnibus again—as soon as she got in, she looked very confused, and said, "Oh, my purse, I have lost my purse"—I said, "All right, Ma'am, your purse is safe; your purse is in the omnibus"—I then laid my hand on Burton's shoulder and said, "This is the woman who has your puree"—I then said, "I insist now upon this woman being searched, and not only her, but the woman sitting opposite"—that was Smith—Burton, in reply to what I said, began to abuse me and to represent herself as a respectable person, and that I must take care or I should be likely to be punished—I do not recollect that the other woman said any<lb></lb>thing—a moment or two afterwards, Burton said, "You can search me," and began to rise from her seat—they were removed from the omnibus, and we then began to look about for the purse, and it was on the floor a little to the left of where Burton had been sitting—I believe both the women volunteered to come out and be searched at once—there was a policeman at once.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a conductor of this omnibus, and was so on this day—I live at 4, Attwell-street, Rye-lane, Peckham—I remember Miss Mullett getting into the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—to the best of my knowledge, I think, she was the first passenger in it—the two prisoners got in near Carter-street, Walworth, as near as I recollect—they came together up to the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>, and got in together, both at the same time—one went on the left-hand side and the other on the right, about the fourth passenger up the omnibus, I should think—no one got in after them—I had ten in the omnibus when I received them, and they filled it—I think there was another gentleman in the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> besides the missionary, but as to the exact passengers, I cannot swear—the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> went on till we reached near the Monument—I received notice there that some one wanted to get out—I blew my whistle, opened the door, and stood down on the bottom step of the omnibus, and while there I saw Smith place an umbrella across the omnibus in the direction towards Burton's legs—Burton put her legs out—being rather behindhand, I said, "You will not let that lady get out; I can plainly see you are doing it on purpose"—I spoke loudly on purpose—in the meantime, the lady got by and came out—I handed her out, and she walked away, but had got but a very few yards</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186102250042"></xptr>
               <p>before she came back to me in an excited state—she pulled my coat, and said, "Conductor, I have lost my purse"—I said, "That accounts for the obstruct<lb></lb>tion I saw take place in the omnibus"—I should think that all in the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi> could hear me say that, but there was great confusion at the time—I spoke it loud enough—I opened the door of the omnibus, and insisted upon the lady getting in again—she, at the time, was in a fainting state, and could scarcely get in—I assisted her in, and after that Burton volunteered to be searched—in the mean time I saw her in a rising position from the seat, and saw her hand, and something, which was no other than this purse, slide from her hand to the omnibus—at first I thought it went on the seat—I would not allow any one to leave the omnibus—an officer arrived, and I gave the two prisoners into his custody—I afterwards saw this purse found somewhere in the omnibus; I think, on the floor—I thought at first it was on the seat, but in the great confusion I will not exactly swear as to where it was—it was placed in my hands by one of the passengers—the money was in it—fourteen sovereigns—I gave it to the officer.</p>

On 21st Dec., at a little before 6 o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner carrying a bundle; I followed him about four hundred yards—he turned round and asked me what o'clock it was—I said, "Ten minutes to 6 o'clock; where are you going?"—he said, "To Greenwich"—I said, "Where are you coming from?"—he said, "What has that to do with you"—I said, "I am a policeman;" and he <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the bundle down—I got him by the collar, and one of the Company's servants picked up the bundle—I opened it—it contained twelve pounds of plums, and a quantity of almonds, spice, and sugar—I searched the prisoner, and found this knife in his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of No. 22, High Street, Deptford. It is a detached house, enclosed by a high wall all round—on the morning of 21st Dec., I was called up at about half past 7 o'clock, and found my bakery broken into by the window, which was closed the previous night at 11 o'clock—theplace was in confusion, and a quantity of raisins, sugar and spice, were gone—the articles in the bundle were what I had lost—this wrapper was in my bakehouse that night—this knife belongs to a boy in my employ, and was safe in my bakery the previous night.</p>

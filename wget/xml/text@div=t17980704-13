            . Now Mr. Hill knows that my name is John Portees, but he chuses to alias me, because he wishes to defame me. Mr. Hill, the whole time I was with him was in the constant habit of pawning every little trifling thing in the house; I have known the house many times bare of every thing, without a table-cloth, or a tea-spoon in the house. Mrs. Hill can neither read nor write, and she has given me the tickets to pick out particular things for her when she has wanted them out, and I have seen even the ticket of a child's cap, that had been pawned for four-pence, and they always pawned things in other people's names, particularly in the name of Mrs. Williams, of Tottenham-court-road, a person not of the best character in the world; two children used to fetch and carry these things backwards and forwards. When they have had company, they have been obliged to borrow tea-spoons, because their own were in pawn; I only came down here last night between eleven and twelve o'clock, if I had had further time, I should have had some witnesses to prove what I have already stated. When I was taken up, I had Lord Kenyon's subpoena about me, to attend the Grand Jury, at Westminster, to give evidence upon a bill of indictment against Mr. Hill, for perjury; he said to a person that is now in Court, that if I went to give evidence against him, he would take me up upon that warrant, and as soon as I came out of the Grand Jury room, I was taken up upon that warrant. With respect to pawning the book in question, I solemnly declare to your Lordship I never did; and, with respect to the second witness, a very few days indeed will shew what a situation he will be in, on account of some transactions at Manchester; there have been several persons up from Manchester to take him, but have not yet been able to find him.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Mr. Kirby: I went up with a person of the name of Pinder, who is mentioned in that subpoena, upon an Habeas Corpus, to Guildhall, Westminster, to go before the Grand Jury, I went up with Jonas Waite, one of my fellow servants, and several debtors; as we were going into Westminster-hall, it being too soon to go before the Grand Jury, I saw Mr. Hill, Mr. Hill said, take care of that fellow, meaning Pinder; after we had stopped there some time, I thought it was time to go to Guildhall; we went to Guildhall, that was at ten o'clock, and we were informed the Jury would not meet till eleven; Pinder said to me, we may as well walk up and down here till eleven, and then we shall not be out of the way; we walked about, and met with the prisoner; when we got to Guildhall door, I saw Mr. Hill again, he came up to me, and said, so I see you have brought up Pinder; yes, Sir, says I, I have; why, says he, there is that other fellow that is with him, if he attempts to go before the Grand Jury, the moment he comes out I will apprehend him upon this warrant, shewing me the warrant; then he asked me if I knew of any constable about there, there was one belonging to Bow-street standing close to me; I told him that was an officer; he took him on one side, and shewed him the warrant.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he would have him taken up for? - A. He said for a felony.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay there till after they had given their evidence? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Mr. Hill? - A. With the officer, at the door; and the moment he came out, he took him up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Matthews. Q. How long was this ago? - A. I believe it was last Monday was a week, or Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. And you recollect precisely the words he said? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now were not these his words: I have had a warrant against this man a considerable time, I have not been able to find him till now, and as soon as he comes out I will apprehend him? - A. No; he said, if he attempts to go into the Grand Jury-room, the moment he comes out I will apprehend him upon this warrant.</p>
               <p>Hill. My Lord, I beg leave to explain this.</p>
               <p>Court. We do not sit here to hear speeches, but to hear facts.</p>
               <p>Hill. I only mean to state facts. I went down for the express purpose of preferring a bill of indictment against Pinder; I preferred my bill, the Grand Jury found it a true bill, and threw out theirs. Happening to be down at Westminster, I asked the last witness for an officer; I gave the warrant to a man of the name of Rice; the prisoner had been out of the way five months, and I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179807040012"></xptr>Rice I would be glad if he would take him as soon as he came out of the Grand Jury-room, but particularly desired him not to molest him, or take any notice of him till after he had come out of the Grand Jury-room.</p>

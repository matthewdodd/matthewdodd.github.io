                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, E</hi> 152). On 11th July, about half-past 8 o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in Torrington-Square, and saw the prisoners standing together, drinking out of a bottle—Hydes emptied it and had to hold it up in order to do so—he then gave it to Williams, with some<lb></lb>thing else, which he took from his pocket; I could not see what, I was not efficiently close—Williams had on this billycock hat (<hi rend="italic">produced),</hi> and Hydes an ordinary cap, with a peak—Williams then went to the Earl St. Vincent public-house, in Little Torrington-street, fifty or sixty yards off—the other remained in Torrington-square—I followed Williams to the Earl St. Vincent and saw him come out—I went in and saw the barmaid, Eliza Thomasson, give the landlord a florin—I saw the landlord try it and mark it, and he afterwards gave it to me at the police-station—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I then went out and saw the prisoners again walking together in Torrington-square—Williams still had the <hi rend="italic">billycock,</hi> and Hydes the cap, and then I saw them change them—they went down the square, and stood with their backs against the enclosure of the square, the gardens—they both had their hands behind them—I went up to them and asked Williams how he came to leave the rum, and the bottle, and the two shilling-piece at the Earl St Vincent public-house—he said that I had made a mistake, it was not him—Hydes said, "I am sure it is not us, we have only just come up from the country, and I asked him for a lucifer"—I suppose he meant Williams—I said, "It is no good telling me that, for I saw you, Williams, go into the Earl St. Vin<lb></lb>cent public-house, and at that time you had that <hi rend="italic">billycock</hi> on that Hydes has on now; there you tendered a counterfeit florin in payment for a half quartern of rum, which you called for, and you went away and gave no ex<lb></lb>planation about it, what was the cause of that?"—Williams said, "Because to lady said it was a bad one"—I took them both back to the Earl St Vin<lb></lb>cent, and the barmaid identified Williams as the man who had given her the two shilling-piece—another constable came up, and we took them both to She police-station and searched them—on Williams I found three halfpence and a comb; on Hydes I found 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a threepenny <hi rend="italic">bit</hi> in silver, and four-pence in coppers, good money—after they were locked up, I went with Policeman, E 155, and pointed out the place to him in Torringten-square</p>

I am barmaid at the Earl St. Vincent public-house, in Little Torrington-street—on 11th July list I was serving in the bar, and saw Williams come in—he asked for half a quartern of rum in a bottle—I served him, and put it into the bottle—it came to threepence—he gave me a counterfeit two shilling-piece—I suspected that it was bad, put it into the detector, and bent it—I told him it was bad—he muttered something to himself and went away—I could not understand what he said—he left the bottle and rum and the money—I banded the counterfeit florin to Mr. Mursell, my employer—the two prisoners were soon afterwards brought back—I recognise Williams as the one who had been there before.</p>

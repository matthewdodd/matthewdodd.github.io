                  </hi>. I am a silk warehouseman and live at 2, Eliza Cottages, Plaistow Park—on 9th February, about 10 minutes to 11, I left home with my little girl to get some beer for the next day's dinner—I went to the Libra Arms, got the beer and sent it home—I stood for a moment talking to some one—I heard a woman scream and saw some man running—I walked quietly over and saw a woman with blood running down her face—I advised her to go home immediately—as I left her I saw the prisoner struggling with a man who he threw down—there were other persons about at the time, some behind me—I hesitated a moment and the prisoner rushed at me and I felt a pricking sensation in the abdomen; I put my hand down and found my bowels protruding—I did not feel the blow—the prisoner then ran away—I walked with the assistance of two men, and a surgeon attended to me—I saw the prisoner again the same night, I said I would not positively swear to him; he was brought to me by the police; I then thought I was dying—a Magis<lb></lb>trate examined me upon the certificate of a surgeon—my impression now is that the prisoner is the man—I was on my back in bed for eight weeks, and I am still sufferring from the effects of the injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. When the prisoner was brought to me I said "It was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060113"></xptr>
               <p>done in a moment"—I don't remember saying "it was dark"—I was perfectly sober—I said "I will not positively swear he was there, he was a tall man, something like this man, I saw him in the dark."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I was examined again before the Magistrate on 23rd March, when I was better; I then said "I cannot positively swear to the prisoner, but I fully believe it was him"—that is my impression now.</p>
               <p>HENRY HUGHES BROOKS. I am a grocer—on the night of the 9th February, about 11, I saw some women standing in front of my shop, which is near the Libra Arms—they were quarrelling—I saw the prisoner standing with some women farther down the road—these women were complaining that they had been struck by the woman who was standing with the prisoner, and they were saying what they would do to her, and they went back to her and the prisoner and they had a bit of a souffle together; the prisoner lifted up a large iron pipe and let it fall on the head of Julia Banfield, and knocked her down; he then threw the pipe over a fence—several men came up and spoke to him, and he and another man began to spar; they had a sort of running fight till they got close to the libra Arms, I followed them—he men made a rush at the prosecutor who stood in front of me, and then suddenly turned round and ran away without his cap—he made a blow at the lower part of the prosecutor's body—he said "I have been stabbed"—a constable then came up.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. There were about eight people there altogether—the women had been scuffling together—the prisoner had the iron pipe in his hand—I saw no knife—I fancied he was trying to trip the prosecutor up with his hand—I saw the beginning of the disturbance, it began about 20 yards from where the prosecutor was stabbed—there Were about half a dozen persons there at that time.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SHAYLING (<hi rend="italic">Policeman</hi> 99 <hi rend="italic">K</hi>), I was on duty and heard some calls for police and ran up, I found five or six people standing there—from what I was told I went to the prosecutor's house—I found him lying on a couch—I then went and apprehended the prisoner—I told him the charge—he made no reply—I asked him for a knife, he took the one produced from his trousers pocket—I noticed that the big blade had some stains on it, and the small blade had been fresh broken off—I took him to the station and went to the place where the assault had been committed, and found this cap there which the prisoner afterwards said was his, and put it on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I stated before the Magistrate that I noticed stains on the big blade—I did not say that the blade appeared free from recent marks; I swear that—I see the words in the deposition but it is a mistake—I signed my name, but it was not read over to me—I showed the knife to the inspector—he is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Plaistow—on 9th February I was called to see the prosecutor—he was lying on a sofa and his intestines protruding—he had been stabbed about an inch and a half below the navel—I should say this small blade would be likely to make such a wound—he was in a very weak, bad state—he had lost little or no blood—it was a highly dangerous wound; I apprehended his death and gave a certificate to that effect, and had a Magistrate called in to take his deposi<lb></lb>tions—I left him in charge of Dr. Howse and attended him afterwards every six hours—I replaced the bowels and sewed up the wound—he in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060114"></xptr>
               <p>proved—I have had considerable experience in such wounds, the general result is death—he is not out of medical treatment yet; he is ruined for life, he will have chronic hernia and be prevented from lifting weights, or running, or any violent physical exercise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. This knife was handed to me by the policeman, who stated there were some stains on it—I only saw a little tobacco—I should expect to find blood stains on a knife from such a stab; not much, but in the nick where the nail goes to open it—it must have been a heavy thrust—the prisoner has always borne the character of a peaceable, quiet man in the neighbourhood—such a wound would not break the knife—it seemed to be a friendly quarrel among the women.</p>

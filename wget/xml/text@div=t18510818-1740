                  </hi>. I keep a tobacconist's shop, in London-street, Green<lb></lb>wich. On 24th July, about 10 o'clock in the evening, I was sitting in my parlour, heard a noise in the shop, went and saw the prisoner there—I asked what he did there—he asked me for a drop of water—I asked him where he lived—he said, "Over the way, in Roan-street"—I asked why he did not go there for the water—he said he did not know; he had walked from Chat<lb></lb>ham that day—my wife got him some water; he drank it, and went away—I afterwards missed between eighty and ninety cheroots—I gave information to the police, and the prisoner was apprehended next evening—while waiting to go before the Magistrate, I said to him, "My lad, you had better tell me who has received the cigars; somebody must have received them"—he then made a statement about the cigars.</p>

The prisoner was in my service as servant of all work—I dismissed her rather better than three weeks before she was taken into custody—after she had left me, I missed a great deal of wearing apparel, amounting to about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—they were chiefly baby's things, shifts and night gowns—I also lost a cloak, two pairs of stockings, and a night cap—very little has been found—I gave information to the police.</p>

My husband said he did not know there were any such in the house. Mr. Burk was sitting in company behind me, he got up and cut my head with a loaded whip, I ran out of the house and called watch, these people all came after me, Commings knock'd me down, he laid hold on my purse and pulled it out of my bosom, there were 20 shillings and upwards in it.

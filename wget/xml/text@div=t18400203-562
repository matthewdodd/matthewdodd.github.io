About a quarter-past seven o'clock, on the 9th of January, I was between King William-street and Lombard-street—I had ten toasting-forks with me, which were my father's, and which I had to sell—I met the prisoner, whom I did not know before—he asked if I bad seen a boy with a child on his back—I said, "No"—he said be wanted him to carry some goods, that he was looking for a porter, and could not find one—he asked whether I would go, and he would give me half-a-crown—I said I would—he said, "Come with me"—he took me to the East India Arms public-house, in Fenchurch-street—he told me to wrap up my forks—he took them out of my hand, and put them in the public-house, and told me to go to Mr. Frith's, a fish<lb></lb>monger, in Bishopsgate-street, to ask for Mr. Williams's clothes and money—I went all about Bishopsgate-street, and could find no such per<lb></lb>son—he told me to meet him at the Bell public-house—he told me to go for my forks to the East India Arms public-house when I had fetched his clothes and money—I went for them, and they were not there—I did not see any thing more of them or him till the Saturday night, when my mother saw him—he said something to her—I did not hear what—these are six of the toasting-forks—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>.)</p>

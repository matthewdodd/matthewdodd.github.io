                  </hi>. I live in Leadenhall-street—the pri<lb></lb>soner was in my service as errand boy for eight or nine months—on the 28th of May, about half-past one o'clock, I left him in the counting-house while I went up to dinner—my cash-box was on the desk at the time—it was fastened, but not locked—I had a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi> note, 2 so<lb></lb>vereigns, 3 half-sovereigns, a half-crown, 3 sixpences, and 4 shillings in it—when I came down stairs at 2 o'clock, the prisoner had absconded—the cash-box was open, and the notes and money gone—I went to the station, and gave information, and circulated handbills, offering a reward—finding the police did not get him, I wrote to his sister—I did not see him again till I saw him at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>)—" Mr. Watson regrets to inform S.M. Lee, her brother Thomas has absconded from his house, having broken open the cash-box, and stolen there from nearly twenty pounds in gold and silver, on Saturday afternoon, while the family were at dinner. Mr. W. begs to say, Thomas is a base, ungrateful villain; no other master would put up with his conduct for some months past. Mr. W, has kept him till he has stolen every shilling he had in the house. Should he call on you, I have no wish to punish him, provided he returns the pro<lb></lb>perty stolen; if not, he may depend on transportation. The officers are every where in search of him, and I hope many days will not be over be<lb></lb>fore he is taken. Injustice to his uncle, I must say he has done all in his power to take him; he has been in my service about nine months. I am sorry I did not long ago discharge him: he has had every kindness shown him in my family."</p>

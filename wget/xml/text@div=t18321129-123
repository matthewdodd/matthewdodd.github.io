               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go to the pawnbroker's, to see the shawl, before it was delivered up? A. No, nor did I send any body; I confine my dealings to clothing and jewellery - she opened her box when the officer asked her; my sister, who keeps house for me, had access to her room; she is not here.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutor call about it? A. He called with the officer, and showed me a mark on the shawl when he saw it, but not before - he was not asked for a mark.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On Sunday, the 18th of November, Lazarus sent for me; I found the property in the prisoner's box - she went up stairs with me, and unlocked her box herself, readily.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Lazarus describe any thing he had lost till the box was opened? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. LAZARUS. This comb is mine, and was taken from a cupboard - I had seventy dozen of them; the stockings are marked with my warehouse mark on them - the shifts are also marked with the warehouse mark; they never were sold.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I bought the things before I lived with the prosecutor, and have had them two years.</p>
               <p>LEWIS LAZARUS. I had four or five hundred of these shifts; I sometimes sell goods with the shop-mark on them, but at times I cross them off - my sister sells in my absence; these stockings I bought since the prisoner has been in my employ.</p>

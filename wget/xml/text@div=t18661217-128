I am an auctioneer's clerk, and live in Queen's Square, Aldersgate Street—on the 13th December, about a quarter to eight at night, I was at the corner of Prince's Street, Barbican—the prisoner came on me from over the way, and with his left hand caught hold of my chest, and with his right snapped my guard chain—the ring broke and he stole my watch and guard, and ran away with them in his hand—I pursued him, calling, "Stop thief," but fell down and got up again, and</p>

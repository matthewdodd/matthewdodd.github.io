            , eighteen days. On the 21st of May, a little before six o'clock in the morning, I went out, leaving my wife in bed; I double-locked the door, and threw the key through the window on the ground floor, where the glass was broken-no person could reach it-the broken glass was not large enough to admit any person through. I went across the road to work in my garden. A little before seven o'clock I was called away, and returned home.

The blood appeared to issue from her throat-there was no person with her. I found the street - door open-the window was not more broken than when I left it. I could find no person in my house. I found a bill-book on the floor of the room; there was a little blood on it, and a great deal on the floor by it. The bill-book was not mine, nor was it in the house when I left. I took my wife to the hospital on a bed, in a cart. As I was putting her into the cart I saw Wells with a razor, which had blood on it. My wife died in the hospital on the 6th of June.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I was at Westbourn-green on the 21st of May, about seven o'clock in the morning. I have known the prisoner some years. I was about twenty yards from Roger's house, and saw the prisoner enter the premises. He stood opposite the door for about a minute before he went in - I do not know whether anybody let him in. I was digging in the road - I went on with my work. Two or three minutes after, I heard, as I thought, a woman scream-it seemed at first to be a long distance off; I took no particular notice of it. The second time that I heard it, it appeared to be nearer, and to come from Rogers's house. I heard it again, and ran to the house. Before I got to the door I saw the deceased fall out of the door, all in a gore of blood. She fell forward on the ground, rose herself up, and made for the place very quick - She staggered, and immediately seized the pales with her right hand. I immediately called out to Reeves that there was a woman murdered-he came, and ran for her husband. I did not see the prisoner come out. I saw the razor in the possession of Wells.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known the prisoner some years, and was always very good friends with him. I always thought him a very good kind of a man.</p>

            . I was at work nearly opposite Rogers's house. On the 21st of May I had been to fetch some tools: as I returned about seven o'clock a man came running on horseback, and said a woman's throat had been cut. I saw the deceased sitting on a pile of bricks, in a very bloody condition-there was blood in the house. I went for an officer-when I returned I looked about, and found a razor near the path, and took it up-it was bloody.</p>

            . On the 21st of May, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning, I and Court were at the Coach and Horses, public-house, at Paddington, about a mile from the prosecutor's house; the prisoner came in to us, called for a quartern of gin, and asked us to drink a glass, which we did; I have known him some years. After we had drank he called us into the back yard, and said he had been and murdered a woman that morning; that he had knocked her down with a bill-book, and cut her throat with a razor. He spoke in that easy way, that we did not believe him. I asked him who he had murdered? he said "

It was agreed that Court should go up to the prisoner's house, and ask his daughter for two little pill-boxes that he wanted, and he would hear if there was any alarm - I was to remain with the prisoner. Court went, when he returned he said it was true. We immediately took the prisoner into custody, and delivered him up before the magistrate.</p>

            . I am receiving house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's hospital. On the 21st of May, in the morning, the deceased was brought there in a cart - I saw her taken out of the cart. After removing some handkerchiefs from her neck, I found a large wound in front, to the extent of about five inches, across the windpipe-this was the principal wound; but there were several others, as if several attempts had been made to cut her throat. There were ten principal wounds in her head-such an instrument as the bill-hook would make them exactly. She lived sixteen days; I attended her every day.</p>

               <p>Q. In your judgment, what was the cause of her death - A. The wound in her throat, combined with others, was the cause. Her scull was fractured, which would have caused her death in a short time. She frequently expressed her apprehension that she should die.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have attended the hospital five years. I could form no idea of her health before the injury. The form of the fracture of the scull was such that it could not be caused by a fall. The windpipe was completely severed. My opinion is, that this wound alone must have proved fatal.</p>

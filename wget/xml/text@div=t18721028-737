I took the charge at the station; Wickman, who was sitting on a stool, bleeding from his left breast, said, in the prisoner's hearing, "I was standing inside the White Bear public-house, St. George's Street, East, about ten minutes back; we had been drinking together, we quarrelled, and he took out a knife and stabbed me"—I said to the prisoner, "You hear what the prosecutor has said against you"—he said "Yes, he struck me last voyage, and again to-night; we have been shipmates together five or six years, and when he struck me to-night I stabbed him, I could not help it"—I asked him if he heard the prisoner say that he had struck him—he said "Yes, I did, and I will skin the b—when I get over this"—the prisoner, addressing Wickman, said "I could not help it, I am very sorry for it, Peter"—I asked the prisoner for the knife, and he handed me this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it was shut.</p>

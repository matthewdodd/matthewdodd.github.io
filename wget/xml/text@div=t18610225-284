                  </hi>. I am a carman, in the employ of the London and Brighton Railway Company—on Thursday 14th February, I was sent with a van to Linhani's in the Borough, for a load of butter and bacon—I got the load—among them were fifteen firkins of butter for Lord of Hastings—I went straight back from Liuham's to the station in Willow-walk—I put my van in the yard, and took my horses out—during that time I did not take away anything from the van—I did not go to the van again—next morning I was called upon to give an account of two firkins of butter that were lost—the birkins I had were chalked on the head, and branded with an "R."—I noticed them so as to be able to say what the marks were—they were num<lb></lb>bered up to 40 something, but the numbers were not progressive—we don't in general take notice of the numbers and marks—I have seen the firkin of butter that has been found—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is one of the same sort that was lost—it is the one that was lost—I know it by the numbers—they in general call out the numbers to us—this is No. 41—a cask of butter marked 41 was given to me that 'night—I know that by the numbers they gave me on the sheet at Linham's—they call out the numbers as they put them in—that number was given to me on one of the casks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am receiving clerk at the Willow-walk station, Ber<lb></lb>mondsey, on the London and Brighton Railway—on the night of 14th February, from information I received I went to the van that was loaded with butter and bacon which had been brought in by the last witness—my way bill stated that there were fifteen firkins of butter for Lord of Hastings—I could only find thirteen—two were missing—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the way bill—that is made out in the office by the invoice clerk, and then is sent down to me to see that the goods correspond with it—I counted the firkins of butter that were in the van—the two that were missing were 33 and 45—I could not find those numbers—I took the numbers of all the firkins that remained—the one now produced is numbered 41—No. 33 has never been found—with the exception of those two numbers, the numbers were all progressive.</p>

On Thursday night, 14th February, I was on duty in Grange-road, Bermondsey, about a quarter to 8—I there saw the prisoner carrying a firkin on his shoulder—I saw him turn out of Page's-walk into Grange-road—I thought something was wrong, and turned and followed him—Page's-walk leads from Willow-walk and Swan-street—the Willow-walk station is in Page's-walk—I followed the prisoner, and</p>

               <p>just before I got up to him, he turned and saw me—he then threw down the firkin, and ran away—I distinctly saw his face—I was quite close to him when he had the firkin on his shoulder—I have not the slightest doubt about his being the man, I could pick him out of a thousand—it was close to the Pitt's Head public-house—there are three lamps outside there, besides the street lamp, and the lights from the windows—I ran about one hundred yards after him, and when I had got as I thought close enough to reach him, he dodged me round, and got away, but I saw his face again then—I next saw him on Saturday evening about 8 o'clock, in the Kent-road—I told him I wanted him for stealing the butter the other night—he made no answer—I took him to the station—he there gave the name of Daniel Hobden, Claren<lb></lb>don-street, Kent-street—he said he was a master carman, that he had got a bone and van of his own, and rented a stable in Paragon-mews, New Kent-road—I went to Paragon-mews—I did not find any stable or hone and cart belonging to the prisoner there—I saw the landlord—I went to Clarendon-street, and went to almost every house in the street, but could not hear the prisoner's name anywhere—he told me he did not know the number.</p>

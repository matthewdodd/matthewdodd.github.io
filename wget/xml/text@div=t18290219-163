            . I am an officer. On Sunday afternoon, I was looking for the prisoner about the former indictment, when the prosecutor gave me information, and on Monday evening, about eight o'clock, I saw him and the female prisoner in Golden-lane - he turned into Charity-alley, and I apprehended him; he asked what I wanted him for - I told him I should tell him by and by; when I got into Old-street the female prisoner followed us, and the man attempted to escape - I saw Fordham, and called him to my assistance; I then asked where he had dined yesterday - he then made a violent attempt to get away; I was compelled to carry him to the watch-house - I searched him, and found nothing on him; the female prisoner came to the watch-house, and I took her- I told the watch-house-keeper's wife to search her, and she produced to me a small purse, containing several duplicates - one for the watch pawned that day: she said at the office that she was married to the prisoner - she did not say how she came by the watch; the man gave his name as John Smith.</p>

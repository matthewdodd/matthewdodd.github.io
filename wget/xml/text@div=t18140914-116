Upon my return from Billingsgate, I made it known to Mr. Dill.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the house of the prisoner Hooper with a search warrant. I asked Hooper for the flour that Gibbs had brought in that morning, the 10th of 
               <persName id="t18140914-116-person1076">August. Hooper</persName>
             made no reply. I had a brother officer with me, and Mr. Dill. I repeated the question, and told Hooper that I had a search warrant, that he had better give it up. He told us it was in the drawer; he shewed us the drawer; the drawer was full; he had emptied the flour out of the sack in the drawer; he shewed us the sack, it was on a shelf; I asked him how much he had paid for it; he said, nothing. I told him to empty the flour into the sack, which he did. Mr. Dill said the sack was his; he gave no account how he came to receive it so soon in the morning; Hooper was then taken into custody. I afterwards took Gibbs into custody for stealing the flour. Gibbs denied the charge.</p>

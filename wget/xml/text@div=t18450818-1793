                  </hi>. I live in Southwark. On the night of the 13th of July, at half-past twelve o'clock, I was returning home—the deceased and the prisoner and two women were quarrelling in the street—I stopped to listen—they got to high words—the quarrel appeared to rest between the prisoner's wife and the deceased, the prisoner not saying a word—I heard the deceased call the prisoner's wife a b—y w—the prisoner then said, "If you call my wife a w—again, I will knock you down"—the word occurred again, and then the prisoner raised his arm, and the man fell—I assisted him up, and the prisoner assisted—I said, "You have killed the man"—he said, "I hope I have not"—I said, "You had better run fora doctor," which he did, and as we were taking the deceased to the hospital the doctor met us, and said, "Take him to the hospital directly."</p>

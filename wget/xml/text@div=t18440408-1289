                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">linendraper, Charles-street, Middlesex Hospital.</hi> On the 11th of April, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoner came and asked for a gentleman's hat-band—I referred her to Cole—in about three minutes Cole came to me, and stated something—I went round the counter, and saw a parasol under the prisoner's shawl—I said, "I must detain you, you have some of my property"—she made no reply—she was standing near the door—in a minute the parasol slid down on the floor—she said, "Oh dear me, it has hung to my shawl"—I replied, "That Is impossible, because you have got it underneath your shawl"—it had stood between five and six yards from where the prisoner stood.</p>

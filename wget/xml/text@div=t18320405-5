On the 18th of March I was on the road to Hammersmith, at half-past four o'clock in the morning - I met three men; they were coming in an opposite direction, but met me at the corner of the lanc - they came from a different road into the road where I was; one of them said, "Good morning to you;" which I returned - I walked on; they joined my company immediately, and were with me about five minutes - then they got behind me, and in about a minute they came up to me, one of them on my left side, and one on my right, and one kept a short distance behind me - they walked with me a considerable distance; one of the three, who was dressed in a black surtout coat and black trousers, took my watch out of my pocket, and one who gave his name James Boswell, struck me at the same time on my right arm, and exclaimed, "D-n you, where are you going?" and knocked me down - the one who drew my watch out ran across the fields, and the other two went in another direction; I lost sight of Boswell and the other - I followed the one who had my watch, but could not overtake him; I am sure Boswell is the man who struck me on the right arm - it was just break of day: the man who took my watch was of a very dark complexion, and very much pitted with the small-pox - he wore a black surtout coat and dark trousers; I saw Hancock at Hatton-garden on Monday last, and twice before that - the first time was the Saturday after the robbery, which happened on a Sunday; he was very much marked with the small-pox, and I thought he was the man, but he was not dressed the same way then.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. You have no means of knowing Hancock, except by his being marked with the small-pox? A. That is all - I do not swear to him; it was a very star-light morning, sufficient to see that the man was marked with the small-pox - the watch was gone before I was struck; they were all three marked with the small-pox.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Sunday, the 18th of March, about seven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner Hancock with another man named Thomas or James Boswell, (not the other prisoner) at the Green Dragon-yard, Holborn - I met a stranger in Holborn, who took me there; I went up to Hancock, and asked if he had not a watch in his possession - he told me he had, and that it was his own property; he took it out of his pocket, and gave it into my hands - I asked how he came by it; he said his mother gave it to him - he did not say when; he said his uncle, who lived in the house against which he was standing, would satisfy me the watch was his property; I told him he and the other must go with me to the station-house, to satisfy the inspector - they went willingly with me; I afterwards inquired if his uncle lived at the house, and found he did not - I was told so: they were afterwards taken before Mr. Laing, the Magistrate - Hancock was detained, and the other discharged; Hancock offered to leave the watch with me before I left the Green Dragon-yard.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183204050010"></xptr>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you the particular house his uncle lived in? A. The house he was standing against; it was not a pawnbroker's shop - he said his uncle's name was Brown; Mr. Brown did not live at that house - it is a respectable looking house; I inquired if there were any lodgers, and was told no such person lived there.</p>
               <p>EDMUND DAVIS. I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner Boswell on the 26th of March, in bed, at No. 43, Charles-street, Drury-lane, in consequence of information, on suspicion of this robbery - I asked if he knew a person named Hancock; he said No - I told him to dress, and asked where his brother was: he said he had no brother - I said nothing to him about the watch then, but at the station-house he was asked about the watch, and said he knew nothing about it; I was before Mr. Laing, but did not hear the prisoner say any thing; I do not know Mr. Laing's hand-writing.</p>

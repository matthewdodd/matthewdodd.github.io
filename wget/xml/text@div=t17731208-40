               <p>Q. When did you make these entries?</p>
               <p>Cleland.

I saw the prisoner about three o'clock on the Monday following, in the parlour at the Bank; Mr. Payne, a director of the Bank, asked me if I knew that person, meaning the prisoner; I said yes, he had received the money of me for that bill of Fludyer's. It was at this time proposed that he should go to his lodgings; Mr. Gines asked him, where is my money? or what have you done with my money? he answered he hoped he would have mercy and pity on him; he was an unfortunate man, and that his money was at his lodgings in Threadneedle-street, where he would go with the constable, and deliver it up; I went with him and the constable to his lodgings, the corner of Finch-lane; one of the constables asked him for the key of his box; he gave it him freely, and immediately upon the box being opened, he said the money was in the left hand corner, which it appeared to be; Mr. Atkinson took out a large canvas bag, and Spriggs, the constable, took out a handkerchief, which contained more of it; there was I think in all between six hundred and forty and six hundred and fifty pound; it was told over by one or two of the cashiers of the bank that were present; I went to the Mansion-house with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing being said about five guineas?</p>
               <p>Cleland. I believe there was; but I cannot recollect the particular words.</p>

               <p>Q. What is their firm?</p>
               <p>King. Fludyer, Marsh and Hudson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the firm always made use of in their bills?</p>
               <p>King. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think there is another partner since?</p>
               <p>King. Yes; Mr. Streatfield came in the 1st of October, but since that we have many bills drawn in the old firm, which are placed to the old account.</p>
               <p>Q In what manner did they usually accept their bills?</p>
               <p>King. Mess. Gines and Co. pay when due F M H.</p>
               <p>Counsel. That operated as an acceptance, and was an order to the banker to pay the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Who usually wrote Mess. Gines and Co. pay when due?</p>
               <p>King. I did generally.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080026"></xptr>Q. Who wrote F M H?</p>
               <p>King. Either Mr. Marsh or Mr. Hudson.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any correspondent of the name of Elliot?</p>
               <p>King. None that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any advice of such a bill as this?</p>
               <p>King. None that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this bill accepted at your house?</p>
               <p>King. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the words pay when due wrote by you?</p>
               <p>King. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is F M H either Mr. Marsh or Mr. Hudson's hand writing?</p>
               <p>King. The F M H is like Mr. Hudson's, but I look upon it not to be his hand writing; he very seldom accepts a bill after I have wrote upon it pay when due, especially of such a sum as this, without asking whether there is regular advice of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that pay when due an imitation of your hand writing?</p>
               <p>King. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first hear such a bill had been paid at Mess. Gines and Atkinson's?</p>
               <p>King. On Monday morning the 29th of November.</p>
               <p>(The bill was read in Court, which was exactly the same as set forth in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Q. How did you discover the bill had been paid?</p>
               <p>King. We always send for the bankers book on Monday morning, and I enter the bills that have been paid by them the preceeding week in our cash book; when I came to sort out these bills in their regular dates, I found among them this bill; it struck me immediately; I looked at the drawer; it appeared to be

I was sent for at three o'clock in the afternoon, and desired to go to the box-maker's, the corner of Finch-lane; I was informed they had a man in custody; I went there; neither Mr. Gines nor Mr. Atkinson were there. I saw the prisoner first of all, just come out of the Bank, in custody of the constables; we went to his lodgings; when we got up into his room, Spriggs, the constable, asked him for the key of his trunk; he gave it him, and said the money was in the left hand corner, and he said the money was the property of Mess. Gines and Co.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was the money found in the lodgings?</p>
               <p>King. Between six and seven hundred pounds. There was some money in a paper produced by the constable, but Alderman Crosby thought the prisoner might as well have it delivered to him.</p>

I am constable of the Bank: I was sent for by the governor, or some gentlemen of the Bank, to the Half Moon tavern; I took the prisoner from thence to the Bank; Mr. Atkinson was there before Mr. Gines; the prisoner was applying to the governor for mercy; the governor said there is the injured person, meaning Mr. Atkinson; the prisoner kneeled down, and said he was an unfortunate young man, and he begged for mercy. Some little time after this Mr. Gines came in; the prisoner supplicated him also for mercy; Mr. Gines said, where is my money? the prisoner said what he had got of it was in his trunk at his lodgings, and he was very ready to deliver it up; we went to his lodgings; I asked him for the key of his trunk; he took it out of his pocket and gave it me; I opened the trunk; Mr. Atkinson took out a canvas bag, and I took out a handkerchief with some more money; it lay in the left hand corner of the trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cleland. I think you said he came to Mess. Gines and Atkinson's between two and three o'clock, was he drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Cleland. Apparently quite sober.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, I had no intention to defraud any body; I was totally a stranger to any forgery at the time the money was received; I was very much in liquor; I went to the King's Arms tavern; the witness here that happened to see me advised me to go to my lodgings. Two people, one dressed in a silver laced hat, a brown coat and boots, and pretended he was a stranger in town, pulled out several bills drawn on copper plate check; he had to the amount of two or three thousand pounds; he presented this bill to me, and asked if I knew where Gines and Atkinson lived; I told them their office was in Lombard-street; one asked me to shew him the place; I will not be positive that I did not go in, I was very much in liquor; I was at the Half Moon tavern in Gracechurch-street all the forenoon, and was very much intoxicated; I went with one of them; they gave me the Bank note; they said it was very good, it is proved by the clerks I was very much in liquor; the gentleman says I was so drunk I could not count it; on the morrow morning I was sober; I must have been either out of my mind, or some sad fatality must have attended me to have gone and received this money after the forgery. I had the greatest opportunity of absconding: I could have got off by water; I have not been above seven or eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080029"></xptr> weeks in town from America; I know nothing of the parties of the drawer or indorser; as soon as they said there was a mistake in the Bank, I was all of a tremble; I had suspected nothing of it before, for I was to have seen one of these persons; I was to have gone on the Saturday morning to see him; after I had been with that gentleman in the Red Lion, Sweeting's-alley, I parted with this Mr. - who has given evidence; I did not know what I had done with the bill I was so intoxicated; I got it from him on Sunday; on Monday I was quite sober; when I went there, there were several clerks of the Bank knew me, and shook hands with me; I met a clerk of the Bank, whose name I do not recollect, that asked me if I had received the money at the Bank; I said I had not, but intended at the time. The twenty pound note was filled up in my own name; whatsoever name I might put upon it when intoxicated with liquor I know not; a person said his name is Leigh, he is an honest worthy man, I know him very well, and so they gave me this draught, and on the Monday morning I received this money. My Lord, and gentlemen of the Jury, I have very little more to say; I leave it to my counsel, who I dare say will explain the matter in such a manner that I doubt not will convince you that I had no intention to defraud any body: there are several gentlemen here that know me, that will speak to my character, that I never was brought to a bar before, and this is owing entirely to intoxication.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about six years.</p>
               <p>Q. What character has he in general?</p>
               <p>Lewis. He bore an exceeding good character; I remember seeing him on Saturday was fortnight in Exchange-alley; that was the first time I saw him since I went to the East Indies; then he went I believe to America, in the employ of some merchants in Crutched Friars; I saw him talking to two gentlemen; he asked me to go and drink a glass of wine; I refused; he was so intoxicated with liquor that I thought it not prudent.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Between twelve and two o'clock; I advised him to go home; I asked where he lodged; he said in Threadneedle-street; I observed a man stood at a distance as if he waited for him, dressed in brown clothes and boots, and had a silver laced hat slapped before, and he had his own brown hair clubbed behind; Mr. Leigh went into the King's Arms passage; I waited till he came out; they wanted him to go with them towards Lombard-street; I went to the 'Change, and returned again; I was afraid he was fell into the hands of sharpers that wanted to take him in; I saw him go along with them towards Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I collect debts for trades men and make out bills.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Lewis. In Old Bethlem.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Leigh?</p>
               <p>Lewis. About six years.</p>
               <p>Q. I thought you had been acquainted with him at sea?</p>
               <p>Lewis. He went to North America and I to the East Indies.</p>
               <p>Q. You have used the sea?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Yes, sometime ago.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have been settled in Old Bethlem about six years?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, my wife has; I have been there about four years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any particular reason to recollect the hour you saw him?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It was between twelve and two.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it might not be after two?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I am sure it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the hour?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think that these gentlemen were sharpers? it was not by being in 'Change alley you thought them so I suppose?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Not by that, but their dress, and they seemed to be inclined to have him into their company when he was in liquor; I thought they wanted to take the advantage of him.</p>
               <p>Q Did you hear any conversation?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No particular conversation.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they dressed that they looked like sharpers?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Brown clothes, a silver laced hat and boots.</p>
               <p>Q. I hope you do not look upon every body<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080030"></xptr> dressed in brown clothes, a laced hat and boots, to be sharpers?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I looked upon it they were going to take an advantage of him; it is generally the case with people that have the appearance of gentlemen to take the advantage of a man of property.</p>
               <p>Q. Now if you apprehended he had got into the hands of two sharpers, how came you not to stay with him?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I went upon the Change and came about again, and one of them was along with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you apprehending this man to be in company with sharpers that wanted to make a property of him, would it not have been kind in you to have staid with him?</p>
               <p>Lewis. I thought it would have been impertinent.</p>
               <p>Q. Not at all, when you saw him in the hand of sharpers.</p>
               <p>Lewis. I judged them to be such, and believe they were so.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no conversation with them?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No.</p>
               <p>Q Nor did not hear them say any thing?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to think they wanted to go to Lombard-street?</p>
               <p>Lewis. Mr. Leigh told me after I came back the second time, they wanted him to go to Lombard-street with them.</p>

            , in Crutched Friars. The prisoner came to us under the best recommendation, in the year 1768; he continued till 1770: he behaved with the strictest honesty, and I had the most perfect confidence in him. About that time he began to relax in his attendance; upon enquiring into the reason of it, I found that he had been drunk; I complained to him, and he said it was very true; that when he had fallen into some company he had lately connected himself with, they were too prevalent with him. He was sensible that his situation with us would not allow his continuance, but, as he was perfectly honest, I told him the wisest step he could take was to go abroad. I hope your lordship will forgive me this detail; I am really anxious for the prisoner, and his father, who is a very worthy man. As soon as he came into the proposition of going abroad, I engaged Mr. Neeve, a merchant of considerable eminence in the North American trade, to take him under his patronage.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he in America?</p>
               <p>Ryland. He is in London, but has a son in America. The prisoner's friends supplied him with one or two hundred pounds; that, with what little matter he had saved, furnished him a cargo, and he went thither under the patronage, and with the friendship of Mr. Neeve; from that time till now I heard he was going on well; I believe there are some gentlemen in Court that will vouch for his good behaviour in North America; I hope so: I never had the least suspicion that he wanted principle or honesty during the years 1768, 1769, and 1770, that he remained with us; when he went from us I believe he was a perfectly honest man. With regard to the forgery now before the Court, from any thing I know of his hand, I think him as incapable of forgery as a plowman, or an infant, and for this plain reason, it was his interest, and I am sure his inclination, to write a better character than he did, a more flowing agreeable mercantile character; he took pains, as my partner was dissatisfied with the aukward hand he wrote, and endeavoured to mend it, but to no purpose. I believe any gentleman who is acquainted with hand writing, would, from an inspection of his hand, be of opinion that he is not the man that is able to perform a forgery; he appears to me, who sat at the desk with him many months, incapable of what I should call an imitative power in writing, so that I am afraid, if he is justly chargeable with this crime, it is in connection with other persons, and when he is drunk, I am told, he is liable to be imposed on by any body. While I have the honour to stand before the magistracy of this great city, allow me to add, my lord, that I have much reason to believe this poor wretch, now trembling before you, owes the origin of his misery to vile disputing alehouse clubs, where the rights of magistracy, and the first principles of morality and religion have been controverted; young fellows sit there and get a habit of hearing, without horror or shame, vice palliated, human government decried, and the attributes of God himself blasphemed.</p>

            . I became acquainted with the prisoner in New York; I went from Boston to New York in the month of April 1771, and I fancy it might be two or three months before<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177312080031"></xptr> I was acquainted with Mr. Leigh; it was at a public house where our acquaintance first began; he was universally known in the first place as a very good natured generous man, hospitable to every body that came from his country. I found he was a merchant of eminence; his general character, as I have learned by being in company with people of his acquaintance, was such, that they were so far convinced of his honour and honesty, that when they meant to speak of a man's character, they would say, I with he was as honest as

            ; he was universally esteemed, and if New York was as near London as York is in this kingdom, I dare say he would have two-thirds of the inhabitants to speak to his character.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe him capable of such a crime as this?</p>
               <p>Lamb. No, I do not think so; I was told of it at New York coffee house; I said it is impossible, for he is one of the most honest creatures that ever broke bread; I went to his lodgings to convince them of the contrary; I was sorry to find there, that what they told me was true. Mr. Leigh's house was in the firm of Leigh and Price; Mr. Leigh was the first partner; he took a man into partnership with him, through his good nature, that he was unconnected with, that he never saw but by accident at New York; he had brought over a little cargo of cloth, and offered them to Mr. Leigh: Price appeared a feasible man; the consequence was, a partnership was struck up; in the course of business, and just before I left New York, this Price proved himself a contrary man to the honest Mr. Leigh; one night when Leigh did not lie at home, he packed up a vast quantity of goods and absconded; the next morning Mr. Leigh pursued him. There was a Dr. Edgar, a man of eminence in the physical way, and one or two more with him; they caught him in the Jerseys and brought him back to New York, and the law took its proper course; Mr. Price was arrested, and put into prison; Mr. Leigh unsollicited went to Mr. Haake, who I believe they owed eight hundred pounds to; said he, this affair is shocking and horrid, I will not have the least imputation of being privy in the least to it, take all my effects and all the money I have; he gave every thing up unsollicited and generously: the whole town was pleased at his conduct, and he had assistance from every body; this I look upon as a very great proof of his honesty; I can say farther, that he has often been taken in for trifles by his good nature, and especially if he got a little intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Counsel for the crown. He gave up every thing?</p>
               <p>Lamb. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had no property of his own?</p>
               <p>Lamb. No.</p>
               <p>Q. These were partnership debts I suppose?</p>
               <p>Lamb. Yes; as Mr. Price was an utter stranger and taken in against all his friends at New York, nobody would give Price credit.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not agreeable to the practice of the Court to enter into particular stories, but I am very unwilling in a case of this sort to stop a witness.</p>
               <p>Lamb. I did not mean to say that he came from New York without any property.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he came away?</p>
               <p>Lamb. About five months; but I understand always after that he had remittances from home.</p>

               <p>Leese. No; he wrote a very particular hand, like an attorney's hand; it is the last thing I should think of; I do not think him capable of a forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that ( giving him a piece of writing) is that his hand writing?</p>
               <p>Leese. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on Monday morning the 29th of November?</p>
               <p>Leese. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay you any money?</p>
               <p>Leese. Yes, ten guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear from the prisoner of his paying money to Marsh and Read?</p>
               <p>Leese. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober when he paid you the money?</p>
               <p>Leese. He appeared to be sober.</p>

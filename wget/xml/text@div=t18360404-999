                  </hi>. I am servant at the British Museum Tavern, Great Russell-street. On the 8th of March, in the evening, between nine and ten o'clock, Mr. Kenzie had just left the tap-room, where he had been sitting—the prisoner was there also—the prosecutor had been there about two hours—they were strangers to each other, but were sitting alongside of each other—I did not know the prisoner before—I had known Mr. M'Kenzie—Mr. M'Kenzie had retired for a minute or two, and when he was away, I saw the prisoner take up the umbrella and walk away—he had paid of what he had—I went to ask Mr. M'Kenzie if he had brought an umbrella—he said, "Yes"—I then went and overtook him—I told him he had taken a gentleman's umbrella—he turned round, mumbled something, and was going on—I said, "Stop, give me this umbrella"—Mr. M'Kenzie then came up and gave him in charge—I am quite sure the prisoner did not bring an umbrella with him—I saw him come in.</p>

               <p>Yes your friend came in first—neither of you brought an umbrella.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. When you came to me, you said, "You have taken a gentleman's umbrella"—I said, "My God! have I? I beg your pardon."</p>

                  </hi>. I hold a situation under Government. I went to the tavern, and sat near the prisoner—I took an umbrella—I retired, and was told my umbrella was gone—I had entered into conversation with the prisoner—I saw my umbrella was gone—I went out in pursuit of the prisoner, and overtook him—the lad had stopped him—I asked him what business he had with my umbrella; what right he had to take it away—he said he did not take it with any felonious intent—he used those words—we</p>

               <p>drank in the same room—I cannot say that we toasted reach other—we conversed together perhaps an hour and a half—I should say he was not at all intoxicated—I was perfectly sober—I was drinking beer, I had had perhaps two pints, but no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. We drank together, and you solicited me to sing a song—you were drunk, decidedly drunk, and I accommodated you to the best of my power with two songs. Witness. He did sing—he said, "This is my umbrella."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I met a friend in the Haymarket—we walked together under an umbrella very much like this—I was going to Conduit-street—stopped at several places, and had a pint of ale probably in each place—I was not intoxicated, but might be perhaps a little elevated—wear called at this house, and I think we had only one pint of half-and-half—we stopped there perhaps an hour, certainly not an hour and a half—I stopped outside perhaps a minute after my friend left—as to whether I took my umbrella into the house, I cannot say—as to stealing a thing from any person, I never had such a thought in my head.</p>

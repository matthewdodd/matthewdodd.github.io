On 21st Aug., I resided at 30, Essex-street, Kingsland-road, and had done so about a year and a half—I have known the prisoner about twelve months, and I have been in bis company I think three or four times, and have drunk with him—there is a person lodges in the same house, named Adelaide Dowdney; I have drunk with the prisoner in company with her—on Tuesday evening, 21st Aug., I was walking up the Kingsland-road, between seven and eight o'clock, and met the prisoner—he spoke, asked me if I would take any refreshment—I said, "Thank you, Sir, I will"—he asked me whether we should have it out, or whether we should walk home and have it—I said I would rather have it at home—I walked home with Mm to 30, Essex-street, and went into the front parlour—he then asked my landlady, Martha Wilton, what she would take to drink—she said a little brandy, as brandy was a good thing for the cholera—he asked her to bring what quantity of brandy she thought proper, and gave her a piece of paper folded up; I did not see what it was, he said it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, she must get it changed, as he had no small change; while she was gone Dowdney came through the room—Wilton went out, with the paper in her hand—she</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 30, Essex-street, Kingsland-road. Bird and Dowdney live with me—they have both been with me about two years, as near as I can guess—they are unfortunate girls—about eight o'clock on 21st Aug. I remember Bird bringing home a man—the prisoner has the appear<lb></lb>ance of that man—I cannot swear to his face—he sat in the parlour in a way that I could not recognise his face—he sat as if he were in pain—the cholera was then very much about—after I returned with the brandy he wished for some hot water, and I was afraid he was seized with the cholera or cramp, as he sat with his head down—I believe the prisoner is the person; I have no doubt of it—I will not swear to him by his face; he appears very much like the person by the way he stands—when he and Bird came in, they went into the front parlour—he asked me what we would take to drink—I said, "What he thought proper"—he said, "I had better go and fetch a pint, or hal fa pint, or what I thought proper and brandy, "and he handed me a paper folded up in four—he said it was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and he would thank me to get it changed—I left him with Bird, and went to Mr. Smith's, the Carpenters' Arms, at the corner of Essex-street—Williams, the bar-man, served me with the brandy, and I gave him the note—the potboy Stiggins was there, and Williams directed him to take the note to get it changed, and he went out with it—he returned, gave what he had got for the note to Williams, and he gave me the change 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. after deducting for the brandy—when I got back I found Bird sitting with the man in the same way as before, as if he were in pain—I counted the change, put it on the table, and the prisoner took it up and put it in his pocket—he wished to take some hot water with the brandy; I poured it out—he would not take that, and asked Bird to light a fire, and get a little water—she went away for that purpose, and I stayed with the prisoner while she was gone; and before she returned, the prisoner said he had a gentleman waiting outside for him—he thought it was ungentlemanly to let any one stand in the street—I said, it was, and he said, "I think I will go and fetch him in"—I said, "Will you allow me to go?"—he said, "No, I will go myself, and by the time the water is hot I will return"—he went outside—I went to the street-door—he walked</p>

               <p>as though he was in pain, he was so doubled up—he went to the corner of Pleasant-street, and there appeared to speak to a man rather shorter than himself, and they either went into the corner door of Mr. Smith's, or into the Kingsland-road—I saw no more of him that night—he had taken none of the brandy; it was on the table near an hour—the note I had taken to Smith's came back to me as a forged note, on the Friday week following, the 31st—on that Friday, Bird went out on an errand for me, and while she was gone, between seven and eight, a young man came with a message to me; in consequence of which, I went to the top of Basing-place, Kingsland-road, and found Mary Bird there—she made a statement to me, and I saw a policeman whose name I do not know, and I told him something in consequence of what Bird said to me—I stayed with Bird till about nine, I think, and then left her there—she waited about there till two in the morning, and I was backwards and forwards with different things—I desired her not to move at all—she was watching—I should say she came home at very near two in the morning—I was in bed, but had been in bed a very little time—on the Saturday week following I was again fetched by a policeman, and went to the station-house in Robert-street, Kingsland-road, and there saw Bird and the prisoner—I cannot say that I knew the prisoner's face again—Bird had given him in charge in Hackney-road—at the station he was given in charge by both of us, in a manner—Bird was positive he was the man—I cannot swear to him, but I think he is the man; he appears very much like the man by his way of standing, and by his build altogether.</p>

On Saturday night, 8th Sept., about half-past eight o'clock, I was on duty in the Hackney-road, near Great Cam<lb></lb>bridge-street, and saw the prisoner passing along with a female and several other parties—there was a crowd, and I went up to see what the bother was—the prisoner came up to me and said he would give Mary Bird in charge for following and annoying him—she said, "No, I will not go on; I am determined to follow him, for he gave my landlady a forged note"—the pri<lb></lb>soner said he did not know anything of her—she went to the Robert-street station, followed by the prisoner, who gave her in charge for annoying him—she accused him of uttering a forged note to her landlady—she requested Mrs. Wilton to be sent for; I fetched her—she said she believed the prisoner to be the man; he was very much like him—I went back to Essex-street and fetched Dowdney—she was positive of him—Godfrey asked the prisoner his same, and he gave his proper name and address, 17, Hackney-grove—he was searched, and a bunch of keys, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and two cigars, were found on him—I searched the house, which was an empty one which he had charge of, and found two pocket-books; one, a very large one, was in a writing-desk—I am not positive of the colour of them, being candle-light—(<hi rend="italic">two red pocket-books were here produced</hi>)—I believe one of these to be one, but I thought the other was a much larger one, the one found in the desk.</p>

I tell you you are mistaken; what night was it?"—she repeated the same night, I think it was the previous Thursday, he said, "I can prove where</p>

               <p>I was that night"—she said it was in the Kingsland-road, but did not name any particular part—I refused to take the prisoner's charge against Bird, and sent Porter for Mrs. Wilton—he returned with her—I said, "Do you recol<lb></lb>lect a forged note being uttered to you?"—she said, "I do"—I said, "Look round this station and see whether you see the man here"—she looked at the prisoner, and said, "That is the man I am positive; I should not like to swear to him, but I am positive it is him, I could not see his face distinctly, because he held his head down"—Adelaide Dowdney was sent for; she came, and I said to her, "Do you recollect a forged note being passed at your land-lady's house?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "Do you see the man here?"—she turned round, and said, "Yes, that is him," pointing out the prisoner, who was standing by himself—at least there were two or three policemen and the female witnesses—upon that, I took the charge against the prisoner.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. Fay, upholsterer, Shoreditch. The prisoner generally passed there on his way to the office—on 8th Aug., about half-past six, he spoke to me about a bedstead which he had bought—I believe his wife was at a little distance from him, but I did not see her that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 24, Caroline-place, Kingsland, and work for Mr. Mordan, the silver pencil-maker. I am the prisoner's brother-in-law—he and his wife called at my mother's about seven o'clock on the evening of 8th Aug. (two of my sisters were then at Dorking) they remained about a quarter of an hour—I went home with them for a parcel and a pair of gloves, which my sister had left behind previous to her going to Dorking—I remained with them till ten o'clock—we had supper, and they were going to bed when I left—there was nobody else there but the children—I should say it is two or three miles from there to Mile-end, but I do not know the place.</p>

Mordan's eleven or twelve years—I left last July, as they were very slack—they will take me back when they have work—I have been living at home with my parents ever since—my father has been head waiter at Copenhagen House seventeen years—the turn<lb></lb>ing to Basing-place is five or six doors from Caroline-place, where we live—coming from the Shoreditch station along the Kingsland-road, you come to Basing-place first, and Caroline-place is the next turning—we got to my bro<lb></lb>ther-in-law's about twenty minutes or half-past seven o'clock—I was first called on to be a witness here at the last examination before the Magistrate, previous to the depositions being taken—I was in attendance twice—I heard bail offered for the prisoner—I knew where he was on 8th Aug., but was not examined—no witnesses were examined—we are six in family—three of us were at home on 8th Aug.—we thought it was not necessary to call the others—Basing-place is no thoroughfare—there are almshouses at the bottom—there is no way of getting from there to Caroline-place—the yards of the houses in Basing-place adjoin those in Caroline-place, but the walls are twelve or thirteen feet high—a person could not very well get over, and even then he would have to get through a house as well.</p>

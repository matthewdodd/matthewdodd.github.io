On the 8th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was at the White Bear public-house - I had been taken ill at my work, went in there and sat down; the prisoner came in and sat by me - I had never seen her before - I had half a pint of beer in my hand - she was kind to me, and said she would see me home; I declined that; she offered again, and went home with me to my lodgings - she said I had better lay down as I was poorly; I did so, and fell asleep, leaving her to mind the room - I awoke in about an hour and she was gone - I missed my bonnet and these other things off a line - I found her about eight o'clock the next night, sitting in the same public-house, with my bonnet on; she said she had bought it of me, and had left her own in the room - there was no bonnet left there - I have found nothing else.</p>

                  </hi>. I am aft errand boy, of No. 49, King-street, West<lb></lb>minster. On Monday afternoon, 26th March, I was coining up Queen-street, Cheapside, and saw the prisoner, and a taller person, at the corner of Cannon-street—the prisoner had hold of the back of a costermonger's barrow—they ran it against a van which was going on, and then the other one laid hold of a barrel which was at the tail of the van, and pulled it into the barrow which the prisoner was wheeling—they followed the van to the corner of Bow-lane, where there is a large stack of bricks—I then told a policeman, who caught hold of the prisoner as he was going down Bow-lane—I was not alone, but I was a little behind the other witness.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 3, St. Helen's-place, Lower Whitecross-street. On this Monday I was near the corner of Cannon-street and Queen-street—Macefield came up and spoke to me, and I saw the prisoner and another one wheeling a barrow, which they <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> underneath the axle<lb></lb>trees of the van—the other one took a barrel from the van, and put it into the barrow—they afterwards ran the barrow up against a stack of bricks—the other man ran away, and as the prisoner was going down Bow-lane the policeman took him.</p>

               <p>bricks and a boarding—I collared him, and said, "Does that barrow and barrel belong to you?"—he said, "No; it belongs to the one who has gone round the corner"—I took him back to the barrow, and told the boy to bring the carman back—he came back, and recognised the barrel as having been on his van—the prisoner said he was employed by the one who had gone round the corner—I asked him if he was employed to assist him in getting the barrel off the van—he said that he knew nothing about that.</p>

On Monday, 26th March, I was driving a van up King-street, with six barrels in it, which I had loaded at Billingsgate—I missed one of them directly the boys called to me, and saw it on the barrow—I had not given leave to anybody to put a barrow on my van.</p>

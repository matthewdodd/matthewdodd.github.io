            . On the 22nd of December, the dowlas was at the door. I accidentally went to the door; I saw the prisoner going along with a bundle on his shoulder; I asked the prisoner where he was going with that on his shoulder; he said, a person gave it him, if it was mine I might have it. I said, I must take you too. I took him; he let the dowlas fall on my arm; a gentleman took the dowlas who is present.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. That is my dowlas; it has my mark at the end.</p>

            . I am a widow, and live in Portman-place, Edgware-road. On the 15th of March, about two o'clock, this property was in my garden, which has a wall on each side and palings: the wall is about six feet high, and the palings at the end about a foot higher - the person who took the property must have got over the fence at the corner; the prisoners were brought in immediately after it was missed - there were other things on the lines, which were not taken.</p>

            . I am a stone-mason, and live at Chelsea. I was looking for work near Portman-place on the 15th of March, I heard a cry of Stop thief! and the prisoner, Duxberry, passed me running - I stopped him as he was running, he pulled off his hat, and a shirt dropped from it. I brought him back, and picked up the shirt; he was about two hundred yards from Mrs. Fowler's. I took him to Mrs. Fowler's. I saw Sturdy run another way; he was stopped by Kelloway.</p>

            . I live in Egerton-cottage, Elgware-road. I was in my own room, which is about one hundred and fifty yards from Mrs. Fowler's, on the 15th of March, and saw the two prisoners coming together across the field; they went to the back of the fence, looked through the palings, and then Duxberry got on the fence and took a shirt off the line, which he drew over and gave to Sturdy; he then got over the fence, and took some other things; Sturdy tied them up in a handkerchief. I got toward them and cried</p>
               <p>"Stop thief!" I pursued Sturdy, and a carpenter stopped him, and delivered him to me: he had dropped the bundle, which I took up - it contained two shirts, which I delivered to Mrs. Fowler.</p>

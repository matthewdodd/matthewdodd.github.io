                  </hi>. I am potman at the White Hart, Ossulton Street, Euston Road—on Saturday night, 31st January, about 10 or 11 o'clock, I was called upstairs to turn the prisoner out in the execution of my duty—while doing so, she tried to stab my master, I jumped in front of him and caught the stab in my neck—the prisoner ran away, I followed her, she escaped then, but I found her about twenty minutes afterwards in the Euston Road, and charged her with stabbing me—she said she had not been in the house—I gave her in charge—I did not see anything in her hand while she was struggling with my master.</p>

I am landlord of the White Hart—on Saturday night, 31st January, about 10 or 11 o'clock, the prisoner was at my bar—I had refused to serve her several times before, and she said if I did not serve her she meant to knife me—she had a penknife in her hand, with a sharp open blade—I went round the bar to turn her out, and called the potman to assist me; I caught her hand with the knife in it, and told the potman to take hold of her other hand—at the door she got her hand loose and made a dart at me and caught him in the neck—she then ran out, I followed her, but she ran through a house and was not taken till half-an-hour afterwards—she was not drunk—I had been cautioned by a policeman that she meant to knife me for refusing to serve her; I am obliged to refuse such characters to keep my house respectable.</p>

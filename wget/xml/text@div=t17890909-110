               <p>That was not in the hearing of the prisoner? - In the hearing and presence of the prisoner; the gentleman said he would call between one and four to give me an answer.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long might you be up stairs do you think? - I suppose not more than ten minutes.</p>
               <p>After these gentlemen were gone away, how soon did you discover that any thing had been taken away? - An hour and a half before we missed any thing.</p>
               <p>What did you first miss? - Our cloaks, that led us to a further examination, and we missed the other articles of the plate.</p>
               <p>Where had these things been before the prisoner and his companion came to your house? - In the front parlour, the plate was in a beaufet, the key was in the door, and the cloaks were hanging upon cloak pins in the room; I saw them there not five minutes before the gentlemen came to look at the lodging, for I went to fetch the tea cups out of the beaufet; so that I am positive they were there; I am sure they were there.</p>
               <p>How was the door of this front parlour left when you went up stairs? - It was shut but not fastened; there was no fastening at all.</p>
               <p>How long was you absent up stairs? - I dare say we might be ten minutes in going up and coming down, for I asked the gentleman in green, if he would like to look at our first floor; it was let, but the gentleman was out of town; I dare say ten minutes were the outside.</p>
               <p>Upon your missing these things were any steps taken to recover them? - Mr. Yates went to Mr. Booth an attorney in Craven-street.</p>
               <p>I believe you did not see any person that you suspected until the Sunday following? - No, Sir, I was in Kensington-gardens when I saw a person that I suspected; Mr. and Mrs. Yates and me were walking in Kensington-gardens, I think it might be about half after seven on the Sunday evening, two gentlemen passed us, a gentleman in blue and a gentleman in green again; I immediately said to Mr. Yates, good God, says I, that is the man that robbed your house.</p>
               <p>Did you say the man or men? - No, the man, because the other was not one of them that came.</p>
               <p>What coloured coat had the man on you saw in Kensington-gardens? - A blue coat.</p>
               <p>Then you took that to be the same man that had been in a blue coat at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And it was the prisoner? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he strike you on the first sight? - He was past the length of this court and more, we met, and they passed us; Mr. Yates said, if you think so, I will turn back<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090130"></xptr>and see, for Sir Sampson Wright has told me I had a right to take him; we immediately followed them, and as soon as they saw us, they turned out of the gardens immediately; they were going towards the palace, when we first followed them.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there not an entrance to the gardens at the palace, and at this end? - There are several entrances; they came in at one gate, and we at the other; so we met; they were going in a direction towards the palace; we turned about and followed them, they perceived us follow them, and they immediately turned round, to come out of the gardens, at Hyde-park.</p>
               <p>How long had you been going in that course, towards them, before you observed them to turn? - About twice the length of the Court; then they turned; as soon as they perceived us to follow them, they turned to come out of the gardens; but we turned after them; they turned to go short out of the gardens, and we walked by the side of them, and they passed us; we followed them; they went sometimes slow and sometimes fast; we had a hard matter to follow them, that was Mrs. Yates and me had; we met Mr. Watson, and then Mr. Yates determined on speaking to them; Mr. Watson joined Mr. Yates; I heard what Mr. Yates first said to him, when he spoke to him; he tapped him on the shoulder, and said, pray was you at my house on Tuesday night last? the prisoner said, I at your house! I never was at your house in my life: by that time there were numbers of people gathered round us; and the prisoner began to be in a passion, and swore a good deal.</p>
               <p>Had there at that time been any explanation made by Mr. Yates, about the errand upon which he came, or any thing of that kind? - No, Sir, not the least in the world; I said to the prisoner, Sir, you have been at our house several times, for I have often opened the door to you, some time ago; to which he made me no answer.</p>
               <p>Was that true, that you had seen him several times at your house? - Yes, Sir, it might have been four months before.</p>
               <p>How many times do you think you might have opened the door to him? - Four or five times.</p>
               <p>Upon what occasion was it that you opened the door to him before? - Mr. Newman had come to wish to buy some goods of Mr. Yates, for Mr. Yates to take a note from him.</p>
               <p>Are you now stating that from the information of Mr. Yates, or from your own knowledge? - From my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was you present at any time, when the prisoner applied to you or any body else, to this business? - For buying the goods; Mr. Newman has said to me he came to do some business with Mr. Yates; people leave their messages with me when Mr. Yates is not at home.</p>
               <p>What message did he leave? - That he would call the next morning, to look at the goods.</p>
               <p>So that you collected from the conversation, that that was some transaction about goods? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you saw the person in the passage, below, either when you went up stairs, or before you came down again; had you any recollection that you had seen his face before? - Not when I went up; he was not dressed so clean as he used to be, when I saw him; when I came to let him out at the street door, then I recollected that he was the person I had opened the door to before.</p>

               <p>Did you mention that to any body, when you missed your goods? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Why did not you? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you know him by name, when he came to the house; did he leave his name? - If he left his name, I forgot it.</p>
               <p>Did it never occur to you to say, that you thought one of the men that robbed the house, was a man that you had seen before: had you described the man by any token; such as that he was the man that came for goods, or that he had been there before? - No, I never particularly stated that matter, till we met him in the gardens; not that he was the man that came for the goods; because when he came for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090131"></xptr>the goods, a Mr. Atkinson always came with him, who generally spoke to me about the goods.</p>
               <p>What did you say about it, to Mr. Yates, before you was in Kensington gardens, about your knowledge of the men? - Why Sir, I do not know; in the course of the week there were several things that passed about such a thing as that; I cannot tell what had occurred to Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>You stated to the prisoner at Hyde Park, that he had several times been at your house? - Yes, the prisoner did not say any thing more to Mr. Yates; he used him very ill with his tongue, shook his stick at him, and said he would put a rod in brine for him to-morrow; the prisoner then and his brother walked off to go to Hyde-park (I afterwards understood that it was his brother that was with him); they walked out of Hyde-park, and we after them; and through the Green-park, and into St. James's-park; there Mr. Watson and Mr. Yates met the prisoner again in St. James's-park; they went down Piccadilly; and we went down the Green-park.</p>
               <p>Why did not you continue following them? - I do not know; we went into the Green-park, and so into St. James's Park, knowing that they were going along Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>How long had you been in St. James's Park, before you met the prisoner and his brother? - I never saw any more of them, till I saw them at Craven-street; at the top of Piccadilly we parted.</p>
               <p>How soon after that did you see the prisoner? - It might be an hour and an half after I left them, that I saw the prisoner again in company with his brother and Mr. Yates, and Mr. Watson and Mr. Reilly, and the constable; Mr. Burke was not in the room; he was in the passage; he did not immediately go in the parlour; I went into the dining-room.</p>
               <p>What more passed between you and him, or from him in your hearing? - Mr. Burke called me down stairs, to go into the parlour; and the prisoner said to me when I went into the parlour, Madam, I should be glad to know from you, what I am brought here for? I said, Sir, you certainly know what you are brought here for; he said, I know! I wish to know it from you? I said, Sir, I do not think I am a proper person to relate to you, what you are brought here for; but you will hear it from some person that is proper; the prisoner said that he hoped I did not mean to hurt his character; and that he wished to come there to clear his character; and to know what he was brought there for, was what he came for; and he waited to know it; I do not recollect that he said anything more to me at that time; I left him talking to Mr. Reilly; and Mr. Booth was come by that time; but he was not in the parlour with the prisoner; he was in the passage, waiting to speak to me; his brother spoke to me; the prisoner was in the parlour; I should suppose he must hear it.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt he did hear it? - I should suppose he did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding, Prisoner's Counsel. Was he attending to you? - Yes; his brother walked with me to the other end of the room; and said, for God's sake, you will not hang my brother, will you? I said, I want nothing from your brother in the world, but to restore to my friends what he has taken from them; I said nothing more to him at that time; I went out of the room, and left them all in the parlour; and a good many people were gathered together; they continued together more than an hour in Mr. Yates's house.</p>
               <p>What were they doing? - Talking; I was not in the room; I went up stairs and got my supper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did you at any time; hear the prisoner say where he was at the time this robbery was committed? - Yes, several times after, I heard him say several places where he was.</p>
               <p>When did you first hear him say anything about it; and where did he describe himself to have been? - In the lock-up house.</p>
               <p>Where was it that he first mentioned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090132"></xptr>where he was at that day? - In Craven-street; on the Sunday evening, I heard the prisoner say, (Mr. Burke asked him if he would give an account of himself, where he was on the Tuesday evening,) that he should immediately be at liberty; for that was all Mr. Yates wanted to know; the prisoner said in answer, good God, he could not recollect particularly where he was; and he said oh! it is very apropos, I was at the lock-up-house from Tuesday, about three; I think he said, till the Wednesday, at eleven; Mr. Yeates immediately went out, to enquire at the lock-up-house if it was true; I forgot the lock-up-house.</p>
               <p>Was it Laver's? - Yes, it was; Mr. Yates had not been gone more than five minutes; he was only got to No. 3, when the prisoner recollected himself, and said, oh! good God, it was Tuesday fortnight I was there, go for Mr. Yates to come back with all the embarrassment in the world.</p>
               <p>I believe, in point of fact, it turns out that on the Tuesday fortnight he was there? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is so I am instructed, therefore your Lordship may take it so.</p>

            . The prisoner immediately sent for Mr. Yates, when he recollected that; he came back; he seemed confused, and said he was very sorry he could not recollect any other place he was at; he walked about the room quite confused; and at last, he recollected; and they said, if any person you know, will say they know where you was on Tuesday night, it will be sufficient; he said, Mr. Price in Northumberland-street; and Mr. O'Brien in Craven-street; and another gentleman I believe, whose name I have forgot, that would say where he was on Tuesday evening; they were sent for, but neither of them came; but I do not know for what reason; he referred to those gentlemen, to give an account where he was that evening, as he was embarrassed, and could not do it himself; I did not hear him give any account at that time.</p>

            ; I saw him the next morning at Bow-street; I was examined there.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner there, in your hearing, give any account where he had been on the Tuesday evening? - No, Sir; he was examined three times; first on the Monday morning; then in the afternoon; then on Wednesday evening.</p>
               <p>Then in the end, I believe he was admitted to bail? - Yes, he was discharged the first time; the magistrate asked me if I had anything more to say; and I had never been at a court; and I said no; and he was discharged; he was taken into custody the same day, and examined on Monday evening; then he went to Clerkenwell, that he might recollect where he was, till Wednesday; on Wednesday he was examined again; and then he was admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Do you know anything more of this matter? - I do not know anything more, than his offering to give a bond for the value of the property; that was in my hearing on Sunday evening; he was very timorous about being taken into custody; the constable told him that he was really not a prisoner; that he would give him every liberty of a gentleman; and if he could say where he was, he should be discharged; and he said he would sooner pay for the property, than have his character exposed in an open court; though an innocent man, he said he had not money at present, but he would give a bond, or something of that kind, for the value.</p>
               <p>Look at the prisoner; this you recollect is a question of great importance to him; are you sure it was him? - I am certain sure it was.</p>
               <p>Have you the least doubt at all about it? - Not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Have you from the time you saw him in Kensington-gardens, to this time, entertained the least doubt about him? - Not the least in the world; I can swear positively to him, Sir; if I could not have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090133"></xptr>done it, I would not have pretended to have done it.</p>
               <p>Did he appear to you to be dressed in the same way, when you saw him in Kensington-gardens, as he was at your house? - I believe it was the same coat; his linen was cleaner a good deal on the Sunday, which made him appear very different.</p>
               <p>But upon the whole, you are positive he is the person? - I am.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now young woman, on the 21st of July, about six, it was tolerably light? - Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>The little girl called you up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who first spoke to you, the man in green, or the man in blue? - The man in green.</p>
               <p>Had you any conversation at all with the man in blue? - Not one word then; he said he would wait below.</p>
               <p>Did you yourself speak to him at all? - I asked him if he would please to walk up stairs? to which he replied, I will wait here if you please.</p>
               <p>Now, mark me young woman; you yourself addressed your conversation to the man in blue? - Yes; I asked him if he would walk up stairs.</p>
               <p>Was not it pretty dark in the passage? - There is no light over the door; but the back door is directly opposite, which was standing open.</p>
               <p>When you saw this man in the passage; and you asked him if he would walk up stairs; having seen him as you told the Jury, before several times, did not you recognize him as an acquaintance some way or other? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Then he passed at that time a perfect stranger to you, though you had seen him three or four times before? - Yes, Sir, as a perfect stranger; because the business he came on, he did not do; I did not recognize him at all.</p>
               <p>Then you went up stairs with the man in green? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now ten minutes is a very considerable time to look at an apartment? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One apartment is soon looked at? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At first, the man in green did not seem very desirous to look at the lodging, as it was a second floor? - No.</p>
               <p>How long might you be up stairs looking at this second floor? - Upon my word I do not know; not more than five minutes I suppose; five or ten minutes might compleat the whole.</p>
               <p>If you would look at the clock, and see how slow the hand moves, you would see that ten minutes is a long time to look at an apartment? - I cannot justly say the time; the gentleman in green walked into the one pair of stairs, and looked at it; and walked in at the bed room door.</p>

               <p>What became of the little girl? - She went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Was the street door open? - No, it was shut.</p>
               <p>Who shut it? - The child shut it.</p>
               <p>On the Sunday, you was walking in Kensington-gardens? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It was the Tuesday before, that this circumstance happened of the lodging being enquired after? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You had lost your cloak, and Mrs. Yates hers? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you say anything to Mr. Yates about the man in blue, or the man in green? - I never described the people at all to Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>Did you ever at all describe them to Mrs. Yates? - Never; never in the world; never described the prisoner, any more than we lost the things; we did not immediately suppose it to be the gentlemen that came for the lodging.</p>
               <p>I dare say not; and I dare say it was not that gentleman that came for the lodging: did you at any time say to Mrs. Yates, good God! if it was the man that came for the lodging; surely I have seen that man before? - Yes, Sir; as soon as we had missed the things, I said so to Mr. Yates and Mrs. Yates.</p>
               <p>What did you say to Mr. Yates? - It is of no consequence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090134"></xptr>Tell me? - When I told him the gentlemen came for the lodging, I did not suppose them to be the thieves.</p>
               <p>How did you describe them, when you took it into your head that they might? - Then I said immediately to Mr. Yates, it must be the man that I left in the passage, that has got the cloaks; Mr. Yates said, what kind of looking men were they? I said, he did not look so much like a gentleman, as the man that went up stairs; Mr. Yates did not stop to ask me anything further about it.</p>
               <p>Does your memory serve you to say, that that was the observation you made; that he did not look so much like a gentleman, as the man who went up stairs? - I think that was the words I said.</p>
               <p>Did you say nothing more? - I think not.</p>
               <p>At first, you say, you had no suspicion that this man took the things? - We had not missed them.</p>
               <p>As soon as you missed them, what was your suspicion? - That the person I left in the passage must be the person: I said nothing more to Mr. Yates at that time.</p>
               <p>Did you advertize the goods, or make any complaint at Bow-street? - Mr. Yates went to Bow-street with a list of the property; Sir Sampson Wright sent to me the next morning; he examined me; and I said to him, what I have said to you; I told him it was one in blue, and one in green.</p>
               <p>What description of the dress did you give of the man in blue; I mean the first time? - That he was dressed in a blue coat, and a striped waistcoat; and I am sure I do not know what hat; but I think he had boots on; because, when I came down, he was whipping his stick, which rattled like boots.</p>
               <p>In Kensington-garden you saw two men; the prisoner was one; and his brother, most certainly, in a green coat, was the person in green, the person that was up stairs with you? - No; I am sure it was not.</p>
               <p>You had not got very far into Kensington-gardens, before they came back? - No, Sir.</p>

               <p>What did you say to Mr. Yates, when the gentlemen passed you? - When they passed us not the length of this court, I said to Mr. Yates, good God! that is the man that robbed your house.</p>
               <p>Now, mark me; this man's countenance you had seen, when he called three or four times before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then, you recollected a countenance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Upon your recollection of that countenance, you concluded he was the man? - Yes; I told Mr. Yates I had seen the man some where, but I positively could not recollect where.</p>
               <p>In Hyde-park, Mr. Yates tapped him on the shoulder, and asked him if he had been at his house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he tell the young man at that time, that you was ready to swear that he had been at the house? - I dare say not.</p>
               <p>Did he explain why he asked the question? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know, after you parted with Mr. Yates, that this young man went up past Mr. Yates afterwards? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Having seen his countenance before, when he came, you thought it was the same man that came about the lodging? - That was the man I left in the passage.</p>
               <p>When you left this man and his brother, and Mr. Burke and Mr. Reilly, then it was that he asked you, what he was brought there for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why would not you tell him? - I thought it not proper for me to tell him any thing about the matter.</p>
               <p>Why so? - I was unacquainted; I thought it was to be related by some peace officer.</p>
               <p>When you did communicate that he was the person that came to Mr. Yates's house; in what manner did you say it? - Mr. Burke had told him he was not in custody.</p>
               <p>Had you pretended then, to be half so<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090135"></xptr>positive as you are now to his person? - Yes, Sir; Mr. Reilly and Mr. Booth had asked me particularly in the passage.</p>
               <p>I want to know, whether in the presence of the prisoner, when Mr. Reilly was there, and Mr. Burke was there, you was as sure then, as you are now? - Because I did not know I was to speak.</p>
               <p>When the question was asked you, whether he was the man that was at the house; or if you would take upon you to say that he was at the house, whether you did not qualify it in that way, saying, I think he was? - I said, for my own part, I have not the least doubt but that is the man.</p>
               <p>Was that your expression at that time? Yes.</p>
               <p>To whom did you say that? - To several people that were in the parlour, that asked me about it.</p>
               <p>Did you say that to Mr. Reilly, or Mr. Burke? - I do not know that I did at that time.</p>
               <p>Why, when you went before the Justice, was you equally positive there; because, it is very odd the Justice should discharge him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Equally positive before the Justice? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You swore that he was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And the Justice discharged him out of custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I see your examination has these words; that you</p>
               <p>"believe he was the man;" was that the way in which you swore; did not the Justice say, here is a mistake: in the first examination you say thus,</p>
               <p>"Who believes</p>
               <p>"is the person that stole the said articles:" in the second examination you get into a more positive manner,</p>
               <p>"Who has not the smallest doubt:" and are you equally positive now? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What sort of a house is this in which Mr. Yates lives; is it a shop? - Not a shop.</p>
               <p>Now, you call him a linen draper? - Yes; he has a room that he keeps his goods in, but not a publick shop.</p>
               <p>Where is this room then; is it a mystery, a secret? - Not at all, Sir; he deals in linen-drapery; he has a room, and carries on his business there.</p>
               <p>Is there any sign of the business? - None at all.</p>
               <p>You had one lodger in the first floor; and had the second floor to let? - We had a gentleman in the first floor; and he was out of town at that time; I suppose he was out of town about three weeks.</p>
               <p>What does the family consist of? - Mr. and Mrs. Yates, and myself, the child, and a female servant; we had hired a maid servant that day; and she was not come; and the child that was there, was a child belonging to the nurse that had Mr. Yates's child to nurse; she might be eleven or twelve years old.</p>
               <p>Was that the first day she had been in the house? - No.</p>
               <p>How long had she been in the house? - I do not know; I was in the country when she came; she had been there almost a week; for I had been home almost a week; she slept there.</p>
               <p>Where is the child now? - I do not know; with her friends.</p>
               <p>Who are the child's friends? - Their name is Gibbs.</p>
               <p>What way of life are they in? - The father of her is a carpenter; I believe he works journey work with a Mr. Archibald; the mother is in no way of business; she had Mrs. Yates's little girl home to nurse.</p>
               <p>Do you know what acquaintance this child had in the house? - I do not know; the child came out of the kitchen to open the door.</p>

               <p>How long had you and Mrs. Yates been below in the kitchen? - The whole day; I had been to fetch the tea-cups from the parlour not five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Who let Mr. Yates in? - I did; I did not miss the cloaks then.</p>
               <p>How long was it after Mr. Yates had been in the house, before you discovered that the cloaks were gone? - I suppose it might be a quarter of an hour after Mr. Yates came home; in the whole, an hour and an half.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090136"></xptr>Now, what sort of situation are those houses? - Iron rails before the parlour windows; but we never leave any windows open, because there have been many alarms of thieves at the tops of houses.</p>
               <p>In fact, you had had nobody to act as servant, but the child, for a week? - No.</p>
               <p>When had it happened to you and Mrs. Yates, to be out, before this day? - The evening before.</p>
               <p>Had you any occasion for your cloaks this day? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Had you observed your cloaks five minutes before? - I did observe them.</p>
               <p>From the time the prisoner and his companion went away, till you wanted your cloaks, was there any body else in the house? - Nobody came into the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Do you know where the father of this child, the carpenter lives?</p>
               <p>Mr. Yates. In Liquor-pond-street, Gray's-inn-lane.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Craven-street; I am a linen-draper; about seven, on Sunday afternoon, we were coming from the palace in Kensington-gardens; coming to London, towards Hyde Park gate, there were a number of people; and two gentlemen went past us; the young woman immediately called to me; says she, that is the man that we left in the passage on Tuesday night? I said, then let us turn about, and look at him; and I said then, immediately, that was him that wanted some goods of me some time ago? and she said, yes, so it is: upon our turning about to walk after him a little way, he looked over his shoulder, and saw us.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see him look at you? - Yes; I saw him look very positively in my face; they turned about, and went to town; and walked very fast; and upon our following him, he immediately turned; and with another gentleman with a green coat on, he immediately turned towards Hyde Park gate; he was going towards the palace before, he walked very fast indeed; we followed after him; and I mentioned I wished I could see somebody and I would ask him; and when we came out of Kensington Gardens coming into Hyde Park; he walked very fast indeed, and sometimes ran a little, and we also; when we were almost at Hyde Park Corner, I met one of my friends, Mr. Watson, and I asked him if he would step with me; I took his arm and went up to Mr. Newman, and clapped him on the shoulder, and took him about twenty paces from the gangway; and said to him, Sir, I believe you are the gentleman that called at my house on Tuesday evening.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was that all you said till he gave an answer? - It was; and instantly upon my saying that, he said, you scoundrel, you rascal, you blackguard, what do you mean? I am a gentleman, says he, you do not know any thing of me; yes says I, I do; oh yes, says he, I remember, I believe you live in Craven-street, but you do not know my name; I said, I did not recollect it; but says he, I will lay a rod in soak for you; my attorney's name is Smith, he lives in Clerkenwell; I will lay a rod in soak for you; I will do for you; I said, I did not care what he could do, I wished this young woman could positively swear to him; there came a number of people up, and him and the gentleman that was with him went away very fast.</p>
               <p>Before they parted, do you recollect Miss Allen saying any thing to him? - Miss Allen, I believe, said to them that she knew him perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Did she assign any reason to him for her knowing him? - There were a number of people; I cannot say whether she did or no; he shook his stick at me; upon this him and his brother went away very fast; there was a good many people came up, and they got off; we parted with him there; we came out into Picadilly, he was in Picadilly before us; and we lost sight of him, as soon as he got into Hyde Park Gate; we went into St. James's Park, and in coming through St. James's Park, we met him and his brother again; he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090137"></xptr>coming as if he had come in at Spring-gardens Gate; he said it was his brother afterwards; upon meeting him there, Mr. Watson was with me; and I went up to him again, and I clapped him on the shoulder, as I did not know what he would do, and I said if I have done any thing to offend you, we had better go and have something to drink, and make it up; when we came out of the Park he wanted to go into the Cannon coffee house; but I said we would go home and have something to eat, and I would make any apology to him as a gentleman; but I still suspected him to be the man; then when we came home he wanted to see the young woman, to see what she had to say to him; and I immediately sent for one of the neighbours, to ask his advice, what to do; and I sent for Mr. Reilley, and we sent for a constable; he had a good deal to say about it, that he did not know what it was we meant to accuse him of in Hyde Park, as a gentleman, and wished to know what we had to say to him; I never said any thing, nor accused him of any thing, till the officer was come, and it was some time after that he was accused; immediately on his being accused with the thing, he flew into a very great flutter, and cried, and threw himself round; and his brother in the same manner, he cried his God, what would he do, he was a ruined man; and what would he do, he was quite innocent, what would he do, and threw himself on Mr. Watson, to support him; and that was all that I heard him say; that he was quite innocent of any such charge, that he was in the country, that he could easily prove where he was on that day; and he still said he was a gentleman; then after he was charged with taking away the goods, he was desired to recollect where he was on Tuesday, and if he was innocent we were to make an apology to him for troubling him; he said should he be obliged to tell where he was on Tuesday; he said that his substance was very much exhausted, and that he was arrested at the suit of Mr. Groves, on the Tuesday, and was at Laver's spunging-house; Mr. Burke then the constable, desired me to go to see; I went out to go to Mr. Laver's; and I was not gone but a very little time when they called me back; and then he said he had made a mistake, that it was on the Tuesday preceding; and it turns out that he had been there that evening; he then said he had been at Mr. Sterling's wine-vaults in the morning, that he had been drinking, and was drunk there the whole day; I knew Mr. Sterling, and upon my proposing to send for Mr. Sterling, he said he believed it was not on the Tuesday, he mentioned some other day; he then asked me what the value of the property was, that I had lost; which I was desired by my neighbours not to put any value, nor to say any thing about it, unless he returned the things themselves; he often told me that he would sooner pay for the property and have done, than have the risk of standing the trial.</p>
               <p>Recollect his particular expression, and do not introduce any thing of your own into it? - He asked me the value of the property, and that would be much better for me than to run the risk of a trial; and the young woman she said she would swear positively to him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did not he add, though he was innocent? - Yes, he said though he was innocent.</p>
               <p>Did not he say this, than have his character exposed in a publick Court? - Yes, he said so.</p>
               <p>Always insisting, however, he was innocent? - Always insisting that he was innocent; he referred us to Mr. O'Brien to give him a character, he sent for him, but he did not come; then he mentioned Mr. Price, an attorney, in Northumberland-street, to give an account of him; and his brother went out and staid out, for some time, and came back again; and on his return he said he had found out now positively, where he was; but he said that in the passage.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that they were to give an account, who he was, or where he was? - To give an account where he was that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090138"></xptr>Tuesday night; the prisoner said no more to me, but that he would sooner pay for the property; in the end he was taken away in the custody of Mr. Burke, and the next day examined at Bow-street and discharged; and in the evening taken into custody, and re-examined; then committed till the Wednesday; re-examined, and then admitted to bail.</p>
               <p>Before the magistrate, did Mr. Price attend, in the presence of the prisoner? - I do not know, I do recollect seeing him there; I heard in the evening what he said, but not in the forenoon.</p>
               <p>Was he examined at the desire of the prisoner, and in the hearing of the prisoner? - It was in the prisoner's hearing that he spoke to the Justice; he said that he was at his house about six, and left the house a little before six; the prisoner brought a Mr. Read there.</p>
               <p>You spoke of the prisoner, as a man that you know on some former transaction; what was that transaction? - One Atkinson came to me, and wanted me to sell some goods to a friend of his, and take a bill; the prisoner called different times at my house, when I was not at home; I went to the Cannon Coffee-house, to meet the prisoner, one evening; he gave me a direction to the gentleman; but by the behaviour of the prisoner, and the gentleman recommended to me; I declined having any thing to do with it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. He had been at your house, we have understood, frequently? - I have only seen him once at my house, and once at the Cannon Coffee-house; but I have seen him often in the streets since; I know him perfectly well; he never told his name.</p>
               <p>Have not you heard from Mr. Allen that he had been at your house? - Yes, but he did not leave his name.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Allen acknowledged to you in Kensington Gardens, her recollection of his person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Therefore this man knew a little of you; you knew a little of him; and his person was known to Mrs. Allen? - Yes; whether she recollected him, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Why, she said she did, you said that was the man that wanted to have the transaction with the goods; she said it was? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now at the time these things were lost, who made the discovery of the loss? - Upon my coming home; we was going to ship some goods; I told this young woman and my wife, if they would get themselves ready, I would give them a sail to London-bridge; immediately they went into the parlour, and missed their two cloaks; and they immediately said there was nobody in the house but these two gentlemen, that came to take the lodging.</p>
               <p>Did they describe the persons at all? - Yes, they described the persons, one with a green coat, and the other with a blue coat; and Mrs. Allen said, she knew him, but she did not recollect who he was.</p>
               <p>How long ago might this be, when you had the transaction about the goods with Mr. Newman? - I think it was the 31st of January.</p>
               <p>Now when you went out of Kensington Gardens, and clapped him on the shoulder, you asked him if he had been at your house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did not you accuse him at once of being the person that was at your house? - I do not know why, but I did not.</p>
               <p>There were some warm words passed between you? - He was very warm with me, but I was cool.</p>
               <p>You have have given me an expression, which I have taken down, and I want to know the reason of this expression,</p>
               <p>"because I still suspected him to be the person that took the things;" but you could have no reason to suspect him, but from what she told you? - And by knowing his former character.</p>
               <p>What made you wish the young woman could positively swear to him? - Because I thought if she could, I should get my property again.</p>
               <p>What made you say so? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090139"></xptr>However that was the expression you used,</p>
               <p>"I wish this young woman could positively swear to you"? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When you lost sight of him, where did he go? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know he went along Piccadilly? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Do you believe he went through St. James's Park, out of Hyde Park Gate? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you never heard from Mrs. Allen, that he went along Piccadilly? - I never heard from her.</p>
               <p>Has she never told you so since, that he went along Piccadilly? - Yes, she has told me so, and so did others.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was it in St. James's Park that you met again? - It was a little on this side the chairs.</p>
               <p>Court. Has that been since you came home to Craven-street, or was it when you came out of the Park? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>Did not she tell you so at the time? - Not that I remember.</p>
               <p>When did she tell you so? - I cannot recollect positively what time; I clapped him on the shoulder, in the same manner, in St. James's Park, and told him if I had done any thing to affront him, I was ready to make him any apology; says he, I wanted to see you.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Now you see another circumstance has escaped you which you would not tell my friend here, he said to you</p>
               <p>"I wanted to see you?" - Yes, after I came up to him, he said he was going to send to his Attorney, Mr. Smith, who lived in Clerkenwell; and he wanted to see me before; and he asked me what I meant by accosting him in Hyde Park.</p>
               <p>Did you tell him? - No, because I did not chuse to accuse him with it.</p>
               <p>Court. Why not? - Because in case I had accused him wrong.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did he object to going with you? - He objected to going home with me; he proposed going into the Cannon Coffee-house with me, to have something to drink, and to make an apology to him, for stopping him, as he was a gentleman; I said you had better go home with me, and we will have something to drink; and if I had done any thing to offend him, I would make an apology to him.</p>
               <p>Did you say any thing to him at your own house, about the charge, before Mr. Burke and Mr. Reilly came? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you make known the charge, and in what manner? - That this young woman said he was the man that was left in the passage; and that I had been robbed that night.</p>
               <p>And he flew into a great passiion; and cried out; and said he was out of town; always persisting in his innocence; and saying he would rather pay the value of the things, than have his character exposed, and stand a trial? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When was Mrs. Allen called in? - When the charge was given of the property; she said he was the man that she left in the passage.</p>
               <p>Did he ask her whether she could say he was the man? - I do not remember.</p>
               <p>That is very odd, your memory serves you very accurately in other things? - She said he was the man that had taken the property.</p>
               <p>Who asked her about his being the man; was it you or Burke, or Reilly? - It was me that accused him with the property being stolen; and she immediately said he was the man.</p>
               <p>What were your particular words? - I said, I have been robbed; and this young woman says you are the man that did it.</p>
               <p>Was it after your so saying, that Mrs. Allen stood forward, and said he was the man; was that the first time that

               <p>When was it? - I do not know; I was not in the room.</p>
               <p>What led you out of the room? - I went to advise with the neighbours.</p>
               <p>Why, you had called in Mr. Reilly and Mr. Burke; did you want further advice? - If I remember right; I believe I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090140"></xptr>went out to speak to another of the neighbours, to ask him what I should do, before I would charge him.</p>
               <p>Why, when you was in possession, as you have told us over and over again, of the assertion of that young woman, did you hesitate at all about it? - I did not know what to do.</p>
               <p>Why, had you found any circumstance in addition; have you found any of the property? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you advertized it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you know where the child's parents or friends live, that happened to be in the house at that time? - In Liquor-pond-street; she is about twelve or thirteen years of age; a daughter of the nurse's.</p>
               <p>How far is Liquor-pond-street from you? - It is in Gray's-inn-lane.</p>
               <p>Does the nurse visit at your house? - Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>How long has the child of the nurse lived with you? - About three weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>When Burke and Reilly had this young man there, what did they say? - They told him he was not in custody.</p>
               <p>Did he attempt to make any escape from you? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Did he insist on the matter being enquired into? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>You went before the Justice Addington; you made your charge; and he was discharged? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did he go to, when he was discharged? - He went to Mr. Reilly's.</p>
               <p>What, to the Globe Tavern, the corner of Craven-street; when was he apprehended the second time? - I never had anything to do before a Justice; and I told the Justice he had offered to pay for the goods; and I asked him in what manner I should proceed, so I did not touch his life.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the Justice at the same time, that he had declared his innocence of the transaction; and that it was only to keep his character from being exposed? - No, I did not; I called the Justice into the back parlour, and told him I would be obliged to him, to tell me in what manner to proceed against him, not to touch his life? the Justice said, as a magistrate I will do my duty; and he examined him; and discharged him; then Mrs. Allen said he offered to pay for the goods, which the Justice had not been told; and immediately the Justice ordered this warrant to take him up again; to pay for the goods, he thought, that was a sign of guilt; and ordered this warrant to take him up again; then I was called upon again, to give the same evidence, when I was examined, I told the magistrate the whole transaction; I told the magistrate that he did not confess to the property, but he had offered to pay for it.</p>
               <p>Did you tell the magistrate the whole circumstance, that we have come at here; that the man declared and protested that he was an innocent man; but that to save his character, and the risk of a trial, he would rather pay for the goods? - In the evening, Mr. Addington and Mr. Bond attended.</p>

               <p>During the time he was committed, there was an advertisement, calling together all the people whose lodgings had been robbed? - I believe there was.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that many people attended at the office? - I believe they did.</p>
               <p>You saw them there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were not they all asked whether that was the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not they all say that he was not the man? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were you present when he was admitted to bail? - I asked the Justice; they took bail for him; I had enquired after the goods, and had not found them.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a neighbour of Mr. Yates's; on Sunday, after Mr. Yates was robbed, I met him and Mr. Yates, and Miss Allen, in Hyde Park; he said something to me, in consequence of which, he and me went up to the prisoner; Mr. Yates tapped him on the shoulder, and said, my friend, I want to speak to you; the prisoner followed about twenty yards out of the croud; and the first thing Mr. Yates said, was, you was at my house last Tuesday night, Sir? the prisoner immediately flew into a passion at these words; and said, I at your house! what do you mean by that? I never was at your house but once (I think he said) in my life; and threw out some threats to Mr. Yates, what he would do to him for that; and walked off; there was a very great croud came together in a moment, which might be a reason for his going off.</p>
               <p>And Mr. Yates did not say to him, what he had against him? - No; after that, we lost sight of the prisoner in Hyde Park, on this side the Serpentine River; about half way between the Serpentine River and the gate; and we were coming down St. James's Park, towards London; the prisoner, and the gentleman that was with him, who was his brother, met us, I did not see them, but Mr. Yates did; Mr. Yates said to me, there, they have passed us again; now, if you will go back with me, we will follow them, and take them into custody? I said I would go back with him; when we came up to them, we told them that we had a little business with them, if they had no objection to going along with us; I believe Mr. Yates spoke first; and I said to the prisoner, Mr. Newman, this is not a place to talk about business, let us go somewhere where we can talk the matter over quietly; and then Mr. Yates will explain it to you? and he said, certainly, he had no objection to go; and he said, I am come here on purpose to seek you; I did upon my soul; for I wanted the business explained to night; I have known him this seven or eight years by name, not further; but I know that was his name; I do not know that I have spoke to him these seven or eight years before: going through Spring-gardens passage, some words passed between Mr. Yates and him; I heard Mr. Newman threaten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090143"></xptr>to knock Mr. Yates down; but I did not hear what Mr. Yates said to him; then he went quietly with us to Craven-street; I was chiefly in the parlour with him and his brother; there was a little delay in explaining the business; the constable was sent for; and after he came, the business was opened; there was Mr. Booth the attorney; and Mr. Reilly of the Globe, and the constable; the delay was occasioned by sending for the constable; the constable opened the business to the prisoner; the prisoner said, that is a very serious charge; I am very glad that I know the business; it is a very serious charge indeed; but I have it in my power to clear myself of it immediately; he then carried the matter with a high hand, and used some threats to Mr. Yates.</p>
               <p>I wish you would not describe it by epithets of your own, but tell us what he said? - Then he said, there is a matter which I must inform you of, though it is very disagreeable to me to relate it; but I must in my own vindication. Last Tuesday night you was robbed? Mr. Yates said, yes: last Tuesday morning, says he, I was arrested; and was in a spunging-house in Chancery-lane, from Tuesday morning to Wednesday evening; after that, the constable then told me that he was very glad the business was likely to end so very happily; in the first place, says he, we will send to the spunging-house, to see if you was there at the time; and Mr. Yates and another gentleman that was there, whose name I do not know, were appointed to go; they set out; and as soon as they got into the street, the gentleman that was with the prisoner, that was his brother I believe, said to the prisoner, was it last Tuesday night, or was it the Tuesday before; upon which, the prisoner then immediately said, oh! good Good! it was the Tuesday before, call Mr. Yates back, call him back, it was the Tuesday before; Mr. Yates was called back; and after that, the prisoner's behaviour was very different to what it was before; he seemed very much affected; he carried it with rather a high hand; he wrung his hands, and said, good God! I cannot recollect where I was on Tuesday last; and was in as great distress as ever I saw any body; he was advised to sit down, that he might recollect, which he could not, he mentioned a great many people that would come to speak to his character; I believe Mr. O'Brien was sent for, and refused to come.</p>
               <p>Did you hear the prisoner name any other place where he said he had been? - I did not; he said Mr. O'Brien, and some other gentlemen he mentioned, would all come and give him a very good character.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Mr. Price being named? - No, I do not think I do; I do not think he named him; there might be a good deal of conversation which I might not attend to.</p>
               <p>Did you understand that Mr. O'Brien, and the other persons in the neighbourhood, were to come to speak to his character; or did they know anything about him? - Only to speak to his character; he was committed that night; I attended one examination; I was not there the first time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Mr. Watson, you seem to have a perfect memory of what passed, on Mr. Yates's meeting him in Hyde Park? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He said to him, you was at my house last Tuesday night, Sir? - Yes, he did; they were the very words he used; upon which, he answered, I at your house! I never was there but once, that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Then he did not disclaim all knowledge of him, but seemed to acknowledge that he had been at his house; and that he knew him? - Yes, about three or four months before.</p>
               <p>What passed immediately after? - Why, upon my word, I do not know exactly, what might pass, as he was not half a minute before he walked off.</p>
               <p>Now, when Mr. Yates walked up to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090144"></xptr>him, and tapped him on the shoulder, and said this to him, where had he left Mrs. Allen? - A little behind.</p>
               <p>Then, the confusion that took place, happened between you and Mr. Yates, and Newman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Allen was not at all incommoded by this? - Certainly not; I think not.</p>
               <p>She said nothing at all to him? - Not that I know of; I think she did not.</p>
               <p>At that time, she did not pretend she had known him or seen him before? - Not in Hyde Park; for he was not half a minute before he got off, there was such a croud.</p>
               <p>Now then, you can tell whether Mrs. Allen said on that occasion, I know you, I have seen you before? - He did not pretend at all, that he was ignorant of Mr. Yates; he could not, by giving that answer.</p>
               <p>Nor did Mrs. Allen on that occasion, say to him, I know you? - Mrs. Allen might say so; I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>You have told me that this matter lasted a minute or two; and that when Mr. Yates spoke to him, you was near him; and Mrs. Allen somewhat behind? - She was; I did not hear her say a word; it might be the confusion; Mr. Yates had not explained the business to me; the words might pass, but I did not observe them.</p>
               <p>How far did you go in Hyde Park, before he escaped from your sight? - Not ten yards.</p>
               <p>Did you see anything of him, when he went out of Hyde Park? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether he went down Piccadilly or not? - No, I do not; I should rather imagine that he went down Constitution-hill, and so turned back.</p>
               <p>Where was Mrs. Allen? - She might be sometimes twenty or sixty yards behind.</p>
               <p>If she was rather behind, and Mr. Newman and his brother were rather before you, it was more improbable that she should observe, than you should? - It was; she was the greatest part of the way behind; I thought in my own mind, that they had come down Constitution-hill, and had turned back again.</p>
               <p>On the accusation being made in this way, when was it that Mrs. Allen was called on to speak to what she knew of the matter? - After the business had been opened to the prisoner by Mr. Burke the constable.</p>
               <p>Do you remember Mr. Yates saying to Newman, I wish this young woman could swear positively to you, in Hyde Park? - No, I do not remember that; he might say so, I was so confused; the people gathering, I might not attend to understand it.</p>
               <p>When did Mr. Yates first tell you anything about his intention of speaking to Newman at all? - Never; he desired me to follow him, but never told me a word of what he was about.</p>
               <p>After the first meeting, what did he say to you? - He told me coming along, the business; and that Miss Allen pointed him out, as the man she left in the passage.</p>
               <p>Where was it, in Craven-street, that Mrs. Allen was called in to tell Burke, or anybody else, what she would say? - I do not think she was immediately called in; I should imagine Burke had talked to her; he was in and out several times; and he seemed to know so well what Miss Allen could say.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when Burke went to Mr. Newman, he was not in custody? - Yes; that was before Mr. Yates had gone into Chancery-lane; and it impressed every body that was there, particularly myself, that however one person might be like another, he could not be the man; and Mr. Burke then said, you are not in custody now; you are welcome to go now; he made no attempt to go; on the contrary, I think he said, I do not chuse to go.</p>
               <p>Now, as soon as ever he was desired to recollect where he had been on the Tuesday night, he first thought of this place, Laver's, the officer's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then he immediately rectified that mistake himself, before Mr. Yates had gone far out of the house? - Yes, by his brother.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Price sent to? - I do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090145"></xptr>know; I think he was not, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You say, that when Mr. Newman was attacked by Mr. Yates, and Newman had agreed to go home with him, that in that passage they had some high words; and he threatened to knock Yates down? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So that on that occasion, he had exasperated Mr. Yates considerably? - Yates had exasperated him; Yates appeared in a very good humour at home.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Mr. Yates shewed his exasperation, by desiring him to be admitted to bail, and not indicting him for a capital offence.</p>
               <p>- BURKE sworn.</p>
               <p>I was at Mr. Yates's on Sunday evening; when this gentleman was there; I believe it was about 10 on Sunday evening, the 26th of July, I was sent for to Mr. Yates's in Craven-street; after I took the prisoner into custody, he seemed exceedingly agitated indeed; and cried that he should be ruined; I explained to him why I took him into custody; I told him I was an officer of the parish, and was sent for to take him into custody, on account of a robbery that Mr. Yates had sustained the Tuesday before; the prisoner seemed very much agitated, and asked the consequence of it; I told the gentleman, that that if he could not disprove what the young woman, Miss Allen, had before told me in the passage, that it was my duty to hold him for that night; and to bring him the next day before a magistrate; and I believed, if he could not there disprove it, he would be committed: Mr. Newman asked me what was likely to follow afterwards? I said, if he was committed, of course, a trial would be had; and if he could not disprove it, I was afraid conviction would follow; but I told him I was not much acquainted with such things; but I said to him, Sir, you seem to be a gentleman, and if you can satisfy me where you was on Tuesday night, when the robbery was committed, I will be very happy to discharge you; upon which, Mr. Newman told me he could: and it was now necessary he should explain his situation; on that day, on the Tuesday this robbery was supposed to be done, he was arrested at two o'clock, and had to the house of a Mr. Laver, till between 10 and 11 the next day; and said, there was a gentleman or two in my neighbourhood, naming them, who would satisfy me of the truth of that assertion; I said, Sir, I shall think it no trouble to attend you here, while I send the man of the house to Mr. Laver; and that will be the surest means of being certain; I called in Mr. Yates, and told him, Sir, this gentleman says he was so and so, as I have now described to you; I desire you will take your hat, and go yourself, that you may be sure of the truth of this matter; and know whether it is so or not: Mr. Yates left the room; and in a very little time after Mr. Yates was out of the parlour; a very little time indeed, it was; I cannot pretend to say how many minutes, Mr. Newman seemed to recollect it was the Tuesday se'nnight; I will not be positive; but as far as my recollection can fairly remember, he seemed immediately to recollect it himself; I immediately called the first I saw, which was Mr. Reilly's apprentice boy, to fetch Mr. Yates back; in the course of that time, Mr. Newman again called me aside in the parlour, and asked me over again, what I thought the consequence of this prosecution would be; or whether I imagined the young woman would positively swear to him; I had told him she would positively swear to him; I told Mr. Newman, that though a neighbour, I was an intire stranger to the people of the house; and never had seen or conversed with them before; which was the truth; but that I should advise her over and over, to be very positive in her assertions; and if she did, I thought it would be serious; upon which, Mr. Newman seemed very much distressed indeed, and mentioned his character, which he said would suffer very much by a publick prosecution, by a publick trial; and under that idea; and seemingly under<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090146"></xptr>the idea of getting rid of a publick scandal, he offered to pay for the things; on account of some suits he had in Chancery, and the honor of his family; but all the time asserting in the most solemn manner, that he was to every intent and purpose innocent of the fact; I told him that as a constable, I did not think it was proper for me to hear of any conpromise; nor did I think it safe for the prosecutor to accept of any; but if it was, it must be conducted through some other medium; I then urged the gentleman to reconcile himself, and to recollect where he had spent the Tuesday, assuring him my time was not so precious, but I should be ready to attend him, to satisfy the man of the house, and acquit him: Mr. Newman in a very great agitation, seemed at a loss to know where he was; but a brother of Mr. Newman's who was all this while there, said he would go and bring a certain account where Mr. Newman was on Tuesday; that was in the presence of the prisoner; he took his hat and went out of the house, for that purpose; he returned in some short time afterwards; I cannot be particular to the time, it might be half an hour; and when he came into the parlour, he sat down, and said I now have found to a certainty where my brother spent the day on Tuesday; I said I should be very happy to know; and he said, that early in the day, on Tuesday, in the hearing of the prisoner, he went to Sterling's wine vaults, in the Hay-market, where he drank freely, got partly intoxicated, fell asleep, and staid till late in the evening; I immediately said, is Mr. Sterling coming here to satisfy me of the truth of that? he said he was, as I understood his brother, said he was coming; I waited two hours, and no gentleman or others appearing; I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner make any observation on what his brother said? - The prisoner heard his brother give this account, and he did not contradict it, that I am sure of; but I cannot remember whether he said any thing to it.</p>
               <p>Did he hear your enquiry, whether Mr. Sterling was coming? - He certainly did.</p>
               <p>He heard the answer, that he would come? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>After waiting as long as you did, did you make any observation on going away? - So far, that I was exceedingly sorry for the disappointment; and that I found it my duty to take care of Mr. Newman till the day following, and that there was no place I could take him to but the watch-house; and I told him any little civility I could shew him I would.</p>
               <p>When did you say to him, you did not consider him as a prisoner? - That was before I took him into custody; that was before I heard what was said by Miss Allen; I thought at all events I would wait to see his conduct on the occasion; and if I found he abruptly attempted to go away, I would run the risk; but in the mean time Mr. Booth, a gentleman of great reputation, came in and removed my doubts; and it was on that I desired Miss Allen to come into the parlour and point out the identical man, which she did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. In some conversation Mr. Newman said you are an officer? - I said yes; he said then I suppose I am in custody? I said no, you are not, you are at liberty to go about your business; and he did not offer to go away.</p>
               <p>Protesting his innocence? - I afterwards, by advice of Mr. Booth, conveyed a line to the prisoner; if he would confess the things, and pay for them, article by article; the prisoner said he was willing to pay for the things, but solemnly protesting he could not confess to a thing he was innocent of; he proposed paying for the things by his own, and his brother's bond; I attended the magistrate with him the next day, and then he was discharged.</p>
               <p>Did you know where he went to? - No, I did not; I found him afterwards at Mr. Reilly's house, the corner of Craven-street; he made no resistance; I found him in Mr. Reilly's Coffee-room.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner at the Bar, now is your time to make your defence; do you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090147"></xptr>wish to say any thing for yourself, or do you leave it to your counsel? - I leave it to my counsel.</p>

               <p>I believe you live at the Globe in the Strand? - I do.</p>
               <p>You was sent for to Mr. Yates's house, on the Sunday night, when Mr. Newman was taken? - Yes, Sir, I had heard of his loss before; he ordered a shilling's worth of rum and water, and he begged I would go over; I went with it, and I saw the prisoner and his brother; the prisoner said, as near as I can recollect, pray what have you to say against me; Mr. Yates told him he should know it in a little time; upon which, with a good deal of excuse, I believe Mr. Yates had sent for the constable, though Mr. Yates said, I was the person that directed him; Mr. Yates and the constable, both, had told him he was not then in charge, and he might go if he pleased; they did not make any charge at this time; when Mr. Yates gave the constable orders to take him in charge, and opened the whole matter of his losing three table spoons and eleven tea spoons; when I heard what had passed, I heard Mrs. Allen accuse him, and say he was the man that positively was in the passage; I was very apprehensive that he was the man, from what she said, because she spoke so pointedly to him; I went to him and said, Sir, if you are guilty you had better confess, and let the man have his property; good God, Sir, says he, how can I be accused of any thing of the kind; I cannot confess that or which I am innocent; says I, Sir, I would not be in your clothes for the world, for you will be hanged as sure as you are born; and if you have sold or made away with the things, make them some allowance? my God, Sir, says he, will you have me confess a thing that I am not guilty of? then Mr. Booth spoke to him; Mr. Yates told me the property came to sixteen or eighteen pounds; I thought it was a great deal of property for the poor man to lose; I staid there a good while; and when he told me he knew Mr. O'Brien, in the street, I went there to enquire into his character.</p>
               <p>Then at the time you was sent for to Mr. Yates, he knew you went there as Mr. Yates's friend? - Yes, I went there as such; the prisoner came back to my house when he was discharged from the magistrates, him and two or three more.</p>
               <p>Did you see him when he came back the second time? - Yes, the constable told me; I was the person that first acquainted him; and the prisoner was with two or three more in the coffee-room, eating a bit of cold meat; he surrendered directly.</p>
               <p>Do you remember when Mrs. Allen was first called upon to see what she knew of the prisoner? - I think to the best of my knowledge, she said, she believed that was the man that was in the house.</p>
               <p>What was the question put to her? - I declare I cannot positively tell you.</p>
               <p>Then tell me what she said? - That she believed him to be the person that was in the house; that was the word, to the best of my knowledge; I am almost confident that was the word.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean speaking of Mrs. Allen, to say that that was the exact expression she used? - No.</p>
               <p>Was she not most positive, and repeatedly positive at that time, that he was the man? - She was afterwards; she said she believed he was the man; I cannot recollect what she said.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath did not she over and over again, say, in your hearing, that she was positive he was the man, and had not the least doubt about it? - No, Sir, she said, to the best of my opinion, the very words I have told.</p>
               <p>You mean to say that she did not say it? - She might say it unknown to me.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any body say that the prisoner said he had been at Laver's that Tuesday? - I believe it was him.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether it was the prisoner that said so? - Yes, I am positive to the best of my opinion; I cannot be positive whether it was him or the brother said it.</p>

               <p>Who said so? - I do not recollect I heard any body say he was there all day long; I recollect it was said he was there in the evening.</p>
               <p>Who did say what was said about Sterling's; do you recollect that? - I cannot recollect that.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was it business of a particular nature; I do not ask you what it was; any thing remarkable that would fix it in your memory? - I had a bill of exchange drawn upon me, which indeed, when he was taken up, it was very fresh in my memory, as I had the trouble of sending into the city to take it up.</p>
               <p>Was the business of a sort that when it was mentioned to you, you would be likely to recollect? - He had been very short of money, and he came for some; to ask me to lend him some.</p>

               <p>When was you first applied to, to recollect whether he had been with you on the Tuesday? - On the Monday following, in the morning; he was in the watch-house, and his brother, Mr.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Was you in company with Mr. Newman and Mr. Read, on the 21st of July? - I was, at Mr. Sterling's punch-house, in the Hay-market, at about twenty minutes after six; I think it was quite twenty minutes; the reason I have to give for it, was this, that going to the Haymarket theatre, the door was just opened; I went to the one shilling gallery, and paid my money; and asked what time it began? and they said, not till seven; I then went over to Sterling's punch-house, where I have frequently seen my friend, Mr. Reed; and there was Mr. Newman and Mr. Reed drinking; Mr. Newman said, Collins, how do you do? I was going to the Son-in-law; he replied, never mind the play, stay and drink some punch with us; in consequence of that, we replenished the bowl, and parted at ten in the Haymarket, each of us going home; I am sure of the day, and as to the time.</p>
               <p>How was Mr. Newman dressed that night? - As to the coat, I do not know; but I can swear to this, that he had no boots on; he had white stockings on; the Monday following, I met my friend, Mr. Reed; he informed me of the unhappy business of Mr. Newman; and I thought it necessary to take a note of the business, which I did at the very time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It does not signify.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I desire to see it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. I do not resist it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How long have you been acquainted with Mr. Newman? - Seven years, and upwards; and I never knew his character impeached or called in question before; I knew him equally with Mr. Reed; I knew them both at the same time.</p>
               <p>You became acquainted with them, probably at the same place; where was that? - I am not ashamed to say it was at the King's-bench prison; undoubtedly so.</p>
               <p>You were quite sure he had no boots on; how came you to think that was material? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>You was out of breath to get to it? - I do not run so fast as that.</p>
               <p>How came you to mention the circumstance of a man's not having or having boots? - Because I thought it extremely material to the case; the gentleman asked me whether he had any boots on?</p>
               <p>No, he did not, but you knew he would; the favourite farce of the Son-in-law was to be performed that night? - I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of it? - No.</p>
               <p>What way of life are you in? - A master<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090151"></xptr>taylor, at No. 20, King-street, St. James's-square.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Newman very sober when you went to Sterling's? - I am not a competent judge whether a man is drunk or sober.</p>
               <p>Was Mr. Reed drunk or sober? - He might be for what I know.</p>
               <p>What do you think now? - I am not a competent judge.</p>
               <p>It is a little unlucky, I think, as you are a taylor, that you could not tell the colour of his coat; I should have thought if you had been a shoe-maker, the boots might have run in your head? - What business have I with the colour of a man's coat, when I do not make it.</p>
               <p>So, you never know the colour of a man's coat, without you make it? - I do not like to look at it; what business have I; upon my oath, I do not know what coloured coat he had on; I was in his company, from fifteen or twenty minutes after six, till ten; upwards of three hours, sitting at a table in a box, at a publick coffee-room or drinking-room.</p>
               <p>Then you walked on together down to the bottom of the Hay-market? - Yes; that I can do in half a minute.</p>
               <p>What made you swear that this man had no boots on, when you sit three hours in his company; and do not know the colour of his coat? - I can see a man's leg that has got a white stocking on; I took more particular notice of it, than of his coat.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect whether his shoes were buckled or tied? - No.</p>
               <p>I wonder at that; do not you recollect now, that they had ham and sallad for their supper at a quarter past nine? - Not while they were with me; I do positively swear they had nothing to eat in my company, while I was there.</p>
               <p>Now, when you went in together, you was not drunk? - I do not know that; perhaps I might be; upon my oath, I do not know whether I was drunk or sober; I do not know what we drank; I told you before, on my oath, that we had our first bowl, and it was replenished; but how often it was replenished, I do not know; we each paid our reckoning.</p>
               <p>How much did you pay? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>How long have you been out of the King's-bench? - These seven years; I have been a man of character these seven years; I do not know what I paid for my reckoning.</p>
               <p>Can you guess within four or five shillings, recollect? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect within four or five shillings, what you paid? - No, Sir, I cannot; I do not think we drank so much a piece; I believe we paid two shillings a piece.</p>
               <p>Did Mr. Newman or Reed appear to you to be drunk, when you quitted the house? - No, Sir, neither of them drunk.</p>
               <p>They appeared better for their liquor? - Yes, Sir, I believe they were better for their liquor; for the punch was very good; it is a noted house for good punch</p>
               <p>Had Mr. Newman a stick with him, now, as he was sitting in that careless manner? - I do not recollect.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. You recollect your master being taken into custody? - I remember there was such a thing happened.</p>
               <p>Can you tell me where he had been the week before that; the Tuesday before that? - I think he had been confined in Chancery-lane; not the Tuesday before that, but the Tuesday week before that; he was discharged on the Wednesday; he returned to his own house, at Mrs. Williams's, in King's Road, Chelsea.</p>

               <p>When they came home, had they any supper afterwards? - No, Sir; they went to bed; they walked home.</p>

               <p>Did you observe anything particular in your master's manner that night? - No, Sir; he is not given to drinking; I never knew him above half a dozen times in liquor, since I have lived with him; he appeared to me, to be quite steady and sober.</p>
               <p>What coloured clothes had he on? - A blue coat and metal buttons; I cannot call to mind whether he brought home his stick or not.</p>

               <p>What did you say, when you came back? - We were left in the room by ourselves; Mr. Booth told me, for my brother to make restitution of the property.</p>
               <p>My question to you is this; when you came back into the room, where there were several persons, whether you said anything; did you, or did you not, at any time, when you returned into the room, after an absence of some time, say anything where your brother had been on the Tuesday? - No, I did not; for I did not know it.</p>
               <p>Then, you are very positive that you did not say, you were very happy you had found out where he was that he went early to Sterling's punch-house; he drank freely; he got intoxicated; and he staid there till eight o'clock? - No, I did not say so.</p>
               <p>No part of the conversation; I wish<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090154"></xptr>not to hurry you, and I tell you fairly that more persons than one have sworn it; attend to the question, whether after the correction of the mistake about Laver's, you yourself did not say, I am very happy now I can state where he was, he was at Sterling's Punch-house, he went there in the morning, he drank freely, he got intoxicated, he fell asleep, he staid there till eight o'clock? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then all that was said in that conversasation, about Sterling's, was that he had been at Mr. Price's, and that he had been afterwards at Sterling's with Mr. Read? - Yes, that was all.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect Mr. Burke saying, is Sterling coming then, Sir? - No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell Mr. Burke that you had left a message, and expected him? - Me! by no means, it is not possible Sir.</p>
               <p>You did not do it? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Did not Mr. Burke continue there near two hours in expectation of Mr. Sterling's coming, in consequence of what you asserted? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Once more; I am very sorry; it is very far from my wish to intrap you, or to see you in an awkward situation; do me the Justice to believe I do this merely because it is my duty; I have no pleasure in distressing either the prisoner or you; but I must ask you whether in any part of the conversation you stated that your brother had been at Sterling's in the morning, and that he had drank freely, and got intoxicated, and fell asleep? - There was nothing said of his having been there in the morning, nothing at all to my knowledge; nothing by me; nothing by my brother, in my hearing.</p>
               <p>You say you observed Mr. Yates, and those persons following you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way were you walking, towards Kensington? - No, Sir, when we observed them we were coming out of Kensington Gardens, towards Hyde Park.</p>
               <p>Why? did not you turn after you saw them? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear, that after you and your brother saw these people following you, you did not turn about? - We did not turn about, excepting we might have turned about in Kensington Gardens.</p>
               <p>When you observed Mr. Yates, and these people following you, was not you walking from that entrance at Hyde Park Gate towards Kensington Palace; had not you just before that been walking towards the Palace? - I do not know, I turned round two or three times.</p>
               <p>Just before you went out of the Gardens, had not you been walking towards Kensington? - I will only swear to my recollection.</p>
               <p>What was there particular in these people following you? - I did not observe them so much in Kensington Gardens, as I did in Hyde Park; I had seen them in Kensington Gardens; my brother said, says he, I think these people are following us.</p>
               <p>And upon that you went out of the gardens? - No, Sir, not immediately; I do not suppose we staid five minutes; and I said upon my honor I believe they are following us; so I just stepped on the green, and they followed us.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When this matter arose at Yates's, about your brother being at Price's and with Reed; did that come from him? - It did.</p>
               <p>The first you observed of these people, was when you had come out of Kensington Gardens? - Just coming out near the gate, nearest Hyde Park.</p>
               <p>After you had spoken to Yates or Yates to your brother, did you go faster than you had gone before? - Not a bit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I beg to call Mr. Burke.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke called again.</p>
               <p>You have heard the question which I have repeated, more than once, to Mr. Newman? - I have; I am exceedingly sorry I am under the disagreeable necessity of contradicting him.</p>
               <p>Is the account you gave originally true? - Absolutely true; after the discovering the mistake of the time of being at Laver's, and his having immediately sent after Mr. Yates; the first I saw of it was, Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090155"></xptr>Reilly the Tavern-keeper with Mr. Newman the prisoner, who seemed then a vast deal more agitated; and so did this young gentleman, insomuch that I believe they cried; however, I then said, Mr. Newman, do not be so warm, recollect yourself; you have time enough to recollect where you was on Tuesday; and this gentleman, his brother, and the prisoner then consulted together, where he had spent the day on Tuesday; they talked of where they had spent the day on Monday; we mentioned Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and I believe Saturday; this was between themselves; but did not seem to fix where they were on Tuesday, or how Tuesday was passed; and it was, I believe, agreed between them, that this gentleman should go out to bring word; he took his hat, and I stopped in the room, he was gone half an hour, if not more; I am sure he was gone about that time; in the time, while young Mr. Newman was gone, I again went into the passage to consult with Mr. Booth, further about the matter; I spent some time in conversation with Mr. Booth, in the passage, while Mr. Newman was gone; I told him that Mr. Newman, the brother to the prisoner, was gone to bring a certain account; I afterwards returned into the parlour, and some very immaterial conversation passed between the prisoner and myself; I sat down by the table, and this gentleman came in, took off his hat, put it on the table, sat down by the table, and made use of these words, I can now, to a certainty, account where my brother was on Tuesday, or where you was on Tuesday; I cannot say whether it was you or my brother; I said I should be exceedingly happy to know that; and when the gentleman sat himself down, he said his brother early on the day of Tuesday, he did not say morning or evening, went to Sterling's wine-vaults, in the Hay-market, drank pretty freely, got intoxicated, fell asleep, and staid there till late in the evening; I then said, Sir, is Mr. Sterling coming forward to satisfy me of that fact; the witness Newman did not say immediately, that he was immediately coming; but I understood him, and I am sure he was heard, that he had left word with Mr. Sterling's people to send him; and he expected them to send him as soon as he came in; I understood him clearly that he had been to Mr. Sterling's; he said he had left word for Mr. Sterling to come, as soon as he returned; I then said I should be very happy to attend them till Mr. Sterling came, because I should be exceedingly happy to see the point cleared up.</p>
               <p>Are you positive that he said he went there early in the day, and staid there late in the evening. -</p>
               <p>Mr. Newman. I could not say it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Does your memory serve you to say so? - I cannot recollect that I said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you deny the whole conversation? - Possibly my recollection may be so bad that I do not remember it; I am sure I did not go to Sterling's; I could not say that I had been to Sterling.</p>
               <p>Do you mean now to swear that you did not take your hat and go out and stay half an hour? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that you never went any where, but where Mr. Booth accompanied you? - I will not say, only to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Price has told us that on Sunday evening, a message was carried to his house; did not you carry that message? - Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Will you venture to swear positively that the Sunday evening, while your brother was at Mr. Yates's, you did not go to Mr. Price's: will you swear you did not come back and express yourself in the manner Mr. Burke has stated? - Yes, positively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grose. He qualifies that with the word recollection, which he seems to me to have sworn positively.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you mean now, Sir, to say, that you never was absent from that house twenty minutes during the time your brother was there? - I do not recollect that I was.</p>
               <p>Will you swear you was not at Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178909090156"></xptr>Price's in Northumberland-street? - Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that you did not say that you left a message for Sterling, and that you expected him? - I do not recollect saying any such thing; I could almost swear it; I think I did not say it; I will not swear it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. It is no other than the proof of this young man's memory.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My lord, I think it will be right to call some of the other witnesses to this fact, to contradict this young man, and to confront him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Yates called.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what Burke has stated? - He was gone out about twenty minutes, when he came back, he laid down his hat on the table, and said to his brother; I am happy, I recollect, now I have found out where you was, you was at Sterling's wine-vaults in the morning, and got drunk, and continued there till night.</p>
               <p>What more was said about that? - He said no more upon that head, but he said Mr. Sterling was coming, he was not at home; he had left word for Sterling, who was not at home, but who would come as soon as he came in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You have heard the brother say before, that he himself had past the evening with Mr. Price and Mr. Reed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then this account of this brother, that young man would contradict that? - I do not know that.</p>
               <p>If you had heard from Newman himself, that he had passed the Tuesday evening with Mr. Price and Mr. Reed; this would contradict that account! - I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>He said he was happy he had found out where his brother was on the Tuesday night? - I was in the parlour when the brother came in; he seemed to be very much concerned, and cried; he seemed to be very much agitated when he went out, but not so much when he came in.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at the Globe coffee-house, Union-street, Spitalfields, and am a poulterer. On Saturday evening, the 19th of Sep<lb></lb>tember, I was at the Angel public-house in the City-road, between six and seven o'clock in the evening—I was sober—I had been taken poorly previous to my getting there, and was very ill after I got there—I felt a violent pain in the pit of my stomach—it was a spasmodic attack—I com<lb></lb>plained of being ill, and Mrs. Allen, the landlady, made me some brandy-and water—it did not do me good—shortly after I was taken very bad—I put my elbow on the window-seat, and leaned, my head on my hand—I</p>

               <p>was very bad—a medical man was sent for, and he attended to me—there was no other person in front of the bar at that time—the landlord and landlady, and her daughter were in the bar—the prisoner came in while the doctor was with me—the doctor gave me a draught, and I had a fomenta<lb></lb>tion—a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was then sent for—the prisoner was very attentive to me dur<lb></lb>ing my illness, and when the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> came he offered his services to see me home—MR. Allen said he would be very much obliged to him if he would, or else he would get some other person—I was assisted into the <hi rend="italic">cab,</hi> and the prisoner got in too—I had received of the landlady that evening two half-crowns and a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paper of halfpence—that was twenty minutes or half an hour before the doctor came—I put the two half-crowns into my left-hand trowsers pocket—I was perfectly sensible during the whole of my illness—while I was ill my body swelled, and the doctor undid the waist-band of my trowsers—while I was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> the prisoner put his hand on my chest, and said, "How are you now, John?"—and when I was pass<lb></lb>ing Finsbury-square, to Sun-street, he put his hand on my chest, and said, "How are you now, John?"—and I felt him take his right-hand from my chest, and place it in my left-hand trowsers pocket—I had two buttons with the two half-crowns in that pocket, and he abstracted the two half-crowns, and left the two buttons—I was very much surprised at the kind<lb></lb>ness he exhibited, and very much surprised after his kindness to find him put his hand into the pocket, and take the two half-crowns—I put my hand on the outside of my pocket, and thought it was impossible he could do it—I supposed he was either a common pickpocket, or else what we call one of the <hi rend="italic">swell mob</hi>—I did not know who he was—I was sitting on the right-hand side of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—when I put my hand on my pocket I found the two half-crowns were gone—I did not say any thing to the prisoner at that time, thinking if he was what I anticipated he was he would have made his escape by some means or other—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped in Union-street, and I told the driver to drive on further, expecting I should see a policeman—I saw no policeman—the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> stopped again, and I told the driver to go on further, and the first policeman he came to to stop—we got on opposite Spitalfields station-house, which, I think, is not more than thirty yards from where I lodge—I got out there, and the prisoner did too—I then put my hand on his shoulder, and told him he had robbed me—he laughed at me—I saw a policeman coming out of the station-house—I called him, and we all went into the station-house together—the prisoner was asked there what money he had—he said, "17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.," and he took that money out—the inspector asked him if that was all—he said it was all he had—he was then searched by the constable, by order of the inspector, and two half-crowns, and some other small things were found in his left-hand trowsers pocket.</p>

               <p>done it, but I cannot tell one person I have done it to—I have no recol<lb></lb>lection of when I did it last—I cannot tell how many persons I told it to.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who provided you with those clothes since you were at the police<lb></lb>office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Myself—I paid for them—I bought them at various places—the coat I bought in Cutler-street, of a man in the street, promiscuously—I paid for it—I bought my waistcoat in the same place, but of a different person, walking about the street—I bought my stock somewhere up at the West-end, I think, but I really cannot tell the street—I bought my trow<lb></lb>sers in Cutler-street—I did not try them on in the street—I chanced them, and the coat and the waistcoat also—I have not bought all these things since I was at the police-office—I bought them, some at one time, and some at another—it is a month since I bought the coat—I was in cash, as I paid ready money for it—MR. Barton found me out at the police-office—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as an installment of the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I owed him—I had not the whole of the money I owed him—I lived in the service of Mr. John Jacobs, a poulterer, many years ago—I do not know why I left him—I was never with him on wages—I was never a servant of his—we separated—I was quite a boy—I lived with Mr. Henry Knill, in Tooley-street, many years ago—he took me before Alderman Farebrother, on a charge of stealing a fowl, or something of that kind—I believe Mr. Knill discharged me—I cannot recollect whether he did or not—he did not discharge me, Mrs. Knill did.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you take the benefit of the Insolvent Act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes.—I was remanded six months by order of the Court, for undue preference to-a cre<lb></lb>ditor—I did not hear that they used the word "fraudulent"—I was in gaol once before that, I think—no, it was since—I never was more than once—I think not more than twice, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>seldom been in the watch-house; for instance, when I went about this fowl I was in the watch-house then—I do not know how often I have been in the watch-house besides that—on the occasion of my bail I was in the watch-house, but I was never confined, to my knowledge, more than on those occasions I have named—I think I can swear I was not—I cannot recollect that I ever was confined in prison—I might have been in and out again—I have been in the Fleet and out again—I will swear I never was confined in prison but once in Whitecross-street, and once in Clerkenwell—I was in the employ of Mr. Williams—he discharged me because we could not agree—I do not know that I told a He to him also—I did not give out that I was his relative—I said he was a friend of mine—I did not say that I was related to him, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you go to him the other day, to beg, if he had heard of this business, that he would not come forward against you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not go to him—I met him in the market—I do not know that I asked him any thing of that kind—we had some conversation together—he came to me one morning, stopped me, and spoke to me—I told him we had had some little dispute together, that I was very sorry for what had occurred, and I hoped he would think no more of it—I said I had been round, and the par<lb></lb>ties in the market had heard of it, and were prejudiced against me—we had not disputed about my giving out that he was a relation of mine—we had no dispute previous to my leaving him—I cannot say that I ever said he was a relation of mine—I might have done it and forgot it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever live with one Robinson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Oh yes—I did not tell him that I was a relation of Mr. Williams, to my knowledge—I told him he was a friend of mine—I might have told him I was his relation, and forget it—if I told him so it was a rank falsehood—I ran away from Ro<lb></lb>binson in debt also—I lived in Old-street before I lived at Picton-street, Camberwell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever swear you did not know where you lived before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have lodged at a good many places—I have no idea how many places I have lived at in the last six years—I paid at all I could—I do not know how many that was, I am sure, nor how many I left unpaid—I dare say I paid half of those I lived at—I cannot recollect—I earned the money I bought these clothes with—I did not pay more than an installment to the gentleman I paid 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a-week to, because it suited me better to pay by in<lb></lb>stalments—I hawk poultry about the street—I have been unfortunate in business—I have not a shop now—I have carried poultry into public-houses to raffle—I was painted up, many years ago, and carried about the market as Guy Faux—I was over-induced to do it by a parcel of vaga<lb></lb>bonds about the market—I lived with Mr. John Smith many years ago—I do not know why I left him—he charged me with robbing him, but it was false.</p>

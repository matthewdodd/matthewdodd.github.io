                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Thomas Todd; he trades under the firm of William Todd and Son, Red Lion and Three Cranes Wharf, Upper Thames-street. On 28th Nov., I examined the lead on the wharf after looking at the book—I missed three pigs and a half, or about that quantity—I afterwards saw that lead—it was shown to me by the inspector—I can swear that they were what was missing from the wharf—the half pig was compared with another half pig—I know nothing more of the prisoner than by seeing him on board the <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi> barge, which came to the wharf on 27th Nov. with a cargo of hops, in the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I was master of the barge <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi>, from Maidstone. The prisoner came with me to the Red Lion and Three Cranes Wharf, on Thursday, 27th Nov.—the barge was discharged there—the crew consisted of Frederick Gill yard, my mate, and the prisoner was third man on board—after the barge had been discharged, we went away at 6 o'clock in the morning of 28th Nov.—we dropped down to Horselydown—the barge was at Horsely-down when the officer came on board—I know the locker and the bed cabin on board—the locker was used for timber, gear, chains, ropes, and blocks for the use of the barge—the prisoner had charge of the locker—I and the mate slept in the aft cabin—a maul was shown to me; that was generally kept in the iron locker—I did not know anything of the lead being on board—the prisoner had nothing to do with the discharge of the cargo; he was to clear away—Mr. Todd's men got the cargo out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He had no right to leave the barge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, just to get a little victuals—I have known him ten or a dozen years; I never</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the Thames police. I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Albion</hi>, at Horselydown, on 28th Nov.—when I was about to go forward, the prisoner ran and jumped before me, and sat himself down on a locker, close to his bed—I said to him, "What have you in the locker?"—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "Get up, let me tee what you have in the locker"—he said, "Nothing"—I took him by the collar, and moved him from the locker, and looking in it I found these three pigs of lead—I said, "I thought you told me there was nothing in the locker"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I then asked him if that was his bed cabin—he said, "Yes; but you will find nothing there"—I searched it, and at the foot, under his bed, I found this half pig—I said, "What do you say to the lead in your bed cabin?"—he said, "I know nothing about it"—I found this maul in the forecastle—some of the pigs of lead have been beaten by some<lb></lb>thing similar to this, and the marks effaced.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the other people do. - A. They ran away. The prisoner was searched, and nothing was found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Young man, this is a serious case, I wish you to be clear in your recollection - are you sure the prisoner at the bar is the person who snatched the watch out of your pocket. - A Yes, it was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other people by in the court. - A. There were other people in the court, but nobody nigh.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who went with you to the watch-house. - A. Only the watchman. In the mean time I was holding him, there was a person that wanted to rescue him; he went to the watchhouse; I held up my arm; and when the watchman came he ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. You never recovered your watch. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be in this court at eleven o'clock at night. - A. I was coming home from Mr. Simpson's, a public house that I use.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the watchman here. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Was not you kept in the watchhouse that night. - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken in custody to Marlborough-street. - A. Yes, the person that came to rescue the prisoner, he gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>Court. I understood you to say when you held up your arm to him he ran away. - A. Yes; he came up to the watchhouse, and said I insulted him; then he gave charge of me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What sort of a court is this, are there any improper houses there. - A. Perhaps there might.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see or meet with any girls in that court. A. There was a girl standing with two men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no girl standing with you. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand that you had no conversation with any girl in that court. - A. I did speak to a woman, I asked her how she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you intoxicated. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now let me ask you, did not you speak to this woman on purpose to accompany her home. - A. No, I did not.</p>

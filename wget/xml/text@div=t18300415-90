            . I am a sailor. I was going down the highway about eight o'clock in the evening, and saw them attack the prosecutor; the prisoner had him by the arm, and I said to him, "what are you going to do with that gentleman?" he said, "What business is that of yours? I know him and am going to take him home" - I crossed the way; they walked on to a street and pushed him down - I ran over and they all ran away; I jumped over the prosecutor, pursued the prisoner, and laid hold of him - he said, "For the love of God let me go, the other one has got the watch, not me;" he struggled very much - but I held him till the officer came; another one came back, and said, "Let him go, you will catch the other yet" - but I held him tight.</p>

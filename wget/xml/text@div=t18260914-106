            . I was in my shop on this evening, and saw the prisoner take the handkerchief from Mr. Copsey's pocket; I did not see his face, but I went to the door and saw him turn into Round-court - I told the prosecutor, and we pursued him - he turned first to the right, and then to the left - I fell down, but I got up again, and pursued; he was taken in Bedford-bury; a little girl put this handkerchief into my hand, which she said she picked up on the stop of a door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was it after he took the handkerchief, that he was stopped? A. Not three minutes - I had seen his person, and am certain it was him; I pointed him out to Copsey before I lost sight of him.</p>

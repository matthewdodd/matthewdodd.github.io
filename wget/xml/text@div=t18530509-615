                  </hi>. I am a tide waiter, of the Customs; I know the prisoner. On 25th April I gave him a bed, some bedding, a monkey skin waistcoat, two shirts, two coats, and some other things, tied up in a bundle, on the top of the bed—the bedding was rolled up, and put in a black canvass bag, and the other things were tied in a handkerchief—they were to be taken to the Fenchurch station, or to Blackwall, to go to Gravesend—I gave them to the prisoner between Waterloo and Blackfriars-bridge—I was on board a small vessel called a Billy-boy at the time—he was to take them to Fenchurch-street station, or Blackwall, to be conveyed to Gravesend—I found the bed and bedding at Gravesend the following day; they were in the bag in custody of the proper officer, who took charge of them when they arrived at their destination—the waistcoat, shirts, coats, and boots, were missing—my waistcoat and boots were produced at the Mansion House—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Russell, a pawnbroker. I produce this pair of boots and waistcoat, pawned on 26th Feb.—I took them in myself—I believe the prisoner to be the man who pawned them—I had never seen him before—I have only seen him since at the Mansion House.</p>

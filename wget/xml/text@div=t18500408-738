                  </hi>. I am the wife of Edward Rawson Clarke, of Drayton-villas, Brompton. The prisoner was in my service about twelve months—in consequence of suspicion, I caused her to be given in custody on 11th March—I sent for an officer—we proceeded to search her boxes, and in consequence of what took place she was taken to the station—I went there afterwards and saw these keys—the inspector said to the officer, "Take these keys to Mrs. Clarke's, and see if they will open any place"—the prisoner then came forward and said to me, "I hope you will forgive me, and think no more of it"—I said, "It is out of my power now"—I accompanied the policeman with the keys to my house—there were two keys on the bunch; each opened one of my wardrobes—I missed rather better than two yards of claret velvet—when the prisoner went to the station she wore a claret velvet bonnet, but I did not notice it—I have since compared them—they corre<lb></lb>spond exactly—I also missed two yards of black satin, in the piece, from the wardrobe—I matched what the officer found with mine, and it corresponded exactly, and particularly here where it has been cut(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I am positive this bonnet was made of a part of this velvet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a dressmaker and milliner, of 48, Harewood-street, Hampstead-road. I have known the prisoner three years—she and I were in service together at Mrs. Billiter's—since then I have been in service—I made this velvet bonnet for the prisoner—I have not the least doubt of it—I bought the stuff at Shoolbred's, in Tottenham-court-road, three-quarters of a yard—I paid 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it—I know my own work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, and live in Castle-street, Southwark. On 10th Oct., about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I was coming out of a public house, in Herbert's-buildings, Waterloo-road—as I was coming out, the two prisoners were standing in front of the house—M'Der<lb></lb>mott stopped me, accosted me, and challenged me for something to drink, or words to that effect, which I would not listen to—she then pushed up my</p>

               <p>hat, and gave me a very heavy blow, which stunned me, and knocked me down, and Rose caught my neck and shoulder, while M'Dermott laid hold of me, unbuttoned my waistcoat; and wrenched off my guard from my neck, and took my chain and pocket compass—I was very much injured with the fall—there were several persons behind me when this occurred, and I believe there were some persons behind them—the prisoners then rushed into the public house—I rushed in after them, and I said to M'Dermott, "You have robbed me of my chain"—she denied it, and pulled little articles out of her pocket, and put herself into a violent temper, and struck me again—she was pushed out by the people round, and she rushed out, across Waterloo-road, and then into Tower-street, and I lost sight of her—I gave information to the police, and they followed her, and brought her to the station—I was sober—I had been taking a glass or two of ale—I was able perfectly to know what I was about—I paid 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my chain, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my compass—I suppose they were worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. when I lost them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and live in Marshall-street, London-road. On Monday afternoon, 10th Oct., I was in Herbert's-build<lb></lb>ings—I saw the last witness there about half past 3 o'clock—he came out of the Half Way House—when he came out, he had a chain before him, and these two girls, the prisoners, rushed upon him, and one of them laid hold of him and pulled him down; and after she had pulled him down, she pulled the chain right off his neck, and they both ran into the house—I went to the station, and told the policeman.</p>

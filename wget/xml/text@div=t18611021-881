                  </hi>. I am an inspector of meat at Newgate-market, and have been so about thirteen years—on 20th September, my attention was called to a hamper in front of Mr. Greatrix's shop in Tylor's market; it contained four quarters of beef, the carcase of a cow—the hamper was marked on one side "G. Dawes," and on the other "Sarum"—it was packed in cloths, in the usual way in which good meat is packed for market, and dressed as a butcher would dress it—I examined it—it was in a very bad state indeed, as bad as it possibly could be in my judgment that arose from disease, and not from decomposition from the weather—if it bad been sent up fresh from Salisbury on the previous day, it could not have got into that condition—it had been fresh killed—any one with common sense could have seen the state it was in, and more particularly a butcher; he would detect it in a moment—it was totally unfit for human food—a salesman named Sims, who was selling at Mr. Greatrix's shop, called my attention to it—Mr. Greatrix's clerk gave me this note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,—I afterwards showed the meat to Dr. Letheby and to some of the other inspectors—it was also condemned by Mr. Ald. Salomons.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What part of it was not sound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The whole of it—it was all unsound, diseased—I did not see the the internal parts, only the meat.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of meat in the City of London—on the morning of 20th September, my attention was called by Fisher to some meat in a hamper—I examined it, and in my judgment it was decidedly unfit for human food—I believe the cow was very old, and in a long state of disease—the ribs were so clean, that we had no data to start from as to what disease it was—the bones would tell us that she was very old—I have been an inspector of meat about seven years—it was fresh killed—I should think it had not been killed more than a day and a night—the weather was warm at the time, but not so close as it has been since—it had not got into that condition from the weather, or from keeping.</p>

                  </hi>. I am carrier at Salisbury—I am continually in the habit of sending hampers and parcels by rail to London—on 18th September the prisoner came to me—he asked me to let him have a horse and cart to fetch a bullock or a cow from Mr. Thornton's—that is three or four miles from Salisbury—he told me the animal was alive—I let him have the horse and cart, and in three or four hours he came to my warehouse at Salis<lb></lb>bury, he then had a cow in the cart—it was dead—I saw that it had been knocked on the head and stuck—it had been slaughtered in the ordinary way—it was not dressed—he said he should want a hamper and cloths to send the meat to London—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) is my writing—I wrote it at the prisoner's request—he cannot write—he told me the form he wished to have it written in—he pinned it on the cloth—the meat was packed and sent away on 19th September to London, directed to Mr. Greatrix, Newgate Market—the carriage was 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I am not a butcher.</p>

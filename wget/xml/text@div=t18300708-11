               <p>"Mr. McCabe you had no occasion to dispute that being my hand-writing, it is mine, I acknowledge it in the presence of all parties;" he would not be satisfied - I took the receipt, and said, "To shew you it is my hand-writing," I took a pen and ink, and wrote the name over again, and said,"There is the ink wet for you;" he would not take that- a stamp was brought, and I wrote a fresh receipt; Rawlinson, his friend, proposed to have a bottle of wine each - I objected at first, not wishing to be in his company, but eventually two bottles were brought and drank, and two more sent for; there were six people in all - while we were talking together I stood at the table; the prisoner got up, and struck me in the face - I never gave him any cause for it; I got up, and struck him - he pulled a knife out of his pocket during the scuffle, and stabbed me in the ear; the three witnesses interfered -Rawlinson ran away; the Police were called in, and I gave him in charge - he was taken to the station; he was held to bail at Hatton-garden - in fact, the whole force of Hatton-garden opposed me; he was well known there - he has surrendered here.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, D</hi> 76). On Saturday, August 1st, about half-past 1, I was in Bond-street in plain clothes—I saw the prisoners there walking together, and followed them up Bond-street as far as Brook-street—they crossed over into South Moulton-street, and stood talking there two or three minutes, and then the man walked away, and the woman went further up the street and met a little girl—she stopped her, and spoke to her—the little girl shook her head—the female said something else to her, but she shook her head again and ran away from her—she then joined the male prisoner again, and walked a little further up the street, then he crossed over and she met another little girl, named Louisa Taylor—she spoke to her, and gave her something—the little girl left her, and came running past me on the opposite side of the way, and went to a stationer's shop, No. 13—she came out again—the female met her just where I was standing, and I saw the little girl give her some silver, and the prisoner give the little girl something back—she then joined the male prisoner, and they went together towards Oxford-street—I ran over and spoke to the little girl, who had gone down a court, and afterwards went into the stationer's shop—Day showed me a bad half-crown—I then went after the prisoners, and followed them into Woodstock-street, Bond-street, Brook-street, and into South Moulton-street again—they then separated, and I spoke to 317 A about the woman, and I went and took the man in custody—I told him I was a constable, and should take him into custody for being concerned with the woman, pointing to her, in passing a bad half-crown—he said, "You have made a mistake, old fellow"—I then took him across to the woman and saw her throw something from her right hand—I called out to the other constable, "Pick up that half-crown that the woman has thrown down"—he picked it up, and gave it to me at the station—we found a half-penny in the female's hand—I had hold of the man by the collar and left hand—when we were in Argyle-street a boy, named Howard, came up and said to me, "Here is something which the man you have got hold of has thrown into a cab; here is a half-crown"—I said, "Give it to the police<lb></lb>man"—there was a policeman standing close by him—the prisoner said, "Let me go; I know nothing about it; take it away boy; if you don't I will strike you;" and he endeavoured to strike him—I searched him at the the station, and found a florin, four shillings, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., all good money—the packet found in the cab was handed to me—there were two separate parcels, one contained these four half-crowns, and the other contained these eight, twelve altogether (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the loose one the boy picked up in the cab.</p>

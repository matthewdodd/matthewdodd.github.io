            . I am a news-vender, and live in Burr-street, Commercial-road. The prisoner came to me three weeks or a month before he was apprehended, and asked if I was in the habit of taking in publications: I said Yes - he said, "Of whom?" I said, "Of no one in particular;" he then asked if I would take them of Mr. Plummer - I said I did not mind: he asked what orders I would give him - I said I took in the Mirror, the Casket, and five other books; he brought them to me on the Saturday following: I paid him 1 1/2d. for the Mirror, and 1/2d. a piece for the other books - I had also two of the Weekly Dispatch newspapers of him, for which I paid him 7 1/2d, which is the trade price - the selling price is 8 1/2d. I gave information of it when a girl came to me about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you remember what day it was? A. The girl came the day before he was taken; it was the 28th of November I bought the newspapers - I recollect the occurrence exactly; I had seen the prisoner by going to the newspaper offices in the morning.</p>

            . I am a Police-officer. I took the prisoner - I made him no threat or promise; he said he wished not to be taken to the office, that he was very sorry he had robbed his master, and there was another boy who ought to be taken up as well as him, as they had shared the property between them - he would have said more, but I cautioned him not.</p>

            . I sell a great number of these pamphlets, but the prisoner was not to sell generally unless he had authority from me to execute an order; if any one gave him an order be might take it and bring it to me, but he was not to go for orders; he had no right to take them from my shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is he in the habit of accounting to your wife for any thing he takes out? A. Yes; he accounts to me, my wife, or my sister - they are not here; he never paid me for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the prisoner the misfortune to let your pony fall into a well? A. Yes, but he was forgiven for that; his mother did make an agreement to pay me, but she did not keep it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JOHN ALLMETT. Q. Is not halfpenny a piece under the trade price for these pamphlets? A. Yes; they have 1d. marked as the selling price, but I did not know the trade price - I had not been in business above three months.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How came you to know the price of the papers, and not the books? A. I had had them at the office, but never had any of the books before.</p>

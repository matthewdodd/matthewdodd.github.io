                  </hi>. I am servant at 208, St. George's Street East—I know the prisoner, he was staying at 208—it is a house where sailors stop when ashore—a sailor named Marius Caclard was stopping there—about half-past 2 o'clock on 30th May the prisoner was having dinner—a row commenced with Caclard in French, I don't know what they said—I asked Caclard what he was rowing about—he said they had had a row on board ship—the prisoner said if he could not fight him he would take a knife to him—Caclard struck the prisoner first with his fist in the head—the prisoner then got up from the dinner-table and they had a fight in the kitchen—they were fighting and jangling about, and the prisoner ran from the kitchen to the shop and came back with a sheath knife in his hand and stabbed Caclard in the shoulder—he was standing with his back to the prisoner and did not see the knife—the prisoner did not say anything when he stabbed him—Caclard ran out into the street and the prisoner after him, and he threw the knife away—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is not the knife he was eating his dinner with—I never noticed him carrying a knife in his belt—he was a little the worse for drink, Caclard was not.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 2, Spital Square—on 30th May I was called to the Leman Street station, and saw Caclard there and examined him—he had a clean-cut penetrating wound, which went through the armpit in front of the left shoulder to the collar-bone—it was a dangerous wound—it did not penetrate the cavity of the chest, but it must have been within an eighth of an inch of it; the large vessels and artery were in the immediate neighbourhood of the wound; in fact, I would not put an instrument there for anything—such a knife as this might have caused the wound, if used with considerable force; the point is very blunt—it went through the clothes—he was under my observation for a week; he was then obliged to leave because he could not pay his lodging, and I did not see him afterwards—from the serious nature of the wound his arm would be weakened, and he would be liable to <hi rend="italic">traumatic aneurism</hi> at any time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The man wanted to fight with me; I did not want to tight He asked me for some money to drink, and I would not give him any. He hit me twice, once in the eye and once behind the ear; and when 1 found the blood running, I took my knife. I always carry it; I had it with me at the time. I did not fetch it out of the other room.</p>

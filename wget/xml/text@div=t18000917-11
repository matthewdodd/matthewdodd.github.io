               <p>Q. Did you receive it that morning? - A. No; I found it was dated the 7th, and conceiving it to be the 7th of June, I went to Hackney to Mr. Wright's, a wine-merchant, where I found Pooley in company with Mr. Hindes; I informed him it was not due till the 7th, and we both looked at it, and found it was not due till the 7th, but neither of us observed that it was the 7th of May; I went with it; I received a 100l. Bank-note, a 40l. Banknote, a 50l. Bank-note, and 10l. in cash; I immediately went to the Bank with them to change them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you desired to write any thing upon the back of those notes that you wanted to get changed? - A. Yes; I wrote the name of Walsh, Kensington-Grove.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect being with him at the Fox? - A. Yes; he then informed me he had got rid of all those; I then gave him the remainder of ninety pounds, chiefly in one and two-pound notes.</p>

               <p>Q. You seem a distressed man at this time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You pawned your spoons, did not you? - A. I might want a little money at that time.</p>

               <p>Q. She has gone by the name of Sleath? - A. That was her maiden name; she has been deserted by her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell us any other name that she has gone by? - A. Her name has been Robinson.</p>
               <p>That was not her husband who deserted her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What other name? - A. She might have gone by many, for any thing I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath has she not? - A. Yes, she has.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought this transaction of the draft a very honest transaction? - A. I certainly could not think it honest.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you told of it; you informed those that were injured immediately? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been in the Post-office? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you turned out? - A. No, I turned myself out.</p>
               <p>Q. That is exactly as other great men do, they resign because they cannot keep their situations any longer; remember you are upon your oath, do you mean to say you were not turned out upon suspicion of having been concerned in taking a one hundred pound note? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor had any such thing hinted to you? - A. Yes, I had; and I resigned immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. So you were the man that changed this draft at the banker's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before or after you had been at the Post-office that you happened to serve a Mr. Dowse? - A. Before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn yourself out from his service? - A. I was brought here as a felon at that bar, on his account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you turn yourself out of the Excise? - A. It is evident now that I did, because I cannot recover it; but I would not accept it now, if they were to offer it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath were you not advertised with a reward for apprehending you? - A. I was so; the first that I saw of it was at Teignmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your good friend Sleath, alias Robinson, alias Sturgess, go with you? - A. Yes; she had embarked on board a Newcastle sailer before we had seen the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not know of your both being advertised? - A. Not at the time that we embarked from London.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took you? - A. The post-master, at Shields.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been, perhaps, in confinement ever since? - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Your business did not call you at Hackney till eleven o'clock - now I ask you, whether long before eleven o'clock, the letters are not sorted at the Post-office? - A. At this time of the year in general they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore, it was in your power, were you so disposed to go there? - A. I might go in as well as any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. You might go in and see the letters? - A. I might go in, but I could not get near them; the gentlemen would not suffer me to stop there.</p>
               <p>Q. But a great deal of effectual business may be done, before a man can get out of a room? - A. I was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been there? - A. Twice.</p>
               <p>Q. How many times have you been turned out? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You said the gentlemen would not let you stop? - A. When they demanded me to go, I went.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go for any purpose but for looking after what you could get? - A. I might have called there once, but not more.</p>
               <p>Q. You know, that for the taking this draft, you were liable to be prosecuted? - A. I am very well convinced of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You are equally well convinced of another thing, that by attributing the crime to this man, you save yourself? - A. So Mr. Parkin informed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you therefore any doubt of it? - A. Mr. Parkin told me, if I spoke the truth, I should be admitted an evidence, and that was on account of an innocent woman who knew nothing of it, or else I would not have come forward.</p>

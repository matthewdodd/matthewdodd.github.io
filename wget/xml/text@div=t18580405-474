                  </hi>. I am an architect, living at Beulah Lodge, Forest Hill. I have charge of two houses there belonging to Mary Parker, called Belle Vue Villas; they have been unoccupied for some time—some time back I introduced the prisoner to a Mr. Unwin, who is the builder of some houses close by—as the architect, I gave the prisoner the privilege of going into one of the houses to take his meals—on 14th Feb., from informa<lb></lb>tion I received, I went to the adjoining house; No. 3, I believe it is—I then</p>

               <p>found some lead pipe had been taken away—a piece of leaden pipe, used for the supply of water to the house No. 3, which had passed under the flooring and turned up at the back of the house, had been cut away just below the brick work which formed the paving of the yard—I had seen it safe about three weeks, I think, before that—the lead (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) appears to be of the same length and size as that taken away—the ends appear to be quite bright, but they are not so bright as when they were exhibited at the police court—Ishould think it had been cut by a carpenter's chisel or a very sharp instru<lb></lb>ment—thislead (<hi rend="italic">another piece</hi>) appears to correspond with the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a marine store dealer. On 20th Feb., I was going round Forest Hill with a pony and cart—the prisoner came out of a beer shop—he had some lead pipe with him—he asked me if I would buy it—I asked him if it was his own; he replied "Yes;" and he said he was going to Peckham Rye to sell it—I said I would buy it, if he would give me a receipt, with his name and address—he did so; and I bought it—I gave 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he gave me the address, "James Reynolds, Sydenham"—a police constable afterwards came and took possession of the lead; this is it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 229). On 20th February, at about half-past 10 o'clock, I took the lead which has been produced by the witness Allen—fromenquiries I made, I went to a public house at Peckham—I there saw the prisoner—I told him I wanted him concerning some lead; and I asked him where he got it from—he said it waa his own—I then took him to the station—the lead was here shown him; he repeated that it was his own—he said something about repairs being done to his house; he said he had a right to do as he liked with his own—I then went to the house at Forest Hill, No.3, Belle Vue Villas—I found some lead had been removed from the back part of the house; the cutting, was quite fresh—I cut off this other piece of lead from that remaining—I have compared it, and it fits exactly with the rest.</p>

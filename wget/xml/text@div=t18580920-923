                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, of Bermondsey. On the night of 4th September, I fastened up my house myself, and went to bed about half-past 12 o'clock, as near as possible—I was awoke about a quarter before 6 o'clock in the morning, or it might be earlier—I heard a noise at the back part of my premises—I slept in the first floor—I came down to the back parlour, and saw Donovan in the act of cutting a square of glass out of the back parlour window—he saw me, and ceased his operation—I made my way to the back parlour door, and to the kitchen, where I saw Elliott at a chest of drawers—he saw me, and they both made their escape to the yard—I pursued them, and they turned round and threw a cart-wheel down that was standing in the yard—I followed them through the stable into the open street; I gave an alarm, and an officer followed Donovan—Elliott cut across the road to a passage—I had seen the prisoners before, but not had any conversation with them—I am quite positive that they are the persons;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185809200063"></xptr>
               <p>it was broad daylight—when I came back, I examined the premises—a square of glass had been cut out of the kitchen window, by which they undid the fastening and got access into the kitchen—they had unfastened the sash—when they got in the kitchen, they opened the kitchen door to the yard—when they came to the parlour door, they found some fastening which they could not get through, so Donovan turned out of the kitchen door, and came into the yard again, and was in the act of cutting a square of glass out of the window to get into the parlour—I found a razor on the top of the drawers, and several things had been removed in the drawers—I examined the razor-case, and the razor which was on the drawers, had been removed from it—my house is in the parish of St. Mary Magdalene, Bermondsey.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, M</hi> 147). On Sunday morning, 5th September, I was on duty in London-street, Bermondsey—I saw Donovan running, and immediately heard Mr. Kemplay give an alarm—I was about ten yards from his premises—I did not see Donovan come out; I saw him running, and pursued him down two or three streets; as I was chasing him down London-street, I saw him throw something away, and after I lost sight of him I searched the spot, and I found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went to Mr. Kemplay's premises, and saw that a pane of glass had been taken out of the kitchen window, and there were marks in the putty which corresponded with the point of this knife—this is a broken table-knife with an old handle tied on it.</p>

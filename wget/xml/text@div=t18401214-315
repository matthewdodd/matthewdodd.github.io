                  </hi>. I am a journeyman plumber, and live in Paradise-place, Marylebone. On the morning of the 18th of November, I was going to work between five and six o'clock—at the corner of Homer-street in the New-road, I observed two men looking down Homer-street, and down the New-road, in what I thought a strange manner—I turned down Homer-street, and a little way down I perceived, to the best of my belief, the prisoner running from a house in that street—he quickly passed me—I thought he had something under his arm—he joined the other two men—I thought as he passed me that I had seen him before, and I went after them—I crossed on the opposite side of the way, and got between them—I then recrossed the road, and met them, and looked the prisoner full in the face—he turned round and looked after me—I had an opportunity of seeing him, so as to be able to declare, to my own belief and conscience, I con<lb></lb>sider he is the man—after I passed them he turned and looked after me, and I then perceived that he had a bundle under his arm—I was con<lb></lb>vinced I had seen him before many times—I went to my work—I after-wards heard of a robbery having taken place in Homer-street—I could not tell the number of the house the man came out of, at the time—I went to the house in question, No. 41, after hearing of the robbery, and am quite certain it was that house—I have seen the prisoner before in the neighbour-hood of Battle Bridge, at the Maidenhead public-house, and round that quarter—I made inquiry there, and at other places, and found him at a public-house in St. John-street, Smithfield, on the Saturday night after the robbery—I asked him how he did—he said, "How do you do?"—I then asked if he remembered seeing me in Homer-street, on the Wednesday morning—he said, "No," he did not—I asked him if he remembered where he was between five and six—he said, "In bed"—I asked if he remembered meeting a young man in the New-road, who looked him full in the face, and looking after him—he said, "No," it was impossible, for he was in bed at the time—I said there had been a robbery committed in Homer-street, and I was sure he was the man I saw come out of the house—he said I was wrong, that he was in bed—I gave him in charge—I firmly believe him to be the man I saw come out, to the best of my con<lb></lb>science.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. M'Gray gave the prisoner into my charge, in Smithfield, for a robbery in Homer-street—I desired him to go the station—he went readily, without resistance—he said he never did it, he was not the man, and was never in a station-house in his life—he gave me his address, "No. 3, Union-street, London-road"—I went there the same night, inquired at several No. 3's, but he was not known there—it is a street occupied by prostitutes and thieves, and low characters—I could not find him out then, but on the Tuesday morning following I found he did lodge at a No. 3 in that street, kept by a person named Jordan—the prisoner had then been admitted to bail, but I thought he was still in cus<lb></lb>tody—Thomas James went with me to the house—I saw a female there, calling herself Mrs. Jordan—she pointed out the prisoner's room to me—it was the up-stairs room—there is only one up-stairs room—there was a bed there—MRS. Jordan pointed out his bed to me, and pulled the bed down herself—I searched the clothes, and found an old jacket and a pair of trow<lb></lb>sers—in the jacket pocket I found a memorandum-book, with some bills, and a duplicate for a rosewood box, pawned at Sharwood's—I got the box from him—I applied to the different pawnbrokers, who are here, and traced out the property—this waistcoat was pawned at Griffiths', a pair of trowsers at Smellie's, and a coat at Button's.</p>

I did not tell Jordan he need not come here—I did not tell him in the indictment-office that he would not be wanted—when Mr. Roper was making the bill out I wondered that his name should be placed on the back of the bill, he being for the prisoner—MR. Roper asked me if that was all the witnesses—I said "Yes," when Jordan immediately said, "No, my name has not been called"—MR. Roper said, "How is that?"—I told him he came for the prisoner, consequently I did not suppose his name would be on the back of the indictment—that was all that took place—I did not expect his name was on the back of the in<lb></lb>dictment, I thought he was bound to appear on behalf of the prisoner, and that it was a mistake of the clerk.</p>

On the evening of the 17th he came home about six o'clock, which was his usual time—he went to bed between nine and ten—he slept in the bottom room—my husband locks the door, and takes the key up stairs of a night—he did so that night—the prisoner went out about six o'clock next morning—I go to market every morning, and, since it has been dark, the prisoner and I have gone together—I went to Duke's-place that morning for cocoa-nuts—that is over London-bridge—I left him on the bridge—I did not notice which way he went—I went down Fenchurch-street—I parted with him a little after six o'clock—I was pre<lb></lb>sent when the policeman and a man with a lame arm came to search the house—the policeman asked me if I knew where our lodger was—I said he was gone to work—the other man said I was telling a d—lie—the po<lb></lb>liceman must have heard that, for he stood at his elbow—when the police-man first searched the jacket, he did not say any thing—they looked at it, and they put it down again—they did not take any book or duplicate out of it—they put it down, took it up again, and laid it on the side of my bed, and spoke together, but what they said I do not know—they then</p>

I keep a coffee-shop in Ratcliff-highway, between London-bridge and the West India Docks—the prisoner was in the habit of breakfasting at my house, previous to going to work at the docks. On Wednesday morning, the 18th of November, he came there about five minutes after seven o'clock—he left about half-past seven, to go to the docks, which open at eight—I had a great many dock labourers there that morning—I do not know how far my house is from Homer-street, it is two miles from Cornhill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am quay-foreman at the West India Docks. The prisoner was in the Company's employ—I keep an account of the men's time in this book in my own hand-writing. On Wednesday morn<lb></lb>ing, the 18th of November, the prisoner came at half-past eight o'clock, and remained till four—he had been in my department about four months, what other department he may have been in I cannot say—he continued to attend the docks regularly after that till the 21st—he was there from half-past eight till four o'clock on the 19th.</p>

On the 3d of April they were out, and I heard a noise at their door or window - soon after that I heard a noise in the house. I went out, saw their garden gate open, and saw a light through a hole in the parlour window-shutter. In a short time I heard a noise at the window, saw it opened, and a man come out with something under his arm. He, came towards the gate, and I shut it, kept outside, and asked him what business he had there? He asked what business it was of mine. I collared him, and opened the gate; he threw the bundle behind the gate, ran back, and I with him. I held him till assistance came up. The light was put out before he came out.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GILLINGS. I live in Greengate-row, and occupy the house. On Monday, the 3d of April, I went out about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning, and left my wife at home - I did not return home again. I went to my brother's with her between ten and eleven o'clock at night, and about eleven I was fetched home, and found Phillips with the prisoner in custody. He said in the prisoner's presence,</p>
               <p>"Are those things behind the garden gate yours." I said Yes. I found no violence on the window or door.</p>

            . I was employed to nurse the prosecutor's child, and was there on Monday, the 3d of April. Gillings went out in the morning, I went out with his wife about ten o'clock at night, and took the child. I locked the door, kept the key, and shut the shutters to, but did not fasten them - they are outside; I am sure I shut the casement down - any one could open it from the street. I was the first person that entered the house after the prisoner was taken. I found the windows open, also a box and the drawers open. The articles stated in the indictment were taken out of a box which was not locked.</p>

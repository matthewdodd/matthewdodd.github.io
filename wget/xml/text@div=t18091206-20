On Saturday the 18th of November, about two o'clock, from information, I went in search of the prisoners. I found them in a court in Chancery-lane; there were three of them. I went after Fox, she was about twenty yards before the others. Underneath her apron I perceived something white. I asked her what she had got, she said nothing. I put my hand under her apron, and pulled out a piece of muslin. She told me two girls gave it her. I took her to Mr. James. I asked her where she had been to, she said that she had been to her brother in Purple-street, near Gray's-inn-lane, and she came up Chancery-lane to go to West Smithfield, and in passing by our house somebody gave her the muslin.</p>

               <p>Q. Had the prisoners been in the shop - A. I heard so, I did not see them. After I had taken Fox, I went into a public house back yard. I heard she had been there. I went in search of the fag-end of the muslin which had been torn off; I picked up a ticket which corresponded with the ticket of the same description of muslin which was bought at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen that muslin, had you seen it that day - A. I dare say I had, I cannot say positively; I believe it to be Mr. James's property.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know what I am to infer from your finding that ticket in that yard - A. By comparing this ticket with the other muslins that were bought at the same time, this corresponds with the muslin.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. James. On Saturday the 18th of November, about one o'clock, the two prisoners came into the shop, and asked to see some muslins, and after a good deal of trouble I sold them three-eighth of a yard. About twenty minutes after they went out of the shop, the prisoner Fox was brought into the shop, having a piece of muslin found upon her by the last witness.</p>

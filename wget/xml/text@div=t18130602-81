               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am a city officer. On Thursday last, the 3d of June, I was attending at the North gate of <placeName id="t18130602-81-crimeloc431">St. Paul's</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18130602-81-crimeloc431" type="placeName" value="St. Paul's"></interp>

I observed the prisoners following a gentleman, I immediately followed them through the crowd of about two or three hundred people, close behind them, with my head over their shoulders; I observed the woman (Saunders) with her hand close to a gentleman's pocket; the other closed to her, and the moment she took it out she put it into his hand, and he put it into his breeches; there was a sudden crowding at the moment, and I lost the gentleman. The prisoner Saunders went toward; the other turned round behind two gentlemen. I let them get as far as Bowles's picture shop; I then took hold of them both, and took them into a wine-vauls. In the passage they wanted to knew what I wanted; I told them to search them; Meers told me there was no occasion; he pulled it out for me. I searched her; I found nothing. I took them to the Compter, and the alderman thought proper to commit them</p>
               <p>Mees's Defence. I was at work; a young man asked me to go with him to see the children at St. Paul's. I lost him; I accidentally met Saunders; she said, here is a handkerchief which I had of a gentleman that has been with me. She gave me the handkerchief; said the gentleman gave it her. I had it not in my possession five minutes before the officer came up; I gave it him. How she got it I know not.</p>
               <p>Saunders's Defence. I am an unfortunate girl. I went down Ludgate-hill with a gentleman, he gave me two shillings, and that handkerchief to keep till night, and then he said he would give me more.</p>

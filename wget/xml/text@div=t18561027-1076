On Friday afternoon, 3rd Oct., the three prisoners came together, and the barmaid brought me a sovereign to change—(we have change constantly ready on Fridays)—I went into the bar parlour, got the change, put it on the counter, and said to Johnson, "There is your change"—it was four half crowns and two five shilling pieces—I am certain it was quite right—I turned to the barmaid, and said, "What is to be taken?"—she said, "A pint of ale"—Johnson then said, "My dear lady, you have given me half a crown short"—I said, "I am satisfied I gave you the full change; I gave you four half crowns"—he said, "You see heve is hut three"—I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in addition, and said, "There is the half crown, but you have done me out of half a crown"—they then wanted a pint of ale and some bread and cheese, but I said, "No, I will not serve you with anything more"—Holloway said to Johnson, "You owe me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and Johnson said, "Now I have got change I will pay you"—I am sure they are the men—they were in the bar more than a quarter of an hour.</p>

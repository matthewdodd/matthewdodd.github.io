On the 21st of June, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I went out of my room, fastened the parlour door, and went down to the kitchen - the street door was shut and fastened with a catch, but not locked; while I was in the kitchen I thought I heard a noise in the parlour - I came up quick, and saw the parlour door ajar, which I had locked; I pushed it open, and saw the prisoner in the parlour - he came towards me: I seized hold of the collar of his coat with both my hands, and asked what he did there - he said, "Let me go;" I said I would not, that he was a thief, and had robbed me - he insisted on my letting him go; I would not - I struggled with him in the passage for a minute or more, and then he tore my gown; I then called Murder! I had not then observed whether my drawers were open - he put his foot to mine, threw me down, and went out at the street door; I followed him immediately, and did not lose sight of him till he was taken by Sibley, the officer, who brought him back to my house- I then examined my drawer, which was open, and he went towards the drawer to throw a purse into it; I had lost from the drawer a brown silk purse, with a sovereign and a half in it - I had put it in there about an hour and a half before; the drawer was locked, and I had the key in my pocket; I did not see the purse in his hand till he went to throw it into the drawer - it was the same purse as I had lost; he tried to put it into the drawer, but it went into the officer's hands before it got to the drawer - when I came up stairs the street door was shut - it opened with a latch-key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How long had you had the purse? A. About ten years; my husband is not here - he is ill: I swear that the purse is mine - I never heard that the prisoner claimed it; I have no family nor servant: I never let any body look at my purse - there is a stitch or two dropped in it, which has caused a hole, and it is changed into different clours; I was single when I married Mr. Hall - I was only seventeen years old: I was never married to a Mr. Holmes - I do not know such a person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever see the prisoner before? A. No.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I was next door to the prosecutor's, endeavouring to apprehend a woman, and saw a man run out of her house - I heard a cry of Murder! I pursued the man directly, and finding him gain upon me, I called out Stop thief! a sort of milkman caught hold of him - he said, "I am not the thief - the thief has turned round the corner;" I still pursued the prisoner, and overtook him - he said, "I am not the thief, he is gone round the corner;" I, however, took him - the prosecutrix came up, and said, "You good for nothing rogue, how dare you enter my premises?" I searched him, and found a chisel put up his coat sleeve - I took him back to the house, searched him again, and saw a brown silk purse in his hand; I saw him heave it towards the drawer - I caught it in my hand, and the prosecutrix identified it; it contained a sovereign and a half - he threw a handkerchief away, which I lifted up, and found a key; I tried it to the parlour door, and it fitted it - I found on him a bag, with a latch-key, and that opened the street door; a boy gave me a key, which he said he found in the street.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186201060081"></xptr>
               <p>matter—I was found guilty and sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment, out of which I have served seven—before I was apprehended I was a silk dealer and manufacturer in a middling or small way of business—my house was at 4, Slater-street, Brick-lane, Bethnal-green—about February or March last, I knew the prisoner Gillett, who was in the general line; he kept a leaving shop where they lend money on articles; not a pawnbroker's—I remember seeing him early in March at my house—he came alone of his own accord into my shop and said, "Can you purchase ten bales of silk of me?"—I said, "Are they your own?" he said no, they were not his own, but he would send the men they belonged to—nothing further passed at that time—he went away after that, and about a fortnight previous to seeing him again, I saw the other two men, Edwin Torn bull and one not in custody—I did not know either of them by name—I did not afterwards ascertain what the other man's name was—I do not know Turnbull's name except by what I have been told—I never heard the other man called by name by any<lb></lb>body—they came to my house—I asked them what they wanted; they said they had come about the silk that Mr. Gillett was speaking to me about—I asked them whether they had the sample of it with them—they said, "No, but they would bring it"—there was some conversation about the silk—they asked me whether I would have anything to drink—some gin was sent for—my servant Phoebe Salmon, fetched it—one of the two men paid for it; I do not know which—a man who is not in custody came before I saw Gillett again—I did not see Gillett again till the morning the silk was in the van—I beg pardon, he came a few days after he first came; he was very tipsy, and held up a key and said that that was the thing that would get it—that was before the two men came—I thought he was joking, being tipsy—I did not know what he meant—on Thursday morning, March 14th, about half-past 6, I heard a knocking at the door—I was in bed—I put on my trousers, went down and opened the door, and saw the prisoner who is not in custody—that was the same one as I had seen before—I cannot exactly say that I ever beard his christian name—I opened the door and he came in—I had a conversation with him—he opened his coat and told me that he had a sample of the silk that he was speaking about—there was about a pound in the sample—it was China raw silk—I took possession of it—he then requested me to go up into Shoreditch—he told me for what purpose, and I consented to go with him—I told him to go up the street while I put my clothes on and I would overtake him—I did so, and we then walked together up as far as Shoreditch church or a little way past, getting into the Kingsland-road—he then pointed out a van with one horse—it was loaded and had a tarpaulin over it—it was standing opposite a coffee house in Kingsland-road—while I was there with him the prisoners Gillett, and Edwin Turnbull, came from some part by the van, but where I cannot say—they crossed to me from the direction of the van—the man who had come with me spoke to them and said, "He won't have it," alluding to me—they both said together in a breath, "You don't mean that do you?"—I said, "Yes, it is no good to me"—I had no use whatever for raw silk—I never had any dealings with it in my life, not with raw unthrown silk, which that was—there was no further conversation with reference to this silk then—we all four went into a public-house; I do not know the name of it; it is right opposite Shoreditch church—we had one quartern of brandy there—while we were there Gillett left the house, leaving me and the other two inside—we remained about four or five minutes after he left, and then Edwin Turnbull, I, and the other man went out together—the van was gone then</p>

               <p>—I was going towards my home and Turnbull told me not to be in a hurry, they wanted to have a conversation with me, would I come with them—I went with them—we walked up the Kingsland-road till we came to the Victory public-house which is in Kingsland-road—we went in there and had two quarterns of brandy and some biscuits—Edwin Turnbull did not say anything there to me about the silk, nor did the other men in his presence—nothing was said in that house about the silk—there was something said before I parted with them—as 1 was coming towards my home Mr. Turnbull asked me whether I could sell the silk for them—at the public-house Turn<lb></lb>bull asked me if I would lend them some money till the silk was sold—I said no, I could not—I do not recollect seeing any one in the Victory besides the barmaid and potman—I spoke to the barmaid in the presence of the two men—she said that I was up there very early that morning—I said, "Well, I have been taking a stroll in Victoria-perk, and that brought me here early—I cannot recollect whether I spoke to the potman—after leaving the Victory I went towards my own home, towards the Eastern Counties Railway-station—on my road, the man not in custody and Mr. Turnbull, asked me whether I would try to sell the silk for them—I said I would see about it—I then parted from them and went home—the sample was at home at my house—I remained at home up till 6 o'clock in the evening—I then saw Gillett and the man not in custody—they came to my house and asked me whether I had sold the silk or whether I had been about it—I said, "No," but I was going to try to sell it—they then left, and I went up as far as Mr. Shears' in the Dog-road, Cambridge-heath-road—he was a very large silk dealer—I am given to understand that he is now dead—I found that he had left, and I was told to go to the prisoner Hunter, who at that time kept the Red Deer public-house in the Cambridge-heath-road—I found Shears there—he was in the tap-room when I got in—I went with him into a private box in front of the bar—I saw Mr. Hunter there—I had given the sample to Mr. Shears—he gave it to Mr. Hunter—I had made a communication to Shears as to what quantity there was of it, and what price was asked for it—I did not hear Shears say anything to Hunter about the quantity—my communication to Shears was in Hunter's presence—I told Shears there was ten bales of it and it was to be sold at 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a pound, but I wanted 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Hunter said nothing to that—he said at that interview that he could sell it for us, not the least doubt—I remained there something like an hour, or an hour and a half—I asked him whether I should call there, or whether he should call at my house—nothing further took place on that Thursday, the 14th—on Friday, the 15th, I went to Hunter's again, about half-past 11 or 12 in the morning, as I was directed—I did not find Hunter at home—I stayed there, and had something to drink—it was half an hour before any one came—Mr. Hunter and Mr. Agg then drove up together in a small chaise—I was standing in the private box—I looked out at the door, and saw Agg come from the chaise to me in the private compartment, he produced the sample left with Mr. Hunter—I had some further conversation with Agg—I remained in the house ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I then left and went home again—in the course of the afternoon while I was at home, a boy came to my house to deliver a message to me, in consequence of which, I went to the railway hotel near the Eastern Counties Railway-station—that was from 4 to half-past 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I cannot say to a few minutes—I saw Agg and Hunter there—they told me they had sold the silk to Mr. Newton; Agg said, "I cannot pay for it now, I have not the</p>

               <p>money," and that Mr. Newton had not the money in London with him to pay for it then, but if I could make it right for the money, I could go down with them and receive the money myself for Mr. Agg, and they would pay my passage there and back—we were all three standing together—nothing further took place in the public-house—Sergeant Jackson was there when I went in—nothing was said in the public-house about packing the silk—after leaving the public-house I went home; I said that I would go home and con<lb></lb>sult my wife about the money, and would meet him in an hour—the same evening I was standing at my door when Gillett and the man not in custody came—that was from half-past 7 to 8 o'clock—I told them that the silk was sold, and I would meet them to have it fetched away—they told me to meet them at the Prince of Wales public-house about 9 o'clock—I do not know the name of the street in which that is—I went there about 9 o'clock and saw Gillett, Turnbull, and the one not in custody—I had a conversation with them there respecting the silk—I told them that I had sold it, and they could bring it to my brother-in-law's, and I would pay them the money as soon as I could get it—I had a brother-in-law named Barker, who lived at No. 2, Hope-street, Spitalfields—they all three went with me to Princes-street, where the silk was—I do not recollect anything being said about money on the road there—(the officers afterwards took me by the door of this place in Princes-street—it was pointed out to me, and I said, "That is the place")—I do not know whose premises those were—when we got to them we went into a stable which is at the back of a yard, down a gateway—as we passed the gate, a van was standing there—in the stable the ten bales of silk, as I supposed them to be, were shown to me—they were covered over with packing stuff like matting—it was down by the horse-manger—the tarpaulin that was covered over it was taken off, and they said, "There are the ten bales"—they were in matting like this on the ground here—a man was in the stable in his shirt sleeves—I do not know who he was—he was not either of the men at the bar—they then asked me if I would see it weighed—I said they could weigh it if they liked—a pair of scales was got, and they took the cloth off three, while I was there, and weighed them, and put them in the van, and I, and the man not in custody, came away—the man who got the scales said, "Don't make a noise"—that is the man who was in his shirt sleeves—we left and came back to the Prince of Wales public-house—we were sitting in front of the bar there when the van drove up to the door—Mr. Gillett was with it, nobody else—he got out and came inside—Edwin Turnbull came into the public-house, and I and the one not in custody came out and got up—we went to my brother-in-law's, Mr. Barker, No. 2, Hope-street—the van was unloaded there, and the silk put in the front parlour underneath the window—when it came there all the outer things had been taken off, and it was all in white calico, put into India rubber bags—it was then left at Barker's—I and the other man went back with the van to the Prince of Wales—when we got there Turnbull and the other man and Gillett were there, and I gave Edwin Turnbull 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was to give them 310<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the silk—and what there was over weight was to be reckoned as tareage—Turnbull asked me when I would give them the residue of the money—I told them I would let them have it the next day, which was the 16th, about 1 o'clock in the day—I had not the money myself to pay—I had some deeds belonging to me which I took on Saturday morning, the 16th, to Mr. Angell, a solicitor—I asked him for the amount of money which I wanted on the deeds—he said he could not let me have the amount till he had looked at them, but I could have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if I</p>

                  </hi>. In March last I kept the Gold Eagle, Agard-street, Derby—that is seventy or a hundred yards from Newton's mill, which is in Agard-street—I remember one day in March, Newton coming to the house with two other persons—Hunter was one of them, and the other I do not know—he was a light complexioned man—they came between 2 and 3 in the afternoon, and remained about half an hour talking together—I heard Newton invite them to go to his new mill—he had not been there long apparently, and they all three went out together—they were away a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, when all three returned and remained about a quarter of an hour, I cannot say to a few minutes—Mr. Newton, and the light complexioned man, went out for about half an hour and came back and joined Hunter, who had remained—they talked together and had some refreshment—while Hunter was there he told me that they were two friends of his, publicans in London—I do not remember the exact day of the month, but I heard the day afterwards, that the two men were taken in custody.</p>

I am chief constable of the borough of Derby—I went on Wednesday morning, 20th March last, to Newton's mill, in consequence of a communication I received, and there saw a quantity of silk; one bale of skeins, and the other bales were loose; they had been unpacked—the bale of skeins was not unpacked—I afterwards caused them to be removed to the Town-hall, and afterwards that silk was given up to Mumford, superintendent of the police of St. Katharine's Docks—on Thursday, 21st March, I came to London in company with Inspector Fearn—we arrived in town sometime between 4 and 5 o'clock—we first went to the Clown public-house in search of a person of the name of Agg—we were told that he was not at home—we then went to the houses of Barker and Debock, and then went back to Agg's and then he was out—we then went to Hunter's house in Cambridge-heath-road—I heard he was in the parlour opposite the bar, and I sent for him out—he came out into the bar to us—I said, "Is this Mr. Hunter?"—he said, "Yes"—I told him I should like to speak to him in private—he asked me to go up into a room which led up four or five steps into a private room above the bar—I said, "Have you been to Derby this week?"—after a minute's hesitation he said, "Yes, I have"—I said, "You went down with a person named Mr. Agg, and old Mr. Newton, on Monday night"—he said, "Yes, I did, we all went down together; old Newton got drunk and lost his portmanteau at Rugby"—I then called Inspector Fearn up into the room—I had left him down in the bar—I said, "Now, Mr. Hunter, you</p>

I am a detective officer of the City police—at the end of February or beginning of March 1861, I went to the Clown public-house to see Agg on a matter of business—during the evening he introduced Hunter—he said "My friend Mr. Hunter, he has been out licensing; he is my partner in business"—during the conversation he said, "My partner and I can get silk to any amount at any wholesale house in the City"—he said over and over again, "We can get silk to any amount"—more passed on other matters, but that was all in relation to the partnership—Hunter took part in the conversation—he said, "My friend Mr. Agg, I am very happy to see Mr. Bull, and anything I can assist him about in his affairs I shall be most happy.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. On the morning of the 8th of November, about half-past ten o'clock, Harrison called and told me there had been a robbery; we went together to Cowheel-alley, Golden-lane, into a house, and while I was in the lower part, Harrison, who was up stairs, called me up; I went up, and saw the two prisoners on the top of the stairs; Harrison said, "Do you know any thing of these two men?" I said, "I do, open that door" - I put the prisoners into the room, and there we found all this property; I said, "This will do," and we went to take the prisoners into custody; they resisted, and Kilminster said, "We are only us four here together, take the things, and let us go" - I threatened to fire on them, if they resisted any more, but made them no promise - I said No,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060096"></xptr>and handcuffed them together - Kilminster then undid his clothes, and pulled from round him this black silk gown - Kilminster then said to the other prisoner, "Turn out," and a shirt then dropped from one of them, but which, I cannot say - I thought, by his saying "Turn out," that there was some other things about him, but I only saw the shirt drop - I found in Stanley's hand a padlock and key - Harrison took the property, and I took the prisoners to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Was Stanley found on the top of the stairs? A. Yes; they were both there, close together - I have always said so.</p>

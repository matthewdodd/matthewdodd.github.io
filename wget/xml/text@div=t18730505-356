About 5.30 on the morning of 1st April, I saw the prisoner near the Prince Edward public-house, Park Road, Holloway—he had a bundle at his feet, and he put it on his shoulder when he saw me, and walked away—I looked at the house and saw the window open, and I ran after him and stopped him—he had this cruet-stand and skeleton dock in the bundle, and this pair of boots and coat—he said he had not come out of the public-house—I took the prisoner into custody and rang the landlord up afterwards—I found a mark upon the window, near the catch, and the prisoner pulled out of his pocket a chisel that corresponded with the mark—he said he had got in with it—he had the pendulum of the dock in his pocket at the time.</p>

I keep the Prince Edward public-house, in Park Road, Holloway—I went to bed about 12.30 on the evening of 1st April, having seen that the windows and shutters were all fast—about 5.30 in the morning the constable called me up, and produced the articles he found upon the prisoner, which I identified as my property—they were safe the night before.</p>

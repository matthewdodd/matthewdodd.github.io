               <p>Q. Did you ever see your watch again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was he taken up after you lost your watch? - Two weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body shew you your watch again? - Yes, the officer (Dawson) I know it by some pale gold, and some yellow gold.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any name on it? - No, it was a worked case.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it pierced? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there drawings or figures on it? - No. The chain was made of steel, worked, a woman's chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you by the appearance of the watch and chain, safely swear it to be your's? - If I was to see it I should; the constable has taken care of it. The prisoner lodged in the house at the time I missed it; when I missed it I did ask every body in the house immediately, I asked the prisoner in a minute, he said he did not know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity was he? - He was lodging in the house till he could get a place; he was in the house when I came into the house, and I was not willing to turn him away; he had no fixed bed, sometimes he slept in one bed, and sometimes in another.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How do you spell your name? -

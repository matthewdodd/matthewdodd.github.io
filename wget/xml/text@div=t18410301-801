                  </hi>. I was housemaid at No. 14, Bedford-place, when the Miss Sinclairs were there. 1 remember their leaving on the 4th of Fe<lb></lb>binary—I saw them in their bed-room between ten and eleven o'clock—I noticed that there was a bundle left in the room—neither Mrs. or Miss Sinclair gave me any instructions about its going to Mr. Learmont's—after they were gone I was going down stairs, and met the prisoner—I asked where she was going to—she said she was going up to Mrs. Sinclair's bed-room for a parcel which was left there by Mrs. Sinclair to be divided be<lb></lb>tween her and me—I followed her into the bed-room, and she was taking up some old slippers which were lying there, she said they were left for her, and I might have part of them if I wished—I asked her where was the parcel she said Mrs. Sinclair had left to be divided between us—she rose up from the slippers, looked round the room, and the parcel was on the bed—she said, "This must be it, there is no other in the room;" and said to me, "Bring it down stairs "I did so, and put it on a slab at the bottom of the stairs—I then went to a ring at the door-bell—a few minutes afterwards I went down to the kitchen floor, and the bundle was not on the slab then—there is a bed-room on the kitchen floor, which the prisoner and I occupied—I went in, and found her there with this tippet in her hand, looking at it—the pair of cuffs, the dressing-gown, and towel were on the bed—I said, "Mrs. Sinclair could never have given you this tippet"—she said, "Yes, she did"—she said Mrs. Sinclair had promised her the tippet; as she had got a bad cold, she was to wear it—I took the dressing-gown in my hand, and said, as Mrs. Sinclair had left the parcel to be divided between us, I would have the dressing-gown—she then said Mrs. Sinclair had left the parcel all for her, and I should have none—we bad some words about it that night, and on Friday morning also—Miss Wright then heard us, and tent down to us—she took the whole of the things, and wrote to Miss Sinclair.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did Miss Sinclair tell you that Mr. Learmont's servant would fetch the parcel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she gave me no instructions about it—I was in the bed-room when Miss Sinclair was, but Mrs. Sinclair was in the drawing-room—the parcel was wrapped up in the towel—I believe the box and bird-cage were in the little room—when I took up the dress<lb></lb>ing-gown, the prisoner said, "That does not belong to you"—I said, if Mrs. Sinclair had left it to be divided between us it was very unfair, and I did not see why I did not have my share—the prisoner took up, the things directly Miss Wright called to have them brought up, and she said then that she was to have the tippet and cuffs—I said the fairest way was to sell the things, and divide the money—she said she would not give them up—Mr. Learmont's servant came next day—I did not deliver to him the bird-cage and box.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 14, Bedford-place. Mrs. Sinclair and her nieces had resided at my house for two months—on the 4th of Febru<lb></lb>ary the prisoner was in my service as cook—the morning after Mrs. Sin<lb></lb>clair</p>

               <p>went, in consequence of hearing a dispute I rang the bell—the man-servant came up, and afterwards Ellen—I afterwards saw the prisoner—I asked her what all the noise was about—she said that Mrs. Sinclair had given her a gown of the value of 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and she had given Ellen two old gowns worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; and the things that were left were to be equally divided between them—I then ordered her to bring the things up immediately—I saw the tippet, and having a doubt about it, I said I should keep it in my possession till I wrote to Mrs. Sinclair, which I did that evening—Mrs. Sinclair did not write to me again, but I heard from her through Mr. White, a gentleman who resided in the house—it must have been on Monday—the prisoner was given into custody the same day the letter came—the po<lb></lb>liceman was sent for late in the evening—I received the message when Mr. White came home to dinner at five o'clock.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

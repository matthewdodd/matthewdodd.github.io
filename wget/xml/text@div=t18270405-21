On the 19th of March, about ten minutes or a quarter past eleven o'clock at night, I was in High Holborn, going home; I was perfectly sober - four or five young men met me, and shoved me about, one from another, telling me not to be in a hurry - they first came to me between Little Queen-street and Newton-street; they kept pushing me about till I got to Newton-street, which is in my way home - I live at No. 10, Charles-street, Drury-lane; I turned down <placeName id="t18270405-21-crimeloc116">Newton-street</placeName>

I am fifty-seven years old.</p>
               <p>DANIEL REARDON. I am a patrol. I heard the cry of Stop thief! on the night of the 19th of March - I was in Drury-lane - I went from there into Charles-street, which runs into Drury-lane, and saw the prisoner running towards me, with two or three others, who appeared to be in his company; the prisoner was first - I stopped him; he said, "Oh, let me go - it was not me;" I said, "Stop till the man comes up," as I saw the prosecutor coming up, calling Stop thief! he said then, "Oh, let me go - I have only got his hat;" I immediately took the hat off his head, and there was a handkerchief in it; the prosecutor came up, and said he was the man; I saw Suttie, a patrol, search him at the watch-house, and two half-crown pieces were found in his breeches pocket; Cooper's eye was very much cut, and his face all over blood; the prisoner had a stick when I took him; I went back to Charle-street afterwards, and near the spot where I took him I found the spectacles and case, on the ground. Cooper had not said he was robbed of two half-crowns before the prisoner was searched. I produce the hat, spectacles, and stick.</p>

               <p>WM. COOPER. This is my hat, handkerchief, and spectacles - there is no mark on the half-crowns.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Charles-street, and saw the prosecutor laying on the pavement; there was a hat six or seven yards from him - I took it up, and put it on, having none of my own. I walked along - he sang out Stop thief! the patrol stopped me, and asked what I had done - I said I had this man's hat; they asked him, at the watch-house, if he had lost any money - he said Yes, a shilling or two - they then asked if he had lost any half crowns - he said Yes, he thought he had - he was quite drunk.</p>
               <p>D. REARDON. The prosecutor was very weak, but quite sober.</p>

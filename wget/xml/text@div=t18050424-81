            ? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the prisoner for some time past been in your father's service? - A. Yes, better than a twelvemonth.</p>
               <p>Q. Your father has lately taken a new shop in Oxford-road? - A. Yes, about five years ago, he has now two shops in Oxford-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You, and the prisoner, and another servant, continue at the old shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On Saturday, the 9th of March, did you, by order of your father, send out the other servants, leaving only the prisoner in the shop? - A. Yes, that was between seven and eight; I went out with a small parcel to the other shop, and there I saw my father. In consequence of what my father told me, I went back to the old shop.</p>

               <p>Q. You have a till-book, is it the business of the person taking money in the shop to enter it there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the till-book here? - A. No, I examined the till-book, I found no entry of it there; I asked him if any person had been in the shop; he told me he had taken two shillings for goblets, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. For what purpose did you examine the till-book? - A. For what my father had informed me. Accordingly, a short time after, I took the till-book, and asked him if there was any more to set down, in order to settle the money, as I always do of a Saturday night; I then asked him if there was any thing more to set down in that book; he said, no, he had given me all; he then went out of the accompting-house to put his great coat on to go home; at that interval my father came in, I went out for a Police officer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned with the Police officer, did you hear your father say any thing to the prisoner? - A. My father asked him for the three shillings that he had taken for the three tumblers; he put his hand into his pocket, and said he was going to put that down; he then took out half-a-crown and sixpence, and gave it for the tumblers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you not know that this man's memory was impaired? - A. He was generally very forgetful.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You really believe he had a bad memory? - A. Yes.</p>

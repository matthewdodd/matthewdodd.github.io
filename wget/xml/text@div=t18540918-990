                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Spalding, a stationer, at Ken<lb></lb>sington. On that day, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner Thomas came in—he asked for a dozen of stamps and a "Bradshaw's Guide"—he handed me a 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece—I saw it was bad—I asked him how many more he had got about him—he said he did not know what I meant—I bent the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in his presence, and consulted with a next door neighbour—I sent for a constable, and gave him into custody—I gave the constable the crown after I had marked it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 164). I took Thomas into custody, and got a bad crown from the last witness—I saw Forbes, who was thirty or forty yards from Mr. Spalding's—I knew Forbes before; I took hold of him, and told him I should charge him with being concerned with Thomas—he said he knew nothing of Thomas—he struggled, but I detained him till assistance came, and he threw five half crowns down while he was on the ground—George Rowley picked them up, and I told him to take them to the station, which he did, and he gave me five counterfeit half crowns and two good halfpence—Thomas gave his address No. 19, Queen-street, Covent-garden—I went there, and inquired, but could not hear anything of him.</p>

I saw the last witness seize hold of Forbes—he asked what he was taken for, and resisted—during the struggle I saw him put his hand in his left hand trowsers pocket, and take these half crowns out in paper—they came into the road—I took them up, and gave them to the last witness.</p>

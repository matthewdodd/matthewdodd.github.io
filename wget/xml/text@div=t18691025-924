                  </hi>. I am a pork butcher—on the 20th September I was lodging at Mr. Winterbottom's public-house, at Jewry Street, Aldgate—between 10 and 11 that evening I was in Fenchurch Street—I had been drinking with two friends—I met the two prisoners; they took me down a little court, and said they wanted to talk to me—I had a gold watch in my waistcoat pocket—there was no chain attached to it—they stood still and talked to me—one of them put her hand in my waistcoat pocket—I looked, and found my watch was gone—I said, "You have got my watch"—Wilson said, "No, I have not got it"—they then went away, and I followed them for a little while, and a gentleman came up and spoke to me—this is my watch (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it about a couple of days afterwards at the Mansion House.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shipbroker's clerk, and life at 230, Queen's Road, Dalston—on 20th September I was walking down Jewry Street, Aldgate, and saw the two prisoners and the prosecutor come out of Northumberland Alley—they crossed the road, and the man followed—the prisoner Smith turned to the left, when she came out of the alley, and Wilson erased the road, and the prosecutor crossed after her, caught hold of her, and said, "You have stolen my watch"—she said, "I have not"—I went up to his side, and he said, "This woman has stolen my watch"—Wilson called to Smith, and Smith went alongside of her, and I distinctly saw her pass the watch to Smith—I left the prosecutor holding Wilson, and followed Smith some distance—she went up towards Fenchurch Street</p>

I am going to Liverpool Street"—I told the cabman to drive to the Seething Lane Station—she got out of the cab then, and I followed her through Fenchurch Street and Aldgate—she turned into Houndsditch, on the left band side of the way—a policeman was about fifty yards distant—she crossed the road by Aldgate Church, and I saw her throw the watch into the churchyard—I then called to the constable—another witness got over and got the watch, and handed it through to the constable—Smith was taken into custody—I afterwards went with the officer Hawkes, to Birdcage Walk, Bethnal Green—I there saw Wilson, and pointed her out—she was taken into custody, and charged with stealing the watch—she said she did not do it.</p>

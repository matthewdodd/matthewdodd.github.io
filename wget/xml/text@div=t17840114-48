               <p>Produces the handkerchief. I took this from Clarke, at the office in Bow-street, he had tied his irons up with it, and the hat he had upon his head.</p>
               <p>How came you to send word to the prosecutor when you had taken these men up? They had given information at the office of the robbery.</p>
               <p>Court. When the prosecutor came into the office were there many people in the room? - I do not think there were; the prisoners were at the bar.</p>
               <p>Did he say he knew them? - No, but the wife of another prosecutor who was with them swore to Clarke, I know nothing about Randall.</p>
               <p>The hat and handkerchief deposed to by the prosecutor; one side of the handkerchief was quite hemmed, and the other only half: the batter is here that made the bat.</p>
               <p>A cutlass produced that was taken from Clarke.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Clarke. There is no doubt but the officers belonging to Bow-street have told the gentlemen already what they shall say before they come here.</p>
               <p>Carpmeal. Clarke is one of the returned transports, as soon as we went into the room he snapped a pistol at us, which luckily did not go off; the prosecutor desired the handkerchief might be taken off, he said, if it was his handkerchief there was a little bit that was not hemmed, he looked at it, and it was so.</p>

               <p>On the 14th of December last, me and my wife, and Godliffe Hartman went down to Lee Bridge, we came from there about half past four o'clock, we came through Hackney and crossed the fields by the shoulder of Mutton and Cat, coming through the last field, before we came to the turnpike road, which is the last field in Shoreditch parish, we met a man, and I wished him a good night, and he wished me a good night, and in about a minute my wife turned again and said they are coming; there was nobody with him, but another was running by the rails; there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178401140065"></xptr> were then two of them; I stopped and cried halloo! he said, halloo, damn your eyes, stop! one of them came up to me and put the point of his cutlass to my breast.</p>
               <p>Court. Forbear to mention any thing of your own robbery, because we are now on the robbery of that man only? - I saw Clarke take the hat off Hartman's head.</p>
               <p>You are positively sure he is the man? - I am sure he is; and Randall took his two handkerchiefs from his neck.</p>
               <p>Are you equally positive to his person? - I have recollected him since he was examined at the Justice's, and to all the ideas I can form in my remembrance, he certainly is the person.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Clarke. He particularly marked that hat then, more than all the rest.</p>

               <p>Was the pistol charged? - Yes, here is what it was charged with; pieces of lead and a glass of a pair of buttons, something of that sort; we secured him.</p>

               <p>I lost my shirt; I suspected the prisoner, and watched for him; I sat in the back room without a light, with an oak stick; and in about an hour and a half the prisoner came in; looked at my wife who was behind the door; he surveyed the linen; I saw him perfectly well; my wife went to the fire; he withdrew; she went to her station again; he advanced again and waved his right hand towards the line, but could reach nothing; and he went out; in about three minutes he came in with a hook stick and looked round the room, and tried the aprons; they were tied to the lines; he put the stick under a wet shirt, and lifted it an inch or two; he continued raising it; at last he got it about as high as himself, and drew it with himself out of the door; I flew across the room, and took him immediately; he dropped the shirt; this is the shirt; it is mine.</p>

Just as we came out, one of the females said, "There is a man going to be locked up." I said "Oh!" and saw three policemen, and one with a roll of carpet. On Thursday night I was at the Elephant and Castle, and a policeman tapped me on the shoulder, and said, "Is your name Warre? "I said, "No; my name is William North." He said, "I want you for a robbery." I said, "I have done no robbery." I went down with him to the station. He said, "You know something of a roll of Brussels carpet?" I said, "No." He said, "Do you know a man named Farrell?" I said "No;" and then I remembered the man I saw a New-street with a roll of carpet. I said, "I do remember seeing a man with a roll of carpet with the policeman." He said, "That is the man." I thought they had taken me for that man. They are mistaken. I am inno<lb></lb>cent.

                  </hi>. I am a seaman; the prisoner was my shipmate. On Monday, 30th June, he and I went to Hurley and Smith's, in Houndsditch, to try on some clothes—I was about to try on a waistcoat; I had a silver watch with a guard round my neck—I took it off—I received it and the guard instead of prize-money, of the sloop <hi rend="italic">Pantaloon</hi>, from Mr. Davis, the navy-agent—I was to receive 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in consequence of the capture of three slavers in the Mozambique Channel, and he proposed to me to take some money and some clothes—he deals in those sort of goods in his house—I do not know whether he keeps any other shop—he lives in Lyon's-inn—I took 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in clothes and this watch—he put the value of 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the watch and chain—he has got clothes at the back of hit office—it is separated off, it is not a room—for the rest of the money I got a short blue cloth jacket, a satin waistcoat, and a pair of blue trowsers, this monkey-jacket that I have on, and a monkey-jacket and waistcoat that I gave to the prisoner—he wanted clothes, and I gave them him—he was not entitled to prize-money, he was only a shipmate of mine in the ship <hi rend="italic">Dauntless</hi>, coming from the Mauritius—Mr. Davis gave me an account of those things, and I signed it at Somerset-house in his presence, at the Admiralty-office, and Mr. Davis kept it—he did not give me any account; I got the clothes and the watch—the same day I lost it, last Monday week, 30th June, I and the pri<lb></lb>soner went to Hurley and Smith's, in Houndsditch—I took off my watch and chain, and gave it to Mr. Boshuck—I then went up-stairs, and remained there about ten minutes—when I came down the prisoner was gone, and my watch and guard also—it was very nearly 1 o'clock—we had been drinking a little, but were neither of us drunk—the prisoner came up-stairs and said he would wait for me, and he went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman to Messrs. Hurley and Smith, in Houndsditch. On 30th June, Johnson and the prisoner came to the shop—Johnson took off his watch to try a waistcoat on—he laid the watch on the counter, and the prisoner took it up, opened it, and looked at it—I do not know whether he returned it, for my fellow-warehouseman came back; I transferred them to him, and went to my dinner—I did not see the watch on the prisoner afterwards.</p>

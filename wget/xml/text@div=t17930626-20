               <p>Q. Was he never in the yard from the 1st to the 18th? - Not to my knowledge; when I met him I was leading a horse up in my hand, and I met him coming down the lane, he had been in the yard during the time I was out, so I saw him coming along and I looked at him, and I found he had my property on him; I sent for a constable and he took them into possession.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know the breeches? - By the marks, I am quite sure they are my breeches, the constable

               <p>I know nothing more than being sent for to take this man into custody; I have got the breeches and have had them ever since. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No man can speak a word against my character, except about these breeches; about the 17th of May I left two pair of old breeches in that place which were not worth much; on the 3d of June or 4th, I went to see for my breeches and could not find them, by looking about I found these in the hostry and took these to put them on while I had another pair mended; I takes these to the breeches maker's, which the prosecutor knows at the time I changed them, afterwards I wore these breeches and did not know but they were my own when I took them. I have no witnesses because I expected it would have been made up, because I sent a person to Mr. Fossit yesterday morning, and he said it would come to nothing.</p>

But as soon as he was got out of the Door, he mist the Box, and going back, charged them with it. They told him he should not have it again, except he would pay 17 s. which he was forced to give 'em a Note for, and then they returned him the Box. Corket in her Defence said, that Sterling pawn'd the Box to her for 10 s. that he spent in Drams, (with which he treated all Comers) 5 s. that she lent him, and 2 s. that Bridger lent him. She called some Witnesses, who said that they believed her to be an industrious Woman.

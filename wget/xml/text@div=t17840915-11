               <p>I know the prisoner too well, she came into my shop the 21st day of August, and took a wooden box which had five half guineas in it, the box stood on a chest behind the counter; about five in the afternoon she came in with two more women in company with her, she went behind the counter, and put her hand and took the box.</p>
               <p>Did you see her take it? - No, I saw her put it into the hands of one of the other women, and I saw that woman put it into the hands of the third, I stood upon a little desk upon a shelf behind the counter, she went round the counter upon a pretence of looking at a weather-glass which hung up, I spoke to all three of them directly, they run out of the door, I followed them and made an out-cry, I stopped the woman that the box was giving to at first, the prisoner I found about seven, somewhere about a hundred yards distant, and stopped her and brought her back; when I stopped her, she said, I have not it, yon woman has it, several times over, and the woman that had the money threw it down; the prisoner is the real thief, the other made her escape.</p>
               <p>Are you quite positive that you saw this woman hand the box? - Yes, I am; three half-guineas were picked up in the street, and one in the area at the next door, and the box was picked up in the street, one was lost, here is the box with four half-guineas. (The box produced.) It has been in my son's possession ever since.</p>

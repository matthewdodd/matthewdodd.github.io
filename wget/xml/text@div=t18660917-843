                  </hi>. I am a stoker—on 27th August, about one in the morning, I was in Prince's Street, Ratcliff Highway—I went into a coffee-house in St. George's Street, and when I came out the prisoners and three other men followed after me; one caught me by the throat, and one got behind me and pulled me down, and Smith cut my pocket out with a knife Higgins was holding me by the throat, almost choking me—Smith took my money from my pocket, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I shouted "Police!"and they ran away; they were caught—I am sure the prisoners are two of the men—I was quite sober.</p>

                  </hi> (Policeman N 192). On the night of 27th August, about a quarter to one, I was at the corner of St. George's Street and Prince's Street, and saw Smith and another man (not Higgins) in company—they turned up Prince's Street—I said, "Where are you going to?"—they said, "We are going home"—the moment afterwards I heard some one calling out "Murder!" and "Police!" and I ran after Smith round the square; just as I caught hold of him he put this pocket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) through the rail—I took him to the station—the prosecutor came there some time afterwards and identified him as the one who cut his pocket out—he also identified the pocket—from information I received from the pro<lb></lb>secutor, I went back and apprehended Higgins in the same street, about 100 yards from the place where this happened—I took him to the station, placed him with five others, and the prosecutor picked him out—I told him the charge; he said, "I know nothing of it."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). Higgins was behind me when he seized me by the throat; but I saw them walking up the street before they caught me—I am quite sure he is the man—there was nothing but gas-light there—I am perfectly sure these two are the men who attacked me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoners' Statements before the Magistrate read</hi>:—Smith says, "I was going down the highway, two of us together, I and another man not here—a man came running down the street, and put the pocket into my hand, and walked ahead of me, and past the constable—I heard fellows singing out, 'Police!'—the man who was with me said, 'The money has been stolen; give it to the man who gave it to you'—the policeman asked him where he was going; the other said something—I walked on the policeman followed me up—I saw him running—I had the pocket in my hand, and threw it down—I know the man well enough who gave me the pocket—I have not seen him since." Higgins says, "I was locked out of a boarding-house that night—a shipmate of mine can certify that I know nothing about it."</p>

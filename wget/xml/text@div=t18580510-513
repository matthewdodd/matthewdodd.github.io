                  </hi>. I am a stationer, of No. 3, Worcester Place, Upper Thames Street. The prisoner was in my employ as commission traveller—it was his duty to bring orders, which I sent by my men to the respective customers—I gave a month's credit, and, at the end of the month, on this money being paid to the prisoner, it was his duty to bring it to me—Ialways sent a printed invoice with all goods, with my name on it—the pri<lb></lb>soner left my employ some time in Feb., on the same night that these accounts became due, and three or four days afterwards I received these three letters (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from him, without any address; a week or a fortnight afterwards I received this account; they are all in the prisoner's handwriting—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is not the invoice I sent to Longman's; it has the prisoner's signature on it—I did not make it out; I supplied the paper to Longman's—Iwent to the prisoner while he was weighing it, and I weighed a part of it—it came to 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and was then sent to Mr. Longman, with a printed bill head, which was produced to me in the place of mine; it is not in my writing, and is for a larger sum—the bill that I made out I gave to the prisoner—I also supplied Houlston and Co. with some paper, amounting to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner never paid me this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or this 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there has been 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. discount taken off the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>about 12th March—the goods were sent to Messrs. Longman about 18th Feb., and would have become due the latter end of March—it must have been the latter end of Feb. when the prisoner left, and this list was sent to me about a week or ten days afterwards—he was not exactly engaged to me, he used to sell for other houses as well; it was his own connection—the arrange<lb></lb>ment was not that I was to provide the goods and he the connection, and that the profits of the goods above a certain price were to be divided between us—hiscommission was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. percent.—he bought no job lots for me, nor has he ever told me that I was entitled to half the profit upon them in pursuance of an agreement between us—I dare say I have known him three years—I know Almar and Son; the prisoner never bought a job lot of them and told me that I was entitled to half—I think I had one small transaction with them through the prisoner; I do not recollect whether it was for goods which I had sent to them; I recollect the name very well, but forget what transac<lb></lb>tion it was—I know Mr. Plant—I have had no transaction with him through the prisoner—I do not recollect the name of Phillips—the prisoner never paid any money over to me; I do not suppose he paid me more than three items while he was with me—he has had money on account; he has overdrawn his commission account—there have been several transactions between us, but not such a great many—he had money on account from me, and, in addition to that, he detained the money he had from customers—that has been going on for a considerable time, but I was not aware of his having money in his hands which he received from customers—the first time he retained money, to my knowledge, was the time he left this list on my desk—I cannot say what the earliest date is of the receipt of moneys by him which he has not paid over to me, because I have not the bill-heads, but I should think it is about three months ago; they were, at all events, moneys which were due before he left—the earliest is Silverlock's, that became due about 4th Feb., and I inquired about the money on the morning he left the paper on my desk—I did not inquire of Silverlock's whether it was paid, till I found out other items being received—Whittaker's account was due on 4th Feb.; I made no inquiry about that, till this paper was sent in to me—it may have been sent early in March, but I cannot recollect the day; I cannot say what time it was sent in—I know a person named Briggs; I do not recollect any transac<lb></lb>tions with him through the prisoner—I have only sent Briggs about 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boiler-maker, of Derwent-street, East Greenwich. On Saturday night, 22d Sept., about a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I was alone on the Creek-road, which leads to the Creek-bridge, at Deptford—I had 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within a few halfpence in my waistcoat-pocket—when I was near the bridge, the prisoner came up to me, took hold of my arm, and insisted on my going with him—I looked in his face, and said, "I want nothing of you; you have not been in my company, and I want to have nothing to do with you"—I then turned to avoid him, and got away—he then came up to me suddenly, and said, "You have got money, and I will have it"—I said, "You shall not have it"—I told him the money was my mate's and my own, and I had to take 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to my mate's wife—I got away from him, and he came after me unawares, and caught me somewhere in the ankle and the back of my head, and knocked me down, knelt on me, and kicked me in the nose and mouth, and when I found he would take my life if I did not give him the money, I hallooed "Murder!" and put my hand in my pocket, folded the money up in my hand, and rolled on the side where the money was—the prisoner felt all round the other side of me—Mr. Bond and the policeman then came to my assistance—I received injuries about the loins, the back of my head was cut very much where it fell on the stones; and my eyes, nose, and mouth, were also very much cut by his kicking me—I had never seen him before—he appeared sober.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a poulterer, and live at 3, Church-street, Dept<lb></lb>ford. On this night I was at my father's house in the Creek-road, and about twenty minutes past twelve o'clock I heard a cry of "Murder!" I ran out, and saw the prisoner kneeling on Towner and striking him—he made a kick at him, but instead of kicking him he kicked me—I immediately pulled the prisoner off—he ran up the road, calling" Police!"—I ran after him, caught him, and with assistance kept him till the police came—he knocked me down and tore my coat—he said if he had his <hi rend="italic">pricker</hi>, or dagger, or <hi rend="italic">sticker</hi>, he would pot an end to his b—y life—I think he said <hi rend="italic">sticker</hi>—Towner had been drinking a little, but knew what he was about.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant, R</hi> 40). I heard a cry of" Murder! "and" Police! "went in the direction, and found the prisoner in the act of running away—he had his arms up, as if he was going to make a start—I saw Towner bleeding, and all over mud and dirt—he pointed out the prisoner, and said he had assaulted and attempted to rob him—I said he must go with me—he was very obstreperous going along, and I was obliged to get a man and the prosecutor to assist me—the prisoner kicked the prosecutor as we went along, and said he should like to kill the b—r, and said, "If I live to get out of the station I shall mark you; I shall serve you out"—I con<lb></lb>sider Towner was perfectly sober, but he was so injured that he had the appearance of being not so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> What did I say? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That you should like to kill him—I suppose you meant Towner and not yourself—you had had some drink, but knew what you were about—the prosecutor was so weak from the injuries that he was led home, passed on from one policeman to another on their beats. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was going through the streets to my quarters, and met the prosecutor, and asked where I could get some drink; he said, "Go to hell, you b—y soldier!"" <hi rend="italic">Shove on</hi>, you red-coated fool! "and used words of a most exciting nature, my temper could not resist it, and I turned back and struck him till he fell; when he was down, he cried" Murder!

Graham said No, and Jackman denied having received it - she made use of the most out of the way sort of oaths, and swore I had not; I said, "Well, ma'am, I will wish you good night, keep the money, and I will go away, and say no more about it;" I attempted to go away, and told

             I should stop no longer - Jackman had a candle in her hand; Gray was standing there, and at the time I made to  go to the door Hyams stood there - she came up and said,"Oh, you cannot go, Sir;" I said, "What have I done? what do you detain me for?" and Jackman immediately blew out the candle - before she blew out the candle she had her left hand on my collar, pushing me back, and the other two women held me hard - I attempted to go down stairs, but Jackman never let go of my collar, and struck me a violent blow in the eye; I received several blows - she is the only woman who struck me, but the other women scraped at me - they all of them fastened on my collar, pulled my coat over my shoulders, scratched my face, and held my throat; the blood came down in torrents from every part of my face - I attempted to get down stairs all I could, but I could not get their hands off my collar; I screamed out Murder! and dragged myself down backwards - Jackman was holding me by the collar with one hand all the time, and striking me as hard as she could, like a man - with great difficulty I got down; Hyams and Jackman stuck to me particularly till I got down to the landing - when I got down to the first floor landing I saw a reflection of light from a room; I looked about as well I could, and saw three men coming up - they began pushing me, beating me about the head, and asking me what I did there - I was screaming Murder and Robbery! all the time - when the men came behind my back I found Jackman's hand in my pocket - the men came behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Jackman's hand in your pocket before the men came up, or after? A. She attempted it before, but after the men came up I caught her hand in my pocket- I held it, and cried out Murder! - she tore my waistcoat from my back in getting out her hand, and got my money out of my pocket; my waistcoat pocket was turned inside out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the men? A. To the best of my knowledge, Hayward struck me on the lip as I came down; after screaming for a considerable time at the door, calling Murder and Robbery! and knocking and kicking at the door, and they using very sort of language to me, the door was opened, as if by magic, and I got out into the street; I found I had lost all the silver in my pocket - I had about 21s., in shillings and sixpences, loose in my pocket when I went into the house; I know that twenty minutes before I had 21s. - I afterwards found a Policeman, and gave him information; he returned with me to the house immediately, and I pointed out the persons who had robbed me - the prisoners were taken into custody immediately in the house; they were sitting in the kitchen, quite composed, as if nothing had happened - they were all four there, with another young man, but the Magistrate let him go, as I considered he was not one of them; I had given 2s. for the bed, and 5 1/2d. for the ale, and when I met Gray I treated her with a glass of port; Gray hallooed out Robbery and Murder! and took my part as well as she could- I had thirty-eight sovereigns wrapped in a piece of newspaper in my watch-pocket; I did not lose them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were quite sober and collected? A. I consider so - I have brought my waistcoat here on purpose to show the Judge and Jury- I am gate-keeper at one of the East India warehouses now; I am not married - business had called me out; I believe Gray to be a respectable person in the character she was - I do not know the sign of the house where we had the glass of port; I did not treat myself with any thing - it was perhaps a hundred yards from the house; it was a public-house - I did not sit down; I paid 4d. for the port.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you were robbed of the thirtyeight sovereigns? A. I did - I never swore it; I put my hand to all my pockets, (and in the deranged state of mind that I was in, I was all blood, and could scarcely see out of my eyes - I felt round all my pockets,) where I am in the habit of keeping money, and could find none; I told the Policeman I had lost both silver and gold - he asked how many sovereigns I had lost; I said I had thirty-eight, not that I was robbed of thirty-eight - I did not swear positively to the male prisoner at the office, and I do not now- I swore to the best of my knowledge; I was in such a deranged state; I did not know but I was stuck with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Might you not then be mistaken about the man? A. No - the man came and met me about three stairs high, struck me behind, and when I called Murder! Jackman struck me in the lip; I was beat and scratched by the women, and nearly choked before the men came behind me- by the reflection of the light on the stairs, Hayward is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the people endeavouring to keep you in the house till you paid 2s. for the trouble you had given them? A. I paid 2s., and treated her with half-and-half.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you mention a word of the quantity of silver you had lost till a sum of silver was found on one of them? A. The sovereigns which I thought I had lost absorbed my mind, for they were only entrusted to me; I said I had lost all the silver and gold I had - I did not hear what silver was found on the prisoner; I said I had lost 18s. or 18s. 6d., or something there about - I stated that when I went before the Magistrate, but I told the Policeman I had lost all the silver and gold I had; it was the sovereigns that were my greatest trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300034"></xptr>Q. The sovereigns in your fob would make a pretty good bulk; did you not feel them? A. I put my hands all round, and never till three o'clock, when I got home, and threw my trousers down, did I find that the sovereigns were still in my fob - I did not feel them before; you must consider that the blood was flowing from my wounds - I did not swear to the man who was discharged as being one of them; when the Policeman called next morning, I said,"There are my sovereigns, thank God! I don't care about the rest - I have lost 18s. or 18s. 6d.;" they had not searched me at the station-house at night - I left the station about twenty-five minutes after the robbery, and stated that they had robbed me of all my silver and gold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you a watch about you? A. No, nor any pocket-book; I had a pocket-handkerchief, which was not lost - I was leaving Gray behind me at first; I told her I should go - they were preventing my going down stairs.</p>

             GRAY. I met the prosecutor on the night of the 26th of June, and went with him to this house - he was not intoxicated; I had been there before, and knew Mrs. Jackman - I have seen Hayward at the house - he lives there; we went up stairs - Graham followed us up; I told her we wanted a bed for the night, if she would take 2s.; she said she would go down, and ask her mistress - the prosecutor pulled out a handfull of silver, and gave her two sixpences and a shilling; she brought the 2s. up again, and gave it to him - Mrs. Jackman came up; I said, "Mrs. Jackman, won't you take 2s. for the bed?" she said, "Yes, I did not know it was you, or I would have taken it at first;" the prosecutor gave her 5 1/2d. to get a pint of half-and-half, and gave her 2s. again for the bed- he gave it to Jackman; Graham was gone out then -Jackman went and fetched a pint of half-and-half; we all drank of it - she put the bottom sheet on the bed, and said,"Has the gentleman given you any thing?" I said,"Never mind that, if he has not, he will;" the gentleman then said, "I shall not stop here;" Jackman said, "You have not paid for the bed yet, Sir;" he said he had, but she was welcome to the 2s., he should not stop at all - she called up the servant, and said, "Graham has this gentleman paid you for the bed?" Graham said, "No, ma'am, he has not," and then two girls came into the room - one of them took the gentleman by the collar, and said, "Why do'nt you pay for the bed?" he said, "I have paid it - you let me go;" the candle was then either put out or knocked out, I do not know which; Mrs. Jackman and they together, pulled the gentleman down stairs, and I was left there in the dark by myself - when they got nearly to the bottom of the stairs, I looked down, and there were three men there as well as the women: at the time the prosecutor paid the 2s. to Jackman, he pulled all his money out in his hand - I cannot form a judgment how much there was; it was silver - I did not see any half-crowns among it; I could not distinguish the men at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the prosecutor before? A. Never; nothing was said about what he was to give me - we went to a public-house at the corner of Fann-street, where I had a glass of port, which he paid 4d. or 5d. for; I never saw his gold - we did not sit down in the public-house; I do not know the name of it - I had met him about a quarter of an hour; I do not know the time exactly - I did not stop long enough to see who the men were on the stairs; I never said there were but two men - I was fetched to the station about six o'clock in the morning; Mrs. Jackman told them where to find me, and desired I should be sent for.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. About ten minutes before two o'clock, on the morning of the 26th of June, the prosecutor met me in Goswell-street - he was in a dreadful state, bleeding from his eye-brows completely all down his front; his waistcoat was torn all down - I did not notice whether the pocket was turned out; he told me he had been with a young woman, and the parties in the house had robbed him of all he had - I accompanied him to the house, knocked at the door, and Jackman opened it; I went in, and called the prosecutor to follow me - I said, "Now point out which is the person who robbed you;" he pointed to Jackman, and said, "That is the person who blew out the candle and began the attack, and the others aided and assisted;" he pointed out Hayward among the rest - he said he had thirty-eight sovereigns, and had been robbed of the whole that he had; I called my fellow-servant while I went up stairs to search, and when I came down I took them all to the station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear that McFarlin said positively that Hayward was one of the parties? A. I do positively - I was at the office when he was sworn; he said there, to the best of his knowledge, Hayward was one - he said no more at the station; I mean to say that he pointed him out - in the agitated state he was in he said he was the man, but when he came to himself, he said to the best of his knowledge; he was standing by in the station-house when they were being searched - I searched Graham and Hyams, and found nothing; he was present when Jackman was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any particular sum that he had lost in silver till she was searched? A. No, he did not - I cannot say whether he saw what silver was found on her; he might be about two yards off - there was a light; there was 18s. 11 1/2d. found on Jackman - it was handed to the inspector, but not to the prosecutor; it was handed to the inspector, who counted it - the prosecutor was not actually near enough to see what it was; he was within two yards - I mean to say it could be done without his seeing what it was; it was handed between the rails to the inspector-I did not search the prosecutor; I cannot say how long he staid there, because I returned to search the house - we never search prosecutors.</p>

            . I am a Policeman, and assisted Jones. The prisoners were all taken into custody; I asked Jackman who did it - she hesitated, and said she did not know; I said it was impossible for her not to know who did it, and who brought him to the house - she said Country Polly brought him there; I asked where she lived; she said somewhere in Playhouse-yard - she said Graham knew a little about it; I said, "Well, I shall take you all to the station;" I searched her pocket, which was behind her, and found 18s. 11 1/2d. - the prosecutor said at the station that he had been robbed of thirty-eight sovereigns, but he spoke in that flurried way I could hardly hear how many he said; I heard nothing of silver till we were at the Police-office on the Monday - I considered they were charged with stealing the sovereigns.</p>
               <p>Hayward's Defence. I am totally innocent; I was in bed at the time, and saw nothing of the prosecutor till he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300035"></xptr>came in with the Policeman - I knew nothing of the thirtyeight sovereigns till I went to the station-house; I was not taken into custody, I followed behind - at the station the prosecutor swore a young man who was taken with me was the man that hit him on the stairs; I thought I was detained for belonging to the house, but at Worship-street I heard a different statement, that he had been robbed of 18s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Jackman's Defence. I am as innocent as a baby unborn - what he has sworn is very false.</p>
               <p>Hyams' Defence. I was not in the house when it was done; I came in just after the Policeman.</p>

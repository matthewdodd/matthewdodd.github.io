               <p>JOHN MORGAN. I live in James-street, Bedford-row. On the 10th of February, about a quarter before nine o'clock in the evening, I was going home; as I passed the Sheriff's office, at the top of <placeName id="t18180218-99-crimeloc526">Bedford-row</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18180218-99-crimeloc526" type="placeName" value="Bedford-row"></interp>

I missed my handkerchief, and seized him, took him to a shop door, at the corner of Hand-court, just at that moment, a gentleman said here is what you lost; the gentleman picked up my handkerchief, about a yard and a half from the prisoner. I had not taken him twenty yards from where I missed it; nobody had passed the place but him-it is impossible any body but him, could have taken it - I had felt it safe as I crossed Brownlow-street - I felt him take it.</p>

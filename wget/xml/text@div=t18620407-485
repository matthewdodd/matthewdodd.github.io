I am a pawnbroker, in the service of Mr. Edward Carter, of Bear-lane, Greenwich—on 11th March, about half-past 6 in the evening, the prisoner came to pledge three spoons and a fork, for 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I asked her whose they were—she said they belonged to her mistress—I asked her mistress's name—she said Smith, and she lived at 7, Creome's-hill-grove—I said, "If they belong to your mistress you had better go and fetch a note,</p>

               <p>and then I will lend you the money"—she said she could very easily do that—she went out of the shop, and never returned again, leaving the property on the counter with me—I communicated with the police next day; but nothing was heard of her til a fortnight ago, when I met her in Trafalgar-road, Greenwich—I followed her to her matter's house, and then communi<lb></lb>cated with the police again.</p>

I went to Miss Martin's on 29th March, and she went with me to the pawnbroker's—I afterwards went back and saw the prisoner; she was living there as servant—I told her that I should take her into custody on a charge of stealing some silver spoons and a fork, which were found at the pawnbroker's—she said, "I know nothing at all about them; I was not out on that night at all"—I had told her the day and the hour—I said, "Put on your things, and come with me to the pawnbroker's"—she did so, accompanied by Miss Martin—the witness identi<lb></lb>fied the prisoner as the person who had offered the things in pledge—I then took her to the station, and she was charged and remanded—on the Friday following I went to the prosecutrix's house and unlocked a box, with a key that I found on the prisoner, and found in it six pocket-handkerchiefs, some rice, and a quantity of lump-sugar.</p>

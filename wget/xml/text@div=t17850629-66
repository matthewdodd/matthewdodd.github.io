               <p>Mr. Garrow. Speak out and remember you have just taken an oath? - The prisoner was apprentice to my father, I remember Miss M'Farlen going out about six, the prisoner was at home, I went out after seven and left the prisoner at home then in the parlour; there was a gentleman in the house that lodges in the one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Had you heard any noise like the breaking open any places before you went out at seven? - I had been ill in bed, and I had business to go out upon.</p>
               <p>How near was your apartment to her's? - Mine is in the parlour, and the lady's is up two pair of stairs, I returned at eleven, and I did not find the prisoner at home; I did not go up stairs till Miss M'Farlen called me, I saw her first at the street door, or in my apartment which is the parlour, I did not let her in.</p>
               <p>When she came in, did you tell her any thing about the state of her apartment? - I did not know anything till she called me up stairs.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner come home again that evening? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you first see him again? - After he was in custody.</p>
               <p>How was he dressed when he was in custody? - In a green coat.</p>
               <p>Had he anything new on? - Not that I perceived, I heard that he had new things on.</p>
               <p>Had you seen any of those things which he had on when he was in custody, before this robbery, upon your oath? - Not to my knowledge, that is all I know about it, the prosecutrix said, if the prisoner would give up the property, she would drop the prosecution, and my father and me, and two or three more went down to Tothill-fields.</p>

               <p>Are you quite sure that it was the prisoner? - Upon my word and my oath I have no doubt about it, I told him before the Justice, says he, I had no bundle, nor had nobody with me, this was about eight, he was about a quarter of an hour in the house.</p>

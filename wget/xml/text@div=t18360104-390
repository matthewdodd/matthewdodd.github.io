                  </hi>. I live in Park-place, Blackheath. I took some pigs to Blackheath fair for sale on the 12th of October—I had amongst them a litter of seven, which were six weeks old—I did not sell one of the young ones—in the evening 1 opened the pen to let them go home—some boys ran in among them, and frightened them—we got some of them in—while we were getting them in, Ford told me I had lost a pig—it was a black and white one—this is it—I know it is mine, I bred it my self.</p>

About 9 o'clock on the night of 17th May I was on duty at Lewisham, and saw the three prisoners and another man, in a cart, come over Lewisham Bridge and pull up at the Roebuck public-house—they all got out of the cart and went into the public-house—while they were in there., I went and looked in the cart, and then crossed the road and spoke to another officer—after a little time one of the prisoners, I think Muggeridge, came out, and led the horse round to the wall; he then went into the public-house again—after a short time he came out, and stood by the side of the cart two or three minutes—I went up to him and said "Do you belong to this cart?"—he said "Yes"—I said "What have you got in the cart?"—he said "I don't know, you had better ask the carman"—I went to the public-house door and asked for the carman, when Robert Lodge came to the door, followed by Thomas Lodge and Coombes, who has been discharged—I asked Robert if he belonged to the cart—he said "Yes"—I said "What have you got in the cart?"—he said "Nothing"—I said "Yes you have, we will look"—I went and let down the tail-board, and there I saw four large rolls of something lying at the bottom of the cart, and five rolls of elastic in a sack—I asked where he got them from—he said that two men had engaged him in Shoreditch to bring them down to the Roebuck, and that they brought them out of a court; but he did not know the name of the men, nor yet the name of the court—I asked Thomas Lodge and Coombes if they knew anything about it—they said they had only come with the carman for a ride—I then took them all into custody—I produce a part of the goods I found in the cart.</p>

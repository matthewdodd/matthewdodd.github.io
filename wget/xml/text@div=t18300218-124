            . I am beadle of St. Martin's in the Fields. Last Saturday evening, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner in Long-acre, with an umbrella - I was carrying a bedstead, and told Dowding, who was with me, to stop him- he struggled with him very much; I put down the bedstead, and helped to secure him - I took the umbrella from him, and asked where he got it - he said he should not tell me; he was taken to the office, and told the Magistrate that he had given 6s. for it in Waterloo-road - that was not taken down; he was coming towards Newport-market, from Drury-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long was it before he was taken? A. Not a minute; I was about fifty yards from him - I did not hear him at the time he was taken, say he had bought it; I asked him to let me look at it - he said he should not.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DOWDING. I stopped the prisoner last Saturday, at seven o'clock, and asked where he got the umbrella from; he would not tell me - I endeavoured to get it from him: he struggled very much - he did not say he had bought it; I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you mean by struggling, his refusal to give up the umbrella? A. Yes - he did not tell me he had bought it in Waterlon-road: he would not satisfy us how he came by it - he did not try to get away.</p>

This umbrella is mine - it is my own make; I saw it safe on Saturday evening, the 13th of February, between four and five o'clock - it stood in my back shop; mine is a corner shop - it was within a yard of the side door in Ryder-street: it is my own make - it is a particular kind of umbrella; I had sold it, and it was brought back to be altered.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you have a great many? A. No, my business is mostly in sticks; I had three or four dozens of this particular sort - I only know it by its being my own make; I have not sold many of this description, not one within the last month - I only know it by its make and general appearance; it was brought back by a gentleman on the 13th, between four and five o'clock, and left on our counter; I was not out of the shop that night: I have not another to match it in the shop; my sister acts as my shopwoman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming from work about half-past six o'clock; a man over in the Waterloo-road, dressed in a blue coat and white apron, had three umbrel<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180058"></xptr>las under his arm - I wanted to buy one, and asked him the price; he showed me this, and asked 9s. - I bid him 5s.; he said he could not take it - I walked on, and he called me back; I gave him 6s. for it, and in half an hour, as I came down Long-acre, the officer stopped me, and asked how I got it - I told him I gave 6s. for it, and he took me.</p>
               <p>GEORGE DOWDING. I stopped him close to Rose-street, at the St. Martin's-lane end of Long-acre; I found half a crown on him - he was going towards St. Martin's-lane.</p>

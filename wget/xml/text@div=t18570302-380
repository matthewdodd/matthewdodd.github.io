                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Henry Withers, a hosier, of No. 9, Poultry. On the afternoon of 26th Feb., I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner come in, take this handkerchief off the side of the counter, place it in his trowsers pocket, and walk away—I ran out after him; he had got two doors off—I brought him back again—he took the handker<lb></lb>chief out of his pocket, threw it in the doorway, and said, "I have not got it"—he then offered to pay for it, and said, "How much is it?"—I saw him searched, and he had not a <hi rend="italic">sous</hi> about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was in liquor at the time; I had been drinking all the after<lb></lb>noon; there was a female who had half a crown pf mine, and she went into the shop, and put it on the counter; I went to get it, and she threw the handkerchief at me; I had no intention of stealing it; I did not know what I was doing. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He was perfectly sober—there was no other person in the shop; there was no female there until the officer came in, and took the prisoner, and then a woman from the crowd outside came and asked what he had been doing, and seemed to sympathise with him.</p>

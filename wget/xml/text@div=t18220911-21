On the 29th of July, about ten o'clock at night, I was in my shop, and heard a crack at the window; it was quite dark. My shop lamps are gas, they were lit, and the two shopman were in the shop. I put on my hat, went out at the private door, into the street, and saw the prisoner at the window - I am sure he is the man. I walked past him, and perceived him fumbling at the corner of the window. Two men were at the corner of the street all the time, about three or four yards from the window. I passed the prisoner; crossed to the other side of the way; he left the window and looked in at the shop-door. I continued on the opposite side, and saw him walk round the window, return again, then walk up Parliament-street, and return to the window several times for the space of three quarters of an hour. I kept walking about, frequently passing him. I was on the opposite side of the way, and perceived him put his hand in, and take something out of the window, which I thought were handkerchiefs. I knocked him down with my fist, and these handkerchiefs fell on my neighbour's steps, out of his hand. I took him and the handkerchiefs into the shop, sent for a constable, and gave him in charge. A pane of glass was broken, and the glass out, near where the handkerchiefs had lain. I know the glass was entire an hour before. I missed eleven black handkerchiefs, all in a piece from near the broken glass, and seven coloured ladies' handkerchiefs. I understand from several people that he has born a good character till within three months.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not other people standing at the window for full half an hour - A. Nobody but yourself, and the two by the post. I saw no others in the street. It was near eleven o'clock. They are worth 50 s.</p>

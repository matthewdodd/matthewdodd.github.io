               <p>THOMAS ROBERTS. I saw the two prisoners on the morning of the 23d of May, in Oxford-road; they followed a gentleman up Bond-street, and then they followed the gentleman whose handkerchief they took - I saw Keys take it from his pocket in <placeName id="t18290611-303-crimeloc1602">Cavendish-square</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner BARRY. Q. Where did you see me first? A. There were three of you sitting on a stool near Argyle-street.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN MURRAY. I was with Roberts, and saw the prisoners in Oxford-street; I knew Barry, and watched them - I saw Keys take the handkerchief, and give it to Barry; I took Barry, but he got away - I took him again, and he got away again; I pursued him to Cavendish-square, and secured him - he threw the handkerchief over some rails; the gentleman came and said it was his, and that he lived in Pitt-street - they both acknowledged in the office that one took it, and the other received it; I am a fancy steel-worker - I do not make a practice of taking people in the street, but if I see a felony committed I take the persons; I was a constable twelve months ago, and have been with Roberts before.</p>
               <p>BARRY'S Defence. I was going along, and this man called out, "I will have you two boys," he came and took us - I do not know what he meant.</p>

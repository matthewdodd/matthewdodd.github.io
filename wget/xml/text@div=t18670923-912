About half-past six on Tues<lb></lb>day morning, 3rd September, I was called by the last witness—I accom<lb></lb>panied her to 3, Milstead Terrace, and went to the first-floor back bed-room, where I saw the deceased lying on the bed—the prisoner was stand<lb></lb>ing over her, his right hand was placed on her forehead, and his left hand on her breast—at that time she was living—I saw that her throat was cut—there was no one else in the room besides the prisoner and the woman—I said, "Who did this?"—the prisoner said, "I did it"—I said, "You will consider yourself in my custody"—he said, "Shall I have to put on my clothes?" I said, "Yes"—he had on a pair of slippers and a pair of light kind of drawers—I then went with him down stairs into the front parlour—I there asked him what he did it with—he said, "I will give it you"—he went to a cupboard at the side of the fireplace, and, taking the knife I now produce from off the top of the cupboard, he said, M That is it," at the same time handing it to me—there was wet blood on the blade at the time—I believe it is a knife used by curriers—I remained with the prisoner in the front parlour until the doctor came—while the doctor wm up stairs the prisoner said he hoped she would die—some one then came down stairs and said that she was dead—the prisoner asked me if I would allow him to go and see her—I allowed him to do so—I went into the room before him—he asked me to stand on one side, so as he could get to the bed, and he leant over the head of the bed and kissed the deceased—I then took him down stairs again into the front parlour—he went to the mantelpiece, took this letter marked A, and handed it to me—there are two letters in one envelope; the envelope was, as it is now, not fastened—when he handed it to me he asked me if I would post it to his brother—he said, "I have not sealed it up, as I thought it might want to be read"—he afterwards said he wrote the letters himself, and they were written in French—I remained there with him ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and then took him to the station and charged him with the willful murder of <hi rend="italic">Emma</hi> Snow; that was a mistake in the name—he made some answer, which I did not understand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of 759, Old Kent Road—I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—on the morning in question, about a quarter-past six, I was called to No. 3, Milstead Terrace—I went into the room up stairs where the deceased was living—she was lying on the bed—she was still alive, but insensible—she had an incised wound on the throat, commencing under the angle of the right jaw, and extending down<lb></lb>wards in a slanting direction to the left side, partly across and dividing the windpipe and several of the blood-vessels—it was about six inches in length, and from one to two inches in depth—she survived about a minute;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230101"></xptr>
               <p>in fact, she was hardly living when I went in—she died from that wound—the knife produced would be likely to produce the wound—I left the room immediately after the deceased died, and upon proceeding down stairs I met the prisoner on the stairs with the constable—the stairs were rather dark, and I said to the constable, "Who is this you have with you?"—he said, "This is the man who did it, sir"—the prisoner from behind the constable said, "Yes, I am the man"—I allowed him to pass me on the staircase—he proceeded up stairs, and I followed him—he went into the room, and said to some one on his way, "Allow me to pass"—he went forward to the bed where the deceased was lying, leant over her, and kissed her—he then went out of the room, and said to some one on the landing, "I have written a letter to my brother, telling him what to do, after I have carried out my plan, with any of the children that may be left; some one (<hi rend="italic">mentioning a name which I forget; indeed, I did not hear it precisely at the time</hi>) will translate the answer"—he then kissed one o£ the children that was brought to him, and walked down stairs—I followed him—he sat down on a chair and took out his pipe—the constable was there all the time—immediately I got into the room I asked the constable where the instrument was with which the crime was committed—the constable took it out of his pocket—it was wrapped in a piece of paper—it was then covered with blood, coagu<lb></lb>lated, not dry, moist blood—the prisoner immediately got up from his seat, came over to where the policeman and I were standing, the policeman hav<lb></lb>ing the knife in his hand, and I was looking at it—the prisoner immediately said, "Yes, that is the knife, you know, that I brought home on Saturday on purpose to do it with"—after looking at the knife a little time I went to the bed where the crime was committed, and, as the wound in the throat had rather a peculiar direction, I said, speaking more to myself than any<lb></lb>body else, "I wonder how the body was lying when the crime was com<lb></lb>mitted"—the prisoner immediately got up from the chair, where he had sat down again, came over to me, and said, "I will show you all about it, sir"—he then proceeded to tell me how the crime was committed—he said, "I got up about four, it must have been four, but my wife awoke and re<lb></lb>quested me to come to bed again, as it was too early, she thought; I did so, and waited a little time until she fell asleep again. I then arose cautiously, stood in front of her, kissed her, shook her hand, and drew the knife in this manner," imitating the movement with his hand, from left to right of himself, but from right to left of the body—he drew his hand across a supposititious throat, across the bed, where the neck had been lying—"Then," he said, "the blood came, which I did not expect"—I said to him, "Did not you know that there was blood in a human body?"—he said "Oh yes, I knew that"—I said, "Then did not you expect it from your wife?—he said, "No, I can't say that I did"—he then said, "She looked, towards the door of the room in which the children were lying" (he pointed to the room with his hand as he said this), "as if intending to go there, but of course my plan was that she should die, so I went over to the door," and he proceeded then from the bedside to the door to show me how he preventing her from getting into room, as if Tie were acting it over again—he said, "Then she went up stairs, left the room; I now intended to cut my own throat, but the blood prevented me"—I said, "How? the sight of it?"—he said, "No, it stood up," at the same time putting his hand to his throat, he brought it forward and then took it back again immediately, as if it had come against a supposititious barrier, as if he had come against a pillar of blood that stood up—he then said, "Of course I</p>

               <p>cannot do it now; some one will have to come and cut my throat now because I cannot do it; I ought to have done it in another way, but had no material"—I said, "Fire-arms?"—he said, "Yes, I suppose so," or some<lb></lb>thing to that effect—I think he said, "Yes, it must have been"—after that he sat down again—I think he said, when drawing the knife, that it was very hard to do—I said, "Whatever made you think of doing such a thing?"—he said, "It was necessity, sir; it was necessary to do it; in fact," he said, and then stopped and hesitated a moment—I said, "You look upon it as a duty, I suppose?"—he said, "Decidedly, it was right, wasn't it?"—I said, "No, I don't think so; how did you consider it a necessity for you to do it?"—he said, "I will not tell you now"—the constable then handed me this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner at that time had sat down—some little time had elapsed—I was speaking to the constable about when the other constables would arrive, the prisoner was smoking, and when he heard the letter mentioned he got up again and said, "Yes, I wrote that letter on Sunday night," and he again repeated what he had said up stairs about what his brother was to do with the children, in fact repeated the contents of the letter shortly—he said, "I only wrote it on Sunday night, although I had made up my mind to kill myself for a fortnight before that, but I could not part from my wife, therefore I determined that she should die too and go along with me, as also the children"—I think that was all that he said—I asked him a little about his health—I made him sit down in a chair, and asked him how he had been for some time—he said, "Bad; very bad"—he did not mention the disease—he said he had been operated upon—I then asked him how he felt his head at the present time—he immediately said, "Oh! You know I am not insane"—I looked at his tongue, and felt his pulse, and asked how lie had been for some months, such questions as a medical man would put—I asked him if he had sweated at night lately—he said, "Well, I think I have"—I asked him how his mouth was in the morning when he got out of bed—he said, "Very dry"—I said, "Parched?"—he said, "Yes, exceedingly so"—I asked him as to the state of his appetite, which he said was bad—I asked if he had any singing noises in his ears—he said he thought he had; he was not very sure about that—I asked how long it was since the operation was performed—he could not tell me the precise time—he told me what the operation was—I mentioned the name of the disease—he did not know the name of it—I said, "It must have been fistula in <hi rend="italic">ano</hi>"—he said, "I think that was it"—I think that was almost all that he said; perhaps he said some other things—several of the deceased's arteries were severed—in a wound of that kind I should think the blood would not spurt, I should say not in the direction of the prisoner, it might spurt out against the chin—I should say it would not spurt out; the veins were separated as well, but the veins do not spurt—the arteries that were severed were the external carotid artery, the lingual artery, the facial artery, and the superior thyroid artery; the edges of the wound might stop the blood from spurting—I examined the body; there was no evidence of spurting—I did not find a spot of blood on the prisoner—there was a little on the sleeve, as if it had been rubbed off on another body with blood on it.</p>

               <p>years as a science—I am a surgeon and physician likewise—I did not ascertain at that time that the prisoner had been under the care of Dr. Rowland for fistula—I knew that he had been under the care of some one, but not of Dr. Gowland—I have had no communication with Dr. Gowland, or with any medical person—I do not even know him by sight—I do not know that the gentleman sitting near you is Dr. Gowland—fistula is a disease of a very distressing and depressing nature; the state of system upon which it depends is of a very distressing nature; it is connected with the tubercular or consumptive state of system, which is of a very depressing nature—the disease is the result of a state of system; of dis<lb></lb>organisation of the general system—some diseases have a more depres<lb></lb>sing effect upon the mental energies than others—it depends upon the time they continue—fistula adds to the already existing depression by being a source of irritation—I trace the disease back to the general system, and this, superadded to the existing irritation, makes it worse: taking the facts of this case as they came within my knowledge, I have formed an opinion as to whether or no they indicate insanity—I have formed the opinion that the prisoner was insane at the time the act was committed; that he was insane at the time I was speaking to him and conversing with him, and I should say insane at the time that he com<lb></lb>mitted the act.</p>

POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then is his stating that, the fact which leads you to believe that this man was insane? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not his merely stating that; I take a variety of symptoms into consideration, his manner, his appear<lb></lb>ance—I believe there was in him a complete absence or deficiency of vo<lb></lb>lition of control over that perverted form of thought; in fact, his will was in abeyance, and his reason had become the advocate of his delusion—there was a complete absence of volition of control over that perverted train of thought, and over the acts which were expressions of that per<lb></lb>verted form of thought; over those acts, of which this crime was one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Tell me a single fact in the case which you say indicates insanity, with the exception of the one you have mentioned, that it was necessary he should die? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The illusion of the blood standing up as a barrier; that constituted another delusion; it was first a delusion of the senses, and then became a delusion of the mind, because he believed in it—I have met with sane persons who have been dreadfully frightened at the sight of blood, and that have almost fainted at the sight of it; I have done it myself when first brought in contact with it—his appearance also in<lb></lb>dicated insanity—he did not appear then as he does now; he appeared pretty much the same, but very different in one respect; he had an ab<lb></lb>stracted appearance, a vacant look, without any moroseness or anything of that kind; I judged from his appearance and manner—his tone of voice was that of a man who was thoroughly satisfied with what he had done,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186709230104"></xptr>
               <p>and expected to be appreciated for it—his manner was that of a cool man—I could not imagine a sane man smoking a pipe and behaving with the coolness that he did—there was also his previous history—I inquired into that—I inquired into his previous state of health and his then existing state of health; it was that of a man in extremely bad health, a man who was undoubtedly labouring under consumption, and consumptive at the present time—he told me he had written the letters on the Sunday night—the 1st September, the date of the letter, was Sun<lb></lb>day. (<hi rend="italic">The letter was read to the witness by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>.) The let<lb></lb>ter is apparently inconsistent with insanity, but it is thoroughly con<lb></lb>sistent with insane persons, because in insanity, even in mania itself, where delusions are many and manifold, the memory is never lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say the letter is inconsistent with insanity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Apparently so, with persons' ideas of insanity, but not inconsistent with the insane themselves; it is apparently inconsistent, to those who do not know insane persons, to the geueral belief of what insanity is, but the memory is not lost in insanity; in fact, insane persons have written books and described their own insanity; there are plenty of books that have been written by persons who have beeu thirteen years insane; they remember everything, but the will is in abeyance, that is insanity.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say one of your grounds is that he spoke of doing this act as a necessity? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the passage in the letter where he says, "It is with the greatest regret that I am about to commit the crime," is not inconsistent with insanity, because in my own personal ex<lb></lb>perience insane persons have regretted the act—it is within my experience that a man who does a thing from necessity would call it a crime; I could perhaps explain it better by example, cases where it has happened, than by answering the question—the passage where he alludes to his children being taunted as the children of a murderer I believe to be thoroughly consistent with insanity; I have had examples of it; it is not only con<lb></lb>sistent, but it has occurred before, in maniacs with many delusions—it shows that his memory of the language is correct; that he knew what he was going to do—it does not show a clear knowledge that he knew right from wrong, not from my experience of the insane; it only proves to me that his memory was in active operation; that he remembered when he wrote that letter that persons considered it a crime—it is consistent with and always occurs in delusion that the persons probably do know they are about to commit a crime, because, as I have said, the memory is not lost; the reason is only perverted, and it advocates the delusion—I should, say from the letters that he did know he was about to commit a crime, the crime of murder—I have been in practice eight years—I have had practice among lunatics—I am now a general practitioner—I have had experience in the treatment of lunatics—I am treating two now in my general prac<lb></lb>tice—I have heard as one of the facts in this case that the prisoner went to his work up to the Saturday.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you a member both of the College of Surgeons and Physicians? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am—in the course of my experience I should think several hundreds of cases of iusane persons have come under my cognisauce—when I said the prisoner knew he was about to commit the crime of murder, I meant the act that would deprive a human being of life; an imbecile knows that it is a crime, a person who is <hi rend="italic">non coapot mentis</hi> from his birth would know that; I should expect an idiot to know it was a crime, and still do it—he did the act for the purpose of causing</p>

               <p>death—judging from the letter, one would suppose that he knew he was committing a crime against the law of God and man, but I don't believe he thought so—judging from the letter, one would naturally conclude so, and I should conclude so <hi rend="italic">primd facie</hi>, but my knowledge of insanity tells me that he did not; from my experience of the insane, and what I have seen them write, and do after writing, I should say that he did not think it was a crime, although he used the word—from his expression in the letter, "If in any case one can so call it," and from his saying he thought it his duty to do it, it is decidedly my belief that he had not the power to appreciate the legal quality of the act which he was about to do—as to the expression in the letter, "Let the gentlemen of the Jury, who will make inquiry over me, not return a verdict that this man was insane," I should have been disappointed if he had not written it; insane men in<lb></lb>variably say they are not insane—his answer to me when I asked him about the state of his head, "I am not insane; don't think that," was an additional proof to me that he was insane; it was not so much the sen<lb></lb>tence itself, as the way in which he said it, the sharp way, the manner altogether, the suddenness of it—his general appearance even when sitting or speaking was that of an insane man—it is very difficult to describe the appearance of an insane man, it requires to be seen, but I say from my experience of perhaps four or five hundred cases, he had the appearance of all the insane persons that I have seen—from my observations and ex<lb></lb>perience, I am decidedly of opinion that he was in an unsound state of mind at the time I was speaking to him, and also wheu he committed the act.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. POLAND</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many minutes altogether were you with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About thirty-five minutes; I was not two minutes examining the body—I had never seen the man before, nor since, except at the police-court and here—with respect to the passage in the letter about the Jury not finding him insane, I said I should have been disappointed if that had not been there; I should not say "disappointed," but it is an additional proof to my mind that he was insane; <hi rend="italic">primd facie</hi>, it certainly conveys the idea that he knew self-destruction was a crime which had to be ex<lb></lb>cused by the verdict of a Jury, but from the conversation I had with him I do not consider so—it is not inconsistent with insanity; in fact, it is an additional proof of it.</p>

               <p>"My dear Brother Alfred,—Excuse me the writing to trouble you for the last time, after being for nearly four years without giving you any news of me. I have submitted during the last eight months to the greatest miseries, and I cannot withstand them any more. I have taken the resolution during the last fortnight to take away my life, as well as that of my wife, with whom I have been living thirteen years, as also that of my children. I have nothing to reproach her whom I have made to pass as my wife for thirteen years. During the time we have lived together not two women out of a hundred would have done as she has done. We have often had many quarrels together about things that were of no consequence, but always takes care of the children as well as the household as well as I could desire. It is with the greatest regret that I anl about to commit the crime, if in every case I have strength enough for the end, for I have a daughter nearly twelve, another nine, and the last nineteen months old. I am going to try, at all events, to accomplish it, and if there is a God (as many of those Jesuits who live by the sweat of our labours wish us to believe) I believe I shall have an interview with Him, although in spite of my not having confessed myself to them. And I believe He will pardon me for the fault I am about to commit, if in any case one can call it so, to save me from misery as well as my family. I cannot say more, for I should have to go through the whole transactions of the last twelve years, and it would take me the whole night. Forget me for ever; and if my poor mother lives, do not strike her such a blow, for the poor woman has always done all one could to bring us up in the right way. It is now eleven o'clock in the evening. My wife and children are sleeping peaceably. They have no thought of what is going to happen to them. I am writing at the address which you will find below, and you will see how it has all passed; and if there remain one of my children do what you can to have it near you, for I have the conviction 'Thy brother is no more.'") <hi rend="italic">The following was also read</hi>:—"London, September 1,1867. After having tried every means, I have at last decided to take away my life, which my poor mother had so much trouble to preserve. That the gentlemen of the Jury, who will have to make inquiries over me may not return a verdict that this man was insane, as it is said I believe always, I have all my faculties at the moment I write these few lines. As to the past," I have endured the greatest misery for eight months, and I have resigned myself to the fate to which I have condemned myself for the last fort<lb></lb>night. I desire to have time and thought to accomplish my object, for I desire to leave no one behind whom people may some day reproach that their father was a murderer. If these few lines fall under your eyes' let my comrade at the workshop, Dostel, know that he will gather the few articles which are at the workshop and keep them for himself, as well as a carpet bag, which he can go and get at the Leopard coffee-shop, which I left there last Saturday. <hi rend="smallCaps">LOUIS BORDIER</hi>." <hi rend="italic">Memorandum found on the mantelshelf</hi>:—"Having always been in good fellowship with those with whom I have worked, I think it my duty before quitting this world to address to them one last word."</p>

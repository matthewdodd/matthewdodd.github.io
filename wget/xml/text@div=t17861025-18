            ; Athill had given me description of a brace of horse pistols that Fossett had in the coach; and when we were searching Mrs. Bell's lodgings, somebody came in to give any assistance that might be wanted; and I told Lucy to follow that woman; we went there and searched the house, and there we found a brace of horse pistols, and also found a bag in Fossett's lodgings in Grub-street, which Armstrong and I had information against; and that Athill declares was one of the bags that the things were found in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What day of the month was this that you was at Bell's? - On the 19th.</p>

               <p>I live in Brick-lane, in Bethnal green parish; there were some linen goods found at my house; my wife bought them of Mrs. Athill; I was not at home when Mrs. Athill came to our house; I remember my wife buying some things of Mrs. Athill, and paying her some money; I cannot say when it was; I think it was the Friday night the 10th of September, I saw her paying some money.</p>
               <p>Was all that linen drapery goods that were found at your house received from Athill? - To the best of my knowledge, they took a great deal more from us that Mr. Collier did not own; I was at home when the piece of cloth (the Irish) was brought; and I saw her pay Athill, in Mr. Athill's chamber; I went there on Friday night the 1st of September.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How long have you known Athill? - I cannot justly say, seven or eight, or nine years.</p>
               <p>Then perhaps you knew him before the year 1780, do you think you did? - I do not know, I think I have heard his name.</p>
               <p>How long have you known the man? - Not a year.</p>
               <p>I think you talked of Mrs. Athill, who is she? - She does not go by the name of Athill; she says her name is Cockvine.</p>
               <p>Are they man and wife, or are they not? - She says her name is Cockvine.</p>
               <p>Now, in point of fact, and within your knowledge, do not they live together as man and wife? - I suppose they do, and have had children.</p>
               <p>What is the character of Athill? - I know nothing of the man's character; he is a master weaver, and makes his own work.</p>
               <p>Does not he bear the character of a most notorious receiver of stolen goods? - I cannot say so; I never knew it; I do not know that he does.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself again, did you never hear him called so? - I do not know that; I have never heard him have any words with any one.</p>
               <p>Do you know that this man has been tried? - Never to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Do you know of Mr. Athill's being tried? - I do not.</p>

               <p>Do you know of his absconding on a charge of his being guilty of a riot in the year 1780? - No, I never heard that.</p>

             came to my house, in the morning; I was up stairs; they asked me I would buy any property; I asked them what it was; he mentioned linens, Irish, cambricks, handkerchiefs, and muslins; I told him yes, I would; I asked him, where they were; he said, it made no odds where they were; but if I would meet him in the evening, he would take me to where they were; he told me to meet him at Mr. Langley's, at the Cart and Horse, in Goswell-street, in the evening, between six and seven; I went there; there was Stephens and Fossett, and Tucker, and Taylor; we drank some beer, and all went away but Tucker; they left him with me; he did not stay many minutes before he went, and told me to wait till he returned again; he was gone about ten minutes, and he told me to come along with him, and he would take me to where the property was; I went with him, and he took me to the place, the back of Brick-lane, Old-street; I cannot recollect the name of the place; and when I came there there was Stephens, and Fossett, and Taylor, and they had a bag with them, with four pieces of muslins in the bag; I measured them, and I agreed to buy them; then they asked me if I would buy some Irish, and some linen; then Fossett and Stephens and Taylor went away, and brought another bag with some other things; then we agreed for the price of them; there was seven pieces of Irish, and a quantity of handkerchiefs; I agreed to pay them for it; they asked me how I would get them home; I said, I intended to have a coach, but I said, I would go home first, and get the money; they said, they were not afraid to trust me with the money, there was no doubt but I would pay them; then Stephens went and fetched a coach, and when he came back he told me a coach was waiting at the corner of the Ivey-house, in Goswell-street; then I took the two bags; then there was a kind of dispute who should go in the coach with the property; then Fosset said, he would, and he told the coachman to drive into Brown's-lane; when we came there, I got out of the coach, and went home to my own house with one of the bags; Fosset had a pair of pistols with him, large pistols with brass barrels.</p>
               <p>Look at these pistols? - These are the very same pistols, for I made a remark of this head being at the butt end of it; then Fosset took the other bag, and brought it to my house with me; then I paid him the money that I agreed for, that was twenty-five pounds, one shilling and sixpence, I think to the best of my knowledge, all but three shillings and sixpence I paid for the coach hire; when he was going away, he asked me if I would have them pistols, to guard the property, I imagine; I told him, no, I did not want them; and when he went away, he desired me to let him have the bags again in a day or two, or rather before that; when I was in Brick-lane, I asked them where the property was from; and they told me, from Islington; he told me to leave the bags for him at the White Horse, in Petticoat-lane; accordingly I went there in a day or two, and there I saw Taylor and Stephens together; I did not take the bags with me; they asked me, if I had brought the bags with me, and I said, no, I would bring them the next day; the next day I carried them, and left them at the bar.</p>
               <p>Look at that bag? - This is one of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250050"></xptr> the bags that I left, the other was a kind of a light blue bag; when we met at the house where Mrs. Bell was, she said it was her place; it had a field behind it, and I shewed it to Shakeshaft.</p>
               <p>Who went with the coach beside you and Fosset? - Another man rode behind, only Fosset went with me in the coach.</p>
               <p>Are you sure these two are two of the men? - Yes, I am very sure of it.</p>

               <p>Are these part of the same goods that were sold to Aldred? - Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Court. Were they all sold to Aldred? - No.</p>
               <p>Were all that you sold to Aldred part of the things that you purchased of these men? - I am sure they were the same things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You say they were the same things that were sold to Aldred? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to be present when Mrs. Aldred came to buy them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You are positive of that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there ever any suspicion lighted on you of this burglary? - I cannot say whether there was or not.</p>
               <p>Was not you taken up for this burglary? - I was taken up, but I cannot say what it was for.</p>
               <p>Do you know what you was committed for? - I was committed; I was sent to gaol, but I did not know what it was for.</p>
               <p>Were you committed to gaol or not? - - I did not take the copy of my commitment out to see whether I was committed or not; I should think a magistrate would not send a man to gaol without committing him.</p>
               <p>Answer my question? - I thought you asked me whether I was fully committed.</p>

             have lived together in the same house? - About five years and a half.</p>
               <p>How long is it altogether that you have lived in one house? - I believe it is about fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Has your wife lived with you at the same time? - No.</p>
               <p>You say you have never been in custody since you was at Sudbury about the charge of those silver spoons? - No.</p>
               <p>Were you ever in custody or tried before that time? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>How long before you were at Sudbury might that happen to be, how often was you in custody before? - Not five times.</p>
               <p>Perhaps four? - I am not sure to any, it is a many years ago; I have been guilty of folly when I was young, but it is some years ago.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you was tried at the Old Bailey? - I cannot tell, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Will you guess within a few months or a year? - I cannot, I am sure.</p>
               <p>What year was it you was in custody before? - I believe it was in the year 1780, or 1781.</p>
               <p>You left town in the year 1780, I believe in June or July? - I believe it was.</p>
               <p>That was the time the riots were? - I believe it was about that time.</p>
               <p>Was there any charge made against you in the year 1780, relative to the riots? - No, I cannot say; such a thing might be; I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Was not the charge about Justice Wilmott's office, in the year 1780? - I cannot say, it might be that, for what I know; I went into the country for work.</p>
               <p>Has Mrs. Cockvine been with you at the several times you have been in custody?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250052"></xptr> - I cannot recollect any other time.</p>
               <p>At no other time when you have been in custody has Mrs. Cockvine been with you? - Not as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>You will not swear she was in custody with you at these times? - I would not wish to swear she was or she was not.</p>
               <p>Surely you must know one way or the other, whether she was or she was not? - I cannot positively say.</p>

               <p>What is your belief? - I cannot recollect any more than twice.</p>
               <p>You know you have admitted yourself that there were more? - No, Sir, not to my knowledge, only at Sudbury and here.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, upon your oath, and I will call the very officers that brought you here to prove it, upon your oath have not you been in custody and tried at the Old Bailey? - Yes, I have been, but it is some years back.</p>
               <p>Was Mrs. Cockvine tried with you at that time? and remember that every officer that brought you here can prove the truth of it. - No, I think she was not.</p>
               <p>Do you only think she was not? - She never was tried with me here.</p>
               <p>Are you positive of that? - Yes, she never was tried with me here.</p>
               <p>Has she been in Newgate with you under confinement? - I believe she might.</p>
               <p>Cannot you go a great way farther and say you are sure she was? - I really believe she was.</p>
               <p>Are not you sure she was? - No, I am not sure about it, whether she was or was or was not.</p>
               <p>Why, she has been confined with you elsewhere? - No, I do not think she was.</p>

               <p>If you had been with him at the time you must have remembered it. - It is very possible, I do not know whether I ought to answer it.</p>

               <p>Why did you tell me just now that you did not recollect it? - Because I did not know whether I should answer it or not.</p>

               <p>What was the charge you was taken up for at Sudbury? - I cannot tell particularly, it was for some little trifling articles, I am sure I cannot tell what now.</p>

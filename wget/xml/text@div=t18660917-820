I am a metal repairer at 12, Waterloo Street, St. Luke's—about one o'clock on morning of 17th August I was aroused by a noise downstairs—I went down into the front parlour, and found the window was up and the outside shutter open—I called the police—the prisoners were afterwards taken and charged—there was nobody there when I came down—I missed my coat and a lot of children's things—I have seen them since—they are mine—I went to bed about half-past ten—the window in the front parlour was safe then.</p>

About half-past one on 17th August I was called to this house—at the door of one of the dwelling-houses in a court adjoining the house I found this bundle of things open—I went into a privy adjoining that house, and found three of the prisoners, Blundell, Stives, and Kennell—I then went to a privy immediately opposite and found Crook, and on the outside of the closet door was this bundle, which contains a skirt and a child's pinafore and shirts—the three first prisoners said on my opening the closet door, "We have not done it, we know nothing about it, we have not touched the things."</p>

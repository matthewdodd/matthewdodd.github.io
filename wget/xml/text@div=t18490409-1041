                  </hi>. I am single; I live in the house in which the prisoner lodged, at No. 19, Artillery-place, Woolwich. He is a soldier in the Artillery—he is married to a woman named Ellen—on Monday, 12th March, they had a quarrel, and she used very harsh language, not fit to repeat—he struck her in the face with his hand—she did nothing, but continued calling him names, and he hit her again; I believe in the face—she still continued to call him names—they were then quiet a short time, and she began again calling him names—his bayonet was close before him on the table, in its sheath, and he drew it out, and stabbed her with it in her back—her back was turned towards him—he put the bayonet back into its case again—he did not think he had hurt her—he had been packing his clothes before, and I believe he still con<lb></lb>tinued packing them—she fell down, and said "Oh, my God, he has stabbed me!"—I sent for a doctor, who came and attended to her in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—the prisoner did not render her any assistance—she was lying on the bed—she bled very little—I did not undress her, I waited for the doctor—she did not cry any more—the prisoner was not in the room</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon at Woolwich. I was called to attend Ellen Davies—I found a wound between the third and fourth bones of the back—I probed it, it was from an inch and a half to two inches deep—it had just escaped the kidneys—it was a part from which I should not expect much blood—the locality of it prevented its bleeding, there are no large vessels there—it was a triangular wound, which is a wound of a dangerous character—this bayonet would produce such a wound—it had entered the flesh—it was perfectly straight—it had gone by the side of the kidney, where it is soft and fat—it might penetrate some distance without making a wound that would be dangerous to life—if it had been a little lower down it might have been dan<lb></lb>gerous—I visited her three times a day till the Friday following, and twice afterwards—I attended her from the 12th to the 21st of March—if it had been a round wound, I should not have had half the trouble I had—a triangular wound never heals kindly, when two lips of the wound are closed the other remains open—I was afraid of an inflammation—it was between the spine and the kidney.</p>

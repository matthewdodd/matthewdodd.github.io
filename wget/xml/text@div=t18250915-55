            . I live in George-yard, Whitechapel. The prisoner Sanders was my lodger, but I know nothing of Schwartz except by seeing him call on Sanders. On Saturday, the 13th of August, Sanders slept at home, but I do not know what time he came in. I generally go to bed about half-past ten o'clock, and leave the street door open for my lodgers. There were four other lodgers in the house.</p>

            . I lived at Mrs. Brittle's. On Sunday morning, the 14th of August, I was in the backyard about twenty minutes past one o'clock. I saw a man come down stairs with a collar in his left hand, and a flute in his right. Schwartz followed him down stairs, and Sanders came after him with a bag of harness, which I saw at the mouth of the bag. Schwartz took the bag, and went away with the man who had the collar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lived there? A. About three years. I had no quarrel with Sanders. I have always said the mouth of the bag was open. I get my living by mending a few shoes, or selling fruit at the market.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard of this on Sunday evening, and from the description of the persons, I went to the prisoners' lodgings on Monday morning, between three and four oclock. I found Sanders on the bed with a woman - he had his clothes on, and two women and another man were in another bed - I took them all to the office, and they were examined. When I went in, this piece of wax candle was burning. I found this looking-glass, these keys, a vice, a file, and some other tools, and phosphorus box without a cork. I afterwards had this cork given to me by the servant, it fits the box exactly. On Sanders I found this handkerchief round his neck, a broken padlock, and this book, which Rawlinson claims; about ten o'clock that morning, Schwartz came to him with a mug of tea, and I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were there in the room? A. Two men and three women; I saw a young woman named Webster there - she did not tell me then that these articles did not belong to them, but she has said so since.</p>
               <p>THOMAS RAWLINSON re-examined. Q. Can you swear to these candles? A. No; but I left some candles of this description in the lamps on the Saturday night - this glass and neckcloth are my own - I have not seen the harness nor the lamps since.</p>
               <p>JOHN CONRAD HOPKE. I heard of this on the Sunday morning - this handkerchief is one of twelve which I gave to my servant; I believe the mark has been picked out out of it.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave Schwartz a good character.</p>

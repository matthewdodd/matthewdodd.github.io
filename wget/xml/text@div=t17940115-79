               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - On Sunday about ten o'clock; we generally lost them on a Sunday, because the yard is more retired that day than any other day. Where he was there is a division between two stables, it is a small yard in the yard his horses stood in the back stable; the prisoner was carter to me at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him wring off the neck of this turkey? - In the stable where his horses stood, which he usually drove. After he had killed it he hid it under some litter, I see him, then I fetched my foreman, and ordered him to fetch Croker the constable; I waited outside of the gates to watch that he could not go out, and when Croker came we could not find the turkey under the litter; Croker found it tied up in a truss of straw in the same stable; that is all I know about it; Croker has kept it ever since.</p>

               <p>On this 29th of December, Mr. Rhodes sent for me, I went to the place where he saw the turkey hid, and it was not there; I saw a truss of straw laying in the stable where him and I stood, and it struck me it might be in the straw, I put my hand into the straw, and there I felt it warm, and I took it out, and I have kept it ever since; the neck is broke.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What may be the value of that turkey? - I suppose it is worth six or seven shillings, we never sell any of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came home with my team about ten o'clock in the day, with a load of grains; after I had been in the stable about half an hour, or a little better I was called in, and Mr. Rhodes came along with me, and said to me you go and fetch that turkey; how? says I, what turkey? I know nothing of the turkey; he says, I will find him, says he, I know where it is, I see him carry it away; he went and searched in the lost, and it was not there, and Croker pulled him out of the straw that was in the stable. There was another man went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150216"></xptr>backward and forward with a team of horses, he was in the stable all the time; it was very odd he could not see any thing about it, my master himself went in there two or three times, it is very odd he did not come to me at the time. The turkey was there in the straw before ever I came home with the cart; the whole time that I was there was not half an hour.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When did you confine this man? - It is a customary thing with us whenever the brewhouse has the grains ready we fetch them away; we pay not that attention that we ought to the day or hour. This man had been out on Sunday morning for the grains, and he had come in with them.</p>

            Where did you find the man? - He fed his horses, and continued feeding them; I saw him for fifteen or twenty minutes before Croker came.</p>

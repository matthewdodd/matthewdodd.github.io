               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q.You did not give information of it? A. No - I was in the balcony of the drawing-room; he had a hat on - it is a narrow street, and leads out of St. James'-street; the cloth was on his left shoulder - I was on the right-hand side; his hat did not hinder my seeing his face; I saw him very plainly for five or six minutes - I did not know him before; I saw him before he went in and after he came out.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How soon afterwards did you see him before the Magistrate? A. The next day; I was certain of his person the moment I saw him - I only saw one person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q. He stood three or four feet from the shop? A. Yes - I also stood there.</p>

On Friday morning, the 22nd of April, near half-past eight o'clock, my coach stood in Piccadilly, opposite Duke-street, about five minutes walk from Ryder-street; the prisoner Atwick came up, threw two pieces of cloth into the coach, and got in himself - he desired me to drive to Sun-street, Bishopsgate; I did so - when I got there he got out and took the cloth; he paid the fare, and I went about my business - when I got to Sun-street a cab passed me, and I saw both the other prisoners in Sun-street; it was then near nine o'clock - they had got out of the cab about fifty yards from where Atwick got out; they had arrived there a little before me - Williams came up, and took one roll of cloth from my chariot; he said nothing - they then went away together; I cannot say where to.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the 22nd of April, I was on duty in the neighbourhood of Crown-street - Piggott gave me information; I followed the prisoners to Finsbury-square, there saw them divide some money, and took all three into custody in about five minutes, with assistance.</p>
               <p>ANDREW MACMANUS. I am a serjeant of the Police. I was at the station-house on the 22nd of April, when the prisoners were brought in, it was near ten o'clock - I searched them; 3l. 7s. was found on Atwick, 3l. 1s. on Robertson, and 7s. on Williams.</p>
               <p>JOHN FORRESTER. I am an officer of the City. On Friday, the 22nd of April, I went with a search-warrant, and examined Guest's house, in Sun-street - Mr. Cope, the marshal, and my brother Daniel were with me; Guest was not at home - I got there about a quarter-past twelve o'clock; I found some cloth there, which I brought away - I now produce all that the prosecutor speaks to.</p>
               <p>MR. DICKETTS. This is my property - I have minutely examined it, and compared it; it is all of a colour and width - here is some of the kerseymere as well as the cloth; it was safe in my house at eight o'clock in the morning, when I left - here is not above half of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CARRINGTON. Q.Does the property correspond with what you lost? A. No - I did not lose it in such lengths as this; it is black - I have found none of the brown; there are thousands of pieces of the same width - there is no mark of my own on it; it was a whole piece - I cut the ends of the piece off, and have them here.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You had cut the end pieces off before? A. Yes, just the fag-end, the list - there is nothing in that to make it correspond; I never sent any cloth to Guest's.</p>
               <p>ANDREW MACMANUS. When I went to Guest's there was a smoke issuing from the kitchen - it smelt as if cloth was being burned; I had a party of the Police trying to get in at the time, and a pistol was presented at me.</p>

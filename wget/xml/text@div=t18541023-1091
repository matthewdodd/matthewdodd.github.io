                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Cooke, who keeps the Bell and Dragon, in Worship-street. On 15th Sept., the prisoner came between 6 and 7 o'clock; she had half a pint of beer—she gave me a shilling; I gave her change, and put the shilling in the till—I am quite certain there was no other shilling in the till—I looked at the shilling in about two minutes afterwards—the prisoner had only just got out of the door—I looked in the till, there was only one shilling in it—I looked at that shilling more particularly; I found it was bad—I put it apart from other shillings, and gave it to my husband when he came home, about an hour afterwards—I had never seen the prisoner before—I am quite sure she is the woman—I have not the slightest doubt about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Bell and Dragon. On 23rd Sept., the prisoner came and asked for half a pint of porter; she laid down a shilling—I noticed it was bad—(my wife had described the prisoner to me)—I said to her, "This is a bad one; I shall keep you, and send for an officer"—my wife then said, "That is the woman that passed a bad shilling to me"—the prisoner declared to her God that she was never in the house before—I went to the door, and kept her inside while I sent for a policeman.</p>

I took charge of the prisoner on the 23rd—I received these two shillings from the last witness—the prisoner denied having been in the house when the first shilling was passed—the second shilling she said she took of a cabman—she gave her address at a place in Bethnal Green-road; I went there, but could not find anything about her.</p>

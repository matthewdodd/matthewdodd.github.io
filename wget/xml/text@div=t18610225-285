                  </hi>. I live at 4, Rockingham-row—the prisoner was my servant—she lived with me fifteen months and three weeks—I left my house on 10th February last, at a few minutes before 5 in the evening, in charge of the prisoner—there was no one in the house besides the prisoner—I told her not to let anyone into the house, and that I should be at home early—I returned from about half-past 9 to 10—the prisoner opened the door to me—she had her apron up to her eyes, and I asked her what was the matter—I asked her once or twice before she answered—she then said that a man had forced his way past her in the hall, and she could not keep him back—I asked her if they had taken anything—she said, "Yes; the clock"—I said, had they been up stairs?—she said she supposed so, as the drawers were open—I then sent my niece to a gentleman we had been with in the evening, and my sister and myself went into the parlour—the prisoner went with us with a light, and I then saw that they had taken the clock from the table, and a cruet-stand from the cheffonier—we then went upstairs—the drawers were shut, but they had been opened—I then missed my watch and chain, four sovereigns, and a purse that was in my room—I looked in all the drawers, but there was nothing missing—they had all been opened—I had left them locked—I said to her, when we ware in the parlour, that I did not believe a word she said; that she had better tell the truth, it would be better for her.</p>

I was called into 8, Rockingham<lb></lb>row, on 10th February, at a quarter-past 10 o'clock, and received the prisoner in charge; I told her what she was charged with, and she said she went out to buy an orange, and as she was coming back a man spoke to her, and wanted to get into conversation, and wanted to persuade her to let him come in—she said she would not let him come in, and he forced his way in—this conversation took place at the house—when I took her to the station she said there were two men spoke to her—she said she met two men, one of them spoke to her and got in conversation, while the other came into the house and committed the robbery—she said he went in about twenty minutes past 6, and went out about half-past 7, that she saw him come in and go out—there are many policeman about that neighbourhood stationed at the corner of the street—I am on duty there every evening—she said that the man's name who was in conversation with her was <hi rend="italic">Jack.</hi>

Yes—I can't say exactly how far Rockingham-row is from the Rockingham public-house—it is eight doors from the turning called Poplar-row—when I took the prisoner into custody she did not seem to be a great deal affected—she took it very coolly from what I could see of it—she seemed to be dull—I might have asked her some questions concerning the robbery—I don't remember whether I did or not—I won't pledge myself that I did not—she was searched by the female searcher—nothing was found upon her—she said what I have stated, when we got to the station about 3 or 4 o'clock—I recollect her saying that the man kept her talking—I mentioned that to the Court.</p>

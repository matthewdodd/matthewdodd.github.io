On 23rd Sept. the prisoner came to my shop, about 10 minutes-past 6 in the evening—he asked for a seidlitz powder, and gave me a shilling—I noticed it was bad, and asked him where he got it from, and asked him to let me search him—I found on him three good shillings, a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bit</hi>, and a penny—he said a gentleman on the opposite side of the road gave him the shilling—I sent my boy out with him to find him—he returned, and said he supposed the gentleman had <hi rend="italic">cut it</hi>—the three shillings that I found on him were wrapped tightly up, and this half-quire of paper was found on him—I took him to Mr. Harris—I put this bad shilling in the break, and it nearly broke in two—it was not out of my possession till I gave it to the policeman.</p>

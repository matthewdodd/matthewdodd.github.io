            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 10th of September, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner at the top of King-street, Tower-hill, with a basket of skins. I asked where he bought them from. He said from Mr. Slee, of Bermondsey. I asked where he was going to take them. He said at Mr. Connel's, near Shadwell. I asked if he had a note, or bill. He said, No; that Mr. Connel was just gone on, and he supposed he had got it. I said I should go with him to Connell's. He went, and shewed me the house. I went in and asked Connell, a shoe-maker, if he knew the prisoner, or any thing about the skins. He said, No; but a woman came in, and asked what was the matter. I asked if she knew anything of it. She said, Yes. Connell said he knew nothing of them; and then she said so too. He looked at Connell, and said,</p>
               <p>"You know I was to bring them here." I went over to the prosecutor's, leaving him in custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. I kept the prisoner in custody. I asked him how long Connell had been at his master's to buy the skins. He said about two hours. He said Mr. Slee was to allow him overtime for carrying them. I told him it was wrong; and asked him who sent him with them. He said the clerk sent him with them, but he did not know his name. They were quite wet, as if just out of the pit.</p>

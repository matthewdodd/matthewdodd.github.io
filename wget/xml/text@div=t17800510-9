             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am wife to the last witness. On Monday the 1st of May my husband brought the prisoner home to sing him a song, and said he would give her a draught of beer; my husband went to the publick-house to order some beer.</p>
               <p>How came your husband to bring this woman home to sing him a song, did he frequently entertain you in this way? - No, never before; there was nobody in the house but she and me; the watch was on the mantle-piece. I missed the watch. I said to her, my husband's watch was here just now! She said, that he had taken it down and put it in his pocket. I said I was sure he did not.</p>
               <p>Did you see it there when he went out; - Yes, some time after he was gone.</p>
               <p>How long was he gone? - Three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>How soon after he was gone did you miss the watch? - It might be a quarter of an hour, I cannot say to a minute; she sat on one side of the fire and I on the other; I might get up for something.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner ever out of your sight, did you leave her by herself? - No. The watch was on the mantle-piece, on the right hand side where she sat; I sat on the left hand side.</p>
               <p>How high was the mantle-piece? - Not very high, one might sit on a chair and reach it.</p>
               <p>Was the mantle piece no higher than a persons head who sat on a chair? - Very little if they sat on a high chair; she sat on a low chair; it was above her head; the chain was hanging down off the mantle piece.</p>
               <p>You missed it, and told the prisoner you missed it? - Yes. She said, she saw it there; that the chain was hanging down; that she saw him take it out with him.</p>
               <p>How came you not to put the chain up when you saw it hanging down, was not you afraid it would fall? - No; it lay so for days and days; I went to Mr. Hopkins's to my husband, and took the prisoner with me.</p>
               <p>How long was it after you missed the watch before you went to look for your husband? - Near half an hour. I waited in expectation of his coming back; I asked him if he knew any thing of his watch. He said, it was at home on the mantle piece. I said it was not at home.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner present then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he generally leave it there when he went out? - He never carried the watch out at any time, it was always left on the mantle-piece.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - I did not see the prisoner much more that night.</p>
               <p>Did you let her go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Without searching her? - I did not know what to do. She came to me the next morning and asked me how I did, and whether I had found the watch? I said no. She said she was sure my husband had taken it, and she supposed one of the press gang had whipped it out of his pocket; there was a press gang. I went to the pawnbroker's and desired if such a watch was brought, describing it, they would stop it; they told me such a watch had been offered there half an hour before by a woman in a striped gown, but they had not taken it in.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find the watch? - Yes; upon the prisoner, on Tuesday the 2d of May. We sent for an officer and had her taken before Justice Clarke; and the officer found it under her petticoats.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I took up the prisoner on the 2d of May. I took her before Justice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100014"></xptr>Clarke, at the public-office in East Smithfield. I searched her and found the watch under her petticoats, the chain hung out underneath the string of her petticoat.</p>

               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>When I went into the publick-house Brown was sitting by the fire place with a pint of beer; he asked me to drink; his wife came and asked him to go home; and he desired me to go home with him and sing him a song. She said, young woman come home with him, that I may get him home. I went home with him and his wife, and he went and fetched a quartern of liquor and gave me and his wife some of it; he then put his watch in his pocket and went out for some beer, and did not come in again; when the ale-house man came for the pots she quarelled with him and broke the glass and cut her hand; he gave me the watch and said, he would make the bitch believe he had lost it. I went in the morning and asked her how her hand did? She said, it was better, but that the rogue had lost his watch, and the villain would not let her advertise it. I said never mind, it was not lost, she would hear of it very soon. I had the watch in my pocket. I did not mean to keep it.</p>
               <p>To the constable. Was the watch in her pocket? - No; when I took her, she denied having the watch, and refused to let me search her.</p>

               <p>Q. Who listed her up? - A.Sarah Scott; I asked the girl if she knew any thing of him; she seemed to hesitate, and said, she knew nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the hesitation? - A. She said, no, Sir, I do not know any thing of him; the man then ran away, and I followed him; there were several people passing and re-passing at that time towards Hyde-park.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there many people passing and repassing where the child was crying? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Where the girl was down there were no people? - A. No People at all; I took him by the collar, and brought him back to the girl; and then, by the persuasions of the girl that was with me, I took him to the girl's mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. And you took the girl there too, I suppose? - A. Yes; there I left him, and a constable was sent for, who examined his linen; his name is Bligh.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Was the surgeon present? - A. No; not till we went to Bow-street, next day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his linen examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any particular mark? - A. No, not any in the least.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I understand you, that you were not quite certain whether he was by the side of her, or at the top of her? - A. I have every reason to believe, to the best of my recollection, that he was upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. When you asked what he was about with that girl, he said he knew her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not then say that she did not know him? - A. No; there was no answer made from her till after.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined this man, and no sort of mark was found whatever? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was it a clean shirt? - A. Yes; it appeared as if it was put on that day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long do you suppose he had worn it before you examined it; did it appear quite a clean shirt? - A. I should suppose it must have been put on that day, or the day before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. And it was perfectely pure, free from stain? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you suppose, if a man had been connected with a girl for the first time, having a gonorthea upon him, it would not have left a stain? - A. I should think so.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He did not say any thing at all; I asked him if he was not a rascal for being connected with such a child; I told him there were plenty of unfortunate women that he might take his pleasure with, better than a child; he immediately got up, and I laid hold of him; I collared the man, and he told me that the girl belonged to him, not to me, and then he ran away; Mr. Smith pursued after him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you examine his linen? - A. Yes, I did, after I had taken him to prison; as we went up stairs, I had a light, and pulled his shirt out of his breeches; I desired Smith to come upto see it, I thought it was necessary; it did not appear to be stained.</p>
               <p>How long did the shirt appear to have been worn? - A. Not more than a day or two at most.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you observe? - A. Upon taking up her clothes, I observed great marks of violence; she appeared to have been much tumbled upon the grass, and her clothes were coloured with the grass.</p>
               <p>Q. What marks did you observe upon her body? - A. There seemed to have been a connection; to all appearance he had entered the body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if the body had been entered for the first time? - A. There was no lasceration, no blood; but there appeared to be human semen upon the private parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hymen broke? - A. There was no appearance of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear as if she had been entered for the first time? - A. To all appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. How should there be that appearance if there was no lasceration, and no blood? - A. From the smallness of the parts, and the appearance of violence, I could not suppose she had been a common girl; I cannot say, positively, that it was the first time; it is my opinion, that he had endeavoured to enter, and I observed the semen.</p>
               <p>Q. Without supposing her to be a common girl, do you think she might have had any man with her before? - A. No, not in my judgment.</p>

             sworn. - I am a surgeon; The first time I attended the girl, was on the 10th of August, I was called to her assistance by Bligh, the constable; I examined her, I found a considerable swelling, a great deal of inflammation, and a considerable discharge, arising, apparently, from an intercourse with some male person or other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any appearance of lasce<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200018"></xptr>ration? - A. The parts were so diseased that I could not tell; I cannot pretend to say that the disease was infectious; the same appearances might have arisen from violence, independent of infection.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do not undertake to say it was the venereal disease? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have attended the child; has she now a venereal disease? - A. No; I do not call it a venereal disease; my brother has attended her as well as myself.</p>
               <p>Q. You can now say, for a certainty, whether it is or not? - A. I am inclined to think it is, but I cannot positively say; the same appearances may have been produced by violence, merely; I treated it as venereal, in order to guard her constitution against any future attack.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if those appearances might proceed from violence, merely, could you judge from the parts whether there had been an entry into those parts? - A. I could not; the swelling was so considerable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. If you had not heard any thing about a rape you would have thought it was venereal, should you not? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe upon the labia pudorus any ulcer? - A. No; a general inflammation.</p>
               <p>Q. There is no doubt but recent inflammation will cause considerable swelling, and change the appearance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it more likely that a venereal complaint would have abated from your treatment of her, or a complaint originating merely in violence? - A. The complaint that originated in violence, provided she was kept pretty quiet.</p>

             sworn. - I am the girl's mistress: She was brought home to me upon the 19th of July; I examined her about ten o'clock at night, there was a great deal of human nature upon her, and by the appearance of that, I thought she had been violently used.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any care of her that night? - A. I got her some brandy, and she used some pomatum; she got up at six o'clock in the morning, and I took her with me to the Park, my business wholly depended there; she staid with me there till between ten and eleven, and then I took her to Bow-street; she was never out of my sight all that time, not yet out of the hearing of my voice.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the girl behave before that? - A. She was a modest good girl, as ever came into a house; she used to put her cows in, and was almost always in my sight; she never had any followers, nor kept any company, I used generally to go with her to see her put her cows up.</p>
               <p>Q. She did not go to ale-house then? - A. None at all; I have had her ever since this happened always under my care, and very rarely out of my sight; the farthest she has been out of my sight has been to Mr. Drummond's the bankers to get some water for my breakfast, I serve them with milk, it is only round the corner of Spring-gardens.</p>
               <p>Q. And, when she has gone there, has she never staid an improper time? - A. No, she has not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to send for any body to attend her? - A. She walked lame, and was sick at her stomach, and I thought she might have overwalked herself, till I examined her, and found a swelling, and then I went to Mr. Bligh, and he got a gentleman to come; before this happened, she was as clean and fair a girl as ever sun shone upon, for I had examined her about the course of human nature, and she did not know what I meant, she was then perfectly clear.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she had any of her menses since this happened? - A. Once.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she had any before? - A. None before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I never saw him to the best of my knowledge, till he was brought a prisoner to my house; he is the person that damaged that girl, for a more virtuous girl never came into a house than she was before that, and a girl that I could trust with untold gold.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have given this girl a very good character, how long has she lived with you? - A. About eight or nine months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a character with her before? - A. Yes; from No. 13, Pimlico.</p>
               <p>Q. That was where her aunt lived, was it not? - A. Where she lived servant, I had her character from.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not she quarrelled with her aunt, and for that reason was turned out? - A. No; I have seen her aunt twice since.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the aunt assisted in prosecuting? - A. No; I answer for the girl myself.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Have not the Justices directed the prosecution? - A. I have not asked any advice from any gentleman whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You know the prisoner at the bar, do not you? - A. I never saw him till that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not he a milk-man? - A. His wife is a milk-woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Has it happened that this woman and you have had a quarrel about the loss of a customer? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any words with her? - A. Not concerning any business at all; never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Never? - A. Not about my customers.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it about then? - A. I met her coming past the Horse-ferry road, since this affair, and she asked what I intended to do; I told her it should take the law, and she behaved very insolent, and called me an old bawd.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Had you any quarrel with her be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200019"></xptr>fore this? - A. No; I had never spoke to her in my life, nor did not know her till after I had been before the Justices.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to tell me, that before this, you never had any quarrel with her about any customer? - A. Never in the universe, in my life, I never spoke to her.</p>
               <p>Q. I tell you she is here? - A. I never spoke to her before.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us that this girl was generally in your presence? - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. You go about the town with milk? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does the girl go about with you, when you are going about the town? - A. Sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you most usually leave her in the Park? - A. No; I have another servant, and I generally leave her there, and my daughter; at six o'clock in the morning she gets up, and gets the cows out of the Green-Park, and I meet her on the milk walk; if she is out of my sight, there is another guard over her.</p>
               <p>Q. This girl was a servant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To do your business like other servants? - A. Yes; when she was in health to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether it was not usual for her, as your servant, to go with the cows, and attend them herself? - A. No, she did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always go with her? - A. Or somebody else; there are three or four servants sometimes go together.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to go by herself that night? - A. It is very hard that I should be obliged to have one servant to guard another for four hundred yards for fear of that man.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us she never went into the ale-houses, you mean in your presence? - A.Nor out of my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. You will swear that? - A. I will not swear that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. She was not that sort of girl? - A. No, She was not; she was always a girl very particular to keeping her time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. The girl has been different times in my company before that evening.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you examined him, and can you state whether within any recent time he has had a venereal complaint? - A. When I examined him, he had not the least appearance of having had a recent venereal complaint upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it possible for such a girl to have the hymen ruptured and no lasceration? - A. No; there must have been a discharge of blood, and appearances of being ruptured by force.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that depend upon the size of the girl, or upon her strength? - A. Upon her strength, and upon her youth.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if in a girl, the hymen had been ruptured, must it not have been discovered when she was examined? - A. It would be impossible for long a time after.</p>
               <p>Q. But do you suppose it possible for the surgeon who examined her the next day, to have passed it by? - A. I should think impossible.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were in Court at the time Mr. Winterbotham was examined? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not a surgeon, he is an apothecary; do you think it possible that he, not having much knowledge of the business, might overlook an appearance of that kind? - A. I should think it almost impossible for any person to have observed the parts but they must perceive whether the hymen had been ruptured, and whether such force had been used as to enter the body of that girl.</p>
               <p>Q. Consider this girl's age; might not the hymen have been ruptured by some accident before? - A. Most assuredly.</p>
               <p>Q. She was a hard working girl, and out early in the morning, supposing it to have been so, might she not have had those appearances, though it was only the first time of a man having been with her? - A. I do not conceive it possible for any man to have entered the body of a girl of that age, without causing a lasceration upon the parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Andrews speaks of marks of great violence that appeared upon the 10th of August, might not those appearances be where a girl had been entered by a man for the first time, three weeks before? - A. Those appearances, I should have thought, would have taken place at least in the course of forty-eight hours.</p>
               <p>Q. She was examined within fourteen hours after by Mr. Winterbotham? - A. She was then free from the inflammation which would increase in the course of two or three days.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Pollard). Q. How soon did you perceive any swelling? - A. I cannot say to a day, it might be between four and five days, that she could not be able to sit.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive any swelling the first night? - A. No; the first night about twelve o'clock, I carried her a bit of pomatum, and on her thighs I saw what was human nature upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her courses coming? - A. Something of that nature.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you perceive any thing of man's nature? - A. Yes, both; there was between two and three table spoonfuls of blood, or thereabouts, came from her; I gave her some hot brandy, and she said, help me, mistress, help me, mistress, for I am very bad.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179709200020"></xptr>Q. Did you consider that blood as her courses, or in consequence of violence? - A. Violence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it continue upon her? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not perceive any swelling till between four and five days after wards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Andrews). Do you suppose such circumstances as Mrs Pollard has described, likely to appear from violence? - A. Very probable.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Webb). What do you think of it? - A. It is certainly very propable.</p>

That is not the woman, that is not the woman, but that is her, that fresh coloured girl, (pointing to Bell;) I will take my oath again, twenty times, that that is the woman that was along with the prisoner, they were drinking a pint of ale, and when they had drank it, they went to the bar, and called for a glass of rum, and they had a glass of rum each.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long did they stay in the house? Not long; I was sitting and looking at them; what made me look more at them, was, that Kelly told me he had seen them the night before, and he said, see how forward that little body is, and I said, it was a pity; Kelly went to the bar and paid for the porter, we went away through the park, down Constitution-hill, and we saw them in the park.</p>

               <p>Mrs. POLLARD called in again. - Q.Had you been with the girl in the Park, on the 19th of July? - A. On the 19th of July, I was with her from between two and three, till nine o'clock.</p>

               <p>Q. How much before nine? - A. As near nine as possible; we generally turn the cows off at nine, at that time of the year, and I had untied the cows myself with her.</p>
               <p>Q. You generally turn out at nine, at that time of the year? - A. According to the weather, if it is fine weather we stay out till the last minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that at Spring-Gardens? - A. Yes; she parted from me at Spring-Gardens, at nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the child on a spotted gown? - A. She had the same spotted gown on that she has at present, and a handkerchief very much like this, but not this, she wore no cap at that time, she had nothing but a hat on her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any apron on? - A. Yes, a blue apron.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you had a good character with this girl? - A. Yes, I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know you had a character with her? - A. Yes; she knew it, for I took her to the woman where she lived; and there have been people coming past, who had known her at Pimlico, and seeing her at the stall, have given her halfpence, because they had known her to be an honest girl; this woman in the dark gown, Mrs. Cusack, offered the girl five guineas, and a gown piece, not to appear, but what day of the month it was, I do not know; about three o'clock in the afternoon, I came up, and they were rioting the girl, and she stood a crying.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time of the offer? - A. I came up at the very moment, when she told her, if she would not appear against him, she should have five guineas and a gown-piece, but if she swore against him, she told her she would be hanged, she said so upon the milk stall; I cannot justly say when that was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her say so? - A. Yes; it was not a month ago; it was at a time she was discoursing with the girl upon the milk-stand.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cusack. It is false as God is true, I never offered the girl any sum at all; I met the mistress, and they all stopped with the cows and sat down, and had a pot of ale, and I came up and said, what a dreadful thing it is, about this affair; bless your soul, says she, come along, I can reason with you better than I can with any body else; with that, I went up to the wall with her, and she up and told me how it was; now, says I, it will be a scandalous thing, if you swear as you have done, to prosecute this man; if you can make it up, I think it would be much better, says she, I am bound under forty pounds; says I, that is nothing, you will not be bound to pay it; well, says she, I will enquire, and if I am not bound by penalty, I do not know what I may do.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bell.) Did Mrs. Cusack offer you any money? - A. Yes, in my mistress's presence, and my master was present to.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mrs. Pollard.) Did you give that girl any wages? - A. No; but I found her in wearing-apparel, both her shoes and stockings, and what I thought necessary; she would have had wages for her own jurisdiction before now, but I thought I had better lay it out for her.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Cusack. I had a young baby of seven months old in my arms, and she said, that she wished that child in my arms might be ravished.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever hear her make an offer to that girl, Jane Bell? - A. I heard her say, that she should be put into prison if she swore against the man, but I did not hear of any money.</p>

               <p>Q. Was your wife there? - A. No; but my daughter-in-law was, the girl told me so, I did not hear it; I heard her say, she should be put in Newgate, to be pillored.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Cusack.) What do you say to this charge, did you tell the child she should be put in Newgate, and pillored? - A. I said, she was liable, if she swore false.</p>

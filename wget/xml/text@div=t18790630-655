                  </hi>. On the night of the 24th May I was standing out<lb></lb>side the "Elephant" public-house, Vauxhall, and saw the prisoner fighting with another man, and his brother afterwards—the deceased, Thomas Spinks, was in my company—he was my brother-in-law—he walked up to the prisoner and said, "Now Charlie, come home along with me," leave off fighting along with them till another day," and he pat his hands on his shoulders—the prisoner turned round and caught hold of his throat by his left hand, and with the other hand took him by the tuft of hair on his chin—they stood for about two or three seconds and then fell down—the prisoner undermost—I unclenched his left hand by using my knuckles—it took me about three minutes to do it—I hit him and knocked him, and he let go his right hand and the deceased was then dead—he never breathed or spoke again—I went for a doctor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had been outside the public-house about five or ten minutes—there was a fight, and the prisoner went to take his brother's part—the deceased did not go up and catch him by the arms behind—he tried to prevent his fighting—nobody else had got hold of him—they both fell in a sitting position—it was all done in an instant—Spinks was sober—the prisoner did not appear as if he had had much drink.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon of 72, South Lambeth Road—on the morning of the 25th I was called to see Spinks—he was dead—he might have been dead a few minuees—I afterwards examined the body—death resulted from syncopal asphyxia, from being throttled, and he must have fainted suddenly from the shock at the same time—I think he would not have died so suddenly unless he had had a weak heart and fainted—the violence produced the fainting, and the two together produced death—he had a weak, flabby heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The marks on the throat were very slight indeed—say sudden shock will sometimes cause sudden death if the heart is weak.</p>

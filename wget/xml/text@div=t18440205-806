                  </hi>. I am beadle and engineer of the parish of St. Olave, South wark—I have charge of the engine—after the fire at St. Olave's it was kept in the arch No. 9, at the bottom of King's Head-yard, Tooley-street—I kept the key of the arch. On the 23rd of Jan. I had my attention called to the archway—the evening before, the carpenter, whom I brought, secured the arch-door with a padlock—the stand-pipe and branch were there safe at eleven o'clock that night—my attention was called to it in the morning by a policeman, saying the place was broken open—I went about half-past seven o'clock—I then missed the stand cock, pipe, and branch—the prisoner keeps a marine-store and rag shop in Bermondsey-street—on Friday, the 26th, I saw the stand cock, and branch, which I missed, in the possession of the policeman who brought it from Mr. Paine's, in the lane—the prisoner's shop is about two or three hun<lb></lb>dred yards from Tooley-street.</p>

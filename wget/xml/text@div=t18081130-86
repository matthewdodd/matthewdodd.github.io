               <p>Q. Do you remember any thing happening when Winstanley escaped out of prison - A. Yes, he called on me where I lodge, I did not see him; he left word with my landlady; I went to the Fleet prison to his room in the Fleet prison, knocked at the door, nobody answered; I went to No. 17, Mr. Chell's door, I knocked and asked if Mr. Winstanley was there, or where he was; he told me he was not there; he then considered a little while, and then asked me whether I washed for him; he said he went out on Friday night and nobody knew any thing of it but him, and that he would return on Sunday; I went down to Mr. Nixon and made enquiry, I did not tell him, I said I wanted Mr. Winstanley. Mr. Nixon made enquiry, he was not found; I went to his lodgings in Doctors Commons, there I saw Mrs. Chell in the room with Mr. Winstanley; I told him that I had been to the Fleet prison, that he was not there; he said it was a pity I went to the Fleet prison for all was spoiled by it. He wanted me to take a note to Mr. Chell, I told him I could not think of doing any thing of the kind; I told him I was obliged to go home. Mrs. Chell went away, she had a bundle, I cannot rightly say what it was; there was something in it like a dark coloured spotted cotton gown. In my way home I stepped into the Fleet prison, I made Mr. Nixon acquainted where Mr. Winstanley was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp, to Woodward. In consequence of information that you received of Winstanley being out, did you go for the purpose of apprehending him - A. I did. On Saturday the 17th of September, I went to Wardrobe place, Doctors Commons; I went by myself the first time; when I came there he was denied by the servant of the house and the mistress; after that I went the second time with Hodgkin, one of the turnkeys. I went up to the two pair of stairs room, in the same house, without asking any questions, I found Wintanley;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300059"></xptr>I told him I was come to take him home again. I took him in a coach with his paintings to the Fleet prison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. Did not Winstanley tell you that he had written a letter to Mr. Nixon from that place - A. I believe he did.</p>
               <p>Q. And did not he beg a little time to pack up his things - A. Yes, and I gave it to him, as much as he wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of Winstanley upon his return to prison - A. He was sent to a place of safety into the strong room - the strong room is equally as good as any in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this said by any one when he was taken to the strong room - there he shall stay as long as he is in the Fleet prison, and I will try to transport him - A. I do not recollect that Mr. Nixon made use of that expression; he said take him into the strong room.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that he did not - A. I will not; I do not believe he did; he might say he would keep him there as long as he staid, it was the only place of safety.</p>
               <p>Mr. Smith. Do you happen to know whether Chell was put in the strong room - A. He was there four or five days. I cannot swear positively.</p>

               <p>and told a very pitiful tale—out of charity my parents gave him shelter in the house, and he partook of all our meals—he slept in a room by himself adjoining mine—it is an attic parted off—on Saturday morning, the 2nd of February, I left my bed-room door padlocked—all the articles stated were then safe in my bed-room—they are worth about 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to ray room about eleven o'clock in the evening, in the dark, and unlocked the door with the key I had in my pocket—I then got a light, and found a bottle on the table, which I had left on my box, and all the property gone from my box—it had not been locked—some articles were taken from a chest of drawers—I found the prisoner's hat in my hat-box, instead of my own—on looking at the door, I found the staple had been drawn out, and just put in again loosely.</p>

Denton says, I cannot; he holds me; with that, the man got up, and broke my hold from Denton's coat, and tore the coat down the middle of the back: after that, they sawed something across my belly two or three times: I had nothing but only my shirt on, and I cried out murder, for I expected every minute they would cut my belly open.</p>
               <p>Was it the other prisoner who tore the coat from you? - I believe it was not: another person then opened the door: when the door was open, the man set off, and Denton next, and me after Denton; and the other person ran after me, and struck me several times with a stick; Denton turned out of Long-lane, into a turning that leads into Cloth-fair, and ran down Back-alley; I ran after, crying out murder! stop thief! Mr. Campton's men heard it, and stopt him; with that, I said, for God's sake do not let that man go, for I would not lose him for twenty pounds; I never lost sight of him till he was taken: I cannot swear to the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you always say the same of the other prisoner? - I never positively swore to him.</p>

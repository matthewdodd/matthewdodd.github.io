               <p>Prisoner. I was above one hundred yards from the place when I was taken; I had not been out of my own yard ten minutes Witness. I am quite sure I saw him put his hand in the gentleman's pocket, and I ran after him - he ran down Riding-house-lane, and was taken in Titchfield-street - I was not four yards from him when he took it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see him throw it down the area? -A. No, a neighbour did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Great Titchfield-street, and a gentleman came and took me to an area, where there was a handkerchief - the gentleman would have let me go, but this witness came up and said he saw me pick the pocket.</p>

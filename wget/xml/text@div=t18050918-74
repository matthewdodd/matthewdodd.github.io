            ; the prisoner came into the shop for an ounce of tea; there were customers in the shop which I was serving; she went from the counter to the door where I had piled up the soap, and took a cake of it, and put it between her knees under her cloak; I had suspicion; I went and took it from her; I asked her what she was going to do with it; she said she was going to buy it of me; in moving her legs a paper of starch fell from under her clothes with our mark on the paper, and there was a paper of starch missing out of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the paper of starch? - - A. Four shillings and sixpence, and the weight of the soap is two pounds and a quarter, value 1 s. 6 d. my brother keeps the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have got a family of small children; I am a dealer in old clothes; I went and sold my work; I went into that man's house for a quarter of a pound of tea; I felt something under my feet; I stooped down to see what it was; before I could pick it up, he came round the counter, and took it up; he said I wanted to steal this soap; he dragged me away, and took me to the watch-house; the next morning he took me out, and as we were going out of the watch-house, he said, if you will own to taking of this piece of soap, I will forgive you, as to the starch, my shop being full of people, it might drop down.</p>
               <p>Witness. I never said such a word.</p>

               <p>ROBERT ADAMS. I am a City policeman, No. 19. On the afternoon of the 13th of December I was in Bishopsgate-street, and saw a chaise which was standing by a door- I saw the prisoner three or four yards from it - he put his hand on the great coat which laid in the chaise - I stood watching him - I saw three or four more at the corner - he pulled the coat out of the chaise, and gave it to another young man - I laid hold of them both, and the other dropped the coat and got away - I took the coat - this is it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.How far were you from me when I took it? A. The width of Bishopsgate-street - it was about a quarter after four in the afternoon, quite daylight - you were dressed in a brown frock coat and a red comforter - I took you myself - a young man stopped you, and I took you into custody - I never lost sight of you - I was watching you in Bishopsgate-street - I took you at the entrance of Camomile-street - you were stopped, and I took you - the young man who stopped you came to the station-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was proceeding down Bishopsgate-street, and stopped to look at a linen-draper's shop, at the corner of Camomile-street - three men stood round me - and the officer secured me and left me while he went to run after the other men - a carman stopped me, and gave me into his charge.</p>
               <p> - SUTTERTHWAITE, of Old-street, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

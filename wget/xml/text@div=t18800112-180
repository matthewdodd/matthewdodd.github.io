                  </hi>. I live at 66, Baildon Street, New Cross Road—on Friday night, 26th Deceraber, about 10.30, I went into the Lien and Wheataheaf public-house, Deptford—I remained there about five minutes—when I came out I crossed ever to the Duke of Cambridge to see if a friend of mine was there—when I found he was not there I had two pennyworth of gin-and-water there—my coat was buttoned up—I walked down to the botton of High Street and came down, and not meeting my friend I went into the Lion and Wheasheaf again, and come out and did not stop to have anything—I then saw the three prisoners by the lamp-post—Ryan bid me a merry Chriatmas and asked me whether I would treat him—I said "No"—he immediately seized hold of me by the coat and said, "If you won't treat me I will treat you"—the moment Ryan seired me by the coat Charles Rutherford struck me on the hat, and some female called out, "Come away"—Ryan kept puling me down Charles Street, when Samuel Rutherford, drove his hand into my right-hand coat tore—he got me against a door, and pulled out my watch and handed it to Samuel, and he ran away—Charles went away the moment I was struck on the hat, when</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Charles was not present when the watch was taken—I might have said before the Magistrate, "I was sober; Ryan seized me first by the cost because I would not treat him; he might have laid hold of me to take me back to the public-house"—I have been in Maidstone, and was charged, but acquitted; I was with a woman for keeping a brothel—she got four months—she had been keeping the house about two years—I am not living with her now—that is four years ago—at first I thought this was a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>, but not when he knocked my hat to pieces—I had been to a funeral that day—I have been married nearly four years—I had only had a glass og beer after the funeral—I went to the police-station with the officer to charge Ryan and Charles Rtherford—Samuel was taken next day—I did not offer to take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as compensation—I know Mrs. Cooke—I swear I did not tell her I would take 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I got 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. William Sinee, timber merchant, for the damage to my coat—I never said anything about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">Two females stepped forward</hi>)—they are Mrs. Cooke and Mrs. Froud—these was a remand, and after I got the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

               <p>Q. How much did that contain? - A. One hundred and four pounds, I cwt. nett tea; I stopped the cart, and ran out of the gateway directly; I asked a gentleman if he saw a man go out with a chest of tea; yes, says he, there he runs; he was going towards Blackfriars-road; he had just crossed the street, I came up to him just as he was turning the corner by the oil-shop; he went into the Blackfriars road, I had a weapon, I hit him upon the cheek; d-n you, you thief, says I, where are you going with that; with that he flung it against me, and the marks came off upon my apron; he ran away; I hit him with the whip, and called out stop thief; two gentlemen coming along stopped him in Bride-lane; I never lost sight of him; I lest the tea on the pavement where he slung it down, we went back to the tea, and got a constable, I delivered the tea to the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. You left the tea in the possession of another man? - A. Yes; he is not here, he was a stranger.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you come back with a constable? - A. In about ten minutes; but we came back with the man directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know enough of the marks of the tea to know it was the same you lost? - A. There was a part of the mark left on it, it was directed for the sick prisoners at Falmouth, I was to deliver it at the Bell in Friday-street; I delivered it to the constable; the gentleman is here who had the possession of the prisoner till the constable came.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt about that being the property? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you don't deliver it safe, you are responsible? - A. Yes.</p>

             sworn. - I am a coal merchant: Hearing the cry of stop thief, and seeing the prisoner running, I stopped him a little way down Bride-lane; he had nothing when I stopped him; the last witness charged him with stealing a chest of tea; the prisoner went down on his knees and begged for mercy, and that he would let him go; I took him back with the carman to the place where the chest of tea was lying, just by the coffee-house in Bridge-street; I held him for a considerable time, the people round me persuaded me to let him go; in the mean time the carman went over to Bridewell-hospital, and got a constable; when he came, I delivered him into his charge; the tea went into the custody of the officer, and was taken over to Bridewell.</p>

               <p>THOMAS UNDERHALL sworn. - I am one of the beadles of Bridewell-hospital, and a constable; Mr. Schooley came to me, and I went with him to nearly opposite Mr. Varley's, the York hotel; I saw Mr. Wright had the prisoner at the bar by the collar, and Mr. Schooley gave me charge of him, and the tea I took under my protection; I have kept it ever since.

               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

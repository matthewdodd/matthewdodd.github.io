               <p>Q. On the 31st, when you missed them, was there any thing the matter with the box - A. When I went to unlock it I could not get the key into the lock of my box; I employed a man to pick the lock to get the box open.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen any of your property since - A. Yes, I saw one of the notes on the 1st of January, in the possession of a man of the name of Hughes. I had the number and dates of the notes before I lost them. When the prisoner was taken in custody, Clements (the constable) searched him; in his breeches pocket (the breeches were in his box) was found a one-pound note. The prisoner lodged at Wellington's; he did not abscond.</p>

               <p>Q. Now look at that; is that one of them - A. Yes, that is 20,132, August 5, 1813. I wrote the name of the person that I took it of before I lost it, and that name is on the note now in my own handwriting. I am sure I received that note on the 23rd.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot tell whether the five notes were taken at one time or not - A. They were all wrapped up in one piece of paper, and they were all gone at one time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Sunday night, the 26th of December, I was going to bed; the prosecutor was in bed; I having a candle in my hand I picked up a bit of paper; I opened it, and looked at it; I saw these notes; I said, Mr. Griffiths, are these your notes; whether he was asleep or awake, I don't know; he said, they are not my notes, I have no notes to loose, let me go to sleep. I put these notes in my pocket. On Tuesday, I changed one of them. He never said any thing to me about the notes until the Sunday following. I have lodged in the house seven months; I never robbed a person of a farthing nor ever was in any place of confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Do you remember the prisoner bringing the paper to you, and asking you if the notes were yours - A. No, he never spoke to me concerning any such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you ever speak to me of your loss until you gave me in charge.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had never spoken to him; I told the landlord and his wife of my loss.</p>

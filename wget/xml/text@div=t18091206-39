On the morning of the 22d of November, on my looking into my drawers I found eight or nine of my shirts missing. I asked my servant if she knew what had become of them, she told me she did not know, she expected they were all there. Not being satisfied, I sent for an officer to search her boxes: nothing was found in them. During the time the officer was in the house, the prisoner brought three of my shirts from the pawnbroker's. The officer searched her, and found in a pocket-book that she had in her bosom several duplicates, where a number of my cloaths were pawned, together with one of my neck handkerchiefs in her pocket. I understand she used to visit my servant,

            . Q. Do you know the prisoner - A. Yes; she is a girl of a good character in the situation she lived; she used to come and see me at my master's. The doors of the apartments were none of them locked. When I was away I cannot say where she went. That day week before my master called me to account he missed his linen, I counted his shirts over, I missed three shirts. When the prisoner came to see me I taxed her with the three shirts, there being no other person in the house. After a long time she confessed that she had taken them and pawned them. I promised her, if she would confess, I would find the money to redeem them.</p>
               <p>Q. She only spoke of them there - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say that she took them all at one time - A. No; these three were pawned for twenty-three shillings. I gave her the money, and she went and fetched them to my master's house again.</p>

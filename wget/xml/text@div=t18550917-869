                  </hi>. I am solicitor to the Times Assurance Com<lb></lb>pany. In Jan. last I sent letters to Mr. Frederick Moul, No. 15, Cannon-place, Brighton—I received letters in reply to those I had written—I know the letters I received to be Mr. Moul's—(<hi rend="italic">The following copy of a letter sent by the witness was here read, as follows; it was addressed to the prisoner and signed, Edwards and Edwards</hi>:" 8th Jan., 1851. Sir,—Your letter to the Times Life Company of the 5th ultimo has been handed to us. It is impossible that we can extend to you the clemency you ask till some expla<lb></lb>nation respecting this loan is forwarded by you to us. On applying for the loan, you named Mr. George Cobham as one of your sureties, and referred to Mr. Parsons to answer inquiries as to Mr. Cobham's responsibility, etc., etc.—reference was made to Mr. Parsons, who assured the Company of Mr. Cob<lb></lb>ham's responsibility and respectability; the loan was thereupon agreed We find that Mr. George Cobham executed a deed at the office of the Company at the same time that you and Mr. James C. Moul did. Upon applying to Mr. Cobham for payment under his guarantee, you having made default, Mr. Cobham comes to us with his solicitor and emphatically denies all know<lb></lb>ledge of the transaction; that he never was applied to by you to become security, and never executed the bond. Upon the bond being produced to him, with what we had been led to believe was his signature, he says it is a forgery; that he never executed any deed, and reiterates his denial Now this requires explanation: either you have committed a gross fraud upon the Company in introducing some one who personated Mr. Cobham, or Mr. Cobham is telling a gross lie. We expect to hear from you by return, how the matter really stands; whether Mr. George Cobham, a big, stout man, did execute the deed, Mr. Cobham, a butcher, of Woolwich, as, if he did, we are satisfied he can pay, and after his statement, he deserves to be, and shall be made to pay. Remember, by return we expect your reply."—The <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's answer to this letter was as follows</hi>; "9th Jan. Sir,—I received your letter this morning. As regards Mr. Cobham, he told me he was will<lb></lb>ing to sign the bond with me; but the day before I had the money, he told me he should have nothing to do with it; this was after the Company had granted me the loan. I was then placed so that I did not know what to do. I asked another friend to sign for me, who said he would; I was not aware that he had put the name of Mr. George Cobham down, as his own name is Mr. John Williams, a master whitesmith, who is now gone to Australia,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185509170045"></xptr>
               <p>which I did not know at the time he intended to go there. Had Mr. Cobham told me when I asked him that he would not do it, I should have given in Mr. Williams's. I am truly sorry that I was so foolish as to do what I did. As the loan was granted to me, I did not know what to do when Mr. Cobham disappointed me; and now all I can do is, to leave myself in your hands, and I do hope you will not take proceedings against me, and I will act honest and pay the loan, so that there shall be no more trouble about it. I sent Mr. Sweet, the agent of Mr. Cobham, before I filled up my loan paper"—in May, or July, I went to No. 15, Cannon-place, Brighton—the prisoner opened the door to me—I showed him this letter, and asked him whether that was his writing—he said it was—I told him that I had come down from the Times Life Office about it—he asked me to walk into a back room—when he got in he began talking about his circumstances, and telling me a long string of reasons why he had not paid the money; at last I put a stop to the conversation and went to the front door of the house, and beckoned in Terry, the constable, whom I had brought with me—I stated that I gave the prisoner into custody for forging that deed, producing the deed at the time—I pointed out the signature of George Cobham as being the signature which was forged—the prisoner said he was sorry it had come to this, he never meant to defraud the Company—we then all three went into the same back room again—he began talking about his circum<lb></lb>stances again, and asked if there was any means of settling it, whether he could pay it in part, and give security for the remainder—I told him I should listen to nothing of the kind—he asked me whether he could speak to Mr. Sheridan, and ask him to do it—Mr. Sheridan is one of the Directors of the Company—I said that I should certainly advise Mr. Sheridan to have nothing to do with it.</p>

Moul, and George Cobham—I should say not, I should say it was put in before—as to this one of Baxter's, I can posi<lb></lb>tively state that the deed was filled in before that signature was put to it—it is my positive opinion that it was all filled in before any of the signatures were affixed—nothing has been said to me about this—the clerk of Mr. Edwards fetched me, and told me I was to be a witness to the execution of the deed—I will give you one good reason for saying it was filled in before it was signed, and that is, you will find the word "Carrington" has been written in after the other part; we did not know that name, and therefore it was left blank, and upon their coming to the office that word was written in—there are no dates to the signatures.</p>

               <p>according to my impression—I do not know that it was so, but it is my impression that it must have been so, because we waited till the parties came, to ask them the name of Carrington, to fill in—I am not sure whether I was there when the parties came—it is my impression that they all came together, and when the name of Carrington was asked for, it was put before it was executed—it was most likely that it was put in before it was executed—what I have been saying is this, I believe the deed must have been previously filled up, before the signatures were affixed—that is what I have been saying all along—blanks were left for the name Carrington, and for the second policy—if the parties all came together, that would be put in before they signed—the regular course would be to fill in all the blanks before they signed—I do not know whether I was there when they came—I have no remembrance whether the deed was executed when it is dated—there is no one here from the office who can state that—the blank that was left for 17th March, 1854, was filled in afterwards—I cannot say whether it was after the signatures, but after the body of the deed was written—that is all I can say; whether it was after the signatures or not I cannot tell—I cannot tell positively whether it was filled in before the three parties signed the deed—it is my impression that the deed was written without the word "Carrington", and "17th March, 54, "and that those blanks were filled up before the parties executed it.</p>

            , who lives at Stanmore. On the 29th of September, at night, I fastened the outer door, and know that the larder window was secure. I went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock, and was disturbed about half-past three, by the dog barking, and a noise. I got up immediately, and found the house all safely locked up, till I came to the scullery door - I found a chopper forced into that; I took it out with difficulty, got out, and found the outer door open, and that the thieves had entered by the larder window. I missed the articles stated in the indictment, and a pair of reins, a bridle, and girths were taken from the stable. Mr. Poole, jun. and I went in pursuit, and traced footsteps some way, and while out, I received information from a man. I went to Edgware, and met Dolling with a bundle, containing some of the property, and afterwards found the prisoner in custody. I do not know him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Edgware. On Monday morning, the 29th of September, at half-past five, I was going off duty, and met one Westwood, coming as from Stanmore, with a bundle; and then met the prisoner, with a bundle under his arm - I said,</p>
               <p>"Halloo, Shepherd, you are in a hurry;" He said he was going up the road to work - I said,</p>
               <p>"I think you have got something which you should not have," and collared him; he said,</p>
               <p>"I have only got a little bit of beef, pray let me go - I will give you anything in the world." I took him to the cage, and put the bundle in my box; went after Westwood; lost him; returned to my box, and found the bandle contained two geese; he gave me a pair of reins and a bridle from under his frock, and a pair of girths were in his hat. I produce them. I shewed the geese to Eversley.</p>

I walked to Barking on the first of April; when I got home again, which was between six and seven o'clock, I took off my shoes and put them with the buckles in them under a clock which stands in the parlour; I did not miss them till the next day in the afternoon, then I went for the shoes and buckles to clean them, and I missed the buckles.</p>

               <p>Can you swear the prisoner is the person? - I should not choose to swear it, but to the best of my knowledge he is the person. He brought them in the evening; I think candles were lighted. He said they were his wife's buckles, but his name was on the inside of them. He said his name was

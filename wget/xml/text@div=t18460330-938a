                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas James Watkins, of No. 19, Devonshire-street, Lisson-grove, St. Marylebone. We get our living by taking houses and letting them out in tenements—my husband occasionally gets tipsy, and I do not trust him with money—in Sept., 1844, I had received 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and had also saved up 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my husband knew I had received some money from my family, and was plaguing me to know what it was—I in consequence deter<lb></lb>mined to put it away—I put eight 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. country bank notes, one 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, and fifty sovereigns together, into a tea-caddy, and put it into an old handkerchief, and took it to the house where the prisoner and his wife lived as my tenants at No. 78, in the same street—they occupied a little shop, a parlour and a bed-room—I saw the prisoner's wife—the prisoner was not present—he was in the shop—she put the tea-caddy into a chest under her bed, in my presence—I kept the key of the tea-caddy—the trunk was locked, and she kept the key of that—in April last year I had occasion to go to that tea-caddy again—Mrs. White turned up the bed and opened the box—I found the tea-caddy safe, and opened it, and put in three sovereigns more, and then locked it up as before—Mrs. White did not see me put the money in—I took the tea-caddy home, that no one should see it—I brought it back immediately—I never told the prisoner at any time anything about this tea-caddy—about a month after this I was sent for to White's house—it was on Whit-Monday morning, about half-past seven o'clock—I went into the middle-room—Mrs. White was then crying—I did not see anybody else—she said something to me, in consequence of which I ran for the police—I came back with Sergeant Thompson—I then found the prisoner at the house, with the tea-caddy upon the table, and the rag which was tied outside it—they were not there before I went for the policeman—they could not have been upon the table without my seeing them—I was very much flurried at seeing the empty box—Sergeant Thompson was taking down what they said they had lost—they said they had lost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and a tea-caddy spoon—the prisoner said the thieves had pushed the key out of the door, though the door was locked—he also said the thieves had, perhaps, come in through the window—I said nobody in the world could do it, and gave him into custody—he was discharged before the Magistrate—after the prisoner had been taken a second time and remanded, his wife came to me, and in consequence of what she said I directed the cesspool at the back of the pre<lb></lb>mises to be searched—I was present when a worsted stocking was found, containing nearly 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, with half a sovereign, and a tea-caddy spoon, which the prisoner said they had lost that morning, and two purses, which the wife said were hers—I know the prisoner had not been out on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the robbery, because it was Monday morning, and he never does go cut—he said he had been there all night.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant D</hi> 4.) On the 12th of May last I was fetched by the last witness to the prisoner's house—I found the prisoner and his wife there—I asked the prisoner which way the thieves got in—he said at the middle door, the parlour door—that leads into the passage—I asked how they could get in there, and if he had locked the door—he said yes, but he had left the key in—I said it was impossible for them to do it—he said he found the key on the floor—I asked how it came in, for I found the key in the lock—he said he had picked it up, and put it in—I went and looked at the bed-room—there was a turn-up bed—a tester-bed I believe you call it—it was down—Mrs. Watkins showed me a chest—I endeavoured to pull it out from under the bed—I could not get it out—nobody could have got the tea-caddy out without taking the bed up—I received this key from the prisoner, which I produce—it opens Mrs. Watkins' caddy—the prisoner said he had los between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and a tea-caddy—he said the key was picked up in the shop, and also the key of the box—he said he picked up a caddy in the front shop—I took him into custody—the Magistrate did not consider there was evidence enough against him, and he was discharged—it was said in his presence that the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. they lost themselves was lost out of a drawer on the left hand side of the middle room.</p>

I am the wife of Alfred Arnold, of Winyard-street, Kennington-lane—I am the sister of the prisoner's wife—on the 10th of March this year I had a conversation with the prisoner and his wife about this matter—my sister was grieving about the loss of her money—the prisoner asked her if she would like to know who had the money—she said "Yes," and he said he had it—my sister screamed, and went almost into a fit—I told him I thought he had killed her, and on that he said he would find the money, and restore it—I saw him several times after that, and asked him if he had found the money or got it—he said he had not—in consequence of that I made a com<lb></lb>munication to Mr. Hughes, the superintendent of police, of what he said, and upon that the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 7, Gower's Road, Dalston—I have been a traveller in the provision trade a great number of years—I have known the defendant four or five years—I knew him when he was a journeyman at Knightsbridge—he first started in business for himself, I should say about two years ago—I became a traveller to Messrs. Holden &amp; Parker, in February last year, and I called on the defendant, and got orders from him to the amount of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—sometimes he paid me, and sometimes he transmitted the money—I left Mr. Holden's at the end of November, or the beginning of December last year, and went in the employment of Messrs. Wilson &amp; Bliss—Messrs. Holden &amp; Parker, dissolved partnership at the end of the year, and I left then—after I joined Messrs. Wilson &amp; Bliss I called on the defendant, and asked him for orders—the terms were one month's credit, the usual terms—the first order was on 9th December, and that amounted to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 16th December there was an order for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on 23rd December, 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 30th December, 31<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 6th January, 51<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 16th January, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 18th January, 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; 20th January, 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the 27th January, 54<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is a</p>

Penson supplied him with goods—I went into Holden's service in February last year—I received a salary, no commission—I know that Mr. Holden is the prisoner's uncle—I did not introduce the prisoner to Mr. Holden as a customer—I should say that during the time I was in Mr. Holden's service the prisoner had goods amounting to about 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I won't say 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have told you what I think it was—it was 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., more or less, if you like—I began to travel for Messrs. Wilson &amp; Bliss at the beginning of December—I had a salary there—they had only just started in business when I joined them—they were making a new business—I can't say that I was an active traveller; I hope I was—I believe that three of the defendant's brothers have taken Mr. Holden's business since he has retired—that is not in the same district as Messrs. Wilson &amp; Bliss—one is in the Goewell Road, and the other is in Southwark—his brothers are in the wholesale way, as Messrs. Wilson &amp; Bliss are—when I was at Mr. Holden's I used to go to the defendant once a week for orders, and I told him afterwards that I should be glad to see him at Wilson &amp; Bike's warehouse—he said he would come down—that was almost immediately after I had left Mr. Helden's—I told the defendant I had gone into the employ of Wilson &amp; Bliss—Mr. Holden was still in business at that time; that is Holden &amp; Parker were—they continued till the end of 1870, and then Mr. Holden kept on on his own account till 2nd February—sometimes the defendant came down to Wilson &amp; Bliss's warehouse—I was desirous of getting all the orders I could for my master.</p>

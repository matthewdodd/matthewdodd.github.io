                  </hi>. I reside in Spring-place, Wandsworth-road, Lam<lb></lb>beth. On 2nd Nov., I went to bed at a few minutes past eleven o'clock; I had fastened my doors and windows—I am satisfied every thing was perfectly fast—the next morning I came down at seven—I saw a light in the back-parlour, and found the window-shutters had been forced open, and the window was open—I missed sheets, counterpanes, and other things, which had been in the front-room, and which were brought into the back-parlour—I went to the station and came back—I then missed a writing-desk, which had been standing on a dining-table in the back-parlour—I had seen it safe the night before; and the counterpane, sheets, towels, an apron, and a watch—the watch was in my writing-desk, the other things were in the boxes which were under the the counter in the shop—they had been brought into the back-room, I had seen them safe the night before—any person could get from the back-parlour to the shop, without breaking any locks.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 77). From information I received I went to the prosecutor's house on the 3rd Nov., about half-past eight o'clock in the morning—I found some thieves had got over a fence five feet high, and then in at the back-window, by forcing the bolt and shutters, and forcing up the the window—that fence divides the premises of the prosecutor from a public thoroughfare—Spice was with me—I left the premises, and in a waste piece of ground I saw Webb walking to and fro, with a bag in his hand, and there was a load of gravel or sand—the fence divides the premises from the high-road which runs at the back of the premises; and the sand-heap was in an open piece of ground in front of the house—there is a road between the house and the waste ground—I was in plain clothes—I saw Webb go and sit down on the heap of sand, and he had a bag, as it appeared to be, under his arm—I went into the Wands-worth-road, and there I saw Wells—he went and joined Webb——they remained a few minutes, and then went away together, followed by Spice—I then went to the sand-heap, and examined it, and found the property which I now produce, tied up in two large bundles, covered over with the sand—I let it remain there for a few minutes, but some children being in the neighbourhood, began to run over the sand, and to remove one bundle—I then took the two bundles away and put them in the toll-house—at half-past five in the evening, just at dusk, I went with Spice, and took the same property back to where I found it, and covered it over with sand—we then went and watched for a few minutes, standing under a large wall—we then saw the three prisoners go up to the heap—we were thirty or forty yards from them; it was dark—I could see them by the gas light</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185011250184"></xptr>
               <p>—they were all at the sand, in a stooping position over the heap, at the spot where I had put the goods, which I had placed in the same part they had been in before—I then saw them all come away together, and Webb was carrying the property which was then all in one bundle in a sack—I could not see who put it in the sack, as they all stood round—when they came down to where I was standing, I caught hold of Webb, and said, "What have you got here?"—he said nothing, but dropped the sack—I took him and the sack to the station, with the assistance of another officer, and Spice took the other two prisoners—I examined the bundle, and found this desk, this watch, and all the property named—it was what I had discovered in the morning, and concealed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, V</hi> 47). I went with Gibbs to the premises—I have heard what he has stated, which I confirm—I followed Webb and Wells in company—they were joined by two more men, near Old Vauxhall-gate—Winkletop was not one of the men—they all four walked some distance, and then Webb took one of the strange men in company, and walked on, and Wells took the other—I followed Webb, as he had the bag under his arm, over Westminster-bridge to Charing-cross, and to the Seven-dials, where the man who was with Webb, went into a lodging-house, and Webb turned down Church-lane, and I lost sight of him about eight or ten doors down—in the evening I assisted Gibbs in carrying back the property and burying it—I then watched and saw the three prisoners come up the back of Bradley-terrace, and go to the heap—they were all in a stooping position together—it was just under a lamp—they remained a short time, and then turned away, and I saw Webb was carrying this property on his shoulder—Gibbs took him, and I took the other two prisoners—they did not say anything—this is the property.</p>

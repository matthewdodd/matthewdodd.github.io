            , Esq. On the 31st of August I was out of place, and about eight o'clock in the evening I was at the end of <placeName id="t18260914-436-crimeloc2458">St. Martin's-court, in St. Martin's-lane</placeName>

(he came right in front of me) I never lost sight of him till the officer took him; a crowd collected: as we were going to the watch-house Hall came up, took hold of my arm, and said, "That is not the man who robbed you - I know where he is gone"- we then went to the watch-house - my property has not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. At the time the man snatched your watch did you hear any thing? A. No. The place was very quiet. I had not seen Hall till he spoke to me.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was on duty at the end of St. Martin's-court, looking up New-street, and saw the two prisoners station themselves at the bottom of the court; Flashman stood at the corner, and Hall about a yard from him, so as to let one person pass between them - I heard Hall say "Now;" they drew close together: the prosecutor came up - Flashman snatched at his watch and ran away; I pursued, and took him; Hall came up, and said, "Let that young man go - he is not the person"- I said, "If you know any thing about the robbery come to the watch-house;" I saw Hall go close to Flashman's side - my brother officer came up - I got him to hold Flashman's other arm; we went to the watch-house, and secured him there - then came out, and took Hall; I knew them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They must have been close together? A. Yes - I was not two yards off; the snatch was made within a second of his saying "Now." I was paying more attention to them than Shaw - whether he heard it I do not know; Hall might have escaped if he chose. The watchmen were not on duty.</p>

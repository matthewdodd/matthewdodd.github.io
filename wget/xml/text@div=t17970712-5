            Twice.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you were there, you denied it shoutly, and said, you did not know any thing about it? - A. I said so the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time, you understood, I believe, that if you did tell of any body else that was concerned in it, you would not be punished? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you laid the blame upon this man? - A. I did not lay any other blame upon him than what he had done.</p>
               <p>Q. You first denied having any concern in it at all? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The second time, you understood, you were to be saved, if you accused another person? - A. Yes, if I accused him right.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you laid the blame upon this man? - A. I did not lay any blame upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. You took a part of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took that to be a very honest thing, did not you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been an honest man, do not you think it would have been your duty to have told Mr. Wyllie as soon as you knew of it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know your own opinion of yourself, did not you look upon yourself then as bad as the thief at least? - A. I did not take it.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Levy.) Q. Did any body ask you any questions before the Lord Mayor? - A. I was asked if I knew the prisoner; I told my Lord, I did, by sight, but we had never any dealings together; my Lord Mayor asked me, if I had the note, and I told him I never had, if I had, I would voluntarily have come forwards.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Webb.) Do you remember which of them had possession of the note? - A. Burton put the note into my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Spicer the person that was with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

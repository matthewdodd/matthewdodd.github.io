            . I am a Thames Police constable. On the 11th of March I stopped these two prisoners, going into the Export Dock, at the west India Docks, between twelve and one o'clock. Jones had this compass under his arm, concealed; I asked how he got it, he said McCarthy gave it him to bring out. I asked McCarthy if he knew anything about it - he said Yes that he gave it to Jones to carry. Jones gave me the furniture of the compass out of his hat; and McCarthy gave me these other articles, which he said he bought of the ship-keeper of the Woodbridge. I went to that ship, but could not find the ship-keeper - I took them to the watch-house, and found a green cloth round McCarthy's body.</p>

            . I am ship-keeper of the Woodbridge. On the 11th of March, I saw McCarthy and a ship-keeper, named Cadwallader, come on board; Jones followed them in a short time - I had not seen this compass, but had seen the other things in the cabin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What has become of this ship-keeper? A. He has fled, and I am in his place; he told me he was going to sell these things - this was done in broad day; he did not attempt to conceal anything - that man appeared to be the master of the ship, he employed me to clean these candlesticks for him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE GARNETT HUSKE MUNNINGS. I believe this compass is mine, but cannot swear to it.</p>

On the 15th of January, about ten at night, the prisoner came into the watch-house at the corner of St. Andrew's Church-yard; she was crying and making a great noise. The watchman and beadle said, Here is a charge for you, this woman has drowned her child in the New River, and she is come to deliver herself up. I only asked her one question. I said, Good woman, what have you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176902220029"></xptr> drowned your child in the New River? She said, If I have, I am come here to suffer for it; and I had rather die than live. I sent her to the Compter directly, the next day I brought her here ( it being sessions time) before an Alderman. I was ordered to go with her to the New River, and search for the child. She went very willingly with me, and shewed me the place. I took her to Sir

            . I live in Mutton-lane. The prisoner is my own sister. This daughter of her's was about a year and a half old, and was at my sister's at Deptford, whose name is Comfor. The prisoner brought the child from that sister's to my room; it was with me Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The prisoner breakfasted and dined with me on the Sunday, and went out with the child in the afternoon; when she came home at night without the child, I asked her where it was; she fell a crying sadly, and said it was in the water; that was all she said to me. There was not a dearer mother born than she was to her baby: she would hardly let it be a minute out of her arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she in distress?</p>
               <p>Underwood. She is very low, and could do but little for it. I went up with her to the New River; she said she would go and surrender herself. I bid her a good night. I hardly knew what she said, I was so frightened; and I believe she hardly knew what she did say.</p>

               <p>I came away from Deptford with the child, and went to this sister's room. It was there from the Thursday till the Sunday evening. A little after three I took my child out to give it an airing. Going along Islington, I stopped to have a pint of beer, as it rained very hard. When I came out at the door the moon shone very fine; and whether the child saw the light of the moon in the river I cannot say, but it gave a spring from my arm into the water, and I ran away directly, being sadly frightened. It is very likely, if they asked me if I had hanged my child, I might have said I have. I was so frightened, I did not know what I said.</p>

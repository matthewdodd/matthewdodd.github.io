                  </hi>. I am a law stationer of 35, Southampton Buildings—on 21st March, between 12 and 1 in the afternoon, the prisoner came into my office and produced this cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., drawn by Edward W. Williams in favour of Toovey and Sons, payable at the National Bank, Oxford Street branch, endorsed William Toovey—he said he came from Messrs. Toovey and Sons, and would I oblige them by changing the cheque—I said it was rather unusual for Messrs. Toovey to send for change, although they were in the habit of sending for goods—I pointed to the name of the drawer, and asked who Mr. Williams was—he said, "He is an old customer of ours"—I did not know the prisoner, before—I then gave him 10 sovereigns and 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—about half an hour afterwards I made some discovery about the cheque, and I went round to Messrs. Toovey and Sons, and I saw the prisoner that same evening at his place of employ, 61, Chancery Lane—on the morning of the 29th I saw him there again and gave him into custody—as he turned to leave my office I saw two scars on the left side of his neck.</p>

I am a plan draughtsman—on 21st March, about 6 o'clock, Mr. Phillips and the prisoner came to my office; Mr. Phillips asked me if I had known him, and how long; I told him eight or nine years, perhaps more—he asked if he had been with me in the morning, and I told him he had, from about 11.30 or 11.45 to about 1.30 or later—he had been with me continuously that time, at 9, Church Passage, Chancery Lane, and elsewhere—he had dinner with me, and we went out afterwards next door to the Apple Tree and Mitre, and had a game at billiards—I was having my dinner when he came in; I began my dinner about 11.30—he made out a bill for me to one of my customers—I was dictating it to him while I was having my dinner—he was not in my service; I don't know that he was in any service—he was working for himself—I sent the bill down, and adjourned with him to the Apple Tree and Mitre; it forms part of the same house in which I have my office—he was never out of my sight—Mr. Phillips said to me in the morning "Do you think he would be guilty of such an act as this?"—I</p>

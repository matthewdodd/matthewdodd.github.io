            . On the 27th of June last I was going from my mother's with a bundle containing all the articles mentioned in the indictment to my brother, at Wrougham's, 161, New Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body take the bundle away from you - A. Yes, the prisoner, at the top of Major Forlie's passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before - A. I had seen him before; I knew him by sight; I never spoke to him. He said, my little girl you are carrying a bundle to Mr. Wrougham's; I have just been up to your mother; give me the bundle, and you can run home. I said I must not leave it with anybody whatever; he said he would give me a shilling if I would let him have it. I told him I must take it myself; he then again said he would give me a shilling. I told him I wanted to see the young man; then he swore, and used threatening language. He knocked me down, took my bundle from me, and run away. I ran after him, hallooed out stop thief, and got close up to him. He said he would cut my throat if I did not hold my tongue. I ran after him until I was out of breath. I lost him at last.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day or night was this - A. About half after eleven on Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing at all of it. I never saw the girl until she was brought to me at the office.</p>

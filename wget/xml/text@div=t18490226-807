                  </hi> I am errand-boy to Mr. Wall, a fishmonger. On Saturday night, 10th Feb., I went to Mr. Broad's for some pork—I saw both prisoners, one buying the pig's head, the other outside the door—I did not get what I wanted—I left the shop, and left Robson still outside the door—he had a cap on then, and Rose had a hat—I afterwards saw the prisoners come out of Water-lane together, and they stood against the pump—I heard Rose say to Mr. Broad that he thought he could pick out the party who had stolen the pork—Rose had a cap on then—a female was taken into custody, and then Robson came up with a hat on like the one that Rose had had on before.</p>

About a quarter-past eleven o'clock that night I saw Remnant, and made inquiries about the pork—I saw Rose coming towards me, with a cap on—he said he thought he knew somebody who had taken the pork; he could tell me who it was; he thought they were musicians, or something of that kind—I afterwards went to a house in Water-lane, where Rose lodged, and found the leg of pork in the soil of the privy; it was shown to Remnant, and he said it had a foot on—I went back, and found the foot in the cupboard, and this cap on the bed—I had seen Rose about an hour and a half before, wearing a cap similar to this—I fitted the foot to the leg of pork, and they corresponded.</p>

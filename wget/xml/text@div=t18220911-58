               <p>"D - n you, I shall know you." I am positive the prisoner is that man; I saw him running off with my watch, and the seal hanging down; he drew it out of my pocket; I had seen him in the public-house that night, and they were in the street just before I turned up the lane, walking at a distance from each other; I recollected the men again; I knew the dress of the others, but could not swear to them; I was sober; I had only been to two public-houses that evening; and was in a mill for two hours; I might have drank four pints of ale in all, and no spirits at all; I was quite sober, and knew what I was doing very well; I saw the prisoner's features well in the house, and noticed him as I went up the street; he was taken, I believe, on the 3d, but I had then gone into the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You came from home to go to the fair - A. No, on purpose to see my relations. I was perfectly sober when I was robbed; it was getting daylight; I saw them coming when they were a hundred yards off; the last man was dressed in a dark corded jacket, which looked dirty - a pair of fustian trowsers, about the same colour - and I took great notice of his complexion; he had no coat or apron on; he had a hat. I stood talking with the woman. The state of my dress prevented my following them. I should have been afraid to run after them, if I could. I saw Campbell, the constable, soon after, and told him I knew one of them, and described his dress. The constable brought the prisoner to me on the 6th of July; he was then dressed in the same jacket and trowsers as when he robbed me, but had a white smock frock over them. I never said I did not know either of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say you fixed on the last man, because you thought him like a man you saw in the fair - A. I went up the street after I was robbed, and met a man in the street, dressed nearly the same as one of the three, and collared him; but as soon as I came to look at him, I told him I did not think he was the man. His trowsers were fulstian, but a little lighter than the prisoner's, and he was taller. I was in a fright when I stopped him. I never charged any other man. I understand the prisoner lives at Twickerham.</p>
               <p>Q. You met Spruce by accident - A. Yes; in the room, I gave her a glass of ale. I have talked with her about this two or three times. When I took the man in the town, I did not say I thought he was the last man, but thought him one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask her to go back and help you, because you did not know the men - A. No; I said to her,</p>
               <p>"You must know these men; and as I do not, tell me who they are." I did not know where they lived. I know the prisoner by his face and dress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you apprehended the other man, did you take him for the prisoner, or for one of the other men - A. For one of the others. I thought the girl might know where they came from, which was the reason I asked her to assist me, but I knew the prisoner's person.</p>

            . I live at Hounslow; I was at the Castle at Isleworth, dancing with Jones; I went out a little before him, he joined me in the street. I went up Walpole-lane with him, and had not been there five minutes, before three men came up the lane from Isleworth, running one after the other; two held Mr. Jones, while Levy robbed him. I did not see them before, one run against him with his head and two seized and held him, while the other robbed him; the prisoner is the man who robbed him. I had seen him before that day; I had a little acquaintance with him, but not much; I knew his face quite well. I had seen him that day in the fair, and also at the Castle in the evening, and had spoken to him, but was not in his company. When I walked up the street with Jones, the prisoner and two others stood outside the public-house; I did not speak to him then. Jones was as sober as possible. I am positive he is the man. After robbing him, all three took to their heels, and ran towards Twickenham; the prosecutor did not follow them, but went to a public-house to get assistance. I saw him lay hold of another man in the street, and let him go again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How old are you - A. Twenty-one; I have no parents. I went to the fair alone; Jones was a stranger to me till I met him. I saw the prisoner at the Castle, but was not in his company that day; he had two more men with him, whom I should not know; one wore a white smock frock; they were both Twickenham men; the prisoner lives on Twickenham Common. I was standing in the lane with Jones; two men ran against him, and Jones said,</p>
               <p>"Do you mean robbing me?" Levy said,</p>
               <p>"I do," and pulled his watch out, and handed it to one of the others instantly, and then turned his pockets out. I knew Levy instantly - he wore a fustian jacket and trowsers, and a hat, but no apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not tell Jones you knew one of them, and where he lived - A. I did not know it would be required till I was taken before the Justice. Jones went to the Castle to look for them; when he asked if I knew them, I said, I did not think I did, he said he really thought I knew them; I said, I did not, and afterwards that I knew one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give your reason for not going back with him, that you were ashamed - A. That was not the reason. I told him one was a Twickenham man - and told him the name.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he did not know any of the men, and you must go with him to point them out - A. Yes, he went to look for them. I went before the Justice on Monday - the robbery was on a Tuesday. The constable says the prisoner gave himself up. I did not see him about; he called when I was out, and left word that he was innocent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When Jones first asked if you knew them, you said you did not - A. Yes; I did not know that he wished to go on with it - but when he said he would. I told him directly, on the same night, and said he lived on Twickenham Common; this was before Jones applied to the constable.</p>

            . I am constable of Twickenham. On the 3d of July, I was applied to by the Isleworth constable about this. I apprehended the prisoner on Twickenham Common on the evening of the 4th of July; his person was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110036"></xptr>described and his name mentioned to me; I had no difficulty in finding him. I had searched his house on the 3d, and next day about nine found him near his home; I told him he was my prisoner, and he surrendered; I understand he had been to surrender at my house on the day before. I had not seen Jones myself; he was sent for and came. Spruce was examined on the 4th, I think.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe Spruce was brought up before the Monday - A. She was with the constable looking after him. East the headborough is not here; I believe he went to him also to surrender; he lived with his mother on the common. I think Spruce was not examined till Monday. The prisoner was dressed then in a smock frock. We all went before the Magistrate on the 6th.</p>

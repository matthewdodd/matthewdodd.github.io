I packed them up in a box to carry home; this was on the first day of the fair. We carry the goods home every night. When I had packed them up, I waited for my husband to come and take the tilt of the stall down, and take them home; some people that came past bid me take care of my goods, for they said there was a bad man or two behind my stall; that they were afraid I should be robbed; that put me in a good deal of fear. I saw Value at the end of the stall; there was another, but I could not get a sight of him. My daughter said I will go and watch him; she went and faced him. My husband not coming, I said we must take the things and go home. I went to take the tilt down, the prisoner Value that instant took up the box and ran away with it; he gave a whistle, and the rest all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150075"></xptr> came up to him immediately. I pursued them down Chick-lane; they ran into a court; I was afraid to follow them there. I did not see the faces of the others till they were taken. I saw them all run away together. I got two constables, Mr. Hall and Mr. Massey, and they took the prisoners as they were selling the things. When they were taken, I told the constables I could swear to Value but not to the others.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable. Mr. Massey came with the prosecutrix to Mr. Henshaws, and said she had been robbed. I went immediately to Sharp's-alley, in Blackboy-alley, to the house of one Lynes, and looked through the window, and saw Bolton and Ward showing a woman a roll of green ribband, and a piece of lace.</p>
               <p>What sort of a house is it? - A little house; a bawdy-house.</p>
               <p>Is it kept by a man or a woman? - By a woman.</p>
               <p>(The goods were produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutrix and her daughter.)</p>
               <p>Hall. I took the prisoners down to the Anchor and Crown, and left them in custody of some of the neighbours, while I and Massey went down Field-lane, and saw the other prisoners in the house of one Mrs. Tipton, who keeps a clothes-shop, in the back room; they were sitting down. I did not see them doing any thing. I found lace, ribbands, mits, and other things, tied up in a handkerchief, and thrown into the coal-hole. I brought them all to the Anchor and Crown, where the others were. I searched them, and found rolls of ribband in every one of their breeches, they are in the bundle which the prosecutrix has sworn to. This roll of sash ribband (producing it) I found in Value's pocket.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I can swear to that ribband; it is not rolled up as they are rolled up at the shops; I bought it by the yard at a sale, and rolled it up myself on a piece of paper.</p>

               <p>Going along by the end of Field-lane I picked up a paper; I stopped to have some oysters, and while the woman was giving me change for 6 d. Mr. Hall came up, and seised me with the paper of things.</p>
               <p>BOLTON's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>My master works in Sharp's-alley. I was going home at half after eleven o'clock; coming through the alley, I saw this bit of ribband and lace lie. I saw a light in a window. I went in to ask the woman to lend me a candle; while she was lending me a candle this gentleman came in and took me.</p>
               <p>WHITE's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I happened to be locked out, and coming down Field-lane I saw a woman at a door. I asked her if I could have a lodging there; she said yes; as I was going to pay for the lodging the men came up, and said they are all here. There was nothing found upon me.</p>

               <p>I was going to buy a shirt. The gentlemen came in, and said they are all here. There was nothing found upon me though the constable swears it.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner on the 22d of June, showing this watch at South-end, in Kent - I walked on, he followed me, and said, he found it at the milestone, near Bromley; that he met a drunken sailor just before with some seals in his hand, and he thought it had belonged to him; and did I think it was worth five shillings? I said, "I do not know; I may perhaps find an owner for it," and gave him the five shillings.</p>

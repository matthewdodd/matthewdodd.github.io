               <p>I am nephew to the last witness, I am shopman, and manage the business in the shop; I have known the prisoner many years, I always thought him a very honest man; on the 28th of September, I told Mr. Moser he must have somebody in the house not very honest, we had missed candles two years and a half; I went and searched the different parts of the shop, and in the place where this man works, there was an iron box underneath his bench, and there were candles such as we generally use.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Was he allowed a box to put his own candles in? - A. No; he always burns oil; the next night, I found two more, the next night I found six, I looked on Sunday, and they were gone; Saturday night was our annual feast, I had not an opportunity of examining that place, and on Sunday morning I did, and they were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any sciffars? - A. Yes; but not upon our premises, they were marked with E X, our private shop mark; they were found in his own room; I reckoned the candles before they were taken, every night for the last week; I found some in his pocket, in two papers, that were marked by me; they were marked with a pin in the tallow, some with an M. and others with an R.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.There were only seven pieces of candles that were marked, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>I am an apprentice to Mess. Jackson and Moser: on the Wednesday, previous to the prisoner being taken, the 5th of this month, at night, Mr. Moser asked me if I knew any thing of the things being stole, I told him, no; only I understood they had been missed; and accordingly every night between that and Sunday, they were marked some of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when they were taken upon the prisoner? - A. Yes; there were twelve whole candles, and eight pieces, some of them marked; I think there were seven of them marked, some pieces and some whole ones; some I had marked myself; and likewise a small nail bag was found at his lodging, and a pair of sciffars and some buck leather.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I bought 12lb of candles in January, in Holborn, and they were part of them that were found in my possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living in Hampshire—I came up in December for my pension, having been formerly a soldier—I received it on the 8th of January—it was one sovereign, a half-sovereign, sixpence, and a penny—when I came out I saw the prisoner and a woman standing together—I asked for a cook-shop—the woman said, "I will show you one close by"—I went and had a basin of pea-soup—I said to the prisoner and the woman, "I will give you one"—I then said, "I am not very well, I have got three miles to go, and if I could get a lodging here I should be glad"—the prisoner said, "I can let you lodge, and give you a good bed, and the key of the room"—he took me to the lodging—I thought he was the master—we sat down by the fire—he said, "You have not paid your lodging"—I said, "No"—I took out a shilling—he went out, and brought in some porter—I said I could not take any—he then took me up a street—I said, "How much further are you going to fake me?"—he took me into a public-house, and there was a woman—she had got a pot of something—she gave it to me—I gave the prisoner some—he then asked me to lend him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and he would pay me to-morrow morning, for he was a man of his word—I lent him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. altogether—we then went back to the house where he took me first—I sat down by the fire, and said I should like to go to bed—there were two or three women there—the prisoner said, "I am here, come, I will light you up stairs"—he went up with me—I sat down on the foot of the bed—he began to shake the things about, and said, "I will take off some of your clothes"—he untied my left shoe, and took off my trowsers, which he put up in a heap—he said, "Take out your rag of a purse"—my money was safe then—I felt it before I went up stairs—I took off my jacket, which he put on the top of my trowsers—I then got into bed—I laid a little bit, and then thought, as there were three beds there, I would take my money out of my pocket, but it was then gone—noone but the prisoner had been in the room—I called for some one to come—the prisoner came up, looked round the room, and said, "There is nothing in your things"—he then went and told the mistress of the house—she came up, and I said I had lost a sovereign, a half-sovereign, and a sixpence—she said she would try to find it out—she went down, and came up again with the prisoner—she said, "Give this man his money"—they then went down—a policeman was got, who found 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some cop<lb></lb>per on the prisoner.</p>

On the 8th of January, about half-past seven o'clock in the even<lb></lb>ing, the prisoner came there, and I changed him half a sovereign—I saw a sovereign mixed with his halfpence and silver, and said, "You have got a sovereign mixed with your money, you will probably lose it"—he said, "No, give me change," and I did—he gave me 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out, to take care of till the next morning, that he might buy a pair of trowsers—I went for a piece of paper—he said, "What are you going to do?"—I said, to give him a memorandum—he said, "If you are going to do any writing, I will have nothing to do with it; give me my money back," which I did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Counsel. How long had this young man lived with you? - He was not a servant of mine; he was under my head porter.</p>
               <p>This money was supposed to be taken out of your desk in your warehouse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it a place which is in general resorted to by people? - Yes, just to deliver parcels, and go away again.</p>
               <p>Upon opening the desk, how many marked guineas did you find? - I did not open the desk at all.</p>
               <p>Did not you see it opened? - No.</p>
               <p>Do not you know what quantity of marked guineas there were in it? - Twenty-seven.</p>
               <p>How long has it been the fashion to mark the money? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Did you mark all that was put into that desk? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not that money get into circulation? - No, never; this money was kept by itself on purpose.</p>
               <p>Did you keep the key of the desk? -</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>There is a desk in the warehouse; it is usually kept locked; I have the key.</p>
               <p>Do you sit there to receive parcels, or when parcels are brought there, do you take them in, and lock them up? - I do.</p>
               <p>Do you usually keep the desk locked? - Always.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250177"></xptr>Did you mark any money on leaving that desk? - Yes, thirty-seven guineas, and twenty shillings in silver, and four half crowns; all these I marked some days before, about four days, except seven guineas, seven guineas I marked over night; I had thirty guineas marked four or five days.</p>
               <p>How much money had you in that desk marked? - That I cannot tell; I kept the unmarked in a purse by itself, and the marked in a leather purse, and the silver in a wooden dish.</p>
               <p>I suppose the occasion of your marking the money was, that you had lost money, and wanted to detect the thieves? - On the 16th of September, between eight and nine, I was sitting on the steps, and the prisoner brought an old lanthorn, which his master bid him put into the warehouse; I gave the prisoner the large key to open the door; there is a key to the desk, another to the door.</p>
               <p>What did you do with the key of the desk? - I had it in my pocket; he stopped about twenty minutes in the warehouse; and few a minutes after his taylor came down the street, and they went down to drink a glass, I sent for the key to go to wash myself; I took the large key from him, I immediately opened the desk and I saw the leather purse which had the thirty-seven guineas was reversed, turned upside down, after that I took and counted them, and there was only thirty-six, I told the silver, and I missed one of the half crowns; I locked the desk and went to my master, and told him; my master told me to go into the warehouse; and he came in and called up the prisoner and accused him; the prisoner said he never robbed him of a farthing; I told him he had taken a guinea and half-a-crown, and some halfpence that morning; my master desired him to take the money out of his pocket; accordingly my master found the guinea and half-a-crown upon him, knowing it to be mine, as he knew my mark.</p>
               <p>Did you see the guinea and the half-crown that he produced out of his pocket? - Yes, the constable has it, it had my mark; I am sure it was in the desk when the young man went into the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you had not paid away any of this marked money? - No, I kept it; it was not circulating money, I kept it on purpose to catch the prisoner.</p>
               <p>How could your desk be got open? - I suppose by the virtue of a false key.</p>
               <p>Was that key searched for? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you pay that money to nobody? - No, I never passed it.</p>
               <p>What is the mark? - There is a horse upon the guinea, and I cut his leg with a dash; and on the half crown, opposite the king on the near side there is a dash.</p>
               <p>(Shewn to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. You told my Lord, I think, that thirty-seven guineas had been marked for four days? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the same mark on all the guineas? - All the same mark.</p>
               <p>You could not tell one from the other? - No.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you began marking guineas? - When I had about seven or eight; I kept adding to the heap, but never took any from it.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear now, that in no one instance any one of these guineas was taken out and got into circulation; could it not happen by accident or any other way? - I never meant to take any out, it was a thing impossible, for nobody had a key to this desk but myself.</p>
               <p>Was not this young man searched directly, to see if he had a key? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Have you lost any of your marked guineas before? - Yes, several times.</p>
               <p>How many had you got before you missed any? - I cannot say, then I kept putting more, every five or six days there was a guinea taken.</p>
               <p>Somebody, however, at different times took out a marked one? - Yes, he had.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178610250178"></xptr>Had you lost any of your silver? - No; I used three different marks, these thirty-seven were marked alike.</p>
               <p>What was the mark on the half-crown? - A dash on the tail side.</p>

               <p>Do you remember Mr. Thompson's evidence, and what be supposed had been done by this young man? - Perfectly well; Mr. Thompson called me up in the Coach-office, on the 16th of September, and told me that the prisoner had been taking money out of the desk; he ordered me to call him into the office; I called him up, and Mr. Thompson told him to take what money he had out of his pocket; and he laid down the money he had, which was part of it mine, and among that money was a guinea and half-a-crown, which he said belonged to Wadsworth our book-keeper; Wadsworth claimed it, and said it was his, and came out of the desk; the lock was not broke as I observed; he was not searched for a false key; his general character was a good one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Did not the prisoner desire to be searched? - I believe he said, you may search me if you will.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent; I said gentlemen search me; I leave the rest to my counsel; I am in the warehouse sometimes two or three hours.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bishop. I gave him the lanthorn into the gateway, and I told him to go into the office and clean it; that accounts for some part of the time.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eleven witnesses who all gave him a very good character.</p>

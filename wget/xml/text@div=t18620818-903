               <p>he lived—I went to the prisoner's address, and searched the house—it is a four roomed house with a small kitchen at the back—it is a private house—there was no symptom of a jewellery business there—on searching a bedroom, in a waistcoast pocket I found this gold swivel—it looks like one on one of the chains—it was hanging across the bedstead—while I was at the police station Mr. Josephs gave me two watch-cases—the prisoner said he had been in the habit of meeting Myers at different sales—on 22d July I got these ten chains from Mr. Josephs; and on that day, from some information I received, I went to 5, Lamb's Conduit-street, to a watchmaker of the name of Reiss—I there found five gold brooches, twelve gold charms, two gold watches, and one silver-gilt watch—I know Harrison—I did not see Fredland on the day he was taken into custody—I saw him on the Saturday previous, the 7th—I saw him drive up in a chaise, and go into Harrison's house.</p>

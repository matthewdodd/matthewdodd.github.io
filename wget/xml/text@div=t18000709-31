             sworn. - I lodge at the sign of the Two Chairmen, in Warwick-street, Cockspur-Street: On Sunday morning, after I returned from my work, there were two men asked me to have a glass of liquor; I was rather in liquor, I had been after drinking a little gin and milk, and it took rather an effect upon me; the prisoner was one of those two men; when I had drank it, I called for a quartern more, that I should not be under any compliments to them, as they were strangers; I was in the box facing them, waiting for my breakfast; I was going up to Air-street to wait upon a gentleman; the other man said he would give me some more liquor in the Haymarket, and when I had had my breakfast, they took me to a house in the Haymarket, the Cock, where I never was before; they called for liquor, and treated me with it, I drank with them.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time you were very drunk, I suppose? - A. Very much so; then I went to <placeName id="t18000709-31-crimeloc160">James-Street, Golden-Square</placeName>

               <p>Q. How do you know that the prisoner was with you? - A. As I have been told; while I was in at the Two Chairmen, I had a silver watch, with a ribbon and key; I did not miss it till next morning, I had been taken home and put to bed; I have never seen it since.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DELIGHT sworn. - I am a constable of the parish of St. James's: I met with the prisoner and Mr. Wall, on Sunday last, about twelve o'clock at noon, at the corner of Golden-Square; I had occasion to go into a public-house; they were both intoxicated very much, and wanted more liquor, but the landlord would not draw any more; they both fell together into the middle of the street, the prosecutor was undermost, with his face to the stones, and the prisoner upon him; the prosecutor cut his nose very much; I got a bason and water to wash his face; I asked the prisoner for a pocket-handkerchief to wipe his friend's face, and he pulled out this watch-string, it fell at my feet, which I took hold of; he said it was his, and took it out of my hand, and put it into his pocket; as soon as the prosecutor came to, almost the first words he said were, somebody has robbed me of my watch; I then looked round, and missed the prisoner; I said to the prosecutor, where is your friend gone; he made answer, he had no friend; I then went in pursuit of the prisoner, and overtook him the other side of Golden-Square; says I, are not you the person who was with the young man in liquor just now; he said no, he had been with nobody; says I, how can you tell me such a lie, there is the mud upon your coat now where you have been tumbling in the kennel; he refused to go back with me; however, after some words, I brought him back, and the watch was found in his pocket. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Wall. This is my watch, and this ribbon, and this key, are mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I come here defenceless, without Counsel. I was in company with the prosecutor, and we were drinking till near twelve o'clock, till we were very much intoxicated; he could not keep his breeches buttoned, his watch was in great danger several times, and I told him of it; we went to another house, but I cannot tell where, for I was as intoxicated as himself; the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180007090023"></xptr>watch fell out of his pocket into the kennel; I was going to get a coach to take him home. I hope your Lordship will have mercy on me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18000709-31-verdict161" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a commission agent, and live in Great Prescott-street, Goodman's Fields. I have several times seen a person passing by the name of Captain Isitt—the first time was about eight or nine months ago—I met the prisoner at the Auction Mart, and he called him Captain Isitt several times in my presence—I think it was in August—the prisoner had a bill of exchange in his hand, which he desired me to read to him—I was aware that the prisoner could not read at all—I read the bill—I think I should know it if I saw it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the bill</hi>)—this is the very same bill</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184105100059"></xptr>
               <p>—I have seen him several times since that, hot not to speak to him—he was no acquaintance of mine—the prisoner was.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Where did the prisoner live? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. 31, Lower Berner-street, Commercial-road—he is a general dealer, I believe—he deals in cigars and other goods—I very seldom visited at his house—I visited him as a friend—he had no shop—he kept the cigars in his own house—I have seen goods in his house—I did not inquire about them—Captain Isitt is rather a mildding aged man, about fifty-five, and stoutish—I have been in Court while Hertop was examined—I do not think the prisoner can read English, French, or German—if he can read Hebrew I do not know it—I never saw him write—the name "P. Fama" on this bill, is good writing—I do not know where Captain Isitt lived.</p>

                  </hi>. I occasionally act as interpreter for this Court, and am a translator of foreign languages. I have known the prisoner upwards of fifteen years—I am here quite by accident—I never heard any thing against him—I particularly noticed him as being a good husband and a kind father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PHILLIPS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many residences did he lire in in fifteen years? <hi rend="italic">A. I</hi> never visited him, and do not know his address—he used to come to me, being an interpreter of languages, when he had commercial transactions—I knew him living at the Cross Keys, Fenchurch-street, four-teen years ago—he had property there to the amount of about 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know he is not able to read—when I knew him first be could not sign his name—I have seen him attempt to sign his name—So the best of my know<lb></lb>ledge, I believe the endorsement to this bill is his writing—the difference between that and the signature of the drawer, is as material as between night and day—he is not able to write so well as the signature of the drawer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> If my case is adjourned till next sessions, I can prove who Mr. Isitt is, by the person who introduced me to him—I gave him credit for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when the policeman came to inquire for me, I heard his voice and came down—Isitt gave me this bill as a collateral security—I cannot write—I declare myself innocent—those old bills do not belong to me, but to Mr. Salomon, who was in Whitecross-Street.</p>

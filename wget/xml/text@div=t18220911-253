On 31st July, 1821, a boy brought an application for some spoons and forks. I selected them - there were twelve table forks, and twelve spoons - they were sent by Gilbert. I saw the prisoner six or seven weeks ago in Bond-street. I followed him; he came up to me, and said he had seen one of the Messrs. Garrards, and had told him his situation, and was about to make an arrangement for the return of the spoons and forks which he had borrowed. without any loss to them. He lived in St. James's-street when they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182209110112"></xptr>were sent. I called at the shop three months after, and it was shut up.</p>

            . I am porter to the prosecutors. On the 31st of July I carried the spoons and forks, and delivered them to the prisoner at his house in St. James's-street. Just as I was leaving my master's door, I met the prisoner; he asked if I had got twelve spoons and forks, and if I would deliver them to him. I said I was going his way, and would deliver them at his house; he then turned round and went with me, and I delivered them to him at his shop. I there saw the boy who came to our house to enquire for them. I went to the prisoner a day or two after for them - he said they were locked up and he could not get at them, but he would send them - he did not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you say he had no others delivered to him - A. I cannot say - I know of no others.</p>

            . I am shopman to the prosecutors. The prisoner borrowed these spoons on the 31st of July; they were never returned; they were only lent to him; we never sold him any. I saw him five or six months after - he had absconded. I saw him in a shop in Pall Mall. He endeavoured to avoid me. He went to the back part of the shop; but when I went in, he came forwards. I asked him what he had done with the spoons and forks. He said,</p>
               <p>"On my word, I do not know; I suppose you know I am done up;" that he was very sorry for what he had done, but he was so much distressed, and had several bills falling due at the time, and a drowning man would catch at any twig - that they were in pawn, and if the prosecutor would redeem them, he would give his bills for six, nine, or twelve months for them. I asked what his bills were worth. He said he hoped his friends would come forward; that he had several things in pawn, but he did not know when ours were pawned - (looks at some duplicates) - these are the duplicates; the name of Church was on them. I asked where he was to be found; he said,</p>

               <p>"On my word, I don't know, he is a scamping sort of a fellow, and used to do these jobs for me;" he at last said, some of them were at Mr. Archbut's, Blackfriars-road; they are worth 15 l. or 20 l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say they were lent? - A. Yes, he was to send them to a customer of his who had not a sufficient quantity. We had found them in pawn and redeemed them. I had heard him ask for them a week previous for the same purpose - he was then refused.</p>
               <p>- ARCHIBALD. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Bridge-street, Lambeth. Twelve forks and twelve spoons were pawned with me on the 31st of July, 1821, in the name of Church. I did not take them in.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a stone mason—on 4th August, I was at work at the new church Queen's Road, Kingston Hill—the prisoner was foreman of those works—on that morning he and the prisoner came on the scaffold<lb></lb>ing; I was about 16 or 20 yards from them—Fisher called out at the height of his voice for Morris to come up to the scaffolding—Morris said to me "There is something up I suppose "—he went up on the scaffold—as soon as he got on to the top of the scaffold I heard Fisher commence swearing at him about a stone that he had worked wrong, it was abusive language, he was very angry, indeed, he let his temper get the mastery of him—Morris said "It is no use making a row about it, it can be very soon altered"—he then said "What shall I do "—Fisher said "Go up and take up what job you like, I will have no more to do with you"—Morris then went down the ladder, he had two moulds in his hand—he went down the ladder and Fisher followed him down; I believe both were on the ladder at the same time—when they got about 3 or 4 yards from the foot of the ladder Fisher seemed to me to make a rush at him, and try to snatch the moulds with one hand and to take hold of Morris by the neck or shoulder with the other, and at the moment they both fell; there was a pail stand<lb></lb>ing in the way and Morris fell on to the top of the pail, and Fisher on the top of him—he cried out very loud "Oh, dear oh," with pain; apparently</p>

               <p>he could not get up—Fisher scrambled up as quickly as possible, almost as soon as he was down—a man from the other shop ran to Morris' assistance and picked him up, the moulds fell on the ground, someone picked them up, they were zinc moulds for the shape of the stone that Morris had been working; they were the property of the builders of the church, Messrs. Todd &amp; Saunders—I did not hear Morris refuse to give them up, but as Fisher was trying to get them he seemed to be holding them away from him; ho would have given them to him, only Fisher was so high in temper at the time; he would have been bound to give them up on Fisher's word being as he was foreman, and they were his masters' property.</p>

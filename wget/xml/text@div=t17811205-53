Upon being asked why she did not bring it to the bar, she said she kept it till it was owned; the cloak that came out of the box was delivered to Mr. Payne immediately.</p>

               <p>I was sent for to Mr. Smith's about nine o'clock the 12th of last month, when I came into the tavern, I desired to see the girl they suspected, she was called down stairs, and I took her into a room by herself, and would have persuaded her to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178112050081"></xptr> open and candid, and I intended to have begged her off, she being a country girl; but she denied to the uttermost knowing any thing at all about the cloak, I desired her box might be brought down, it was; I desired her to open it, she did, and took all the things out of the box herself, she said she had found the cloak in the passage, I have had the cloak ever since.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Smith. Is there any particular mark by which you know it? - Yes; it is worn in the neck.</p>

I took it up stairs for farther inquiration, and nobody ever enquired after it, she said it might be enquired after in time, but nobody ever did enquire after it.</p>

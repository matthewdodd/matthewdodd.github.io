                  </hi>. I live in High-street, in the parish of St. James, Clerk<lb></lb>enwell—it is my dwelling-house. On Saturday night, the 15th of Oct., I went to bed about one o'clock—I was the last person up—the premises were all safe—I saw that the back parlour window was shut in the ordinary way—about twenty minutes after one I heard a noise below, but did not go down at first, thinking it might be the cat—I heard it frequently—I slept on the second floor—I ultimately came down about an hour after I had gone to bed—I came into the passage—I could then see into the shop—I saw a light there—I had left no light there—I saw the two prisoners in the shop—Caylor had a candle in his hand, and Harvey was standing at his side by the window, at a glass case, which was open, and which contained watches, rings, and plate—they had their backs to me, and did not see me—I walked into the shop, went up to them, and said, "Hallo, thieves!"—upon that they turned round, and I saw them both very distinctly—the light almost immediately went out—I was on the side of the counter on which customers stand—Harvey was on the other side, and he ran on the opposite side to where I was, made his way into the parlour, which is on the same floor, and was gone—he did nothing to me—Caylor was going in the same direction, but on the side of the counter on which I was—I put ray arms out and stopped him—he caught hold of ray throat with his hands, and said, "D—n you, let me go, or I will knock your b—y life out"—I only had on my stockings, trowsers, and slippers—I held him as well as I could, but he threw me down—I still held him, and we rolled over—we both got up again—I was obliged to let go of him while I got up, but as soon as I got up I was on him again—we again struggled, and I was again thrown down—he kicked my leg, and bit mo just under my ear—I bled very much, more from the throat, from his nails, than any when else, and I was very much bruised and cut about the face—we struggled for a long time—at last he succeeded in getting to the baek parlour window, which was open—he threw me down, and, while I was getting up, he was getting out of the win<lb></lb>window—as he was on his hands and knees doing so, I caught hold of his leg, which caused him to fall back—he seemed to support himself somehow with his legs across the window-cill, and I, being very much exhausted from the severe bruises I had had previously, could not hold him well with both legs, so I held him by one, and with the other he kicked me in the face, chest, and about the head, a good many times, till at last I fell on the parlour carpet, and he fell on the stones in the yard—as soon as I could recover, I jumped out, pursued him, and got hold of him again in the yard—we then struggled again, and he threw me two or three times—he ultimately got on the dust-hole, which is about three feet and a half high, and has a tree by the side of it—I caught hold of him by one leg, and with the other he kicked me, about the head and body till I fell—his legs wen then released from my grasp—he got upon the wash-house, and then on the kitchen—at that moment a policeman came, and shortly after he was taken—there is a water-butt in the next yard—both the prisoners had hats on when I came into the shop—a piece of candle, and some lucifer-matches were afterwards found in the shop—I saw</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's servant. On the night of the 15th of Oct. I shut the back-parlour window, and put the shutters to—I am not certain whether I fastened the window or not, but I shut it down—mistress awoke me in the night—in consequence of what I heard, I went to the back window up stairs—I saw Caylor on the dust-bin, and saw him kick my mas<lb></lb>ter with his foot—I afterwards saw him get away—I heard a splash after he disappeared—the same morning, when it was light, I saw that some of the wood-work of the window had been removed—that was not so when I had shut it.</p>

In consequence of hearing a rattle spring I went to Mr. Knapp's house—I went in at the shop door, and saw Mr. Knapp standing in the back yard, bleeding—I went through the window to him in the yard—I saw Caylor on the roof of a low out-house—he turned and looked at me, and I saw his face—he had no hat on—he then appeared to go over on the other side, as if going into the adjoining yard—I momentarily left the yard, ran round with another constable, and had the place surrounded—I then went up to the roof, and found Caylor in the cus<lb></lb>tody of Window.</p>

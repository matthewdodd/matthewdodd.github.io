I leave my house always at eight o'clock in the morning. I do not know the day of the robbery. I missed eight or nine half-guineas and some seven-shilling pieces, which I kept in a drawer by my bed-side; I had not seen them safe for a fortnight or three weeks before; I saw some of them at Uxbridge, soon after the prisoner had been at work near my house. I lost the money at different times.</p>

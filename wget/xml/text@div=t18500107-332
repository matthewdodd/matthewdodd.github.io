                  </hi>. I reside at No. 1, Alfred-terrace, King's-road, Chelsea, and am a grocer and tea-dealer. The prisoner had been in my service about sixteen months—in consequence of missing several articles, I went up to her room, about 10th or 11th Dec.—my wife was with me, and Mrs. Culver, the pri<lb></lb>soner's aunt, was there, and the prisoner—I opened three of the prisoner's boxes, in her presence—I found in one of them seventeen empty jars, which had had in them various jellies, jams, and marmalade, and four empty wine-bottles, two of port wine and two of British wine—the pots and jars were mine; I can swear to them—I noticed two pots of red currant jelly which I had missed, one of them particularly; they were empty, among the jars in the prisoner's box—I had had six dozen of port in, about six months before—I had used a little, perhaps one dozen and three; I think not more; and there were but sixteen bottles remaining in the cellar; the rest I cannot account for—the prisoner could have access to the cellar where it was, but her duty did not take her there—the cellar door was closed, but not locked—the</p>

               <p>two port-wine bottles were similar to the six dozen that I had—the two British-wine bottles had had elder wine in them—I can swear to them by the labels, to one in particular—the prisoner had no right to have jars of that description in her box—they were for sale in the shop—I also found in her box a small quantity of Spanish liquorice, some sugarplums, acidulated drops, some muscatel raisins and almonds, some candles, and other things—I have missed from my stock, from time to time, six dozen pots of jam—I found some empty pots in my kitchen—they were from my stock—I know they had been taken when they had fruit in them, because nothing of the kind was used by ourselves—I know the pots, they were labelled with a particular label that I knew—I charged the prisoner with the theft—I had said nothing about its being better for her to confess—I charged her with these things, and asked how she got them—she said, by means of the kitchen door, through the trap-door into the shop—I said it was impossible, she could not do it—I said so, because the trap-door was too heavy for her to lift, and the kitchen door was locked—(there is a way from the passage which leads from the kitchen into a warehouse under the shop, from which there is a trap-door into the shop)—she then said she got access to the shop by means of a key, which she produced; this is it, it will open the shop door leading from the parlour; I have tried it—I then went on to say, "You have robbed my cash-box"—she said she had once—I said, "More than once."</p>

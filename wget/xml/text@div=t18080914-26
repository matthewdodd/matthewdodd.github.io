            . I am watchhouse keeper of St. Giles's. When the prisoner was brought into the watch-house, I received from the last witness four guineas and a half, a seven shilling piece, four shillings, and two sixpences and some copper; they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prosecusor. All I can say, the guineas were all old guineas, and these are old guineas.</p>

               <p>Q. to Lane. Was the money in the purse when you found it - A. Yes, in her shoe; only the silver was loose in her pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer, of 3, Holles-street, Spring-place, Wandsworth-road—I know the prisoner—I was at the Surrey Arms beer-house on Saturday night, 26th January last—the prisoner and I were tossing for a pot of beer, and the penny came against his feet and he kicked it over—I paid for the pot of beer—I left the public-house that night—in cones<lb></lb>quence of something I was told, I went there again, on the following day, Sunday, at a quarter before 3 o'clock—I saw the prisoner there—I went to him and asked him what he had been talking about me, and if he had any<lb></lb>thing to say to say it before my face, and not to go backbiting me—he said, "I have nothing particular to say but what I have said, I can soon settle that"—I said, Well, that is what I want"—I was stripped at the time, and I went home and put my jacket on, and I then returned—he stood in the street—I went to him and said, "Now, how are you going to settle it?"—he said, "You b----, I will settle you," and then he rushed at me—I pushed him back with my left hand, and he struck me with his left hand, and then drew his right hand from his side in this way; he threw it round me and drove it right into my back, and said, "Take that, you b----"—we both fell together, and a young man, named Burgess, who was by, laid hold of him, and took an open knife out of his hand—the prisoner gave him a violent blow on the cheek—I put my hand to my side, and found that I had a handful of blood—after the prisoner had struck Burgess, I turned round and said, "You vagabond," and struck him a blow, and, I believe, I struck him a second time; I knocked him down—I was obliged to have Mr. Jones, a doctor, to the wound, and to keep my bed eight days—I could not get out—I was not able to do any work for eight weeks—I afterwards went to the hospital—I have recovered now, and am able to go to work.</p>

               <p>he did not say, "I won't; I aim not able"—I did not then put my head right into his face; I never touched him—I laid hold of him by the shoulder and turned him round, and said, "Come, now, what have you got to say?"—I did not offer to go down on my knees and fight him—I went home to put my jacket on I did not say I would put a heavier pair of boots on—I did put another pair on; these that I have got on, because I had got an old pair of slippers on with all the bottoms out of them—he followed me out of the public-house and stood in the street—I went home to put my jacket on—I do not know that I went for the purpose of putting my boots on as well—I did not think about it—I went home to put on my boots—I did go home to put my boots on and my jacket—after I had put my boots on I went to the corner—I did not go on purpose after him—I knew which way he had gone—I could see him; it was not ten yards from where I left him—I did not run after him—I did not hit him Or knock him down till after I was stabbed—I mean to swear that—I did not do anything before I was stabbed—I did not hear him say, "If you don't leave me alone I must defend myself the best way I can," or anything of the sort—I never saw the knife before—I have seen it since—I did not see it in his hand when I came after him to the corner—I cannot swear that he had not the knife in his hand—I did not, at the Surrey Arms, thrust my head into the prisoner's face, or strike him in the face with my open hand, or challenge him to fight—he did not say, I can't; I am not able to"—I did not say, "If you can't, I will make you"—I did not go down on my knees and double my fist at him.</p>

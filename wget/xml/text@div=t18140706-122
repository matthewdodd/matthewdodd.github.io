I lost his watch on the 22nd or 23rd of May, it hung over the mantle piece. The prisoner and another boy were in company together, about five minutes after five in the afternoon; they asked me if I had any cooper's work to do; one of them stood by the window, and the other a little distance off. I went up stairs, and when I came down again, the watch was gone.</p>

            . On the 23d of May, the prisoner and another boy came and asked me if I had any coopers work that I wanted to be done; I said, no. I saw the other boy come from Mrs. Bishops house; he went across the street to the prisoner, and said something to the prisoner. They went off together. Soon after, Mrs. Bishop said she had lost her watch while she was up stairs I said, the cooper's boy must have taken it. I know the prisoner: he mended a pail for me. I never saw the other boy before.</p>

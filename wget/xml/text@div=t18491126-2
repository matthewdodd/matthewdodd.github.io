                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Barker, of Lower Thames-street. Jones was occasionally employed under me as a labourer—the painter's shop is a short distance from the warehouse—on 22d Sept. I found the carpenter's shop was open—I missed the key of the painter's shop—I went to the painter's shop, and missed a cask of white lead which weighed 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4 cwt., and another cask containing a small portion of white lead; they bad been safe on the evening before—in two or three hours afterwards I missed the screws of the ventilators of the windows on the wharf—these are the de<lb></lb>scription</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184911260012"></xptr>
               <p>of screws I missed—they are the property of Mr. Joseph Barber—I believe this to be the cask which contained the white lead—it had a head to it when it was in the shop—the marks on this head correspond with the delivery-order—I have not the least doubt but this is the head of one of the casks—I have the delivery-order, which came about a fortnight before the lead was stolen—I bad observed that the screws were safe about the middle of the day on Friday—Jones had been at work on the Friday, at the warehouse; I expected him to come to work on the Saturday, but he did not.</p>

On Saturday, 22d Sept., I went to Jones's lodgings—I found a waistcoat with marks of white lead on it; I found marks of white lead on the street-door and on the banisters, they appeared to have been made by the hand in running up and down stairs—I went to his house between ten and eleven o'clock; he was not at home—I apprehended him about six that evening, in Aldgate—when he saw me he ran away—when I told him what he was charged with, he made no reply—I went the same evening to Vandenberg's shop, in Rosemary-lane—he was in the shop—he asked me what I wanted—I said, "I want you for one thing, and I want that white lead beside, that has been brought in here"—he said, "What white lead do you mean?"—I said, "You know all about it: I mean that white lead brought here this morning or last night, one of the two"—he said, "O! here it is," taking a piece of wood off the top of it—it was standing behind the weighing-machine in the shop—it was in this cask—you could not see where it was without its being pointed out—there was some old bag<lb></lb>ging or matting placed up in front of it—Vandenberg said he had been looking after Sergeant Kelly—he said he had been to the station-house for him, and been inquiring in the neighbourhood for him—he said he had been all day looking for the police—I know the neighbourhood of Rosemary-lane; there are policemen on the beat there—I saw one or two policemen in the course of the day—Vandenberg asked if I was going to take him as a witness; and he said, two or three times, "Can't you take me as a witness?"—I said, "No, I take you as a receiver"—I took him to Leman-street station—there was a large piece of wood on the cask when he showed it to me—this head of the cask came from the painter's shop at the prosecutors—when Vandenberg was at the station he said he gave a man (6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, but he did not mean to buy it—I left him in the station, and I went back to his house with Foay and made a further search—we found three or four putty-knives, some bell-pulls, and new brass articles; and thirteen screws were found by Foay, under the counter—a party named Lloyd owned some of the articles.</p>
               <p>

On that evening I went with Hyde to Vandenberg's shop in Rosemary-lane—I found these thirteen screws in a small canvas bag under the counter—the bag was under a great many things, such as metal, iron, and copper—I had to remove them before I could get the bag—I know Rosemary-lane well—on Saturday, 22d Sept., I was on duty there—I passed Vandenberg's house twice, from ten to twelve o'clock—I was on duty there five hours wearing my uniform—I have been doing duty in that part thirteen years—I said to Vandenberg at the station, "How do you account for these screws?"—he said, "The man brought them who brought the lead."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a cigar-maker, and live in Bell-lane, Spitai<lb></lb>fields. I have known Vandenberg for eight years—he is a foreigner, and a countryman of mine—he has borne a very good character—I was with him on 22d Sept.; I went to his house and saw him between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; he said, "Will you be so kind as to go with me to Holborn?"—I went with him, and was in his company from ten o'clock till two—we went back to his house between two and three o'clock—as we were going along we met Mr. Asher—I did not speak to him—I stood at a little distance—Vanden<lb></lb>berg said it was a friend of his, and he would go and speak to him—he having spoken to him, we went on—when we got back to Vandenberg's house there was no one there, but after some time the prisoner Jones came in—he said "Have you seen that white lead that stands there?"—Vandenberg said," "No""—Jones said, "There it stands," and he showed it</p>

On last Wednesday morning, I was in Wapping, near the Dundee Arms, I cannot tell the name of the street where it is, between seven and eight at night, on last Wednesday, I asked the Captain leave to go to Mr. Abbott, of Clement's inn; I went there, and got my prize money; on my return to Wapping, I bought a suit of clothes of a jew; on my coming out of the sale-shop, I saw a friend of mine; he and I went, and had several pots of beer together at a public-house; I had my bundle of new clothes with me; the prisoner came and sat at the same table in the public-house; I put seven pounds out of my pocket-book, out on the table, and a one pound note; I had them in my pocket-book; I said, I was going to Ratcliffe Cross; the prisoner went with me, he said, he would carry my bundle; after that, the prisoner and I went into another public-house, we had some more beer. We came out of the public-house together; the prisoner stepped back, I received a violent blow at the Dundee Arms, I fell directly, then I felt his hand under my jacket, and when I went home I missed my pocketbook; I made an alarm that I was robbed; I went to go into another public-house, they would not let me come in for fear I should say I had been robbed there.</p>
               <p>Q. You were so drunk - A. I was fresh. On the next day I met the prisoner again near St. Catherine's bridge, he turned from me; I ran to him, I asked him where my bundle was, my pocketbook, and money; he said he had my bundle at home; the pocket-book and money he knew nothing of; if I would go home with him I might have my bundle of clothes. I was very intoxicated when I lost my bundle of clothes.</p>

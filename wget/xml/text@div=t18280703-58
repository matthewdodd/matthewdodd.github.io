On the 5th of June, soon after six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came up to me and asked for Wapping Old Stairs - we walked on together, and when we got to the middle of the street, I was holding out my left hand to direct him, down a street opposite, when he made a catch and took my pocket-book; I saw it in his hand, and made a grasp at it; he ran off, and I lost sight of him at the different turnings; he ran about a quarter of a mile; he started from me in Green Bank-street, and ran down Meetinghouse-alley, where I lodge - a man came out of my lodgings and pursued him - he turned into King-street, where he was taken; I did not see him taken; I have never got my pocket-book again; there was 11l. in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you tell the numbers of those notes? A. No: I had them only one day; I got them from Captain Scarlett; I was quite sober - it was in my inside jacket-pocket - it was day light; the prisoner was not taken for two days after; I never saw him before - but am certain he is the person.</p>

            . I am a smith: I know Mirk; I saw him at dinner-time, on the 5th of June; he went out afterwards - I did not see that he had any pocket-book or money; at six o'clock I went to our yard, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went out and saw the prisoner turn the corner of Love-lane; I pursued him to King-street, and saw him sitting down there; I had just glimpsed him as he turned the corner; Mirk and some women and boys were crying Stop thief! when I got to him he was sitting down scratching his head; I passed him and then went back; Mirk came up and said that was the man; he jumped up and ran away; I followed, but could not catch him; on the Saturday evening following, I went with the officer to the public-houses in the neighbourhood; we found him at the door of the White Swan public-house, in Ratcliff-highway, with two or three women; I went to speak to a shop-mate, and asked him to give me something to drink - he said he had no money; the prisoner came up and said, "I will lend you as much;" I then charged him with having stolen this money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What is the prisoner? A. I do not know. I knew him before, but it was rather late and dark - there were gas lights about; I told him I knew him; I dare say he had seen me at different skittle-grounds; I have not a doubt but he saw me the night he stole the money, and knew me; he had a full opportunity of running away on the Saturday night, because I had to go and call the officer, which took me five minutes; he did not attempt to go away.</p>

               <p>How long before had you seen the ring? - About six weeks ago. I had not occasion often to open the place where it was; it was a brilliant diamond ring; one stone in the middle and two on each side. It was a family ring. It was my mother's. Upon an information, I went to Mr. Packer's, a pawnbroker, in Princes-street, there I found my ring.</p>

I asked her whose property it was, and where she had it; she said, she had it of a broker by the Seven Dials, and that she gave half a guinea for it. I said it was worth more, and that he must not have known the value of it. I sent to him and desired him to come directly. He sent word that his wife was ill, and he could not come. I stopped the ring and told her she must call again the next evening, that was the 16th. The next day I took it to Sir

               <p>I live at Hampstead.</p>
               <p>You carried this ring to Mr. Parker to ask the value of it on the Wednesday? - I went with it to ask him whether it was gold or not; I did not want to know the value of it.</p>
               <p>Where did you get the ring? - I went to Knightsbridge to see my father and mother on the Wednesday. As I came back, the prisoner, who is my sister, came a little way with me, and pulled a ring out of her pocket, and said she found it. I said I believed it was of no great value; we would go into some shop and ask the value of it. I went into Mr. Parker's shop to ask the value of it, and he stopped me. She stood on the outside.</p>
               <p>How came you to tell Mr. Parker you had it of another person? - Because it rather frightened me. I did not know what to think of it at first. When he stopped the ring, I came out and said, Molly, where did you get this ring? She said she found it under a chest. I said, why did not you ask somebody the value of it? She said, she did not think it was of much value.</p>
               <p>All the story you told Mr. Parker was invented at the time? - Yes. I was frightened.</p>
               <p>What became of her after she found the ring was stopped? - She went home.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Parker. What is the value of that ring? - About two or three guineas.</p>
               <p>(The ring was deposed to by the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They have valued it at more in the indictment than I think they should. It is a very old-fashioned ring.</p>
               <p>The cabinet was usually kept locked? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was there any appearance of it having been broke open? - None.</p>
               <p>Had you left it open at any time? - I cannot be certain.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I found it. I did not know that it was of any value. I kept it in my pocket several weeks. When my sister came I gave<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178002230063"></xptr>it her to enquire whether it was of any value or not.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I always found her extremely honest in money matters. I left my purse with a guinea and half a crown in it on the table, and she brought it me very honestly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Robert Lewis Gawtrey. We carry on business at No. 3, Loundes-terrace, Knights bridge—the prisoner was in our employ three weeks; on 25th Jan., in consequence of information, I went to a place where our parcels are put for delivery, and found a parcel directed in the prisoner's writing, "Mrs. Williams, 1, Farm-place, Walbam-green;" it was represented in a private character that 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., had been paid—this is the wrapper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>); it would have been delivered in the usual course if I bad not noticed it—I opened it, and found it contained fifteen yards of flannel, worth 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I then went to the books in the prisoner's charge, in which the money is checked, and found no entry either of the money or goods—if he had sold the goods, there ought to have been an entry of it in his book, and the cash paid at the desk—I sent for an officer; the prisoner was called up stairs, and questioned as to what flannel he had cut off, to send to Mrs. Williams—he said, "Fourteen yards"—he was asked the price, and said he could not recollect; he had sold it the night before, to a lady, and received the money in the shop—we have no flannel of which fourteen yards would have been 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he was asked to point out in his book the cash he had received in payment for the parcel—he pointed out the sum of 105. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the day before (<hi rend="italic">producing the book</hi>) and stated that the lady had also had a pair of silk gloves, which she paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for, and took away with her—I then ordered the remainder of the piece of flannel from which this had been cut, to be brought up, and he was asked if that was the flannel he had cut from; he said, "I believe it is"—he was then asked how the price came to be 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., when the real price was 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said be could not understand our private letters, which told the prices—I then referred to the parcel book—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I find a parcel had been sent on 15th Jan., directed to Mrs. Williams, Walham-green, sold by the prisoner, and the price against it was 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—(that is not the same transaction)—I told the prisoner there was no entry in the cash book of that, and he pointed out two sums of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on 15th Jan., which he said was the money be received for the parcel—I told him I should give him into custody; he said he hoped we should pardon him, or forgive him, as it would be the death of his mother, or words to that effect; he was then taken in charge—it is the duty of the shopmen to make entries of all sums they receive above 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they have each two books, which are changed at five o'clock every afternoon, and this book would not have been in the prisoner's possession at the time he says he made this entry—I went to the address on the parcel, and found a Mrs. Humphries, who answers to the name of Williams as well—she is housekeeper to Mr. Williams.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep house for a Mr. Williams, who people think is my son, but he is no relation; they call me Mrs. Williams, thinking I am his mother. About two months ago when the prisoner was not in Mr. Coleman's service, I lent him some money—I also told him when he saw a piece of flannel to suit me, to buy it for me, as he understood it, I was not in a hurry for it; it was to be about twelve or fifteen yards, and I was not particular in the price; and if it came to more, I would pay him for it—I never was in Mr. Coleman's shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I am acting bombardier of the fifth battalion of the Royal Artillery. William Shepherd was sergeant-major of the second battalion of the Royal Artillery—the prisoner was a gunner and driver in the same battalion—on Sunday morning, the 26th of May, I was on the parade in front of the barracks at Woolwich—the second battalion with other troops in the same barracks were being paraded previous to going to church—it was about twenty minutes to ten o'clock—they were not formed, they were all waiting scattered about together—there were between two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183906170263"></xptr>
               <p>and three hundred—I observed the deceased standing in front of the bar<lb></lb>racks on the parade—I also observed the prisoner—I suppose he was about twenty yards from the deceased, when I first noticed him—the de<lb></lb>ceased was then standing with his back towards the prisoner—I saw the prisoner move in advance about four or five paces from the flag stones upon which he had been standing before, that brought him nearer to the de<lb></lb>ceased—I then saw him bring his musket first to the hip, as if to cock it, and then to his shoulder—he took a steady and deliberate aim at the de<lb></lb>ceased and fired—the deceased immediately fell forward on his face, and I do not think he moved afterwards—the prisoner stood for a second as if to see what effect the shot had taken, then turned to his left about, and threw his musket on the ground—I ran up and seized him by the belt and cuff of his coat—Lieutenant Bingham and Sergeant Poison came up, and I think it was Sergeant Poison asked him How he came to commit such a rash act, but the same question was put by several people at the same time—the prisoner answered, "I meant this some time"—I distinctly heard him use that phrase—he appeared quite cool and collected at the time—he was not one of those who were going to church that morning—he was going to mount guard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would he have any authority, according to your regulations, to have his gun loaded with ball that day? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None—the muskets are loaded with hall when the men are stationed on convict guard, but there is no convict guard on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the muskets are loaded for the men on convict guard, are they loaded from the ball cartridges which are regularly given out to the men, or are they supplied with ball cartridges for that particular purpose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are supplied with ball cartridge for that particular purpose—there is merely one charge given for the musket—it is the duty of a man after coming off convict guard to draw the charge—it is drawn before he leaves the guard-room, and delivered over to the sergeant of the guard—the men have two packages given them for their pouches—each package contains five cartridges—I believe the prisoner has been in the battalion twelve months—the deceased had been there many years—I do not know How long.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Lieutenant in the first battalion of the Royal Artillery. I knew the deceased—he was Sergeant-major of the second battalion—he was not under me—on Sunday morning, the 26th May, about half-past ten o'clock, I got up from my breakfast table in my own room on the ground-floor, and looked out of window—I saw the Sergeant-major moving along towards the private parade, where his guard was falling-in—I saw the prisoner with his musket to his shoulder levelled towards the deceased—he was about twenty-five yards from me at the time, and about eight or nine yards from the Sergeant-major—before I could think, I heard the explosion of the musket which was pointed at the Sergeant-major, and I saw the Sergeant-major fall fiat on his face on the ground—his back was towards the prisoner and likewise towards me—when I saw him fall, I had not the least doubt in the world be was a dead man—the prisoner stood still and seemed to poise his musket, to hold it to his shoulder to see if he had perpetrated the act—I rushed from my room and cried out, "Seize that man," and before I got up to him he was secured by two non-commissioned officers—be was standing between Sergeants Poison and Patton when I got up—the moment I arrived I put my hand on his arm and said, "What could induce you to commit such an act?"—he said, "I have meant it some time, or I have thought of it some time"—I cannot be certain which—one or the other I am perfectly sure of—I have been in Court while Patton was examined—the account he has given of the manner in which the ball cartridges are given out for convict service, and the duty of returning them, is perfectly correct—when a man mounts duty during divine service, it is not his duty to have his musket charged at all—he should have nothing in it—there is a difference between ball cartridges and blank car<lb></lb>tridges—ball cartridges are made up in whitey-brown paper, and blank car<lb></lb>tridges in blue paper—it was not his duty to have any cartridge in his musket, but ten in his pouch, made up in packets of five—there is never any convict guard on Sunday—the prisoner never was on convict guard—he was once, as I have heard, warned for it, but was never on it—Her Ma<lb></lb>jesty's birth-day was celebrated on the 23rd of May—the men fired the usual <hi rend="italic">fen-de-joie</hi> on that occasion, which is three rounds of blank cartridges—they are delivered out for that express purpose—no more and no less than three to each individual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you examine the body of the unhappy man who fell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> As soon as I left the prisoner I went towards the deceased, and made way for him to be carried into one of the barrack-rooms—he was laid on his back, and was stone dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The ten cartridges you speak of are ball cartridges? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—according to the regulations every man carries ten rounds in his pouch at all times—that is all they are to carry except when they go out to <hi rend="italic">feu-de-joie</hi>—they are left at home in case of accident—the ten are for them if called suddenly on any duty—I do not know myself when the prisoner had his ten served out to him—they are put back into his pouch, I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am orderly to the second detachment of the Royal Artillery.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The Sergeant-major did not confine him then when he did not appear on extra parade? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, be was a very kind man to the men—the prisoner was first for guard on this morning—I did not find him in company with the Sergeant-major, as if wanting to talk together—I called his name twice, and the men told me he was talking to the Ser<lb></lb>geant—I did not turn round and see him with the Sergeant-major as if wishing to talk together—I saw the Sergeant-major coming away from towards him, but I did not see they had be*n talking together—I did not see them together—I think I said I did before the Coroner, but I corrected that evidence—I was under a mistake then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Recollect now, do you think they seemed as if they wished to talk together, or at least that he wished to talk to the Sergeant-major? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, the Sergeant-major appeared coming from towards him, but I heard something—I was too far off—I had not reported his having missed the second parade then.</p>

On the day before the Sergeant-major was killed I saw the prisoner in his room in the barracks, about ten minutes before seven o'clock in the evening—he was dressed for guard—I asked him if he was going on guard—he said no, he was not, he was going to show himself with the guard—I said, "You have plenty of guards now"—he said, "Yes, but I will not have many more"—I asked him the rea<lb></lb>son of that—he said, "You will see to-morrow"—I asked him what was to-morrow—he said, "Wait, and you will see"—he said, "There is one particular person I wish to see on the parade"—I asked him who that per<lb></lb>son was—he told me I would see to-morrow—he said, "I don't think it is the Sergeant-major's fault that was to parade to-night, for he never in<lb></lb>spects me when I do parade; I think it is the Orderly's doing, and I will serve him out"—I then left the room, and saw no more of him—he said serve him out—I then left the room, and saw no more of him—he said</p>

               <p>he thought the Sergeant-major had got a spite against him—I did not see him on the parade—he said nothing about going on parade that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bombardier in the second battalion of the Royal Artillery. After this occurrence had taken place I went into the room No. 7, and the doctor came in soon after me—I examined the prisoner's poach about eleven o'clock, and found two bundles—one appeared smaller than the other—it appeared to me that one cartridge was gone out of one of the bundles, but I did not open them—I could tell by the feel and ap<lb></lb>pearance—it was tied in a different way to what it usually is—I had not the slightest doubt that one had been taken out—one could not be taken out without my knowing it.</p>

I know the prisoner—I saw him on Saturday afternoon, the day before this happened—he was speaking to me about his extra parade—he had to parade with the night guard, and he told me he would make it all right in the morning—he said nothing else to me that night—he said some time before that the Sergeant-major had a spite against him—I do not recollect bow lately before the Sunday that was.</p>

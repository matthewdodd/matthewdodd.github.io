            . On the 7th of November I had been drinking, and was going home with this coat on my back- I did not miss it till I was told it was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q.Then you do not know how you lost it? A. No; I do not know whether I told the prisoner to pawn it to get some gin - I had not been drinking with her in the Broadway; she came in before I left the house - I do not know whether I went to the Brown Bear, or whether I was in a wine-vaults in King-street; I never went to the prisoner's father - my landlord paid me 9s.; I did see the prisoner's father when he came to my house - I did not say I had spent 9s., and if he would give me that I should be satisfied; I had 5s. in my pocket, and 6s., and what became of it I do not know - I had 12s. at first, and spent about 1s. at the Broadway.</p>
               <p>THOMAS KILLIN. I was in an alley with Swanton, and saw the prisoner on the prosecutor, who was on the ground- it was dark; I do not know what she was doing, but she spoke to him and he gave her no answer - his coat was half off; I saw his shirt sleeves.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner drunk? A. She looked sober - she stood up when she was taken; I heard nothing about pawning the coat.</p>
               <p>ROBERT SWANTON. I was with Killin - I saw the prisoner stooping over the prosecutor, trying to take the coat off; we went to find the officer, and I asked if he saw a woman go by with a coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was she sober? A. Yes.</p>

            . I was on duty in the Coal-yard. I saw the prisoner come out of an alley with this coat - I asked what she had got; she said, "My husband's coat" -I said, "People generally pawn things on Monday morning and take them out on Saturday night;" she said if I would go to where she lived, I should find it was right - I let her go; these two boys came and told me what they had seen - I ran after her, and took her.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met him and three other men in the street - I knew a man the prosecutor lodged with; they gave me some gin in the Broadway - the prosecutor then took me to the Brown Bear, and several other places- he then asked me to pawn his coat for 2s., and said he would redeem it when he got home.</p>

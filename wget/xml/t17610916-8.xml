            . I am servant to Mrs. Mason, on the 14th of August the prisoner at the bar came into our shop, under pretence of buying some goods. As I was shewing her some ribbons, she conveyed a piece containing a dozen yards of green and white figured ribbon, under some paper that lay on the counter. I then suspected she intended to steal it. I opened five or six rolls; she bought a piece, and when she went out of the shop, I followed her, brought her back, and the piece of ribbon was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who found it upon her?</p>

               <p>I was looking after a gentlewoman that lay in, she sent me to let a person know that the child was to be christened the next week, and gave me a guinea to buy some things for her. I went and bought a piece of lawn; then I came to this shop, and bought a piece of figured ribbon, and a piece of plain, and paid for them. I laid my handkerchief on the counter, in order to put my things in. I tied them up, and went out of the shop, and went to another shop to buy a pair of shoes, and the gentleman came and said, he wanted to speak with me. I went over to the shop again, and he said I had got a piece of ribbon. I emptied my pocket, and untied my handkerchief, and found I had put the piece of ribbon in by mistake.</p>

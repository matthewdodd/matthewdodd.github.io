                  </hi>. I am the mother of the deceased Laurinia Elizabeth Elliott—she lived at 13, Milton Grove—she was seventeen years old, and was a domestic servant—her father was William Elliott, a carpenter—she had been in service, but she was living at home on the 11th April—I can't recollect whether she went out on that day, but on Wednesday, 29th April, she complained of a headache—she went out on Thursday afternoon for two or three hours, and she still complained of her headache—she was rather sick on that day—on Friday morning, 1st May, she got up, and at 10 o'clock she laid down partly dressed,—she complained of her headache, and on the same day, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening, she died—I sent for a doctor, but it was too late—she had not complained <hi rend="italic">to me of</hi> anything that had happened to her a fortnight before—she did not complain of her head at any other time except the times I have mentioned—I never knew her to complain of headache before the 29th April, or to be poorly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was a dispute between my daughter and another girl—that was in January, I think—I did not know of her fighting a week or so before her death—it was a month after Christmas she and another young girl slapped one another's faces; they did not have a good sharp fight—the girl insulted my daughter by calling her "gravy eyes."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons—I was called on Friday, 1st May, about 6 o'clock in the evening, to Mrs. Elliott's house—I saw the deceased girl lying dead upon the bed—I think she was nearly dressed—I made a <hi rend="italic">postmortem</hi> examination the next day—externally there were no marks of violence, internally the body was well nourished—there was a little bronchitis in the lungs, to a very alight degree; not much more than a common cold—the chest was healthy—there was no sign of injury in the trunk that would cause death—I ex<lb></lb>amined the head and found a quantity of <hi rend="italic">serum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pus</hi>, or something between <hi rend="italic">serum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> into and under the membranes of the brain on the right hemisphere from front to back, over the whole convexity—death was due to inflammation of the brain, of which those were the indications—those indications were consistent with a blow or fall—they might be con<lb></lb>sistent with disease of the bones of the ear; I am not aware of any other cause—there was no disease of the bones of the ear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She died from inflammation of the brain—that might be caused in various ways, independently of any blow—I do not mean such inflammation of the brain as I saw; it was limited to one side—I only know of that other cause; that is disease of the bones of the ear, which was not present in this case—I speak both from my experience and reading—I have not heard of such inflammation being caused by anything else but a blow—it might or might not be a severe blow—I have known a slight blow on the side of the load produce such appearances as I saw—I never saw such a case resulting from a slap—I should not think a good hard slap on the side of the head with the open hand would produce what I saw—a blow which resulted in death would cause headache after it was given—sometimes it would cause sickness, and sometimes not; that is a symptom that varies—the headache would not necessarily be continuous—a person would be able to go out and attend to their duties, and so on—it is quite possible that the person might not have suffering for three weeks after the</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">blow</hi> was given; it might be a month; from that to three weeks—different <hi rend="italic">cases would</hi> have different symptoms—it is possible) that a blow that <hi rend="italic">would</hi> cause death would remain three weeks in abeyance, as it were, then burst out, and <hi rend="italic">kill the individual</hi> in three days—I don't know of a case of that sort, but I have read of such in the writings of a French surgeon—I don't think I have read it in English writings; I may have done so—it would certainly be more probable that a person who died under those circum<lb></lb>stances would have received the blow much more recently than three weeks—if I was asked, I would not pledge myself to any number of days that the blow was given before death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> It is not inconsistent with a blow given three weeks before—it is not possible that a slap on the face about Christmas would cause it—if there had been a blow or a fall which had the effect of bringing on the inflammation and the death, I should expect to find some external mark of it within a week—I found no signs of a bruiser—that would show that it had not been inflicted so recently—with regard to Trench surgeons, they stand very high indeed.</p>

Catholic Chapel on Highgate Hill—I was on one side of the rood and they were on the other—it was 12 o'clock at night—there are trees there—it is a shady place, and it was dark—I can't say that he hit her each time as hard as he could—they seemed to be hard blows, and each time she went to the ground—I only saw Harriet Miller that once—she was there when the girl was knocked down, and. Richard Jones was there and George Childs—they did not do anything when he knocked her down, to prevent him doing it again—they simply stood there—I walked away after the third blow—I should have gone over, but as there was a female there, I did not think it was necessary—I had been out with my young man and had just left him—we had been for a walk down Highgate—it was 11.50 or 12:10—</p>

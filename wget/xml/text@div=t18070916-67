               <p>Q. When was it. - A. On the 27 of July. From information I and the officer caught him with the goods upon him. They were going abroad. It is the custom to take off one end for the merchant as a sample; he cut off each end.</p>
               <p>Q. What use could be made of the eighth part of a yard. - A. They sell them; it is but of small value, but an immense quantity is of great value; it is an unfortunate circumstance that in all the markets they are publicly sold as remnants to make patchwork.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday the 27th of July Mr. Williams gave me in charge of the prisoner. On searching him I took out twenty one pieces from his coat pocket. Tipper has some, that he found in his lodgings; one of the pieces corresponds with the piece he was working.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never denied to Mr. Williams that I had taken the matter in question; I asked him if he did not allow it, he told me he did not; I then told him if I had known his refusal of it, I should not have took it, for journeymen generally do it. I have been a master, and my partners as well as myself never disanulled the custom; I asked Mr. Williams if he meant to send me to prison, he told me yes; I told him I hoped he would think of my family, a pregnant wife and six children. I had a strong recommendation of character to Mr. Williams; I had been only in his service six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. I am bound to ask you whether it is a custom in the trade for such perquisites. - A. Never since I have been in the trade.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

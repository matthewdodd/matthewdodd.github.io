               <p>Do you act under the authority of the Trinity-house? - Yes; I lost a quantity of junk some time in August, from <placeName id="t17841020-3-crimeloc12">Ratcliff Cross</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17841020-3-crimeloc12" type="placeName" value="Ratcliff Cross"></interp>

               <p>Mr. Silvester, Prisoner's Council. What is Nicholls? - He is a waterman, or pilot.</p>
               <p>He is employed by the Trinity-house? - Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>But he does look after the bomb-boats? - Yes, by his own authority, by an arbitrary power as I understand.</p>
               <p>You have instructions given you by the Trinity-house? - Yes, the articles specify something of them.</p>
               <p>You know the prisoner perfectly well? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When he found this cordage, he took the boat and you too to the Justice.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you present when they were taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. When the Justice had you and the cordage, he said this was taken, by your own confession, from the other side of the water, in Kent? - Yes, I hope no offence in my speaking amiss; the Justice ordered the man to go with me to Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Then you begged for favour? - I begged for none of him; I am a phthisical sort of a man, I could not follow the goods any longer.</p>
               <p>Court. What complaint did he make of you at the Justice's? - He made a complaint as such as this, he brought the goods and me before him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. My Lord, it is not my duty to keep this up any longer.</p>
               <p>Court. There is only one reason for going on, do they mean to prosecute?</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My Lord, this man has been used very ill, I will just ask another question; do you know Well Spring? - I cannot say I do.</p>
               <p>What conversation had you with Nicholls's wife yesterday? - She asked me what terms I would make it up upon; says I, I have nothing to say, do you come along with me to my lawyer, and talk to him about it; I said no more to her.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell her yesterday, that if he would pay your expences and loss of time, and give a note under his hand that he would not molest the bomb-boats, you would make it up? - I said no such thing.</p>
               <p>Have you been about to solicicit subscriptions among the boat-men? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Who pays the expences of this Prosecution? - My friends.</p>
               <p>Did not you apply to Argyle? - Not a word, no, Sir, I deny the words before God and man; before my Maker, that is over my head.</p>
               <p>Describe your friends? - Mr. Slade and Mr. Watts.</p>
               <p>Did not you and Mr. Slade go to Mr. Argyle, to desire him to subscribe to prosecute the prisoner? - My friends subscribed out of their own pocket, I cannot tell what has been subscribed.</p>
               <p>After you was released before the Justice, how soon was it before you indicted this man? - The Friday following, this happened on a Friday.</p>
               <p>Was he ever taken up before the indictment was preferred? - No.</p>
               <p>Was he ever charged with it? - No.</p>

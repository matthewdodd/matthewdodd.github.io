I now keep a public-house at South Walton, in Devonshire, and have come up from there to give evidence—I was foreman, last summer, to Mr. Hibberd—I remember the blinds being put up at Queen's-terrace—Mr. Charles was the first that had any rings or pulleys—the others were fixed with eyelet holes—I remember putting up Mr. Charles's blind—Edward Hibberd, who is Mr. Hibberd's nephew, was with me and two working smiths—I put two pulleys to it, such as these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they were put at the sides, on the face of the house—this is the way they were fastened—the pulley was attached here—I attached these pulleys and ropes to it, when I put it up—this is the blind (produced), and here are the eyelet boles—these are the rings that run on the bars—there was a good deal of iron-work which was not brought here—wheu we fixed the blind, it was drawn up and down to see how it worked—it bagged down in the middle—it did not run up well at all, and Mr. Charles said he did not like the way it was put up, because it did not run very easy—I worked the ropes, and pulled it up and down in his presence—my master and I afterwards suggested putting another pulley in the middle, and I told Mr. Charles that it would work a great deal easier, and prevent the bagging down in the middle—he said that he would not have it done then, he would see, Mr. Ruddock's done first—I put up a blind for Mr. Ruddock with three pulleys, and three ropes—in consequence of a suggestion from my master, I took the pulleys and ropes down from Mr. Charles's blind, as he said he did not like it, and attached them to Mr. Ruddock's blind, which worked, but not so well as it might—it answered better than it did with the two pulleys—before Mr. Charles's blind was taken down and returned to my master, and after I had put up Mr. Ruddock's blind, I offered to Mr. Charles to make his blind like Mr. Ruddock's—I went half a dozen times to offer to put his up like Mr. Ruddock's, and I went at other times besides to put it up, but he said he did not require to have it done until the spring, now, as it had got rather late in the season—I took the steps there at one time, and made an effort to work at it on them, and Mr. Charles offered to knock me off, so I thought it was no use to go any further—these pulleys are worth sixpence or eightpence, and the rope twopence or threepence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you say it was fixed up? Is this the thing you put up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know whether that is the one; it was like that—I believe the hooks are there now—I put this screw under the facia, and the nut on the top—I put them in myself, with the assistance, of the smith—I was not at the County Court—I came up from the country on purpose for this trial—there must be a mark on the house where this screw went in, unless the screw is there now, which T believe it is—I did not take the irons to Ruddock's, as well as the pulleys—I left them there, and believe they are there now—I went into the country in August—I passed Mr. Charles's house yesterday, and I believe I saw the hooks there—there are some of them there, I know—there were three put up to each blind, and two pulleys—the third was to keep up the blind in the centre—the screws were put through here (<hi rend="italic">Referring to the model</hi>)—I cannot tell whether they are there now—the middle of the blind was attached to the third hook, merely to support the rods—I am aware that there are two there now—there were two there, and I believe one has been taken out—I did not take particular notice yesterday, because I came about the blind, and not about the hooks—Mr. Hibberd showed me this hook before I came here yesterday, but there were two there, and if the Jury were to go there, they would see two hooks</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186004020068"></xptr>
               <p>—I did not tell you so when you first asked me, because I was not aware that you meant the hooks—Edward Hibberd, and two working smiths, and my master, saw me test the blind, and draw the pulleys and the cords—I cannot say that I saw Mr. Ruddock at all, though I believe he was there—I believe it was the next day that I spoke to him about the cords to his blinds—the pulleys were put to Mr. Charles's blind when I spoke to Mr. Ruddock—I went into the shop and suggested to him that Mr. Charles's blind did not work according to his wish, and said that I should like to put a third cord—he did not then look at Mr. Charles's blind, he had looked at it; and as it bulged down in the middle, he did not like it—the pulleys were put up in the morning, and the next day they were taken down again, before the blind blew down—that was to try an experiment on Mr. Ruddock's blinds—I think Mr. Edward Hibberd was there when the pulleys were taken down—we afterwards took the ropes down, that had been used in connexion with the pulleys, and carried them into my master's shop—they were no good after the pulleys were taken away—they are at my master's shop now, if they have not been used—I tried the experiment a few days afterwards—I am not aware that Mr. Charles went and saw the experiment tried on Mr. Ruddock's blind; but of course he saw it, because it was up a month or two—I left the defendant about three weeks afterwards, because I had not got my health—I had been with him nearly twelve months—he had much work at the time I left; sufficient for me and a great many others beside—it was during the strike that I went away—I did not go with my master to Mr. Charles's for the money, or by his direction—I had never heard that Mr. Charles came to the shop—he never came to the place when I was there, but after the blind blew down the second time, he said that he would not have it put up again; but two days afterwards, he allowed it to be put up—the blind ordered in June was not Bent till August, because it took a good time to make all these blinds—we had the others to put up as well, and, of course, we could not put them all up at one time—I am not aware that the de<lb></lb>fendant was in difficulties all this time—he never mentioned such a thing to me as the Bankruptcy Court, or the Insplvent Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Whether this is or is not one of the hooks put up, were there three hooks put up in the way you describe? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—if Mr. Charles had chosen to have a third pulley, the middle hook would have done for the cord and pulley if it was only put up—a third pulley could have been put with great ease—I could have put it up in an hour, and put the rings in at once—my master was there when it was done, and saw and heard all that passed—he was also there at the trial of the experiment, and I believe he spoke to Mr. Charles—he saw it bulge, and it was with him that I suggested the middle cord—Mr. Ruddock said that if I could make it answer differently from Mr. Charles's, he would have it done, but if it was to break down in the middle he would not have it done.</p>

I am the defendant's nephew, and am now in the Royal Marines, stationed at Chatham—in August last I was a carpenter in my uncle's employ—I enlisted on 5th or 6th August—I remember the bliud being put up at Mr. Charles's shop—I worked on the other blinds that were put up—I was with the last witness and two smiths when the blind was fitted up—we took pulleys and rope with us, and fixed them upon this son of hook—we fixed the pulleys here, and this rope through them—we tried it—it did not go up as it ought, and there was a great bulginess in the middle—I did not luur Mr. Charles say anything about it—I was gone before the blind was blown down—I remember going with Stone, after it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186004020069"></xptr>
               <p>was blown down, with the blind and pulleys and ropes—I saw Mr. Charles, and he would not allow me to put it up—I remember Mr. Ruddock's blind being put up—we used three pulleys for it, the same as these—we used two of Mr. Charles's and I added a third.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a working smith, and am now in the employ of Mr. Harvey, of Circus-street, Marylebone—in July and August last my master had a job to put up the blinds in Queen's-terrace—I did the iron-work of fifteen of them—I remember putting up Mr. Charles's blind—that was not to be fixed—he altered his plan from the other tradespeople—he said he would have his to work up—I helped to threddle the rails on the stays—Stone was present—Edward Hibberd was not present when we drew the blind up—he was not working at that blind to my knowledge—this is the blind—there were pulleys to it—Mr. Stone fixed them and put them up—they were fixed like this, and with a rope through them—I tried the blind, and hurt my hand by rolling the cord round it and pulling—it bulged down in the middle when it was pulled up, and Mr. Charles said it would not do; it must not work so hard as that—I was present when a suggestion was made about having another brace in the middle—I only had to do with Kuddock's in putting up the ironwork—he said he would have his to pull tip as well—I am quite sure that was in the presence of Mr. Charles—I pulled up his pulleys, and worked his blind—he stood at the shop door at the time—I had a mate, John Land—he is in the hospital—he has a bad toe, and is obliged to have it cut off—our foreman saw him on Sunday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Mr. Harvey's foreman come to see you too? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I saw him every morning—he went to see how the boy was because he employed him—I did not go with my master to one of the workmen and ask him to come up and prove that there were pulleys—I do not know the number where the pulleys were put up at, but it was between Mr. Harrison's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186004020070"></xptr>
               <p>and Mr. Ruddock's—on my oath it was not Harrison's where the pulleys were put up—he said that he would not have pulleys at first—his blind was not put up before Mr. Charles's—after Harrison's blind was put up, the kerb stone came out with the wind, and the blind fell in towards the shop front; which was the cause of Mr. Charles's blind coming down, because they were together—it was not at Harrison's that the pulleys were put up—Mr. Stone and I actually put the hooks in—we assisted each other—I may have put one in—I was not present when they were taken down—Mr. Hibberd employed Harvey because he does not keep smiths on the premises—I never saw Hibberd in my life—I did the work for Mr. Harvey—I believe these things were put up in July; it was after Whitsuntide; it was the latter end of June or the beginniug of July—I will swear it was not in August—I made a good deal of the ironwork, and they wanted me to work on Whit Monday to get on with the blinds—I do not know who made the pulleys—Mr. Hibberd brought them out in his hand—I do not know who Mr. Hibberd deals with for ropes or what has become of the rope which was used there—it was put up to see if it would answer, but the rings tore off, and we were obliged to take the other rings off, and Mr. Charles said that he would not have it—I do not know whether the ropes were taken out—I had nothing to do with that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you give me an idea of the cost price of the ironwork, of the labour, and of the blind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but the ironwork must have cost some pounds—I am sure it was between Whitsuntide and August, and not in August, that Mr. Charles's blind was done.</p>
               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">KEAR</hi>. I acted as attorney for Mr. Hibberd in the County Court—I remember Mr. Hibberd giving his evidence, and the Judge recalling him after the different witnesses were examined—Mr. Adolphus said, "Were ropes and pulleys put to this blind complete?"—Mr. Hibberd said, "Yes, but—;" he was going to add something, but the Judge stopped him from the explanation which he was then about to give—I conducted the case for him when he was before the Magistrate for perjury, and had witnesses ready to call, which I mentioned to Mr. Hammil, who said, "As five witnesses have been called who swear that the ropes and pulleys were not complete, it is not my duty to decide"—I said, "Then it would be wasting the time of the public if I call witnesses."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not the defendant say that the blinds were Completed? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember his saying more than those two words—I do not mean to say that it is untrue that he said that they were completed—I can hardly say that the agreement was before the Court, because I was imperfectly instructed; and Mr. Hibberd had a notion that the agreement was not admissible, for want of a stamp—I was not aware that we were suing on such an agreement—I do not know whether the agreement was before the Court, but I have no doubt it was—I did not take possession of it—I produced it at the police-court—it was handed to me there, but certainly not at the County Court—I can say that the agreement was in the County Court, but I cannot say that it was before the Court—the discussion was not about ropes and pulleys at first, and I do not remember the agreement being put in—the discussion about ropes and pulleys did not occur till the end—I made very rough notes, but have not kept them—I will not undertake to swear that Mr. Hibberd did not say something of this kind, that the blinds were complete at the time he was speaking, and that there were cords and pulleys there; but I will undertake to say, to the best of my belief, that no such words were used by Mr. Hibberd—he did</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186004020071"></xptr>
               <p>not, to my recollection, explain the kind of cords to the Judge—I do not remember his being asked whether they were completed when they were blown down, and saying that the cords and pulleys were up at that time—I destroyed my notes within forty-eight hours, and before these proceedings commenced—I have looked for them.</p>

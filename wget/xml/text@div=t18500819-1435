                  </hi>. I live in St. James's-place, Hampstead-road, with my father who is a wheelwright. On Wednesday evening, 27th June, the pri<lb></lb>soner came and inquired if the governor was at home—I told him he was in the country, but would return on the Friday evening—he said he wanted to know what he would build him a new truck for—I said about six guineas—he said he would come the next morning and hire one, and he came and brought his man with him—he hired a truck for half a day—it was my father's, Richard West's—the prisoner wrote down his name and address—the truck went away, and never came back—we found it in Winchester-street, Penton<lb></lb>ville—I went to the address the prisoner gave, which was No. 23, Drum<lb></lb>mond-street, Euston-square, I could find no such person there—on the day before I went before the Magistrate, I saw the prisoner in Cheapside, in one of Hansom's patent <hi rend="italic">cabs,</hi> and I gave him into custody—I told him I wanted to see him respecting the truck—he said, "Very good, he was just going to see about the truck and send it home."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a greengrocer, and live in Winchester-street, Pentonville. On Thursday, at the latter end of June, the prisoner came to me, and asked if I knew anybody that would buy a truck—I told him I would buy it—I have seen the prisoner about—I am sure he is the man—the truck was afterwards fetched away by a policeman—I saw the same truck at the police-office—I bought it, about two o'clock in the afternoon, for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had it outside my door.</p>

On 25th March I saw the two prisoners standing together about thirty yards from my master's—I saw Dance cross the road, and saw no more of them till my master gave me information, when I went after them, and saw them join company at Loughborough-road—they went straight up the road—I saw a policeman and gave them into custody—I saw Jones come out of my master's house, but I had not seen him go in—that was about two or three minutes after I saw them talking together.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Crown and Anchor, Brixton-road. On 25th March Jones came, asked for half a pint of beer, and tendered me a shilling in payment—I tried it in the detector, bent it, and found it was bad—I laid it on the counter—he picked it up, and said he had no more money about him—he then left the house and turned towards the right—I went out to see if I could see a policeman, Jones was still in sight, and met Dance at the Loughborough-road about forty or fifty yard's from my house, and joined him—they appeared to talk together, and I directed Bush to give them into custody.</p>

I was on duty at Brixton on 25th March, received information, went after the prisoners, took them, and charged them with uttering a counterfeit shilling, and told them I suspected they had bad money—Jones said they had not, they had no money at all—Jones then put his left hand in his left hand trowsers pocket, and I saw and heard six shillings drop from his leg—I picked them up, and while I was stooping Dance ran away and I took him afterwards—I afterwards, examined Jones's pocket, and found a hole towards the top of it large enough for the shillings to have fallen through—I gave the shillings to the sergeant.</p>

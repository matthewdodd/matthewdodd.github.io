On Tuesday, the 18th of August, the prisoner asked me to go with him to his landlord's house, at No. 8, Gower-place, where he said he had a job, to put up some gutters and pipes—I saw him take from my master's ware-house four lengths of pipe, and two lengths of gutter—he took nothing else then—I saw him take the elbow in the morning—I did not see him take any thing else that day—after he had put these pipes and gutters up,</p>

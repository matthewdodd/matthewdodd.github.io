                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Reeve Mihill, a farmer, of Dagenham—Watson was his carter, and went on journeys with the wagon and hones—he should take with him four nose-bags full of chaff,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185102030126"></xptr>
               <p>and corn mixed—the chaff consists of wheat and oat-straw and wheat eavings—he cuts it with a machine, and mixes it with the corn in the nose-bag. On Wednesday evening, 8th Jan., I saw him preparing the food and putting it into the bags—there were generally four bags, and one sack besides—I afterwards saw some chaff produced before the Magistrate; it was the same sort as that cut up on my master's premises—there was no corn with it—he had no business to take it unmixed—the sack was Mr. Mihill's—there was sufficient for the journey of that which was mixed.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 142). On 9th Jan., about four o'clock in the morning, I was on duty at Chadwell, in the parish of Barking, and saw Watson with a wagon and horses—he stopped at the White Hart, which is kept by Saxby—I watched him—he took out a sack and put it on the ground—(I measured it afterwards; it contained ten pecks of chaff)—he took it into the stable—Saxby was standing at the stable-door, and took it of him—I heard him say, "Here is a bait of chaff"—I did not hear Saxby answer—he untied the mouth of it, shook it up in his hand, and, as I walked in, he was in the act of placing it behind the door—I was in my uniform—I asked him what the man had brought in—he said, "Nothing"—I said, "He has brought in this sack and its contents, and I must see what it is"—Saxby said, "It is only a bit of chaff, for my sake don't say anything about it"—I went to Watson; he was just coming out of the door, and I asked him what he had taken in (he had passed me as I was going into the stable)—he said he had not taken anything—I said, "You took it this sack and its contents"—I showed it to him—he said, "It is only a bit of chaff, don't say anything about it; let me go after some dung, and I will call here after some dung as I come back"—I told him I must take him into custody—I looked into the wagon; there was another sack there full of corn and mixture—it was in a large bag—there were four new bags besides; they were full, and a large bag of mixed food for horses; corn was mixed with it—there were nose-bags there also—I showed the chaff in the bag that I saw him take to Saxby, and the chaff and corn in the bags, to Woolmore before the wagon went away—we sent for him to the station.</p>

               <p>Hart—I was standing behind a tree—another officer pasted it—I put my light out, and they could not see me—I am not on duty there in the afternoon or evening—Watson told me, on the way to the station, that it was a little bit of victuals be bad left there in the morning for the horses to have in the evening when they came back—I believe I told the Magistrate that Saxby said, "It is only a little bit of chaff, don't say anything about it"—(<hi rend="italic">the witness's deposition being read did not contain the statement, or that Watson took a handfull into his hands to see if it was chaff</hi>)—I believe I mentioned it—I did not think of mentioning it to the clerk when my deposition was read over—the sack was in the same state before the Magistrate which bad the chaff in it—it was tied round the mouth with a string—it was untied when I went in, and I took it from behind the door and tied it up—the string was lying on one side of it—I should say there were about four bushels in it—when I had taken Watson I came back and fetched Saxby—he went with me willingly—the Magi<lb></lb>strate let him out on his own recognizances—he was afterwards admitted to bail, and has surrendered this morning—I did not go into Saxby's house—I believe his son was present—I know Burchwell by name—he assists Saxby in his business—I do not recollect seeing him there—Saxby has a wife and children—it is a well-conducted house, as far as I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, of Dagenham, and the master of Watson; he had no business to stop at the White Hart to bait—it if only about three miles or three miles and a half from my house—he ought to have gone by the great road, which is much the best—I was not at home at the time, and did not see the mixture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had you given him any particular orders not to stop at the White Hart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, but he had no business to stop so near; they usually stop at Stratford—the men do at times stop three or four miles from home—Watson started at three o'clock in the morning—it would take him something less than an hour to go three miles and a half or four miles—if he stopped to get refreshment, he had no right to bait—I never knew it to be the case for carters to leave a bait at the house at which they stopped in the morning, to give their hones on their return—I have taken up a cart myself, but have never done that, nor stopped so near home—I should not expect a man to bait within three miles of home when he was coming back—there was no corn in this chaff.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Watson,</hi> I have carried chaff to Romford with me when I have had no corn, and the horses have eaten it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He had no right to do so, and he did not do it to my knowledge—he used to go to London three times a week generally—I have found fault with him for not taking the nose-bags—about four bushels of mixed food is quite enough for the journey, besides the four nose-bags.</p>

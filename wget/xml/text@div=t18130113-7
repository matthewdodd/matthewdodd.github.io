I asked her the lady's name. She said, she could not remember the lady's name. I then went to enquire of my mistress, leaving the door open, and when I had got halfway up the passage she called me back again. She asked me to remember the name for her. I told her I could not repeat the name unless she spoke it, perhaps I might know the name if she would tell me. She then hesitated, and said, some name, but what name I cannot say. I then asked her if it was Grace, a relation of my mistress. She said, it was. I then left her to acquaint my fellow servant, that she might tell my mistress. I saw no more of her after that. I acquainted my fellow servant, and went down into the kitchen, leaving the woman outside of the door, with the door open. My fellow servant went up immediately to acquaint my mistress. My mistress was up stairs. About half an hour previous to the woman's coming, I saw the coat hang in the passage; it was a good distance from the door. My master discovered the coat was missing, about ten minutes after the woman was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did you stay with her - A. Only a short while. She had a large basket. I saw nothing in it but two lumps of butter and straw. I told her to come into the passage. I shut the door. I went and told my mistress; she delivered me the butter. I paid her for it, and then let her out. I shut the outer door, and then went down stairs. I saw no more of her. I left her in the passage when I went up stairs to acquaint my mistress about the butter, and when I came down I found her in the passage; then she gave me the butter.</p>

I sent one of my boys for a constable. She staid in the shop: the boy came back, and told me he could not find a constable. In the mean time she went away, and came back in a short time and wanted the coat. I then went out myself and brought in a constable, and gave her in charge. I desired the constable to tell Mr. Stevens I had detained such a coat. He brought me word to bring it up to Bow-street, the next day; which I did. I marked the coat in the office. The magistrate ordered the coat to be given up to Mr. Stevens. I had the coat in my custody until it was given up. This is the mark I put upon it, and then it was delivered up to Mr. Stevens.</p>

            . As I was in the shop, on the 14th of December, at the time the woman was in the passage, I heard a rustling with the straw; at the same time I heard a gentle rapping at the door with the hand. The door was shut. The woman was alone in the passage, no one answered the door. I went and answered the door myself. There was a man standing at the door, I asked him his business. He returned me no answer. He spoke to the woman in the passage. He told her a lady over the way wanted some butter; her answer was that she had not more than would supply that house; she would serve them the next week. He then left the house and I shut the door after him. One of the maids at that time, I believe, was gone up for the money for the butter.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Look at that great coat - A. It is my great coat; it is the same coat that was lost out of my house on the 14th of December.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rossiter. That is the great coat that was brought to me by

               <p>Eleanor the wife of Patrick Hannams Defence. When I went with the butter there was a man at the door; he told me he would be half-a-crown in my way; he gave me a great coat, and told me to leave it at a public-house, the corner of Wild-street. It was a man that had been buying soap or candles in the house, and my selling butter there, Mr. Stevens was positive, he said, I was the person that had taken the coat. I never saw the coat until the man give it me.</p>
               <p>Eleanor the wife of James Hannam's Defence. This woman told me to go to Mrs. Stephens's to ask for a bundle my sister had left there. We are both married to two brothers. Mrs. Stephens gave me the coat. My sister told me to pawn the coat, and to bring her the money; accordingly I went to Mr. Rossiter's. I being known there, I thought I could get more money there than at any other place. Mr. Rossiter had some suspicion of the coat; he stopped it. He told me to go. I thought it was too bad to go back to this woman, she being in custody, without money or coat. I went back to Mr. Rossiter, and he gave charge of me, as I would not go without either money or the coat.</p>

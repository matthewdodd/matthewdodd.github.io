                  </hi>. I live at Sunbury and sell fish. I come up to London three or four times a week—last Monday I was coming up, and had got as far as Putney with four fish in a basket, what we call diamond plaice—I was outside the Fox and Hounds, in the Richmond-road, and went in to have half-a-pint of beer, and left my basket outside—when I came out I noticed the cloth had been removed, and one plaice was gone—the officer came up, and I told him—the prisoner afterwards came with the policeman and my fish—I knew it directly by cleaning it out—when I have fish left I always clean it out for the next day—it is disposed of now, but we have the tail of it left—as I went into the public-house, the pri<lb></lb>soner came out and brushed by me.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable V</hi> 67). I took the prisoner last Monday night in High-street, Putney—he was going down the town with this plaice in a handkerchief—I asked what he had got—he said "Nothing"—I said "You have got a fish?"—he said, "It is all right, I have only been having a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with old <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Johnson"—that is an old fiih-monger who goes about Putney—I took the prisoner and the fish—the prosecutor explained to me how he knew it, he had cleaned it, and cut it in the brown part—this is the tail of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I and two or three others came out; we had played tricks with old <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Johnson, and we said, there is old <hi rend="italic">Billy's</hi> basket, and we will have another <hi rend="italic">lark</hi> with him; they took the fish out, and gave it to me.</p>

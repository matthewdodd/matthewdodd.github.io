On the morning of the 4th of July, 1844, about eight o'clock, Parkinson missed his watch and guard—I directly went to look for the keys of my box, and found they were removed from where I had placed them—I found them in my box—my guard-chain and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. were gone from my box—the prisoner had been in the same employment as myself, and was discharged a fortnight before—he knew where the property was—he was af<lb></lb>terwards apprehended, and the chain and watch and guard were found on him—the</p>

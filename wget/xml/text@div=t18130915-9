               <p>Q. How far from the road - A. I cannot rightly say.</p>
               <p>Q. While Larman was working with you what happened - A. We were looking at some slugs, he happened to get up and he fell. I heard a report of a gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find what had occasioned that fall - A. No, I saw the blood come from his body by the ribs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find a ball - A. No. I found a hole in his ribs, and blood come from that hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look towards the part where you heard the report of a gun - A. I did, up the high road, there I saw two soldiers, they had both a gun, each they were dressed in blue; like the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other persons near the spot from whence the report came except these two - A. No, I did not; I ran away to Whetstone for assistance; I passed them. One of these two men that I passed was the prisoner now at the bar; when they got to Whetstone they were stopped and examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his gun examined - A. Yes, it appeared to have been lately discharged. It was quite we, when you put your finger in the mouth of the gun.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his companions gun appear to be loaded - A. They were all loaded but this one.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You knew nothing of the prisoner before this time - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Nor did he knew Larman - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you in the field - A. Against some paling which my master had lately put up.</p>
               <p>Q. How high was the paling - A. Higher than me a good deal, and higher than Larman.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the soldiers who were in the road on account of Larman stooping see him - A Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the person whoever he was that hred did not you know - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fence between where you stood and the soldiers - A. There were low rails, he shot over two or three rails, we could see those in the road and they could see us. The rails are open rails.</p>

               <p>Q. Did it appear to you to be fired at random or taking aim - A. He was taking aim, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shortly after see the body of the boy who was killed - A. I did; I went down to him as quick as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, in what direction did it appear to you that the soldier's gun was pointed - A. It was pointed to the boy as near as could be.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181309150016"></xptr>Q. It was pointed to that part of the field where the boy was - A. Yes, and when I got to the boy I found him dead. The ball went through one side and out of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the wounds even - A. No, one was higher than the other. It went in one side and came out of the other. I cannot say which side the wound was highest. One side the hole was about two inches higher than the other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say, the pointing of the gun was towards that part of the field where the boy was, and whether it was pointed towards the boy you cannot say - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a paling to that field - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then whether he was shooting at the paling or the boy you cannot say - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. The paling was behind the boy - A. Yes; the soldiers were in the path-way; that is a great way higher than the road, and higher than the field.</p>

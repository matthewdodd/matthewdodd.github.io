            ; the prisoner was in our employ. I was in the shop on the 9th of February, when some lithographic books were purchased by a lady: when she was gone I asked him if she had bought many books - they were to be sent home, but I did not hear distinctly where they were to be sent to; the prisoner said, "They have taken one of Harley's, and one of Diton's," or some such answer, but I could not tell to what amount - I cannot swear positively to what he said; I cannot speak positively as to when the porter was sent with the things - here is the till-book, and here is the entry in the prisoner's hand-writing, "Litho. books, 7s. 6d.;" and I hold a note in my hand in his hand-writing for those very books for 9s. 6d.; this entry was made that evening.</p>
               <p>MR. PAYNE. Q. Have you any means of knowing whether that entry applies to the books the lady had? A. There is no other entry of lithographic books that day; on the 11th of February there is 1s. entered to Miss Bacon, and there is no entry of colours by the prisoner on that day, nor any other entry with Miss Bacon's name; here is an entry of 3s. 6d. on the 12th of February, but no name - I know this alludes to Mrs. Wallduck, because I was in the shop at the time; she bought the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182904090019"></xptr>colours, and I looked into the book to see what the prisoner put down, and it was 3s. 6d. - here is an entry of 1s., but I am not certain whether that was after she had paid or not; the money paid for oil, letters, shavings, &amp;c. has been put down in the book.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is Miss Wynne here? A. No, not to my knowledge; at the expiration of a few years I should have quitted the partnership - I am not aware that the prisoner was likely to become a partner; we highly respected him, and he was likely to get a considerable advance of salary.</p>

            . I went to the prosecutors' shop on the 12th of February, between two and three o'clock; I purchased colours to the amount of 5s. 6d. - I gave a sovereign to the prisoner, who gave me change, taking the 5s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There was, I believe, a customer waiting to be served? A. I did not see any one; the prisoner went to the till, took out the change, put in the sovereign I gave him, and shut it up.</p>
               <p>MRS. ROWNEY. On the mornings after these days. I examined the contents of the till, and found the entries and the money corresponded together.</p>

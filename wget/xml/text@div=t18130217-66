The boxes were brought back again immediately. Her boxes were searched in the presence of

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in either of the boxes that belonged to any part of your brother's family - A. Certainly. There were a great number of shirts, and two fine muslin handkerchiefs, which I recognised to belong to my family, and some tablecloths and dusters, which she confessed to have taken away. After having searched her boxes, I searched the prisoner's drawers, and found two shirts. She told me all these things had been given to her.</p>

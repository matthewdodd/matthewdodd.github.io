               <p>Q. Had you a cloth coat stole from you at any time? - On Monday the 4th of August I had it stole; I did not see the prisoner take it, I saw it just opposite a broker's shop, put up to be sold on Monday morning the 5th.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you when you last saw it before it was stole? - Sunday about twelve o'clock, I missed it from my own room, in the <placeName id="t17930911-57-crimeloc307">King's Head, James's-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. How soon did you see it after you missed it? - Monday about eight o'clock at Mr. Lawrence's shop door.</p>
               <p>- LAWRENCE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a taylor, in Petty France, it is called York-street now. On Sunday evening about seven o'clock the 4th of August, my wife had a very bad state of health, and was very ill that day particularly, about seven o'clock she wished to be at the door for the sake of a little air, and this man came in, and he said to me, would I purchase this black coat? I I told him it was a thing I did not wish to have any thing to do with buying of a Sunday; so I asked him what he asked for it? he said he was a recruit, and rather being short of money he asked four shillings and six-pence or five shillings I cannot be certain which; I told him the most I could give him was three shillings as it was pieced under both the arms. I hung it out on Monday morning between six and seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Court. You see there is nothing thrives that is bought of a Sunday? - Soon after it was hung out, there was a jew that came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179309110096"></xptr>in, and asked me what I would let him have that black coat for? and after that the prosecutor came to the door and found the coat; by eight o'clock in the morning the constable came with him; I delivered it immediately. The old man that says he owns the coat, has had it ever since, by the magistrate's order, in his care; I never saw it since.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at that man, was he in a soldier's dress? - The same; he is the man, I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you pick him out? - I went to the Bird Cage-walk on Monday in the afternoon, about the middle of the day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he with you altogether? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you recollect him by, his voice, figure, or what? - He has got an amazing sight of warts on one hand, which I took particular notice of, and I gave the same description before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you pick him out of? - I cannot say how many there might be particular, there might be more than twenty exercising at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you when you picked him out? - I did not pick him out while he was exercising, I waited till they were done. This <rs id="t17930911-57-deflabel308" type="occupation">soldier</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you know him to be the man before you saw the prosecutor? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the coat again? - I should by the piecing under the arm; but at the same time I have seen it so triffling a time.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the constable here? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very sure that the coat you gave to the old man, was the coat you received from the prisoner? - It was the same coat; I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Court to Elliott. Produce the coat.</p>
               <p>Lawrence. I know it by the piecing under the arms.</p>
               <p>Elliott. I know it by the same, and by a remarkable seam on the top of the sleeve.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the coat, nor know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called his serjeant to his character.</p>

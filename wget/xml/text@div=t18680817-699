                  </hi>. I reside at 11, Artillery Passage, and carry on the business of an eating-house keeper—the deceased, Emma Grossmith, was my wife—she was forty-five years of age—the prisoner was in my service for about five months, to do anything that would be required to be done in the kitchen—we used to call him John; my wife called him John—his proper name is Alexander Arthur Mackay—we had no other servant at this time—on Friday, 8th May, I left home at 9.10 in the morning—I left no one at home but Mrs. Grossmith and the prisoner—he was cleaning the shop window when I went out—my son had gone on an errand, I believe, and came home after I went out—I did not notice that he was at home when I left—on the Wednesday before this there was a conversation be<lb></lb>tween the prisoner and me about some potatoes that he spoiled—my wife found it out first—he used to hide the potatoes, and spoil the rest—I can't say whether my wife said anything to him about it in my presence—I spoke to him about it; I could not say on what day it was—I don't remember my wife saying anything to him about it—on the morning of the 8th he threatened the children; Mrs. Grossmith came and told me so; I did not hear him—I was absent forty minutes that morning—it was 9.50 when I came in—I found Mr. Lubbock, Dr. Jackson, and Mrs. Sandiford in the house, attend<lb></lb>ing upon my wife—they would not allow me to see her then—I saw her about an hour afterwards—she had then been put to bed—I could not describe the state in which she was, it was so fearful—I could not recognize her at all, not a feature—three days afterwards, I think on the Monday, she made a statement to me—she was very sensible then—she died on the 17th; that would be the following Sunday—she told me at the time that she should never get over it—she first asked me what I thought of her—I said, "I think it is dreadful"—she said, "Do you think I shall ever get better?"—I said, "I hope so," and she said, "I never shall"—I made no answer to that—she said almost directly after, "I shall die, I shall die, the pain is so great;" and also a hundred times, I should think, during the time she lived—her words on the Monday were, "I shall die through the pain at the back of my head."</p>

I am eleven years of age—I live at 11, Artillery Place—I was there on the Friday morning—the prisoner threatened to strike me that morning, because I asked him to get me some water—mother liked him why he would not get it me—I did not hear what he said—I heard him say if mother did not mind she would get into the wrong box, and get something for her trouble—I think those were the words—I think that was somewhere near 8 o'clock—mother gave him a pudding-cloth to wash, and he never washed it clean, and she asked him to do it again—I don't know what he said, or whether he did—I usually go to school of a morning—on this morning I did not go straight off to school—I think it was about 9.30 when I started to go—my father was out then—I left my mother and the prisoner in the house—I did not go above two doors off—while I was there I saw the prisoner cleaning the windows—he was inside the shop—I think he said to mother, "The boy is not gone to school"—I don't know if he saw me; he might have done—my mother came to the door, and said, "Walter, go to school," and I went—I think my mother went into the kitchen to make puddings—she went straight up the shop; that leads into the kitchen—when I went to school, my mother and the prisoner were the only persons in the house—she had not been making puddings before I left, that I am aware of.</p>

               <p>blood—the blood had spurted I should say from six to eight feet, very nearly to the ceiling, on the walls—I continued to attend her until her death—at the time I first saw her I thought the probabilities were that she would not live from minute to minute. till the afternoon; she then recovered her consciousness—she retained her intellects afterwards perfectly, with the exception of the Tuesday evening; she then had a little delirium, and on the day of the accident she wandered in her mind—with that exception she retained her intellect till the time of her death—when I visited her on the Tuesday evening, she made some incoherent remarks to me—I can hardly say how long she wandered, she did not answer my questions intelligibly while I was examining her—on the day of the accident I think I saw her six or seven times, besides stopping with her several hours; and subsequently I saw her two or three times a day—on one day I may have seen her only once, I can't say what day that was—about the middle of the week follow<lb></lb>ing the injury I thought there was a chance of her recovery, I think about the Wednesday or Thursday, but she then began to sink—she died on the 17th, about 6 o'clock in the evening—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I have my notes of it here—the nose was divided by a con<lb></lb>tused wound at the junction of the middle with the lower part; the upper lip was divided from the left nostril into the mouth; there were two con<lb></lb>tused wounds on the left side of the upper lip, about an inch long; part of the left ear was cut off; the cheeks and eyelids bruised; the right cheek bone, the bones of the nose, and of the upper jaw fractured; on the forehead was a wound laying bare the bone over a triangular space which measured three inches vertically and four inches transversely; the periostum, the membrane that covers the bone, was torn off from the bone at the upper part; there was a transverse wound about an inch long above the left brow; on the head, on the left side, there was one wound two inches long, and two wounds one inch long; a little further, but on the right side of the head, was a wound laying bare the skull to the extent of seven inches from before backwards, and five inches transversely; the periostum was torn off in three places at that wound; the scalp on that side of the head (the left) was so contused as to be in the condition of a pulp; the neck was bruised on both sides; the right arm had bruises on the back of the elbow; there was a superficial wound on the left forearm about two and a half inches long, small superficial wounds on the left forearm and hand, and bruises and a wound on the left elbow; there were bruises on the back of the trunk and legs, but no bruises on the chest or abdomen; there was no fracture of the skull—that was the superficial examination—this was afterwards—"No effusion of blood into the interior of the skull, and no laceration of the brain—the organs in the chest and abdomen were healthy"—She must have received a great many bruises—I found sixteen wounds in all, some of them were very slight—the nasal bones are easily broken, but to fracture the upper jaw bone great violence must have been used—she died from the injuries which she had sustained—I have seen the rolling-pin and the iron bar—in my judgment those instruments would have boon quite sufficient to inflict the wounds I saw—a chopper was shown me, it was an ordinary kitchen chopper—I think that had not been used—there were merely a few spots of blood upon it, nothing on the edge—the rolling-pin had a quantity of blood and hair upon it, and the iron bar also—I was shown a waistcoat in the kitchen, on the morning when I first went there, I think it was hanging up, as far as I remember—I did not pay much attention to those</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there any marks on the back of the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The whole of the back and side of the head were bruised—I imagine that the bruises about the trunk, arms, and elbow were probably caused by a fall; I don't think it likely the injuries to the head could be, nor any of those on the face; they were too large—the back of the head was generally bruised—there was a copper in the corner of the kitchen, near where the body lay—if she had fallen against that, It might have given her a bruise, but it could not have given her the wounds on the head—some of the appearances might have been caused by a fall.</p>

About 11 o'clock in the morning of 8th May, I went to 11, Artillery Passage, and found a number of things, which I produce—the iron bar, chopper, and rolling-pin were in the yard; they had been removed—this waistcoat I found behind the door in the kitchen, on the floor—this iron saucepan handle was in the kitchen, and these pieces of head comb broken in two or three pieces; that is a comb for the back of the hair—this piece of side comb and a hair pin I also found in the kitchen, a sack and an apron, which appears to have blood on it—the waistcoat is torn down from the arms—I found some hair in the kitchen; to all appearance, it is woman's hair—I delivered all the things to Dr. Letheby, in the condition in which I found them—there was a great deal of blood on the floor, and on the walls, up to eight or nine feet high, spurts of blood—the things in the kitchen were very much disarranged; some crockery</p>

On Friday, 8th May, about 9.15, I was in Artillery Passage, and saw the prisoner at Mr. Grossmith's—he was standing with his foot on the doorstep, and had a cloth in his hand, as if he had been cleaning the window—he had a waistcoat on, the one that has been produced—I said, "Good morning" to him as I passed by—about 9.45 I heard what had happened—I went into the kitchen, and saw Mrs. Grossmith lying on her left side, with her feet to the kitchen door and her head towards the copper; and I saw a rolling-pin, an iron bar, and a chop<lb></lb>per on the floor—I took them out into a small yard at the back—I did not see the waistcoat.</p>

The prisoner Fanny had lived about seven months in my service - the other prisoner visited her sometimes: on the 1st of February I went to a place of worship as usual, with my wife, about half-past ten o'clock - returned about half-past one, and when dinner was brought up, we thought the meat very much shrunk; while we were at dinner, Aldred, the officer, came with Susan Gough in custody; I gave

On Sunday, the 1st of February, about a quarter-past one o'clock, I saw the prisoner Susan coming down Fish-street-hill, with a bundle; I asked what she had got - she said"What is it to you?" she said she was going to her mother's - that she was no thief; she had brought them from up the hill - I said "What, from Fish-street-hill?" she said "No, from Stamford-hill:" I found she had got these coals and potatoes, a bottle nearly full of ale, and two porkchops undressed - they were pinned up in a knife-cloth; I took her to the watch-house - she then said her sister had given them to her, and she lived in Queen-street; I went to Mr. Strutt's - he gave the sister in charge; I took them both to the Compter.</p>

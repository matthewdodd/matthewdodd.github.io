                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and have a partner—my shop is at Church-Mil, Woolwich. On the 2nd of June I saw the prisoner in the shop, in the act of throwing a frock over the counter, which had been hanging within the counter—she had dealt at the shop.</p>

                  </hi>. I was standing in the prosecutor's shop—I saw the prisoner come in—she staid a good bit, and inquired for Mr. Booth—the shopman said he was gone to dinner—she said she could not wait—she went to the next shop, got on the counter, took down the gown, and put it under her shawl—she then ran away with it—Mr. Booth gent the policeman after her, and she was brought back by the shopboy—I sat her throw the gown over the counter.</p>

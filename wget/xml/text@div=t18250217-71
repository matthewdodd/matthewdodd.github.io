On the 14th of December the prisoner called at my house. My wife sent him to the stable. I was there. He asked me the particulars about the mare, and the price of it, with bridle and saddle. I asked 25 guineas for the whole. He saw the mare in the stable and out in the yard; he said he wanted it for an elderly gentleman - that he had not time then to try the pace of the mare, but would call next day, and, with my permission, would ride it; but he knew his friend would not give above 20 guineas. He did not mention his friend's name or address. He called on Friday the 17th, about twelve o'clock but I did not see him. He came again about three, when the boy fetched me to the stable to him. He asked if the mare was sold - I said No. He asked if she was quiet - I said Yes. He said, if I knew of any imperfection in it I must mention it; for it would be useless for him to show it to his uncle (as he then called his friend) if it was imperfect; and said, with my permission, he would ride it a few paces, and should then be able to judge whether it would suit his uncle or not; if it was not calculated to suit his uncle, he would return in a few minutes; but if it was he would ride it and show it to his uncle. I asked his address, he said No. 36, Davis-street, Berkley-square, and mentioned a name which I cannot recollect; he said, he and his uncle both lived there. I asked, if he said Davis or David-street. He said, Davis-street, Berkley-square; and said, "You know the neighbourhood of Davis-street, I presume?" I said, Yes, perfectly well; for I married my wife from there. He asked, what part of the street. I said, my father-in-law lived at No. 8, Davis-street, at the corner of a yard, and was a lock-smith and bell-hanger. He said, he knew the shop perfectly well, but did not personally know my father-in-law. The saddle and bridle were on the mare; he got on her, and rode away; but, before that, said, if the mare was likely to suit his uncle, he would take it to him, and I should have an answer; about half-past six o'clock that evening, he would send his servant to order me to come to his uncle's for the money for the mare, saddle, and bridle. He then rode away. I waited till rather later than half-past six o'clock - he did not come then or at any other time, nor did his uncle or any body else. No bargain was made for the mare; he said, he knew his uncle would not give more than 20 guineas; and, if his uncle did not approve of it, he would send it back; but, if he liked it, he would send to me to come for the money. I enquired the same evening at No. 36, Davis-street, Berkley-square, and was informed, no person of his description lived there. Mr. Hopkins, a coachmaker, lived there. I could not hear of any old gentleman living there, or any person answering the prisoner's description. I went to the office next morning, and had hand-bills printed, but have never found the mare, bridle, or saddle. I met the prisoner in Hyde-park on the 17th of January, and had him secured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. If the person who took the mare had returned the money, you would be satisfied? A. Certainly. I had not sold it. If the money had been sent back, I should have thought the bargain concluded, but not till then. If it was approved of by his uncle, the money was to be returned. If the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182502170041"></xptr>mare or money had been sent at half-past six o'clock, I should have been satisfied. I let him have it to shew to his uncle. I expected either the mare or the money back. I bought it at the Bazaar. I never said it had come from my uncle, in Gloucestershire, who had sprained his uncle. I bought her on the 11th, but she would not go in harness, and I had no use for her. He did not offer to leave the money, or I should have been glad to receive it. I have not sent to him in prison for the money. I know Mr. Manley - I desired him to go and ask the prisoner where the mare was gone as I thought he was made the tool of others to get it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Manley said, if 20 guineas could be produced, you did not care? A. I understood Manley to say, that the prisoner would produce 20 guineas, if I should be satisfied: but I never sent him to say a word about money. Nothing was said about depositing the money, when he was at the stables. We were a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes bargaining about it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you see him again? A. On the 17th of January, in Hyde-park, with another man - he was about 150 yards off, walking towards me. He turned round, and ran away from me very fast: he left his companion. I have no doubt but he saw me. I passed his companion, and followed him. He ran out into Park-lane, and was overtaken by a groom. I came up to him in Pitt's-head-mews, collared him, and said, "You villain, I have got you at last." He said, yes; I had got him. Some person in the crowd asked what he had done. I said, he had stolen my mare. He said, I could only make a debt of it, for he had bought it. I gave him in charge. The Magistrate asked where he lived. He would not give his address.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When he rode away with the mare, did you not expect the money to be sent? A. I expected the mare or money back at half-past eight o'clock. He had not rode on it till he rode it away. My boy has left my service now. The Magistrate said, I need not bring him. The horse was bought for my own use: nobody else had a share in it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of January, I saw a crowd in Pitt's-head-mews, and found the prosecutor holding the prisoner; he charged him with stealing his mare.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor's servant was in the stable at the two interviews, and heard me offer to leave 25 guineas, as security for the mare. I declare, I never mentioned my uncle. He said, it came from his uncle, in Gloucestershire, who had sprained his anckle, and could not ride again. I took it away by his consent. He asked, if I was going to take it into the country. I said, no: I was going to a friend, in Davis-street, Berkley-square, and was going to Mr. Grinwood's, whom I once lodged with. I have been abroad six years, and have no friends in London.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, Hazel Road, Darnall, near Sheffield, and am a miner—I knew the prisoner when she lived at Darnall—Jane Ann Peace lived with her and passed as her daughter—she at that time lived, with</p>

               <p>Charles Frederick Peace—I married the girl on 8th January last at Hull—Charles Frederick Peace was not present—Last Whit Monday I came to London with my wife, and went to 5, East Terrace, Evelina Road, where I saw Peace living as Mr. Thompson with a woman who passed as Mm Thompson—a lad named Willie lived there—I stayed there eight or nine days and went home—the prisoner and Willie took their meals alone, and Mr. and Mrs. Thompson in another part of the house—on 12th October the prisoner came to my house at Darnall and said she had left a large box at the station, Sheffield—she said she had seen something in the paper relating to a man who was apprehended, and she supposed it was her husband—I took her in, and on the following Monday I went to Sheffield and brought her box, which was heavy—the box I have seen is the same—there were eventually two brought to my premises—I saw them searched—all the things that have been identified as found on my premises had been brought there by the prisoner—I had nothing to do with them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of Police at Sheffield—on Nov. 6th I assisted Phillips in searching Mr. Bolsover's house—I left Phillips, and afterwards returned to the house—I saw the prisoner, Mrs. Bolsover, Willie Ward, and Bolsover—I said to Bolsover, "We have found a large quantity of property in your house, which we have good reason to believe is stolen; there is a clock there which Mr. Phillips identifies as part of the proceeds of a burglary at Blackheath; how do you account for it being in jour house?"—he said, "I know nothing of it"—I said, "It is stolen, and you will have to account for it"—the prisoner said, "I brought it from Hull five weeks ago, a tall woman brought it to me;" that a friend had sent it to her house; she said, "I don't know her," and she said the other proper! was hers nearly two years ago—I collected all the property, and assisted in the search on Nov. 14th—some time between the 6th and 14th she said she was married at St. George's Church, Sheffield, in the name of Hannah Ward, to Charles Peace, the year before her daughter was born, who was 19 years old; that her husband had burnt the certificate, and that the two witnesses to the marriage, John Clark and Clara Clark, were dead.</p>

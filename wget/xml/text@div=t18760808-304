                  </hi>. I am the son of Elizabeth Turner who keeps the Blue Posts, Freeman Street, Oxford Street—on the morning of 15th July about 12.20 I locked up the house excepting the coffee-room window, which could be pulled down—I was alarmed about 3 o'clock, came down and found the prisoner in custody—I missed a silver goblet value 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which has not been recovered—this goblet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was on the counter—it was on a shelf 11 feet high the night before—the window shutters were then down and there were foot marks on the saw dust.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman E</hi> 318). On the morning of 15th July about 2.40 I passed the Blue Posts and found it safe; I passed again twenty-five minutes afterwards and found the top half of the window shutter down—there was a little saw dust on the area railing and on the window cill, which aroused my suspicion—I went to the folding doors, pushed them open suddenly, and saw the prisoner behind the bar—I asked him what he was doing, he made no answer, I asked him a second time and he said that he saw the doors open and walked in—this cup was on the counter close to where he was standing, and the till was open—I caught hold of him, called "Police," and two constables came.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I do not deny being there, but somebody had been there before me, leaving the door open. I deny being behind the door, the policeman is anxious to patch up the case, I was drunk and feeling very drowsy went in there to sleep. Two men came out, one of whom had a banjo under his arm, and I thought the house was open. I knocked and receiving no answer went in, and the policeman came and took me. The policeman admits being twenty-five minutes away which would give the banjo player time to secure the cup. The place had been robbed before I got there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a miller, and live at Wettonstone, in Hertfordshire. I am in the habit of sending up flour and corn in sacks to London—when my servants go, they very often bring back some kind of goods, sometimes oats or bones—we do not regularly count the sacks when they return, because they are partly filled with corn, and partly empty—in consequence of in<lb></lb>formation, I went with a policeman and warrant to search the prisoner's house, at the Bull-inn at Whetstone, where my horses stopped regularly to bait and sleep—I went into several bed-rooms—in one of them I found two of my sacks nailed across the bedstead, from one side to the other, for sacking—in the same room I found another on another bedstead, nailed in the same way—in another room I found three bran sacks, converted into a straw bed—altogether I found twenty-seven sacks, which I believe to be mine—they are worth about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's wife, and live at 9, Whitebait Court, Lambeth—on Thursday, 23rd May, between 6 and 7, I was in Leman Street; the prisoner followed me there—I went into a butter-shop—when I came out I passed him by, and I knew nothing till I found a stab in my shoulder—I screamed and ran into the road—I did not look to see where the stab came from—a policeman came to my assistance directly—I had not been living with the prisoner for four weeks.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman H</hi> 237). I was in Leman Street on this evening—I heard the prosecutrix scream, and saw the prisoner with a knife open in his hand on her shoulder—I rushed towards him—they were struggling—he cut her across the arm—she had received a stab in the back before that—in the struggle the knife went through his own hand—they were both bleeding very much—I sent for a cab, and, while waiting for it, he said "I have had three months for her before, and I don't care if I have the rope this time"—I took them to the hospital and their wounds were dressed—the woman was detained in the hospital—I took the prisoner to the station—on the road he said "Constable, I will tell you the truth; I done it on purpose; I bought the knife in the Borough to-day for a shilling"—the charge was read over to him at the station, and he said "Quite right, sir"—he dropped this knife at the time, which some one picked up and gave to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon at the London Hospital—on 23rd May the prosecutrix was brought there—she had a clean incised wound on her back, such as would be produced by a knife or some sharp cutting instrument; it consisted of two wounds joined at a right angle; it was three-quarters of an inch deep—there was a great deal of haemorrhage, most dangerous, an artery was wounded, I had great difficulty in stop<lb></lb>ping it then, and it has returned twice dangerously since, it has now healed—unless she had had surgical aid she might have bled to death.</p>

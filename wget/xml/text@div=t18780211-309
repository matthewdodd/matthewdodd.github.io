I am a labourer, and live at No. 12, Ship and Mermaid Yard—I went home shortly after midnight on Christmas Eve, when I met the prisoner with a dog under his arm, which he set at me—I told him if he didn't take the dog away I should kick it, when he gave me a blow in the jaw and ran away—I ran after him, and caught him on the stairs of No. 2, Ship and Mermaid Yard, where his mother and another woman named Donohue live, and we had a struggle on the stairs—his mother happened to be near, and pulled him one step higher up the stairs, and he drew a white-handled knife from his right-hand trousers pocket, and stabbed me in the side, and said "I mean doing for you"—I fell on my side in the corner, and found my inside was hanging out about two inches—he ran upstairs and got a poker and hit me twice on the arm and three times across the back—I remember no more till the next morning when I found myself in Guy's Hospital, where I remained for four weeks—I am sure his mother did not stab me—she was the only other present—I saw the knife in his hand—I have seen him with it before.</p>

I was sober I am certain—I have been a quiet peace<lb></lb>able man for the last nine months—I had not before that the reputation of being so—he put down the dog and set it at me before anything was said—I did not strike the prisoner or kick the dog—I have been con<lb></lb>victed several times for assault, but I have turned over a new leaf now—I do not remember being convicted in November, 1873—I was in October, 1875, and sentenced to 21 days' hard labour at the Southwark police<lb></lb>court; in November, 1875, to one month for willful damage and assault; and three months in April, 1876, for assaulting a police-constable, and in February, 1876, I had seven days for assaulting another constable—in February, 1877, I got a month for assaulting a woman, and in August, 1877, I was bound over to keep the peace for a row at home—I didn't have two months on the 27th September, 1877—I know police-constable 110 M—he did not take me into custody then—I have not been taken this last nine months—I did not seize the prisoner's mother by the hair, and he did not say "I will not have my mother struck," and then get the poker—I might have torn his trousers in the scuffle—I only went in to remonstrate with him.</p>

I am a labourer, and live at 9, Ship and Mermaid Yard—I heard a cry of "Murder" late on Christmas Eve, and a woman told me to run into the passage of No. 2, and I did so and I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner, his mother, and Larkman, no one else—as I ran into the house the prisoner ran upstairs and said "What will you do, Jim Larkman, or anyb—b—who will take your part?" —Larkman called out "I am stabbed," and the prisoner runs up and gets a poker and says "That will do; I know who it is now," and he hit Larkman two or three times and his mother on the head—she was on the stairs holding Larkman—I did not see the stabbing—I picked the prosecutor up and took him to the hospital—I had to keep his wounds in, they were coming out through his guts—I didn't see any other man in the place.</p>

I was acting House Surgeon at Guy's Hospital on Christmas Eve when the prisoner was brought in—I examined him after he was in bed, and found he had a clean-cut, incised wound, I should say about one or two inches long, just above the left groin, and there was about two or three inches of <hi rend="italic">omentum</hi> hanging out—those were all the injuries I saw—that portion of the <hi rend="italic">omentum</hi> was ligatured and removed, and the patient was put to bed—he remained in the hospital till 19th January, I believe—only the lining of the intestines was cut—the gut itself was not injured—I should think the wound must have been produced by some kind of knife, as it was a clean-cut wound.</p>

He said, 'That heifer you spoke to'. He raised his foot to kick the dog. I told him not. I took up the dog and turned back into my mother's room, when he ran up the stairs after me. My mother put her back to the door to prevent him coming in. He bursted the door open and seized my mother by her hair and began thumping into her. I got hold of the poker and struck him across the hand to loose his hand out of my mother's hair. Mrs. Donohue was in the room at the same time. She called out for help. Joseph Reardon then came into the room."</p>

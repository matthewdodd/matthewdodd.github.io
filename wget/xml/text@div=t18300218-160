On the following day he came again for four lengths more for the same persons; they measured about nine yards; I let him have them - that was worth 8l. 2s.; he was not taken up till the middle of January - I saw him at the examination at Guildhall; I saw Brown and Sams about a day after, and told them what had passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have the kindness to state the exact words he said the first time he came? A. He said he had come from Brown and Sams for a cut or length of cloth, two yards and a half - that it was to be the very best, and according to a pattern which he had - it was a dark olive; that is all he said then, I believe - I cut a cloth to match his pattern; he had been in the service of Brown and Sams some months before - they were in the habit of sending him to our shop for cloth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not they direct that no cloth was ever to be given for them without a written order? A. We often gave this man cloth on their account without a written order; there was no order not to deliver cloth without - he did produce a written order sometimes, but not for one article in twenty; Messrs. Dawson and Williams have no other partners.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BROWN SAMS. I am in partnership with Mr. Brown - we are tailors, and deal with Messrs. Dawson and Williams. The prisoner was in our service, but had not been employed by us for six months previous to the 23rd of October - he had left us for more than six months; I had no knowledge whatever of his going to get these goods on our account - we should not have employed him in our business after the time we discharged him; he brought some goods to me on the 24th of October, and asked me the favour to cut out from one of the lengths a coat for himself - he did not tell me where he had got it, nor did I know - it was to be applied to his own use.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For what you know it might be the cloth mentioned in the indictment? A. For what I know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the 24th of October he appears to have had two yards and a quarter of blue cloth from the same persons - did you authorise him to go for that for yourself, or did your partner? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>JAMES MARTIN re-examined. He came on the 24th for four lengths of two yards and a quarter each; they were blue Oxford mixed and brown - he brought a pattern-card, and pointed out the patterns for all of them.</p>
               <p>MR. SAMS. I did not know of his getting these articles, and never authorized him to get them; when he came to my house he asked me to cut a coat from the Oxford mixture - he took the whole away, and never intimated that he had got them on our account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For aught you know they may or may not be the property included in this indictment? A. I cannot say - I am convinced Mr. Brown did not send him- I am sure he did not; Mr. Brown was at that time an invalid - he was not confined to his bed; he was in the house, but not doing business - I was not with him all the day, but am convinced he did not send him; I know it, as far as it is possible for any one to know the actions of another - I did not ask him if he had sent him: I can swear positively, of my own knowledge, that he did not - he is unable to walk now; I act as foreman - nobody besides myself takes orders except Mr. Brown, and he has been unable to attend to business; I do not mean to swear he was unable to go into the shop that day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the prisoner at your house before he was in possession of the cloth? A. No - I saw him with the cloth on the morning of the 24th, not the 23rd- I was at home part of the day on the 23rd, but not all day.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS addressed the Court and Jury on behalf of the prisoner, and called two witnesses, who deposed to his good character.</p>

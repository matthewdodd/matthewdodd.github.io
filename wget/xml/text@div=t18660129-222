I am a coach-builder, of 184, Old-street, St. Luke's—on 6th January, the prisoner called on me at about ten minutes to 4 in the afternoon, and said he wanted to hire a cart—I showed him one—he said that was not good enough—I told him I had not got a better cart, but I had a waggonette—I showed it to him, and he said it would do, and he should want it for about two or three hours, or it might be a little more—the value of it is about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him the charge would be 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he paid it—he had brought a very nice horse to the door—I looked at it, and asked him where he got it from—he said that it belonged to his brother-in<lb></lb>law, a man named Thompson, whom I knew—I gave him no authority to part with the waggonette—I saw it again next day, Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Providence-place, Dockhead, and am a general dealer—about half-past 8 o'clock on Saturday, January 6th, from something told me by a man named Underwood, I went outside the Sugar Loaf public-house, and saw the prisoner and a man named Murphy with a waggonette—Underwood said to the prisoner, "Here's a man that will buy that trap of you"—I said, "I am no judge; how much do you want for it?"—he first asked 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and then he came down to 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "It's too high a price for me; I can't afford to buy it"—Murphy says to me, "Oh, he means selling it"—"Well, "I said, "if you mean to sell it, I'll buy it, but not at that price; who does it belong to, to you?"—he said that he and his brother-in-law were partners; they had had a few words and fell out, and he wanted to sell it to get some money to pay his men—I asked him what tradesman he was, and he said a wagonnette polisher and horse-hair finisher—at last I agreed to give him 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he could get more than that on the Monday—"Well, "I said, "if you can, I will take 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on</p>

               <p>Monday to give it back, which will be 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my bargain, "upon which he says, "If you come to them terms, you shall have it"—I said, I shall call a constable to see I have paid for it"—"Oh, "he says," you can do that with the greatest of pleasure—I then called a constable from over the other side of the way, and told him I thought it was stolen—he says, "you should not <hi rend="italic">think</hi>"—I then said to the prisoner, "I had better ride to your house, and see where it belongs to, before I buy it"—"Oh, "he says, "you can do that, if you like"—my brother and a person named John Keane were with me, and we jumped up with Murphy, and John Underwood, and the prisoner, and drove off—when we got to Farringdon-street, the prisoner says to me, "Got any money?"—I said "No, I got no change"—"Well, "he says, I can get two pots of beer at this public-house on tick, "so we got out, and he went and spoke to a person over the bar, and got two pots, and then, as we were drinking it, Murphy says to me, "Look here, we don't want to hurt you, and you don't want to hurt us; the cart is stolen, "to which I said, "If it is stolen, so help me, God, I'll look you up—my brother went outside, and caught hold of the horse's head—Murphy and Underwood then ran away—the prisoner then says to me, "Where's Murphy and Under-wood?" and I says, "They're run away"—I said to my brother, "We had better catch hold of him" meaning the prisoner—I daresay he heard me Say that, and, instead of walking on the pavement, he walks out in the road, and then popped through the cab rank—me and my brother ran after him, calling "Stop thief"—one of his shoes came off, but, without stopping to pick it up, he went along by the Underground Railway, and jumped into the ruins.</p>

Stratton, of Sekforde-street, Clerkenwell"—I said, "I understand you offered the waggonette for sale to a man at Bermondsey"—he said, "No, I was taken down to Bermondsey by Underwood and Murphy, but we did not intend to sell the waggonette"—those are the words, as near as I can remember—I said, "What made you run away and leave it unprotected in Farringdon-street?"—he said, "Because the man we saw at Bermondsey was going to lock us up"—I took him to the station-house—there was nothing found on him.</p>

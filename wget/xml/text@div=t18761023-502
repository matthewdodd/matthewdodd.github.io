                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer in Lupus Street, Pimlico—I received instructions from the representatives of the late Rev. John May to sell the contents of his place, The Heath, Hanwell—the sale took place on the 26th September last of which this is a catalogue (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I employed the prisoner as a porter on the sale, his duties were to assist in lotting and bringing the goods up and showing them to the persons—the lots bore numbers in the usual way—if anything was not lotted he should have spoken to the manager or to me about it at the time—he had no authority to remove or sell anything—it was not contrary to the rules that he Should become a purchaser; he purchased Lot No. 4, a hair mattress, and lot 24, four blankets and counterpane, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and lot 142, under carpet, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—lot 235 drugget and hearth rug, fender and fire irons was sold to Mr. Batty for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I did not know at the time they were lotted that there was oilcloth in the library under the drugget—lot 111*, page 9, is three blankets, sold to Mr. Ray for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—lot 197, page 13, I dozen table napkins, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., sold to Mr. Hansom—lot 31, a quantity of dimity bed furniture, sold to Mr. Garnham for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and lot 61, two blankets, sold to Miss Groves-lot 57, 4 1/2 feet iron tester bedstead and vallance, to Mr. Golding, 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—lot 96, page 7, bedroom No. 7, two dimity curtains, four post bamboo painted bedstead, sold to Golding, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—lots 6 and 7, sold to Miss Groves for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., two feather pil<lb></lb>lows, blanket, and one quilt—I was not present when the things <hi rend="italic">were</hi> deli<lb></lb>vered—on going down in the afternoon after the clearing day I went up in one of the upper rooms and found a cupboard locked—I opened it with a key from my pocket and to my astonishment I found a lot of goods; I did not know by whom the cupboard had been locked; I found in it two blankets, two of the best counterpanes, linen quilt, three linen pillow cases, toilet cover, some dimity furniture, in fact, a quantity of bed furniture, one of the best towels, and a dinner napkin (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I recognised the dinner napkin as being one of the twelve I had sold—the bed furniture was the lot I had seen on the bamboo bedsteadthe blankets I recognised as having seen—I had gone through these things before and I believe they were in one of the top bedrooms—I am quite sure that the blankets were not those sold to the prisoner in his lotthe vallances are the same as those described in lot 57 as sold to Mr. Golding, and the dimity bed furniture is that sold to Mr. Garnham; the quilt, I believe, is the same as that sold to Miss Groves—I was afterwards shown three blankets which did not form any portion of those sold to the prisoner, but were those sold in lot 111* to Mr. Ray—the pri<lb></lb>soner asked me if I had broken open the cupboard, and I asked him what he knew of the cupboard-this was on Wednesday afternoon, the day after the sale—he said there were only a few things there which he had bought—I said I have taken possession of them and shall require an explanation"—I saw him afterwards taking the mattress and the blankets hanging from it towards the station—I followed him and went by the same train to Padding<lb></lb>ton</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187610230043"></xptr>
               <p>—on getting out at Paddington I went to him and said "I require you, Merriman, either to take those goods to the department here or straight to the office, for I must know what you have there before you take them any<lb></lb>where else"—he said they were only what he had bought, his mattress and blankets—I said "You. have other goods there", and he said "Yes, I have some fire-irons and I have some china"—I said "Where did you get the fire-irons from?"—he said "I bought them in the village"—I said "Can you tell me who you purchased them from?"—"No", he said, "I don't know who it was"—he then tried to get away from me and turned down towards the Edgware Road—I still persisted in following him and he went across to the corner public-house—I went and stood there and insisted that he should either take the goods across to the office or leave them somewhere till it was properly investigated—he then promised he would go with me and take them to the office—we went to Broad Street Station and took the tickets to Victoria Station—I stood with one foot on the step of the carriage and the other on the platform till I saw him put the goods in the train—the guard came along to shut the door and I got in—the train started and I saw the prisoner deliberately pull the things out again and I was obliged to go on and could not find him afterwards—he never said anything about the oil cloth which Mr. Batty took—the full value of the goods I have seen is about 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not know what the <hi rend="italic">goods</hi> were which he took out of the train—I saw the mattress and blankets—I did not charge him with taking those; I charged him with stealing the oilcloth—I brought a charge against him before the Magistrates, which was dismissed, and I afterwards brought this charge—when the charge was taken I had to give him into custody for stealing the oilcloth; all the other goods were taken to the station and were there at the time of the trial—there was only one charge preferred on the charge-sheet—he commenced some civil proceedings against me by serving me with a writ, the Monday after he was committed on this charge,' which was on the Saturday—I did not say when the Magistrate dismissed the former charge that I would make it hot for him—I was not at all hot myself—I have a great many sales; I have been in business as an auctioneer for three or four years; before that I was an ironmonger—I presume I know what a sale porter's duties are—Mr. Deakin was the manager; he is my sale clerk—I do not think he is here; I understand he has met with an accident since 1 came here; I took steps to get him here-Deakin engaged Merriman and paid him his wages—Skinner would be the leading porter; I believe he is here—I have not taken an opportunity of seeing him; I believe my solicitor has—there was another porter engaged on the sale; I don't know his name—there were about four porters altogether—Skinner had the lead of the sale; he would tell the others what to do—Deakin put the things into the catalogue—there was a number of duplicate lots; it was rather a hurried affair—there were other things put into the sale at the request "of the family, not forming part of the estate, to make the sale more attractive—I did not mis<lb></lb>lead the public by putting at the top of my sale catalogue a formal announcement as if I were selling by the order of the Chief Clerk in Chancery, and put goods in which were no part of the property; what was done was done at the request of the solicitor—the people had the oppor<lb></lb>tunity of seeing the goods the day before; it was a public auction—they could judge for themselves whether the goods were worth the money or not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187610230044"></xptr>
               <p>—in a sale like this of 348 lots where things are put in, Mr. Deakin might leave out something in the catologue-none of the things which I say have been taken by the prisoner were left out of the catalogue to my knowledge—I always go myself after the sale to see after the money, and see if the house is properly left so that I may hand over the keys to the parties—it was about 4 or 5 o'clock the next day that I went to the house, all was cleared then, with the exception of some few things that had to come to town purchasers, and which were waiting for the van-Mr. Deakin was there, I drew his attention to the things in the cupboard—it would not be his duty to leave till I had gone down—I first heard of Mr. Garnham's complaint; I could not go all over the country to find the purchasers—a complaint was made by Mr. Hansom to Deakin—he bought a dozen table napkins and had eleven delivered to him—I could not say whether Skinner or Merriman delivered the napkins—I did not say Merriman delivered them—I don't know that any of the sale porters besides the prisoner are here—I had no chance of getting them—I do not think they know anything about it—there were a great many cupboards upstairs—I bought one little lot of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the sale, I think—toys for my children, and an aluminum watch for 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I gave to my boy, and I bought one lot of oilcloth in the passage—there were two boxes of toys locked up in the cupboard-when I buy I have to make the offer the same as anybody else-if my clerk is knocking down anything to myself, I say "George"—that is my name—I should say my porter would not know that—I was surprised that the toys should be taken such care of; the things he had bought were not in the cupboard—he took them away which he had a right to do—I did not see him afterwards till I gave him in custody on Saturday night—I know that two of the blankets produced are Mr. Ray's, because they were the best blankets in the house, and they came out of what I think is called "Mr. John's room"—my attention was called I to them—Mr. Ray gave 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the blankets; there were three—the goods I found in the cupboard were taken to my office; nothing else that I am aware of—there is some wine still down there belonging to me—I have never got into difficulties occasioned by my conducting sales in this way; there were not things in two cupboards that I am aware ofthe toys were locked up in the cupboard I opened—the blankets in the catalogue, sold to Mr. Ray and Miss Groves had been taken out and sold to the publican—three were taken and sold to the publican the moment after the sale, and others substituted to the party who had purchased them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The majority of the articles in the catalogue belonged to the estate—I should say out of the 350 lots, possibly twenty were added—I the wine consisted of three dozen claret, and one dozen champagne—adding I lots to a sale would increase the value of and competition for the other lots, I I should think—I took my order to sell from the solicitors—I stated in the sale "By order of the representatives of the late Rev. John May"—the parties considered I had not delivered them the proper lots, and of course it was doing me a great deal of harm.</p>

I am a land value, and live at Hanwell—I attended the sale at The Heath and bought eighteen lots, amongst others 235, con<lb></lb>sisting of a drugget, hearth—rug, fender, and fire-irons, which were delivered to me the following day, Wednesday, when I got the order for them and saw the prisoner—three or four persons were with him in the room where the drugget lay; it was not taken up till I got my man to take it up; on taking it up the prisoner saw the oilcloth underneath it—he said did I want it, and I said "No", seeing its worn state—he said "As you purchased the drugget you may as well take it;" it was not in the catalogue—he said "You can have it if you please"—I said "Well, perhaps it will come in useful in some way or other", and he said to me, "You give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." which I gave him then and there—I believe the drugget was delivered to me the same day—I got the oilcloth, I believe, on Thursday—I sent my boy for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say that the prisoner delivered it to my lad I believe he did not by what my lad said—I gave him the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., not for the value of the oilcloth, but the trouble he had had with the eighteen lots.</p>

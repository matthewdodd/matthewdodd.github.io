                  </hi>. I am assistant to Rebecca Holmes, who keeps a linen-draper's shop at Hackney. On the 21st of March the prisoner, who, was a stranger, came and inquired for some mouseline-de-laine dresses—she chose one, which was to be put by till half-past seven o'clock—she then looked at some fringe and lace, and then wanted to look at some lining for her dress—she went to the opposite counter, where her dress was, to see the colour—I saw her put something into a small bag which she carried, and which I imagined to be a piece of ribbon—I went into the next room, and stated what I had seen—my brother came out, and missed a piece of ribbon—he charged her with taking it—she denied it at first, and then said she had taken it, and begged forgiveness—I sent for a policeman—this ribbon was found in her bag.</p>

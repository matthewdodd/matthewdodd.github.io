               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. What ages are your children? A. Ten, eight, five, and two years and a half; my husband had been doing no work for a few days before - he was out of work, but had been making a table or two to sell; he often said he wanted money to go on with.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you stopped out all the night before? A. No; I had not been out all night for the last month or two.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was pacing up and down the room, you was using violent language to him and he to you? A. I cannot say that I was; I am sure I did not call him ill names.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you saw the razor in his hand, did you hear him observe that he could not use it for shaving, that it required sharpening, and he was going to take it to be done? A. Not any thing about it; I did not see him take it up - it was before I observed the razor that he wished the privilege of a husband; I did not try to catch hold of it - I went to try if I could feel it, and he brought it forward himself; I did not catch hold of his arm nor of the razor - I was going to do it, but he brought his hand forward; I am certain the razor was not in my hand at any time - I did not attempt to take it from his hand; he did not throw me on the bed, as if insisting on what he had asked for; it was all done instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not his hand up rather when he threw you on the bed, and you tried to catch the razor from his hand on the bed? A. No, I did not; I tried to keep his arms from me.</p>
               <p>Q. Your impression is that he did not throw you on the bed to have connexion with you? A. No - he was over me before I was cut, and I was struggling to keep his arms from me, to prevent his injuring me; I called Murder! when I first saw the razor in his hand, before he touched me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Your hands were not at all cut? A. No.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you go out to upholstery work, or what? A. Any thing I can get; I never did upholstery - I have made children's clothes and shirts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his cutting you in the throat appear the effect of accident? A. I cannot say.</p>

            . I live in the same house as the prisoner, with my mother. On the 16th of October I heard the prosecutrix halloo out Murder! I live in the back room up stairs - I went to her room; the door was not locked - I went in and saw her laying on the bed, on her back, and the prisoner laying on the top of her; her petticoats were not thrown up at all - I did not notice his breeches: she was bleeding at the neck a good deal - I screamed out for my mother to come down stairs; the prisoner continued to lay on her till my mother came - she caught hold of him by the collar, and pulled him away from her; I did not see any thing in his hand - I saw the razor next day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he must have been some time on her? A. Yes; I ran down when I heard the cry; he continued on her till my mother came - he was some minutes on her; I went down directly she screamed out -I went with her to the surgeon, and after her wound was dressed walked home with her; she was not taken to the hospital.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Clarendon-square, Somer's-town. The prosecutrix was taken to Mr. Robinson's shop - he was not at home, and I was called into the shop; I found the prosecutrix sitting on a chair in the surgery, very pale, with a handkerchief up to her throat - it was bleeding but very trifling; there was one wound on the left side of the chin; and one on the right side of her throat; the one on the chin was immediately below the chin bone, about an inch and a quarter long; it was a semi-circular sort of wound; it could not be deep; it went nearly to the bone - the other was a very trifling wound, about an inch and a half long, towards the lower part of the neck; it merely divided the skin on the right side of the windpipe, close by the side of it; it is impossible to say whether they were done intentionally, or by accident - it might be done by falling on a sharp instrument; it is quite impossible that it could be done by accident.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The second wound was very slight? A. Very, but in a much more dangerous part, for it was immediately over the principal blood-vessels of the neck - I observed next day a third wound; it was very slight, more like a scratch from a cat.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose the second wound might have been done if the razor had been dropped on the part? A. Yes, but the same drawing of the sharp instrument might have done both.</p>
               <p>Q. The wound being semi-circular was the length you name, but not that size? A. No; she walked home from the shop: there was not much loss of blood; the injury did not appear to be inflicted with a heavy hand at all - I cannot say respecting the first wound, as it was so near the bone.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in Seymour-street about half-past one o'clock; seeing a mob collected, I went and found the prosecutrix in a doctor's shop - I went to her house, knocked at the door, and was told to walk in; I found two or three persons in the room, with the prisoner, and took him - I asked for the instrument he had cut his wife with; he said, "You may find it if you can;" I called at his house next morning, to make further search, and the wife gave it to me - when I told the prisoner he must go with me to the station, he said,"Very well, I am ready to go with you any where;" as we went along to High-street, Marylebone, I asked him what made him use an instrument like that to his wife - (I had not then found it, and did not hold out threat or promise to him) - I said it would have been better to have used his fist; he said she was in the habit of going to houses which he had an objection to to work - I said"What houses?" he said, "Houses where girls live, and more than that, I pulled her out of a bawdy-house at Temple-bar;" I said, "A bawdy-house! perhaps she might go there to work;" he said, "No, she went there along with a gentleman, and I was determined to be revenged on her."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you and he alone at this conversation? A. Yes; we walked on first.</p>
               <p>MRS. GRAY. I gave the razor to the officer; I cannot say it is the one I saw in his hand; I pulled it out of the fire next morning; the handle was burnt off - I could find no other in the room.</p>

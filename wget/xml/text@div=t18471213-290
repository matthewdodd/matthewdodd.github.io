                  </hi> I am a surgeon, residing at Hackney, and have known the late Mr. Nelme many years—I was first called in between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, and he died, as near as I can ascertain, between four and five in the afternoon—I had not attended him since I cut off his arm, I believe, in 1837—I was in the habit of attending the family, Mrs. Nelme being in bad health, as well as the daughter—the morning I saw him he described himself as suffering great pain in the bowels, and having been very sick, and having been purged—I thought him extremely ill, wrote a prescrip<lb></lb>tion, and they sent it to be made up at our surgery—I promised to see him again in a few hours, I saw him again between twelve and one; he had then taken two of the draughts, and I directed him to have some beef tea and a little brandy and water—I was afterwards sent for urgently, and went imme<lb></lb>diately, between four and five, and found he was dead—I afterwards, by the direction of the Coroner, opened the body—he was about 73 or 74 years of age—I amputated his arm in 1873. in consequence of an accident, and he told me then he was 62 or 63—the draughts I gave him did not contain any arsenic—I did not, on the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, discover anything that caused me to suppose he had come to his death by foul means—the first examination I made was on 29th, forty-eight hours after his death—I discovered nothing that led me to suspect the presence of poison, but it may be right to observe that the contents of the stomach, the stomach itself, and other parts, were removed expressly for the purpose of chemical analysis, so that I had not the opportunity of judging altogether of the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>, appearances—the contents of the stomach were placed in a jar, and the stomach in another jar; the intestines were secured at either extremity, and placed in a jar, with a portion of the liver; the jars were all sealed—I can hardly recollect what was in each—there was one small one and two large ones—I did not seal them myself, or see them sealed; my partner, Mr. Hacon, took charge of them; he kept them till I called for them in my car<lb></lb>riage on the Sunday morning, and we took them, together, to Dr. Letheby—on 1st Nov., I was sent for to Mrs. Nelme; she had been sick—I received from her some arrow-root and pounded sugar—I requested to have them, and placed them in different papers, and took them away—I did not make an experiment on the arrow-root; I endeavoured to dissolve the sugar in cold distilled water; it would not dissolve—I delivered the rest of the sugar to Dr. Letheby, at the London Hospital—he made some experiments on it in</p>

               <p>my presence—it was pounded lump sugar—he told me it contained a consi<lb></lb>derable quantity of arsenic—I was not present when he made the experiment on the liver, the contents of the stomach, and the intestines—all I know on the subject is, from Dr. Letheby's evidence before the Coroner, which I heard, and attended to, and from which, I have on doubt, Mr. Nelme died from arsen<lb></lb>ical poison.</p>

Q.</hi> I believe, until you heard that evidence, you were under the impression that he died from some form of cholera? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Until I found arsenic mixed with the sugar, I had no reason to believe but it might have been a natural death—I believed it to have arisen from some sort of cholera, until arsenic was found in the stomach—the arsenic in the sugar would not have assisted me, only from the history of the case, unless I had heard that some was found in the stomach—one or two jars were brought from my surgery by Mr. Hacon, and the small one from the kitchen below by the undertaker, it was brown earthenware—they were placed on the table—I saw them carefully washed out with boiling water, and scrubbed out—to the best of my belief they were perfectly cleansed—great care was taken on the point, with the third jar particularly—it was washed in my pre<lb></lb>sence—earthenware does not contain any free arsenic; I mean, none that can be dissolved by any ordinary matters—I do not think it possible that the stomach contained dissolving material—I attended the prisoner professionally some time last year—he had two abscesses of a scrofulous kind, one on the cheek and one on the back—they were extremely obstinate—it is a disease of a constitutional character, and may show itself anywhere—it might affect the internal organs—it might do so without being suppressed externally—I have frequently seen scrofulous disease of the brain—it a disease of that kind should attack the brain, it would be calculated to affect the intellect—I do not recollect seeing any wound on his head; my attention was never called to it—I understand he is under twelve years of age—he appears to me to be about twelve, but I should say he is rather diminutive.</p>

                  </hi> I am physician, and lecturer on chemistry at the London Hospital. On Sunday morning, 31st Oct., Messrs. Toulmin and Hacon called on me with the three jars—the smaller one, which was put into the larger one, contained the contents of a human stomach—the other large jar contained the stomach, the intestines, and a portion of the liver—the jar into which the smaller one was put contained nothing—the intestines were secured by strings, to keep the contents within them—on the following day Mr. Toulmin called on me at the hospital, and gave me two paper parcels, one containing arrow-root and the other pounded sugar—I analysed all those</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184712130045"></xptr>
               <p>matters—I used tests of my own, which are known only to a few—they are known tests, but somewhat modified—I can state that there was not any material used that contained arsenic, inasmuch as experiments were per<lb></lb>formed with portions of sheep's liver, and so on, which did not yield to the same reagents any indication of arsenic—the contents of the stomach were first put into a retort and distilled, and about three tea-spoonsful of liquor distilled from it—those three tea-spoonsful were tested for prussic acid, without giving any evidence or indication of that poison—the remainder of the contents of the stomach were evaporated nearly to driness, then digested in about half a pint of alcohol, then about half a pint of alcohol poured upon this nearly dry deposit—this alcoholic solution was then filtered, and then tested for lead, corrosive sublimate, copper, and beryta, all of which are poisons; also for opium, nux vomica and oxalic acid, but without being able to detect either of them—the remainder of the contents of the stomach not dissolved by the alcohol was then boiled in water and tested for arsenic, by which means I was enables to detect that poison, a portion of which I produce in a metallic state—it is the small metallic ring in this tube—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that is only a portion of what I discovered; the other has been subjected to analysis—the liver was then tested for arsenic, and that gave similar results—I then proceeded to analyse the arrow-root, but did not detect any poison there—I then analysed the coarse white sugar, which amounted to four ounces and a half, and out of that I was enabled to obtain this, which is rather more than half an ounce of white arsenic—I afterwards examined a portion of the brain, which was given me by Mr. Toulmin three of four days afterwards—I cannot remember the day—it was at one of the sitting of the Coroner's Jury—I analysed that, and detected a trace of arsenic in the brain—I did not weigh the quantity of arsenic I found in the stomach, but in my judgment I should say I detected about four grains of white arsenic in the stomach, liver, intestines, and brain altogether—I weighed one portion, and from that obtained rather better than two grains and a half, nearly three grains, of white arsenic in the intes<lb></lb>tines—I think that would be sufficient to cause death—I can form an opinion, from discovering arsenic in the liver, how long the patient had been under its influence—I may be wrong, but I am of opinion that the deceased had been under the influence of arsenic of few days—I am speaking from my experience in similar cases—from the time it takes to get arsenic into the system, I think he must have had it in him for about a week—that which was contained in the intestines might have been taken recently—I should say he had taken if very recently before death—in my judgment the arsenic was the cause of death.</p>

                  </hi> I am the daughter of the late Mr. Nelme, by a former wife—the prisoner is my son—he was twelve years of age last Oct.—I have several sons—my father was in the habit of having arsenic in the house to kill rats—the prisoner know that—the prisoner has seen it used for that purpose—one day, the week before my father died, the prisoner asked me what arsenic was like; I said it was like flour—the conversation began by his inquiring about a lady, a friend of mine, who had taken laudanum, and he was rather surprised that she had taken it, because he thought it was poison—he then asked me about arsenic—my father kept the arsenic in a bureau, in the back parlour—I believe there were two keys to that bureau, but I do not know anything about them—it was kept locked—I knew the sugar-vase that was used in the family—I believe it was last filled on the Friday morning previous to my father's death; my mother filled it with pounded sugar—I took my meals with my father and the family—I recollect my father taking some sugar out of that bason, with some baked apples, on Friday night—the last time I remember his using that bason, or having sugar out of it, was on Sunday afternoon, after dinner, with baked apples—he gene<lb></lb>rally took a great deal with his fruit—I made some gruel for him on the Tuesday night before he died—I sweetened it for him out of that sugar-bason—I ate some of it myself the same night—I felt very sick after it—I did not vomit—I had had bad health for some time before—I remember my step<lb></lb>mother being sick on the Monday after my father died—she had taken some arrow-root—Mrs. Simpson had prepared it for her—she vomited; but I did not see her, because I was in another room—I was ill for a fortnight, and am suffering from the effects now—I was sick for three days, and was paralysed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long has your husband been dead? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two years last Sept.—he died at Hastings—he ad been rather in the habit of drinking for some years before his death—for two years before be died he was subject to epileptic fits—at the latter part of his time they increased in frequency—he died in a state of complete madness—he was thirty-seven years old—there were occasions, when these fits were not on him, that he was exceedingly violent—I did not know any other members of his family—I was in a very poor state of health previous to, and at the time of the birth of this boy—I had a good deal of trouble. and my mind was very much affected indeed—I did not notice anything particular about his head when he was born—before he was a year and a half old he had a fall on a ploughshare—he was very ill when he was first brought in, and we thought he was dead—that was not followed with any particular illness—he bled very profusely from the cut—I should think he was in a state of insensibility, as he did not cry—the cut was across the top of his nose—it was cut open, I believe—he has shown scrofulous habit lately, but I was not aware of it, since he had the ringworm in Dec., 1844—it was a very obstinate attack of ring<lb></lb>worm indeed, and lasted till Oct., 1846—I have had a good deal of trouble</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you able to say whether walking in the sleep is indicative of a disordered mind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, of a disordered state of the brain; but it may be produced by the state of the body, by a foul stomach—anything which would give rise to a disordered state of the stomach might, perhaps, cause a sensation of a disordered brain—fancying sounds in the head may be indicative of unsoundness of the brain—calling out in the sleep may be caused by a disordered stomach—it is possible that a violent blow across the nose, quite at the top, such as has been described, might cause such mischief to the brain, as to give rise to an alteration in its formation—a fall on the ice might do so, I cannot say that it would—ringworm is a species of scrofula—scrofula very often disorders the brain.</p>

               <p>the distinction between truth and falsehood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He is a very clever boy in some things—in most things he is a boy of very superior ability—there was nothing to lead me to think he did not know the difference between falsehood and truth—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—"My dearest Mother,—As you cannot come to see me, I hope you will write to me, and tell me what I ought to do to get forgive<lb></lb>ness for what I have done, for I know I have sinned against God, and I deserve to be cast into hell; but what is my only comfort is the Bible, for our Lord says, 'If ye repent I will forgive you; if ye seek me ye shall find me, for he that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out;' therefore I hope for forgiveness, for I will put on a fresh cloak, and I will cast the one I have got on off from my back; and although my sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as wool; I will cast off all my evil ways and put on better. Mr. Davis preached a beau<lb></lb>tiful sermon on Sunday; he took it from Pro. xvi., begin at the sixth verse: 'By mercy and truth iniquity is purged; for fear of the Lord men depart from evil; and after service time he told me that if I did not confess what I have done, God would not forgive me, and every one was sure I had done it; and he told me that if God was to strike me dead where would my soul go to; therefore, dear mother, I have no one to blame but myself. If I had only attended to what you were teaching me I should not have come into such a place; but Satan had got so much power over me that I had two dreams this night; I will tell them to you. I dreamed that if I did not confess what I had done God would not forgive me, and I should surely die, and that God would cast me into hell; and if I did confess it, God would forgive me, and if I turned away from my wickedness God would take me to heaven when I died: and Satan tried to make me not confess it, and that if I did confess it I should be cast into hell; but I turned away from him, and said, 'I will confess it, or else God will not forgive me; and I mean to turn away from my wickedness.' And then I awoke and perceived it was but a dream; but I soon feel asleep again, and I had another dream: it was about the resurrection. I felt so happy whilst I was dreaming it. I dreamed there was God seated on his throne, and Satan was on the left hand, and God called us all up, and asked us a question; it was an English word to make French, and those that had confessed all their sins, and had left off all their wicked<lb></lb>ness, he said to them, 'Come ye into my kingdom, which I have pre<lb></lb>pared for you;' and he said unto those on his left hand, 'Go ye into the furnace of fire prepared for Satan and his angels.' I dreamed I was happy, and you, and all my brothers and sisters; but I hope done what I am accused of. How I got the poison was this: on the 20th of Oct. grandfather went to his desk for the key of the wine-cellar to get some wine up and to look over his accounts; and whilst he was gone I took the poison out, and emptied some of it into another piece of paper, and put the other back; and then after dinner I put it in the sugar-bason; and why I did it was I had made grand<lb></lb>father angry with something I had done, and he knocked me down into pas<lb></lb>sage, and my head went up against the table and hurt it very much, and he said next time I did it, he would almost kill me; but in future I will say the truth and nothing but the truth: as grandfather said, 'Truth may be blamed, but cannot be shamed.' But if I am transported I know it will be the death of me, therefore I hope they will pardon me. What is the punishment of man to the punishment of God? It is an awful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. I dare say you will not believe the dreams, but I assure you it is the truth. With kindest love to you and all at home, believe me, ever your affectionate son, W.N.A.</p>

I am suffering very much in my mind for the number of sins I have committed, but I pray to God to forgive me my sins through Jesus Christ; but if God will not forgive me; but it makes me very miserable to think that I shall be cast into hell. I feel I am in the depth of sin in its true light. I did not before when I was at home; I gabbled my prayers over without thinking the least of them. Oh, I am an ungrateful child, but, dear mother, pass it over, and look for the future; I know my sin is very great indeed, but God is able to wash me clean through the blood of Jesus Christ. Oh, I shall be either hung or transported from all my dear friends, but, what is my comfort, I cannot be separated from that precious friend. God's will be done what punishment I am to have, but if it please him to grant me a little longer life I will endeavour to walk in his righteousness, and never to break any of the least of his commandments. Continue to offer up your prayers for me. I continue to pray for you and myself six times a day and night, as my mind stops me from sleeping. Oh, mother, comfort yourself by looking up to God. Never can I be happy again till I feel myself relieved of my sins, which God alone can wash away. I have such fancies at times, When I am reading, or lying down at night, I fancy I can see some one; and it does startle me so, and makes my heart beat so; and when I look, I see no one; and I lay down again, and I fancy I can see it again; and I get up again, and ask it what it wants. It mutters something, but I do not know what it says. I do not say it to frighten you, dear mother. I have had it like it for some time, and before grandfather's death, only I did not like to tell you of it, because I knew it was only my fancy. It is not story I assure you, dear mother. It is what I fancy. I felt quite overwhelmed to think I am such a sinful and an ungrateful child I have been to you for your great kindness to me. I can never repay you for it I am sure. It makes me very ill indeed, when I look back, I feel I shall go out of my mind at times, but I will try, by God's help, to conquer my unruly temper, I think I must have been mad to have done what I have, or else I do not think I could have done it. Mr. Goodchild was kind enough to come and see me on Saturday. He recommended me to a prayer in the Communion Service. I hope you are better than when I heard from you last. God's blessing be upon you, and bring you through this heavy trouble. I am sure I shall not have strength to bear up against it; my heart feels ready to break; but I must not murmur against the God who sends us this trouble for some good or another; besides, I have brought it all upon myself, and I deserve to suffer; therefore I can only say, 'God's will be done, not mise.' Look at our blessed Saviour; what agony did he suffer when nailed upon the tree; and yet, when on the tree, he prayed for his enemies; he never murmured. Now, again; Joseph was sold to those merchantmen. God ordered it to turn of out for some good. King Pharaoh would not have known how to provide against the famine if he had not have been sold. So you see it is very wicked to murmur against God. Let our troubles be ever so afflictive, God orders them to turn out for good. So learn to be patient. Therefore, dear mother, do not make yourself ill because of me, if I am transported. I will bear any punishment he inflicts upon me. He will help me through all my troubles, if I turn to him with all my heart. He sees me wherever I go, either in the dark or light. I will look up to him in all my troubles, and he will guide me to that heavenly kingdom where moth nor</p>

               <p>rust doth not corrupt, nor thieves break through nor steal. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Let me have the Bible. Never before this time did I value the Bible, the book I could read. I am un<lb></lb>worthy of the lenst of his mercies. I am a wicked child; but in future I will put off all my bad habits, and put on better. The sermons we have guide me a great deal, together with the Bible. One sermon was taken from Proverbs xxiii., beginning at 23rd verse: 'Buy the truth, and sell it not.' In the week he reads one or two verses out of the Old or New Testament, and then explains it to all the prisoners, which my soul I think profits by it a little. Oh, most merciful Father, forgive me all my sins, and let me find comfort in thee. Oh! I am a very great sinner, and I deserve to be cast into hell; but, Oh God! keep the devil away. Oh Lord, for thy Son's sake, bless my dearest mother, and all my brothers and sisters, and all my kind friends; and at the last bring them to thy everlasting kingdom, through Jusus Christ our Lord; and if it should pleases thee to restore my dearest mother to health, and grant that we may grow up good boys, to be a comfort to you. Oh, dear mother, when can I repay you for all your great kindness to me. Oh, I will grow up a good boy, by God's help. I do earnestly repent, and am heartily sorry for my sins, which are as many as the hairs of my head. I will ask God to blot them out of his book. I must now conclude with kindest love to you, and all my brothers and sister, and grandmother, which I hope are quite well. God bless you all. Oh continue to guide my dear brothers to the Saviour while young. Could not I see my tow brothers? Your affectionate but unhappy son, W. N. <hi rend="smallCaps">ALLNUTT."</hi>

                  </hi> I have been a medical man since 1826, and am brother-in-law of the late Mr. Allnutt. He was subject to epileptic attacks—I attended him many years—I did not attend him immediately before his death—I saw him at Hastings probably about two months before his death—he was then quite mad—I had seen him so before at times—he was a person of an extremely excitable habit and mind—I know his father (the pri<lb></lb>soner's grandfather)—he was subject to paralysis—that is a disease connected with the brain; and his two sisters are blind from a nervous disease, called anmarosis, which is, no doubt, connected with a disease of the brain—I have attended the prisoner—I saw him subsequent to Mr. Croucher, for the illness occasioned by the fall on the ploughshare—I was the regular medical atten<lb></lb>dant, but Mr. Croucher happened to be in the house—I saw the prisoner either the day, or the day but one, after the accident—nothing very particular ensued from the wound—there was a degree of inflammation—there was not erysipelas, that I recollect—the last time I attended him was for ring-worm, after they returned from Hastings, and before they went to Hackney—it was after his father's death, probably eighteen months ago—ring worm is a disease of an irritable, painful, and excitable character, it was very obstinate, it is a disease of the head, I should not like to say that it would affect the brain, but certainly the remedies may do so—the irritation of ring-worm might have the effect of disturbing an already excited and disturbed mind—he was suffering from scrofula; and at the present moment his face exhibits traces of it—he very early gave evidence of a scrofulous habit—scrofula is usually hereditary—it is so in this family, on one side—when it is hereditary, it is more obstinate and difficult to cure—I have attended him for scrofula, but only for a short time—I do not think Mr. Conolly attended him for scrofula—I believe Dr.</p>

               <p>Duesbury did—the nature and character of scrofula is calculated to affect the mind—I think it more likely to arise other causes, from the pre<lb></lb>sence of tubercles—I was not in Court when Dr. Letheby gave his opinion—tubercles are not to be ascertained, they may be suspected—I know Mrs. Allnutt's other children—the prisoner is more excitable than them, so far as my examination has gone—from my examination of him, I think he is par<lb></lb>tially insane; that partial insanity, when he was suffering from it, would pre<lb></lb>vent him distinguishing right from wrong.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you last attend him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was in the autumn of last year, on his return from Hastings—he was on a visit at my brother-in-law's—I had opportunities of seeing him—I cannot say that I considered him partially insane then—from all I have heard, and what I have seen, and acting in the way he is charged, he must he under an impulse and delusion; but I do not mean to say he always was so—I mean at intervals—I do not actually say that a boy who would murder his own grandfather, must be insane—when I saw him in prison, last Satur<lb></lb>day, he spoke of a voice inducing him to do what he was charged with, as far as I recollect—I consider that to be a delusion—I mean that I consider him to have been insane when he committed the act, not when he told me about the voices; his telling me so, partly led me to that opinion; but I take into consideration all the circumstances which I hear of him; his suffering from scrofula, and his father being decidedly insane, at the last part of his life; and the evidence I have heard; I come to the conclusion that he was partially insane when he did the act—my opinion, independent of anything I have heard about him since last Saturday, is, that he is a scrofulous boy; and I consider, from his shrieking out in the night, that the brain was certainly in a diseased state—as a medical man, I have no hesitation in saying so—I agree with Mr. Latheby, that the walking, and calling out in the sleep, may have been occasioned by an overloaded stomach—I have not seen him since last autumn—I think he may have been partially insane at the time he did it; and I think he is at this moment; and I think he is liable to become more insane, and probably will—nothing has passed since Saturday to leas me to that opinion—his skin was unhealthy in appearance; and he told me that he was often complaining of dreadful headaches; and I believed it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, practicing at Abingdon, and have been in the profession more than forty years—I am surgeon to the Berks Country Prison—when the prisoner was eighteen months' old I attended him for the cut on his face—I think I attended him three days—at that time there was a considerable degree of inflammation, and erysipelas apparently coming on—I then left him, and Mr. Payne succeeded me—I have not seen much of him since—I occasionally visited him, but not to notice him particularly—I may have noticed him a time or two afterwards—the wound was of a cha<lb></lb>racter calculated to affect the brain, it was a very serve blow, it fractured a bone which is connected with the bone of the skull—he was insensible when he was brought in—he soon came round—such an injury might produce epi<lb></lb>lepsy and derangement, but sometimes it does not show itself for years—by derangement I mean insanity.</p>

                  </hi> I am a Doctor of medicine at Clapton. In March, April, and May the prisoner was brought to me by his mother—he was suffering from indigestion and scrofula—he paid me six or seven visits of about a quarter of an hour each, during those three moths—he was suffer<lb></lb>ing from scrofula in a very marked degree—I have heard that his father died mad, and that the prisoner is in the habit of walking and shouting out in his sleep; and he has told me at his visits that he has heard voices in his head telling him to do things: from all those circumstances, and from my know<lb></lb>ledge of his constitution, I do not believe him to have been in a sane state of mind at the time this occurred—that opinion did not occur to me, to the same extent, previous to this matter, but to a certain degree it did—I entertained an opinion that he was very peculiar in the formation of his mind—there was a peculiarity and eccentricity about him which arrested my attention when he consulted me—the stated of his mind struck me—I have not had more than the ordinary knowledge of insane people, which would occur to a general practitioner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you mean that you consider him permanently insane, or liable to occasional derangement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My opinion is that it is the early stage of insanity, implicating the moral sentiments, the sense of right and wrong, and not as yet having reached the intellect in any market degree, or interfering with his judgment of right and wrong—I did express any opinion of that sort, not to that extent, until he was charged with this murder—I consider him in the ordinary initiatory stage of insanity—I have not had knowledge of his conduct, or of the particulars of his life, until very recently, so as to form a notion of how long that has existed—it is now in an early stage, and has not gone to a length to weaken the intellect in any marked degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What do you mean by a marked degree, has it gone to a length to injure the intellect, so as not to know that he was poisoning a person when he did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might know it as a principle of hearsay, but not as a con<lb></lb>trolling principle of his mind—I think he would understand that he was poisoning his grandfather, if explained to him, but at the time the sense of right and wrong was not acting with sufficient power to control him—I mean a morbid state of the moral feeling, of the sense of right and wrong—I think he knew what the act was that he was doing, but that he did not feel it as being wrong—I am speaking of moral feeling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You would consider a pick-pocket had not got much moral feeling, but do you consider when he did this that he did not know that poisoning his grandfather was a wrong act? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am not prepared to answer; I think he has not the moral sense of wrong distinguished from right, or right distinguished from wrong, to give him a moral sense of feeling; that it was an irresistible impulse on his part—I draw that conclusion from his having perpetrated this act without hesitation, or struggle of mind, or remorse, or compunction, and without any sensible object; and also another circumstance which I have heard, leads me to believe his conscience is diseased, that he could not fell it as an influential agent to distinguish between right and wrong, although his intellect leads him to understand what others tell him.</p>

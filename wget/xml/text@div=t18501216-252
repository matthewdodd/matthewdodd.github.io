On 29th Nov. the prisoner was brought there, at nine in the evening—I searched her, and found a franc and a half franc, five sovereigns, one half-crown, four shil<lb></lb>lings, three sixpences, and two halfpence in her pocket—while I was counting it she pointed to the half-crown and said the man who charged her had given it her to pay her fare home, she had borrowed the rest of the money, and was going to lend part of it to another female.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fly-master, at Brixton-hill. On 29th Nov. I was at Smithfield, and when the market was over, soon after half-past four, I went to the Crown, and while I was sitting there, two gentlemen, another female, and the prisoner, came in—I then walked as far as the public-house at the corner of the Old Bailey—the two females followed me, and they went in too, and we had some brandy-and-water together—one of the females left me, and the prisoner walked with me down Holborn-hill, as far as Shoe-lane, where I went into a house, and remained half-an-hour or twenty minutes—I was not sober; I had been making a little free—while we were in the house there were persons in and out of the room—when I left the Crown I had eight sovereigns and about twelve shillings in silver, loose in my pocket—there was a franc and a half-franc among the silver—when I left the house I came back with the prisoner to a public-house at the corner of Snow-hill, and while paying for some brandy-and-water, I missed my money, except three sovereigns and four or five shillings—while I was standing with the other female and the prisoner at the bar of the public-house, I seemed to fancy the prisoner kept touching me.</p>

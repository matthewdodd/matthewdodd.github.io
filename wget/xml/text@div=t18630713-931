                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to a lighterman, and work for Messrs. Phillips—on 3d June, I was in charge of a lighter, called the "Sarah Ward"—in the afternoon I went into St. Katherine's Docks and got on board seventy-six bags of coffee and three casks—I then "brought up" to the "Fyenord," and lay my barge alongside—I delivered there the three casks of coffee, leaving the seventy-six bags on board the barge—I then went to tea about half-past seven—before doing so, I secured the tarpaulin, and nailed it down—a man named Hitchcock was in a barge alongside—I spoke to him before I left—I came back from tea about a quarter to 9—I then saw Fitch and another man off in a skiff, and go from my punt into a red lug-boat two or three times—shortly after that they came ashore in the skiff—I had been standing about five minutes, when Finnis came and stood alongside of me—the other two men took him off in a boat—I asked them to take me off to my barge—the two men asked Finnis what I wanted—he replied, "He wants to know if you will take him off to his barge"—they said, "No, we cannot be bothered with him"—they then went to the red lug-boat and took her away—they fastened the skiff to the lug-boat—about ten minutes after, I got a boat and went on board my barge—I saw the tarpaulin had been shifted, and I missed something, but did not know how many bags—afterwards I counted, and found four bags of coffee were missing, which would be about two hundredweight—I afterwards went with the police-inspector to Newcastle-wharf, Wapping, to see the red lug-boat—it was the same—I saw the prisoners on 13th June on Tower-hill—I followed them to the Monument—I did not give them, into custody—I did not know whether land policemen would be allowed to take them, as it was a robbery on the water—I afterwards had some directions from our foreman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, in the employ of Messrs.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Finnis. Q.</hi> Could you not tell the difference between a lug-boat and a barge? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think so—the pumps of a lug-boat are in the cabin—sometimes when you are alongside a vessel there may be a dozen craft to take their turn before you—then a small quantity of goods is put across the other vessels, instead of a man waiting until his turn comes—if there is a hole in the bag the contents then sometimes drop out into the other craft—it is not common to find coffee or anything else under the boards of the craft.</p>

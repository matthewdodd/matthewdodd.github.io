I am a grocer, of 17, Angel-terrace, Peter-street, Islington—I live there, and my business is in the City—On Friday night, 22d February, I went to bed between 11 and 12 o'clock—I am not positive that I was the last person up—when I went to bed, the doors and windows were all right—I can't say that I noticed the kitchen window, it was usually fastened at night—in the course of the night, I was aroused by Mr. Harrison, a gentleman who was staying with me, who was sleeping in the back parlour—I came downstairs and found a candle alight on the kitchen table, the drawers open, the papers taken out, and everything strewed about—in the breakfast room, in the front of the house, there were three different desks broken open, the papers taken out and strewed about, and some other little things—there happened to be no money in the place—I then went up into the parlour the key was taken from one side of the cupboard to open the other side—it will open both sides—the electro plate was taken away from there—in the kitchen I found these knives, which had been taken from a shelf in the pantry—a piece of ham was gone, also some tea, some cheese, and a pair of boots—after searching the parlour, I examined the kitchen window—I found it open—it appeared to have been cut with a diamond from the outside, then a knife inserted and the catch pushed back—the window could then be opened, and the thieves could get in—a portion of the property produced is mine—it was all in my house and under my care on the night in question.</p>

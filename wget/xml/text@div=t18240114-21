            . I am a saveloy maker. I have known the prisoner a fortnight or three weeks, by seeing him about. On the 1st of January, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, he and another lad came up to me with seven rabbits and two fowls in their laps - the prisoner asked if I wanted to buy any rabbits; I gave him 1 s. 6 d. for one with three young ones. I sold them to Lovell for 4 s., between twelve and one o'clock. They came back afterwards; I bought two fowls of them for 1 s. 6 d. - I paid the prisoner the money, and sold them for 2 s. to Littlewood. They were killed afterwards.</p>

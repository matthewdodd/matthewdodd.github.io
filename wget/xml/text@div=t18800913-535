                  </hi>. I am a seaman and was living at 10, Staniforth Road, Battersea, with my wife, on the 9th August—our room was upstairs—the prisoner and his wife lived below—about 6 p.m. I heard some screaming downstairs and then I heard the front door bang to—I opened my window and saw the prisoner leave the house—he said "I have killed my wife and I am going to fetch a doctor"—I then rushed downstairs and opened the kitchen door—I saw the prisoner's wife standing in a corner of the room—she said something to me and then went to a corner of the room, picked up her baby, which was lying on the floor, and gave it to my wife—I lifted her up and put her down at the foot of the stairs—she kept saying she was dying—she then slipped off the stairs in an unconscious state—the doctor came, and about ten minutes after the arrival of a second doctor she died—the prisoner came back with the doctor—the woman had been drinking a little—I had seen her standing at the front door with her baby in her arms before I heard the screams, and she seemed all right then—the prisoner had not come home at that time—I took her to be about 32 years of age—when the prisoner came back with the doctor he said that he had kicked her, and that he supposed he had done it with the toe of his boot—he said he would own to it if he got transported and sent out of the country—before I heard the screams I heard him using very foul language to her—I heard her talking, but I could not hear what she said.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Colan—about 5.40 p.m. on the 9th August I was in my room—the deceased was at the door, with the baby in her arms—the prisoner came home about 6—after he came in I heard them quarrelling in their room—he used very bad language to her—I then heard a scream—my husband opened the window—we looked out, and saw the prisoner going along; he called out to the neighbours that he had killed his wife, and was going to fetch a doctor—I went with my husband into the kitchen, and round the deceased standing in a pool of blood—I went for a doctor, and when I returned I fonnd Dr. Richardson there.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman V</hi> 225) I was called to the prisoner's house—I found the deceased on a bed, and two doctors with her—the prisoner went for some ice, and on his return he said "If I have done anything wrong, policeman, I will go with you"—Dr. Richardson said in his presence that she was dead—on the way to the station he said when he came home from his work he found his wife out; he saw her down the street, and called her indoors, and then he said "We had words, I took up a basin of dirty water to empty, she threw it over me, and threw a knife at me, and in kicking her I threw over a can, and I wish I had never come home this day."</p>

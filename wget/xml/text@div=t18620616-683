                  </hi>. I live at Harrell-street, Bethnal-green, and am in the service of Henry Mears, a cigar manufacturer, of Great Prescott-street, White-chapel—on Saturday, 17th May I received from him a cheque for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I took to the Unity Bank, Cannon-street, to get changed—I presented it there at about half-past 1 o'clock, and received 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, and 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. odd in silver—I counted the gold first, and found it right, 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I put it in a bag by itself and put it on the counter on my left side—I then proceeded to count the silver, and while doing so I noticed the prisoner on my left side, leaning over as if he was going to hand a cheque in, and then he asked me if they changed Irish notes—I told him I did not know—Mr. Crowther asked Mr. Porter, a clerk behind the counter, about it, and then told the prisoner where he could get the notes changed—I saw the prisoner and Mr. Crowther leave the bank, and I went on counting my</p>

               <p>silver—I then looked for the gold and found that it was gone—the prisoner and Mr. Crowther had then left—I then spoke to the bank clerk—there was only one clerk behind the counter though there were other clerks in the bank—with the exception of Mr. Crowther and the prisoner, there were no other persons near me while I was counting the silver—on the Wednesday in the next week I saw the prisoner at Bow-lane station, and selected him from a number of persons.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Rose and Crowther, shipwrights, of Gun Dock, Wapping—on 17th May I was in the Unity Bank, and saw Morris at the counter, counting money—I saw the prisoner speak to Morris—he was close behind him, and said, "Do they change Irish notes here, or can I get change for an Irish note here?"—he repeated the question a second time, and I turned round, thinking it was addressed to me, and said, "What did you say?"—he repeated the question to me—and I said, "I think not, but I will ask the clerk at the counter"—I did so, and he said, "No; but you will get them changed at Spielman's, in Lombard-street"—the prisoner then left the bank, and I followed him, the boy still counting the silver—as I left, I said to the prisoner, "I think you are a stranger; if you will allow me to show you, I am crossing into Lombard-street"—we crossed Cannon-street, side by side—he said, "I will not trouble you now; good morning," and I went about my business—we had only walked across Cannon-street—he went upwards, as if towards London-bridge—I went up Nicholas-lane and Abchurch-lane, one of the lanes opposite the bank—I saw no one but the prisoner near the boy—there were other clerks at the bank besides the one I spoke to—I heard of the robbery the same evening, and went to Bow-street police-station—I was shown ten or twelve persons in a room, and picked the prisoner out.</p>

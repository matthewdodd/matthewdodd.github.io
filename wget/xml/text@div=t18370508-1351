                  </hi>. I am a corn-factor and farmer, residing at Layton-stone, in Essex. The prisoner Harden was in my employ—I observed that my horses looked particularly thin in April, and searched my corn bin, with my son, on Thursday morning, April 20th, about eleven o'clock—it has a division—one part was empty, the other had a sack in it—there are two keys to it, one kept by Harden, and one by myself—about a bushel of oats was in the sack, some white and some black—I measured them—I marked the sack, with a pencil, with two crosses on the letter "P"—the bin was locked up again, leaving the sack in it, as it was before—next morning we found a part of the white oats that had been given for the horses on the even<lb></lb>ing before by my son, but the sack was gone—I went to Harden, and asked what he had done with the oats that were in the sack the morning before—he said he bad shot them into the bin with the others, and part he had given to his horses—when I saw these oats the second time in the bin, I did not find any black oats there—we went to Hudson's—we did not find any thing there—we went to Sparks's with a search warrant, know<lb></lb>ing they were intimate—the constable found about the same quantity of oats as I had lost, and exactly the same sort, in a corn bin in Sparks's stable—he was in the yard—the constable asked if he would allow him to look over his premises, as Mr. Payze had lost something—he said, "Yes"—when he found the oats, he asked if they were mine—I said they were—he then said to Sparks, "This is a bad job; how did yap come by these?"—he said, "I don't know; I have not bought any"—he said he hoped Mr. Payze would not hurt him, but look over it—I have since seen the sack—I observed the same description of oats sticking to the sack as those found at Sparks's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son. On the 20th of last month I examined the corn-bin, about eleven o'clock in the morning—I found about a bushel of oats in a sack, and the other part of the bin had nothing at all—I measured the oats—there was about a bushel—they were white oats, with a few black ones—Lingard, my boy, came to me about twelve o'clock, for some corn for his horses—I sent about two pints of beans to Harden by him, and told him I would give him the rest of the corn in the evening—he came to me himself in the evening—I gave him two bushels of white oats, for the rest of the week, for his three horses—I had seen the bushel of white and black in the bin at eleven o'clock, and he sent the boy at twelve o'clock—that bushel was sufficient for the noon meal of these three horses—the next morning, between eight and nine o'clock, I examined the bin, and found in it a part of the two bushels I had given him the night before, but the bushel of oats that was in the sack was gone—I should think from two to three pecks of the two bushels were gone—there was no stint of the hay and chaff—they had as much as they pleased—about a peck of oats a day is given to each horse—they feed them when they please—the quantity that was gone of those oats that I sent in the evening, together with the beans, would be sufficient for the horses' food from that noon to the Friday morning, and it was rather more than we generally give—my father did something to the sack in the bin—it was found afterwards concealed behind the bin—I was present with my father at Sparks's, and saw some oats found there—they corresponded in appearance with those I saw in the sack at my father's bin—they were the same sort—he said he did not know how they came there, he had not bought any, and he hoped Mr. Payze would not hurt him.</p>

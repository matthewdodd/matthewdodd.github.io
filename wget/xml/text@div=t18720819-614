I live at 13, Umberstone Street, St. George's—about 8.30 at night, on 18th June, I was looking into a shop window in the Commercial Road, when the prisoner and two others came up—a man named James, who has been tried and got nine months', snatched my watch, and the prisoner threw me on my face—I am positive he is the man—my watch was worth 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner got away—I next saw him about a fortnight after at the police-station—I saw a group of persons, and I picked him out from about eight, I should think.</p>

I live at 37, sidney street—on 18th June about 8.30 in the evening, I was in Commercial Road—I saw Mr. Hill there and the prisoner, with two others—one of them watched the prosecutor's watch—they were on the pavement by the watch shop and I was by the gutter—they ran away and I followed with the prosecutor—the prisoner tripped the prosecutor up, and ran on and got away—I am certain he is the man—I picked him out of seven others at the station.</p>

In consequence of numerous robberies in the neighbourhood of Stepney, and of a description, I took the prisoner on the 24th July, about 3 in the morning, at John's Place—I went to the front room up stairs and rapped at the door—the prisoner's father said "Who are you?"—I said "A policeman; I want your son"—he said "He is not here; there is no one here but me and my wife"—I searched, and found the prisoner under the bed with his trousers partially on—I told him I should take him into custody for having done numerous robberies—I took him to the station; and about 11 o'clock I fetched Mr. Hill and Mr. Escott, who identified him from six or seven more.</p>

            . I keep the wheat-sheaf public-house; on the 14th Lyons came in with Kennett's wife, he was with her about two or three hours; Kennet came in and they had a quarrel about Lyons being with Kennet's wife. On the 15th, Lyons came in and asked for a glass of gin and peppermint; I served it him, he had it and went to sleep; he slept until a quarter past three. Kennet came in about half past one, he called for a pint of porter, he drank that and called for another; he said, Who is that lying on the bench asleep? Kennet went out directly he came back again; he had a knife in his hand when he returned; I did not see him stab it until I saw the blood come from Kennet's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether Lyon was stabbed? - A. There was a bit of a mark on his breast not as big as the black of your nail; there was no blood as I saw.</p>

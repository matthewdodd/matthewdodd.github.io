Deitz took a pen and ink and cast it up; he said it came to 90 l. 2 s. he said that was 90 l. payable, and we should drink a bottle of wine with the 2 s. when the goods were delivered; I agreed for ready money; they said I should have the money when I delivered the goods, but they would call at three o'clock and take away the goods; they came near five o'clock; we then went to Pemberton-row; they asked for a receipt; I asked the name, he said it was Prince; the prisoner Deitz wrote a direction, No 2, Pemberton-row, near Fleet-street; but there was a mistake, there was no number; we put the goods in a coach and went to Pemberton-row; I was to be paid when I brought the goods to Pemberton-row; we took the goods out of the coach, and Deitz said lay them down there, that was in the room below, you call it a parlour in England, I believe; there sat a clerk<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100062"></xptr> at a table with a number of books and papers; they sat there to write; Mr. Prince and Mr. Deitz called me to go up stairs, we went up stairs, Prince took out a bottle of wine, set it on the table; I said, No, I don't like wine, I like better to have my money than wine; then what should I drink, O, I like a draught of porter; well they would send for it; they drank a draught of porter, and Prince took out his pocket book; and gave me a draught, I said it was two different hand-writings; I don't understand English, and I believe that the draught is not good; this is the draught (producing it) I sat close to the table, on the other side sat Prince and Deitz; when I said I believe the draught was not good, I gave it to Mr. Deitz, he took it in his hand, and said, O you be not afraid, this note is good, it is as good as the Bank of England; Deitz then said, now you must give us change, 9 l. 18 s. I said I have not so much in my pocket, I will go home and get change; Deitz said, O no, this merchant believes you an honest man, so give your own note to pay to-morrow after tomorrow; I said I did not like that, I would go home and get change; I went directly to Lombard-street; I asked for Mr. Smith upon whom that note was drawn; one person I met told me which was the house of Mr. Smith; I shewed the banker the paper, I said I did not come for money, I only wanted to know if it was good; the banker said, my name is not John Smith; I said, does there live any

             in this Lombard-street, they said, no; they asked me how I came by this note; I said, tell me whether it is a good note or not; they said, no, it was not worth a farthing; then I went to my friend in Fox-court, Gray's-inn-lane, and told my story; he went with me to the house in Pemberton-row; when we came into the house where I left the goods, the goods were gone; the maid said the merchants were gone, and the goods were gone.</p>
               <p>That is the direction given you by Deitz in his hand writing? - He wrote it himself, but the goods were not delivered at that house, and besides there was no number.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Did I ever buy any chair of you? - You and your partner did.</p>
               <p>You swear that that man is my partner? - I cannot swear that; I never saw either of you before.</p>
               <p>What capacity did I pass in, did I pass as a hair-merchant to you; you are upon your oath, do you know the meaning of kissing the book in English? - I do.</p>
               <p>Did I pass as a hair-merchant to you upon your oath? - You brought Mr. Prince, who you said had a commission; you said you did not know the hair.</p>
               <p>Did I pass as a hair-merchant to you? - No, he said he had a commission to buy the hair, but he said he did not know the hair.</p>
               <p>Did I buy any goods of you? - You and he came together.</p>
               <p>Did I ever say that I had a commission, or that I was in partnership with Prince, or that I would pay you for it; did I make any promise to pay you? - You said Prince had a great quantity of commissions out of the country, and kept a fine house and kept his clerks.</p>
               <p>On what day was it that I first came to your house? - The 23d of July.</p>
               <p>You say I came twice with Mr. Prince? - You came three times.</p>
               <p>Can you prove that man is not the king's barber? - You called him so; I never saw the king's barber nor this barber before.</p>
               <p>You are sure it is not the king's barber? - I never saw the king's barber.</p>
               <p>When you came to Pemberton-row, who received you? - You ordered the coach to bring us there; there we left the hair below in the parlour, you and Prince ordered us to go up stairs, I never saw the hair any more; you gave an order to Prince to lay the hair down there, and I never saw the hair any more.</p>
               <p>Did I tell you that this Smith was a banker? - You said it was as good as the bank of England, that Mr. Smith lived in Lombard-street, and that was enough.</p>
               <p>Was I at that time in any superior appearance than you have seen me before or after, or did you think that I came with an intent to cheat or defraud you, or did I insinuate to you that I was any thing which I was not? - You gave me a false draught and a false direction.</p>

               <p>I am not guilty of a fraud, and it would be very hard for me to suffer for it; if I had had the least benefit by it, I must have received some remittances from it while I have been in prison six weeks; I have not heard of this Prince nor of the men who he says had connections in this parlour with Prince, and if I had any band in the fraud they would surely have bailed me out; it is my being innocently accused which makes me absolutely make these observations to your Lordship and the gentlemen of the Jury, who I hope will take the cross examination into further penetration; Mr.

             swears hard where his property is concerned, where perhaps a man or conscience or an Englishman would not have sworn so severe as he has done, for I believe putting him to his oath upon an English bible has not put him to that severity as if he had been sworn in a foreign, in a more solemn manner; if I had given him the goods or the money, he would never have staid in England to put the laws in force against a High German; Mr. Prince and the king's barber are both strangers to me; Prince came to me at the Turk's Head bagnio, he said he was informed I understood several languages, did I understand Dutch? I said I did; he said he had a commission from Marlborough to buy hair, and he would make me amends; I having been but lately discharged from Mr. Akerman's academy, and having been detained there ten months, as your Lordship knows, I thought it as well for me to condescend to be Mr. Prince's interpreter, which formerly, when I was in prosperity and kept my own chariot, I should not have gone to do that for a guinea; I not being a judge of his commission, never asked the man about his goods; but Mr. Prince said I have got an order for hair for the length of so many inches; the Dutchman said he could suit him, but he had not so great a quantity as he wanted; Prince said, let me have what you have already; he said he would write to his friend, and get some more; one Kelly, I am informed, is the man that made the wig for his Majesty; he was was then foreman to the shop who served his Majesty, and was applied to to make a wig for the king when he had his hair cut off; Kelly said, he had made the king's wig: I know no more of Prince than as a bottle-friend, by his coming twice or three times to that tavern; the goods were never delivered to me nor my care; I drank part of a bottle with them up stairs; I was not very well, I retired home and left Mr. Prince and the hair-merchant there; I saw Mr. Prince in the evening at the Turk's-head tavern; the waiter said, some of Sir John's men had been after me; I said, I would go immediately up to Sir John's office; I went there; Sir John's office; I went there; Sir John's office was shut up then, because it was late in the evening; I went to a public house the next door to the office, and enjoyed myself with a few acquaintance; I enquired for Mr. Leigh, Sir John's clerk, one of Sir John's men went and asked Mr. Leigh, if he had any thing against me; he said, if the Count comes let him be derained for a fraud; one called me our very genteely, and said, he had an information that I had been concerned with one Prince in defrauding a Dutch merchant; I said I will clear up the matter with you at any time, or take my word till the morning; he took me to Covent-garden round-house; I staid in the watch-house till morning; I gave all the description to Mr. Wright, the magistrate, that Prince might have been brought to an account, and the servant who officiated as servant to Mr. Prince; but Mr. Wright being rather prejudiced against me for appearing like himself as a gentleman, it was his intention to commit me, right or wrong, which justice Addington would not the day before; I said to the justice, he might do the devil justice which he deserved, and discharge me; Prince, and Paterson, and Bailey, and those whom he has mentioned, the king's barber and Prince, I have not heard since about them, nor have they applied to me, nor assisted me, nor do I know what is become of them, nor the hair; if there has been a fraud committed I think it would be requisite to have them advertized, and he might get his hair from them, and not from me, a man that had it not in his possession; I went with these men as an interpreter; I don't know but he is a hair-merchant: I have suffered almost two months imprisonment; I hope<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177709100064"></xptr> the gentlemen will take it into consideration that my liberty is at stake; he was fitter to have a concern in it than not; for if I had had a hundred pound in my hand I could have easily got bail; I hope you will consider me as an innocent man, and judge me accordingly.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have you any witnesses to your character?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My character is perfectly well known; it is in vain to call any witnesses.</p>
               <p>Court to the prosecutor. When you left the house, and went to Lombard-street, did you expect them to stay till you came back? - Yes, they were to stay for the change, the 9 l. 18 s.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Was not I in a dishabille; and did not I tell you, that I wanted to be shaved and dressed, and be gone? - Not at all.</p>
               <p>You did not see that I was in a dishabille? - I never look to a man's dress.</p>
               <p>Then you cannot tell that I am the same man? - O yes, I know you too well.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you ever find out whether that Prince was a hair-merchant? - I never could find out or hear any thing of him.</p>

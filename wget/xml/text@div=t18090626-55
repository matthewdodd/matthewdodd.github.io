               <p>Q. Was any body in company with him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing laying on the table or board when he came - A. Yes; the diamond bandeau.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go out with the prisoner - A. No; he went away, and his companion at the same time; about half an hour after he was gone I missed a link of a diamond bandeau; it was an entire one link; I believe it was worth about ten pounds; I do not know the value of it. I saw it again on the Tuesday morning, at the pawnbroker's; I missed it on the Sunday night.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Dobree, pawnbroker, Charlton-place, Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you part of a diamond bandeau - A. It has been delivered; I marked it before I delivered it. The lady has got it, she is in Scotland. At the time it was delivered to Cathery's master; this young man was not taken up at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. However you had a part of a diamond bandeau brought to you - A. Yes; it was offered on the 29th of May, by a servant of a lady of the name of Berresford. I know her to be so.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of a bandeau was it - A. One entire link; consisting of twenty five stones, there might be more; I lent him five pounds upon it. She said it belonged to a gentleman of the name of Hazelhurst, I gave a duplicate; that was on the 29th, in the morning. Marsden brought the ticket the same night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Marsden before - A. I had seen him in that neighbourhood before, I did not know him by name; he acknowledged that the woman pledged it with his consent; he said he would wish to prevent them from getting it out, he would have two pounds more on it. He brought the duplicate and had two pounds more on it; and had the duplicate in the name he gave me, Hazelhurst, not in his own name. I gave him the other two pounds. We received the duplicate the next day of the master of this young man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the young man present - A. I believe he was; I delivered up the link the next day to Cathery's master.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, that the link was worth more than seven pounds, as you lent that upon it - A. It was worth three or four and twenty pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the prisoner apprehended - A. On the Friday following he was apprehended, at No. 8, Suffolk-street, nothing was found upon him; he is the same man. He and the woman that sent it in the first instance; Mrs. Berresford and he were found together.</p>
               <p>Q. Which Berresford you knew - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. She pledged at your house, and you knew the person that pledged it for her - A. Yes; because I was in the habit of taking things in pledge of her.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not present when the duplicate was found - A. I believe it was sent to Cathery.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cathery. Were you present at Mr. Dobree's, the pawnbroker, and saw the same link - A. Yes; I went with my master; I saw it in my master's hands. I was in the shop, when it was given up to my master.</p>
               <p>Q. to Farrer. Do you recollect whether you produced that link to his master - A. I saw it produced.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you undertake to say that is the same link, that was produced to his master, that was received from Berresford's servant, and afterwards was claimed by the prisoner - A. I am confident of it.</p>
               <p>Q. And that young man was in the shop at the time his master had it - A. Yes; I was present. I am sure that is the same we received from Berresford's servant; and afterwards was claimed by the prisoner. We had but that one pattern in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cathery. Did your master take with him a duplicate at the time you went to the pawnbroker's - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge, where he got that duplicate - A. Yes; it was sent home to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who brought it home to you - A. No, I was out at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first information you received where it was - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see your master looking at the link, at the time you were in the pawnbroker's shop - A. I saw him look at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why is not this property produced - A. It is returned to the owner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Have they applied for it - A. Yes, my master has applied for it, he cannot get it; my master told me he had applied.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did you see me take this - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you say was the first time you missed it after I was gone - A. About half an hour; I believe it was nine o'clock.</p>


               <p>Q. What time did I call upon you - A. About eight in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. I called upon you at eleven o'clock in the morning; I drank some ale with you, and then went away - A. You did call at eleven o'clock in the morning, I went out with you, and had some ale, and afterwards you went away.</p>


               <p>COURT. Did he come to you again in the course of the day - A. Yes; about eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen that link of the bandeau after he called upon you in the morning - A. It was a link that I was not at work at.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen it in your possession - A. I do not know exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was in your lodgings - A. Yes; I saw it on the Sunday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether you had seen it in the morning, after the time that you went out to drink with the prisoner - A. I cannot say, now.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you saw it that Sunday morning at all - A. Yes, it lay on my work board.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you recollect whether you saw it on the work board, after coming home from going out with him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body called on you afterwards in your room that day - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body come with him in the morning at eleven o'clock, when he came and asked you to go out and drink with him - A. Yes; it was the same person that called with him in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether any body else had called after you came home, till eight in the evening - A. No, nobody else, while I was at home.</p>

               <p>Q. But you had been out, had you not, who did you leave in the room - A. Nobody; I left my room door locked, and the key in the door; when I came back I found the key in the door, and the door locked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Who did you first issue out this warrant against - A. I had it for you, and that other young man; I do not know his name, nor nobody else.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in a course of intimacy with Cathery for seven or eight months back; I was unfortunately arrested for debt, he came to see me in Newgate; he gave me an invitation to come to his place when I came out, if I had no other place to go to; I told him I should be out on Friday, I wanted some money to supercede my action; he sent me one pound ten shillings. I went to live in Vinegar-yard,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260049"></xptr>at the back of Astley's theatre. On Sunday morning I called upon him, I told him I wanted some money, to go and see my friends; he lent me some shillings; I called again in the evening, he told me that he had no money by him, he would call upon me in half an hour, tell him any place I would meet him; I told him I should be in Vinegar-yard; he there came to me, told me he had no money; he lent me the diamond bandeau. I was to bring it him on Tuesday morning; he called on me on Tuesday, he asked me whether I could take it out, I said no; he said I must send him the duplicate, he must take it out. I sent it to him in a two-penny post letter.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cathery. Did you know this prisoner any time - A. Yes; I have known him about half a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you lent him any money - A. Yes, I have often lent him money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he asked you to lend him any money about this time - A. He asked me to lend him some on Sunday morning, at eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you lent him any - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he want you to lend him some more money - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any more money to lend him, if he had wanted it - A. No; only a few shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, mind you are upon your oath - did you give him the link of this bandeau, for the purpose of him raising some money upon it; and that afterwards he should return it to you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. For him to pledge it, and to take it out in the course of a day or two, if it should be wanted - you are upon your oath. - Are you certain that you never lent him that link of a bandeau, to go and raise money upon it - A. I am certain I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to him to a house in Vinegar-yard at the back of the play-house - A. Yes; I went after him there, after I missed it. I found him there after I missed the link. I asked him if he had the link, he said he had not; and if I would go home, he said I should find it on my board. I went home; I looked for it. I could not find it. On Monday evening I received the duplicate, it was enclosed in a letter; I have the letter here; there was nothing written in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He offered before the magistrate, that if I would pay the expences, he would let me off.</p>
               <p>Cathery. I said if I had my property, it was all I wanted of his friends.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Here is Mr. Johnson that heard the same.</p>

            . I formerly was clerk to Messrs. Bennett and Greaves. I have chambers at present at Staple's Inn. I am assisting a friend of mine, who is an attorney.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the prisoner - A. I have seen him while he was a debtor in Newgate; I was requested to attend before the magistrate at Marlborough-street, by some friend of the prisoner's; I attended there, that if I could assist the prisoner, I would. I heard the prosecutor say there, that he did not wish to prosecute if he could have his expences paid, that he had been put to; and the expences of the office. In fact, I saw the prosecutor yesterday; I asked him if he was of the same opinion to let the prisoner off, if it was possible, he said yes, if he had the money, he did not wish to prosecute; a bill of exchange of ten pound, to pay the expences, and the taking out the diamond bandeau, is put in some person's hand to know the event of the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. to Cathery. Has a bill been put into your hands in order to pay the expences - A. There is a bill, it was given to Mr. Magnes, a surgeon; that if the prisoner was acquitted, I was to be paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Who proposed to give such a bill - A. The prisoner's friends. I always said that if I had my property, I did not wish to hurt him.</p>

I am a bag manufacturer, of 65, Fore Street—Burnes was in my service eighteen months—I do not know Keogh, I never saw her before this charge—Burnes had woes to the warehouse—I placed unlimited confidence in her, and set her to look over others, and keep the keys—in consequence of a communication from last witness I spoke to the police, and about thirty bags were afterwards shown to me at the police station, which I recognised as mine I had not authorised anyone to take them off the pro<lb></lb>mises—there are some linings inside one of them; they would not be sent out or sold—I have lining similar to it—I have a son—he left for Sydney five weeks to day—these linings were out out by me since be left the value of the bags altogether is between 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—they are all finished off except the handles.</p>

On 18th December, in conse<lb></lb>quence of information, I went to 65, Fore Street, and saw Mrs. Lazarus—I often saw Burnes—I said to her, "Martha, you know me as a police officer, what have you to say in reference to a bag that you took away this after noon "t"—she said, "I took no bag," I said,—"It is no use saying that, for I know better, you will have to go with me to the police station, put on your bonnet and shawl"—she went into the kitchen to do so, and took up a knife off the table and endeavoured to out her throat—I prevented her she said she would die before she would go to the station—after speaking to her about it, she went to the station—four billings and three billings were</p>

               <p>found upon her—after she was locked up I went to 13, Cumberland Street, Curtain Road, and there saw Keogh; it is a private house—she and her husband live on the ground floor—I told her I was a police officer, and had called in reference to a bag that was brought there that afternoon by a young woman—she said, "My dear soul, I have got no bag here"—I told her I knew different from that—after some time she produced a carpet bag similar to this, from a cupboard—I said, "Have you any more"—she said, "No"—I told her I should search the place; and in boxes, and in cupboard, and underneath the bed, in different parts of the room, I found sixteen carpet bags, nineteen black bags, and six bundles of bag handles, a quantity of lining; and in a box I found this pencil case, a pair of boots, a scarf, and numerous other articles—the bags were all new—they were concealed, and many of them sewn up in bundles—three or four sewn up in old rags and aprons, and stowed away in the cupboard, and some in the bottom of boxes where women's wearing apperal was—Keogh is married her husband was present at the time—I asked them what they had got to say—she said she had taken them in for the young woman, to mind, and her husband knew nothing about it—the bill against the husband has been thrown out.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Burnes' Defence.</hi> She was out at a days' work when I took the bags to her; she did not know anything of them. After they had been there a week she asked me where I got them. I told her that Mr. Lazarus owed me money and I got them instead. Mr. Lazarus gave me the bags for the money I had lent him to pay his mother's workpeople while she was away. I demanded my wages several times, and she would not give it me, and I left her because she did not allow me half enough food, and kept me up late at night to let her sons in, who kept such late hours. She owes me money now.</p>

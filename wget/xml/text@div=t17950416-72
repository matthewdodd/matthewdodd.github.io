               <p>Q. You live in NO. 13, Little Moorfields. It is your house? - It is. I let the shop to my mother-in-law, who keeps the shop. When the girl went of the errand, I sent her off; she came up with fears; I asked her what was the matter? she said, she was sure there was somebody in the kitchen; she heard the things all rattling, and had felt somebody's hand feeling about the wainscot. On that I asked her where the key was? she gave it me, and I took a candle, went down and unlocked the door, and unlocking it, the two prisoners at the bar were fixed with all attention to look me in the face, which they did. On that, as soon as I see them, I said, you are two fine lads. I had scarce got the words out of my mouth, when Greelow momentarily knocked the candle and candlestick out of my hand. The candlestick was found at the stairs foot, and the candle trod upon. Instantly he tried to get by me in the dark. I drew back to the narrow part of the passage to hinder them coming by me, and called for a light. When the light came, I see them both standing before me; I took them both by the collar, one in one hand, and the other in the other. I asked them what they did there? they told me they thought it had been Mr. Warren's, the green-grocer's, which is in Fore-street; at that time the alarm was given, and the watchman came, and I was going to represent the circumstance to the watchman; says he, will you give any charge of them? I said, yes; and he took one in one arm, and me the other, and went to the watch-house with them. Then after that the constable asked me if I had lost any thing? I said, I could not tell. I went and took the watchman with me, and searched the room. When we came there, we found the things off the mantle-piece, all laying about the floor, and the cupboard doors all wide open, and these candlesticks by the door close under the chair which was on the mantle-piece, and a tinder-box and other things removed, here are three candlesticks which were removed from the mantle-piece, to the corner of the door. The watchman took Millard, and I followed with Greenlow He begged me not to take him to the watch-house. The constable searched them; there was a silk handkerchief found on each; one had a pair of hooks, which went by the name of Barrington's hooks, and nine shillings were found on them.</p>

               <p>Q. Why did you take the handkerchiefs off the prisoners necks? - Because I took them to search them and Alderman Langston told me keep to them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Greenlow. I was going down to my father's house, and my father sent me to Mr. Madden's, in little Moorfields. Going along, I met with this young lad and he asked me what was the clock? and I told him, I did not rightly know; and he asked me to go into this house, to get some bread and cheese. Directly we went in, somebody locked the door, and we were very frightened, and by stamping with our feet, Mr. Catmer came down, and he said we knocked the candle out of his hand; it was no such thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Millard. I was going along, I left my master, who is an hackney coachman on the stand; going home, I met this boy, and he asked me to go and buy some bread and cheese. I went us, and felt along for the door and somebody shoved me into the place.</p>

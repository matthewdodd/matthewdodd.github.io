                  </hi>. I am a stockbroker, and reside at 57, Harley street—on Monday night last, about 7 o'clock, the night of the ball, I was in Cheapside, and just by Queen-street I missed my watch—I did not feel anything; it had been taken from the swivel—the bow of the watch was broken—I looked about in the crowd, saw a man I suspected, and kept my eye on him—it was not the prisoner, but he called to the prisoner, who came up to him quite close, they then separated, and I followed the prisoner, and saw my watch in his hand—I was then within a yard of him—I came to a policeman, and gave him into custody—the policeman afterwards showed me my watch—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I had it safe in my pocket before.</p>

The prisoner was given into my custody by Mr. Charlesworth—he said that he believed the prisoner had got his watch—at that moment I saw a motion of the prisoner's hands, as though he passed something from one hand to the other—I endeavoured to seize his hands, and from his right hand he dropped this watch on the ground—I took him to the station, and Mr. Charlesworth charged him.</p>

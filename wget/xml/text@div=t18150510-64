            . I belong to the Police office Bow-street. I was going up Holborn on Wednesday the 10th of May about a quarter past eight in the evening, I saw the prisoner walking before me nearly seven yards, I did not know him before. He had got this pot of honey wrapped up in his great coat, and this cloth hanging about six inches from the great coat. I saw him lift it up two or three times under his arm, apparently as if it was heavy. With that I stepped up to to the prisoner and asked him what he had got there he told me he had got something that he had brought from his sisters, No. 330, Holborn-bars, I asked him what the things were, he said, he had come honestly by them, he was going to take them to his brother; I told him I must see what it was, so he might as well tell me; when he found I was going to examine the bundle, he told me it was a pot of honey. I told him he must go along with me to his sisters, for I did not believe the story he had told me was correct. As I was crossing the road towards Turn-stile, I told him he might as well tell me the truth, he told me he brought it from Mr. Corbyn's. I then took him to the office; I searched him, but found nothing particular about him. I afterwards went to Mr. Corbyn's with the honey, and it was claimed. The apprentice was watching him the whole of the time, but being a quaker he did not swear to it.</p>
               <p>- TEARING. This honey is the property of Mr. Corbyn, I am sure it came from the shop, twenty-seven pounds, it is worth about thirty-one or thirty-two shillings; there was such a not missing; the hand writing of young Mr. Messer is on it, it was on it when it was taken.</p>

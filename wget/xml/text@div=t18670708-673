                  </hi> I am a builder, and reside at Trafalgar Villa, Hackney—on the 20th June, about a quarter-past ten p.m., I was driving my horse and cart in the Pownall Road, Dalston—three men stopped me; one seized the horse's head, one climbed up behind, and one in front; one of them struck me in the face and broke my nose—I do not remember anything else until the prisoner was brought back to me—I could not swear to any of the three—I was insensible for some time—my gold watch and chain was picked up on the spot by a woman, who gave it to me—this is it'(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

                  </hi> I reside at 34, Powuall Road, Dalston, and am a clerk—about a quarter-past ten on the night in question I was standing in front of my house—I saw the cart being driven very quietly along the road; then three men came up; one stopped the horse, one jumped up behind, and the other got up at the side—I heard the sound of blows, and I saw the prisoner striking the prosecutor—the prosecutor was hurled to the ground—I rushed in amongst them, and the men ran away—I ran after the prisoner, and, after chasing him about a quarter of a mile, caught him; I never lost sight of him—he said, "Don't grasp me so hard; what do you want with me? "—I said, "You are my prisoner, and must go back with me, and I will hand you over to the local authorities"—I sent for a constable.</p>

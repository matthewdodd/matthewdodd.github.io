               <p>Court.

               <p>Was you or was you not alarmed when he made this charge on you? - The first time I was very much, I did not know what I did.</p>
               <p>Did you part with your money on account of that alarm? - No, Sir, for the sake of my character, that he should not scandalize my character.</p>

               <p>I am master of this young man, he has lived with me between eleven and twelve years, and I always found him very honest.</p>
               <p>Court. We do not ask you his character Sir, do you remember the prisoner at the bar? - Perfectly well, I never saw him till the morning he was taken before the magistrate, I was in a little room adjoining the Chaplain's room, having my hair dressed; the prosecutor brought in that note to me, and desired me to look at it, I desired him to wait half an hour or so, as I was quite in a dishabille or else I would have flew out myself.</p>

               <p>The first time I ever saw that gentleman was one night; I was centry in the Engine court in the Park, that was in June; he came to me just as I had come on centry at ten; he asked me what it was o'clock, I told him, he said it was rather a wet night, and we began to discourse about one Mr. Plumbtree that he had known, and I was there about fourteen or fifteen months; he stopped with me till very nigh twelve, till the relief came in; he asked me to come in, as soon as I came off centry, and he would give me some ale, saying a soldier's pay was very little, and he thought it would be very acceptable; I went in and sat with him till very near two; he made a fire, and gave me some ale and some bread and cheese; he said he must go to bed, he told me to call any time I came on guard, I was welcome to some ale, but to call between ten and eleven at night, for if I came there in day time there was somebody there; and he had generally the evenings to himself, I accordingly bid him a good night, and said I would call again as he had behaved so well to me, I thought it very good natured of the gentleman; I called about three or four nights after, and knocked at the door, and he came to the door, and he said, ah! is it you, how do you do, you may walk in; he asked me to sit down, he brought out a bottle of ale; he put his hand in his pocket and gave me a breast buckle: after that, he said he would put a faggot on the fire-place, and make a fire; I sat with him till between one and two, and then I said I would go home, I told him where I lived; he said he would contrive for me to lay there all night; I said I was much obliged to him; he said, if you will undress yourself I will make the bed; but you must get up early in the morning; I went to bed, and after I had been in bed a little while, he began to act as a Sodomite to me; the same as a man would, if he had a woman in bed with him: I immediately jumped up, I asked him if he gave me this breast buckle and this beer, and asked me to come in at this late hour of the night, to intice me in the same situation of life that he lived in himself; he said, no, he did not try to intice me at all; he begged and prayed he might not have his character exposed; I swore I would have him taken up; I said at last when he begged so very hard, I would not; he said, for my goodness he would make me a present; he said, says he, I will give you three guineas, I will give you two to night, and at half past eight to-morrow morning, I will give you another guinea; he said he had no more than two in the house, and he took them out of a corner cupboard in a pretty large room; and, if I would come in the morning, he would give me the other; I said mind, I do not demand any thing of you: In about a month I came again, and brought that piece of paper with a young fellow that was with me; I have a man here that will shew the breast buckle that he gave me, (The breast buckle<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178307230019"></xptr> produced by

               <p>Did you go with him to the palace the 11th of July? - I do not recollect I was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentleman, there was a case of this kind tried before me some time since, and on that case it was the unanimous opinion of all the Judges of England, that that case as proved, amounted to a robbery: To constitute the crime of robbery, it is essential, that money should be taken from a person, in the presence of another, or against his will, and under such threats and circumstances, as may induce a reasonable man to part with his money through fear; in the case I mentioned, there were different circumstances from the present, because it was there sworn by Mr. Fielding, that he apprehended danger to his person, if he had not delivered the money at the same time; there was another charge like this where the fear went only to loss of character, and in the discussion of that case, it was the opinion of the Judges, that any threat which induced a man to part with his money against his will, was such as would constitute the crime of robbery: Now in this case you are to consider, that Miller, according to his own account has acted a very indiscreet part, for he says, that he never saw the prisoner before; and yet he is such a dupe, according to his own account, that from a conversation that happened in the course of a few minutes, while he was lighting his candle, he thought fit to ask this man into his master's apartment, and there to treat him with bread, cheese and ale. (The learned Judge then stated the rest of the evidence, and the Prisoner's defence as before mentioned, observing there was a remarkable circumstance in the defence, for the prisoner says, when the prosecutor offered him a present; he told him, Mind I do not demand any thing of you.)</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, upon the whole, the material question is, whether you are upon this evidence satisfied; first that Miller speaks truth; and then whether upon the facts he has stated, you are convinced that he parted with this money against his will, and through fear of an injury that he might receive to his character from the prisoner. If you are of that opinion, you will find him guilty; if you think otherwise, you will acquit him.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Corporal. Was the prisoner ever in the black hole? - Yes, a little before that time, I forget the day, I think he was kept there forty-eight hours.</p>

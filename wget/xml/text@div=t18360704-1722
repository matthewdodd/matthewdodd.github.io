I am the prisoner's wife, and live in Cinamon-street—he is a coal whipper—last Saturday week he came home about eleven o'clock at night—he asked me if his daughter was in—I have known him to be mad for six years last March—he has been in a lunatic asylum at Hoxton—I told him I did not know whe<lb></lb>ther she was or not—I asked him what was the matter—he said nothing—he then took hold of me, threw me down on my back on the floor, and clapped his knee down on me, but I did not see the knife till he was drawing it the second time on me—he took up the knife a third time, he struck me twice with it, and the third time I caught hold of his hand, and God Almighty assisted me to hold it—I cried out "Murder," and there was a young couple in bed who came and assisted me—they took him off me, and took the knife out of his hand—I was taken to the station-house, and they sent me to the London Hospital—I was hurt</p>

               <p>under my left breast, and on my knee—it was a spring knife—one that opens and shuts—he has been in a lunatic asylum for four years—he only came out three months before this—he was at Hanwell four years—he was as mad the day he came out, as he was the day he struck me—he was in Peckham madhouse twelve months before that—let any gentleman examine his body, and they can see what he has done to himself in Peckham madhouse—I have been married to him twenty-five years last February—he first began to be disordered in his mind six years last March—he got quite raving in his head, and went as naked as possible 300 yards along the street, he was taken away that day to Hoxton, and continued there a month, and he was as bad the day he came out—he scalded me about a fortnight or three weeks afterwards—he was twelvemonths at Pockham, he went there a fortnight or three weeks after he came from Hoxton, and was not out long before he went out stark naked naked into the street—the parish of Wapping brought him out every time he came out—I wanted the gentle<lb></lb>men to give me a certificate to certify he was mad, and they would not give it to me.</p>

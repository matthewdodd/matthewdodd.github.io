The Prosecutor depos'd, The Prisoner's Mother lodg'd in the House, and that the Prisoner coming out of Service, lay with her Mother; that sending his Maid up Stairs, she came down, told him his Chamber Door was open, and that, upon examining his Drawers, he missed the Money in the Indictment; that upon his making some Stir about it, the Prisoner took a Coach, and went to Westminster. The Maid Servant depos'd the same, adding, That she saw the Prisoner at that Time in her Mother's Room under a seeming Surprize at her coming up, and that there was no other Lodger in the House, at that Time, but the Prisoner. Another Evidence deposed, She saw the Prisoner lay out 11 Guineas and a Half, in Cloths a Day or two after. Mrs. Tatam depos'd, that being ill one Day, she lay longer a Bed than ordinary, the Prisoner open'd the Door, and was coming in, but she asking her what she wanted, she went away again, and said nothing, and telling her Husband of it, she found the Door was lock'd, at that Time, and her Husband had the Key in his Pocket. The Prisoner deny'd the Fact, and the Evidence not coming up to a clear Proof, the Jury <rs id="t17230227-5-verdict23" type="verdictDescription">

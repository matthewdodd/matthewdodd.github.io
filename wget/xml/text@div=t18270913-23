I think he really was drunk, for he had a bottle of cherry brandy in his hand; the trunk was not opened; I did not wish to detain him, but the porter of the Inn would.</p>

I saw the prisoner take the trunk up in the yard; and thinking him a passenger, I asked if I should carry it for him; he staggered, and appeared drunk; he said No, he could take it himself - I led him by the window, fearing he might fall through; when it was missed I went and took him by the arm, and said he must come back; he said very well.</p>

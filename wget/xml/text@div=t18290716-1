            . I am a Police-officer, at Marlborough-street. On the 2d of July I was employed by Mr. Pollard to examined this house, which I did; I saw the cabinet in the drawing-room - the property must have been taken out by means of a false key; the lid appeared as if a chisel had been used, but had not succeeded - I opened it with the key in her ladyship's presence; I afterwards went down in the wine-cellar, and found the door of that had been forced open; I then went to No. 4, Johnstone's-place, Marylebone, and inquired if they could tell me where Mr. McNamara's servant was, as I had a parcel for her to take into the country - upon that Ann Delany came down stairs; I asked her for Bridget - she said she would take me to her daughter's lodging in Kendal-mews; she did so- I did not find Bridget there; I then asked where she thought she was; she said very probably she was gone to her sister's, which was four or five miles from town, but she did not know where it was - in about half an hour I went back to Kendal-mews alone, and found the two prisoners in the room with a young man named Phillips; I called Phillips on one side, having understood he was in Mr. McNamara's service - I afterwards told Bridget that in the absence of her Ladyship her cabinet had been opened, and a watch and other jewellery taken away - this was in the hearing of Ann; she said she knew nothing of it - I immediately afterwards observed her whispering to her mother; I could not hear what was said, and I said they must come with me to Mr. McNamara's immediately - on coming out I locked the door, and put the key into my pocket;

             walked away without saying any thing - I took Bridget and Phillips to Mr. Pollard's; I left Bridget in the custody of Pollard while I took Phillips to the watch-house - I soon returned to Pollard's, and from information I afterwards received, I asked Bridget to return with me to her lodging, and asked her what she had done with the box which contained the jewellery; she said she would take me to Kendal-mews, and give it me - I neither threatened nor promised her; this was on the road there - when we got there, she showed me a key; she said that was the key of the box, but she dare say her mother had taken the box away, as she could not find it, for she had whispered to her mother, and told her to taken it away; I said "Was that what you told your mother when you whispered?" she said Yes; I left her at the lodging with Mr. McNamara, who had gone with me, and I went to Johnstone's-place in search of Ann Delany - she was not there; I got information, went back to Kendal-mews, and found her there with her daughter - she was looking over several things; I asked her where the box was; she then said to her daughter."What! you have not been telling any body about it - don't mention any thing about the young man;" at the same time holding her fist up to her daughter; the daughter said, "Let them have the box," she fell on her knees, and implored her mother to give the box up - the mother said,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182907160004"></xptr>very well, she would go and get it, telling me at the same time to stop behind; I told her No, she was in my custody, and I must go with her - she took me to Johnstone's-place, up two pairs of stairs, and reached down a key which hung over the fire-place - she took me down stairs into the yard, unscrewed the staple of the wash-house door, and behind that door was another small door, which she unlocked with a key she had taken from up stairs; I said, "What, are the things here?" and was going to stoop down to search for them - she pushed me aside, and said,"No, I hid them, and I can find them;" she then searched among the rubbish, and gave me this box, which contains a gold seal, a topaz brooch, a gold chain, a locket, a pair of gold ear-rings, and two other brooches - the neck-chain and locket were in a small pill-box, on the lid of which is written, "Lady Charles Bentinck;" I saw her endeavouring to conceal something - I asked her what it was; she said Nothing: I then took from her, out of a leathern apron, which she was in the act of throwing away, this box, containing a pair of buckles; I asked her who they belonged to - she said to her daughter - that her daughter had them given to her by Dr. Hill, who she had lived servant with three or four years ago; I then took the things in my possession, and took her to Kendal-mews; on the road I asked her how long it was since she had concealed the two boxes in Johnstone's-place; she said, "Three or four days ago;" when I arrived at Kendal-mews, I took her and her daughter on to Marlbourough-street Office, and on the road there I asked Bridget, in the hearing of her mother, if the box was in the room when I first got there - she knew I had found it then; she said that when I first came the box was on the table under the window, and that when she whispered to her mother, she told her to take it away, and that her mother returned when she left me, put the window up, and took the things away; the mother then said, that when I went away with Bridget and Phillips she had returned, pushed the window up, and took the things away to Johnstone's-place - I took Phillips to the office, and afterwards returned to Kendal-mews with Ballard, and on searching the room found several pairs of drawers, pantaloons, and waistcoats, on several of which was the name of the late Lord Bentinck; they were remanded till Friday - I took Ann to the New Prison myself, and on the road there I asked how long ago it was since she had received these things of her daughter - she said six or seven weeks ago, two days before Mr. McNamara came to live in her ladyship's house; she said she had been very uncomfortable ever since she had had them, and was afraid to offer them to pledge, or to dispose of them, for fear of being found out - Bridget told me at the second examination, that she had done it all herself, and she had been very uncomfortable; she seemed in great trouble - she said Phillips saw the things lying about, called her up stairs, and said, "Take these things, for her ladyship will never miss them, and if I were you I would take them;" she said they were lying about the room; Phillips is committed for re-examination to-morrow - we have been able to trace nothing to him, except what she had said, and that she has contradicted since.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . On the 12th of this inst. the prisoner came to me with these pails. The man had them in a bag upon his back, and the woman offered them to sell as old copper; I said, I suspected them to be stolen, and that they were made for the government. She said, she had them from her brother<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174501160005"></xptr> in New-England. I stopped them, and said, if they brought any body to shew they came honestly by them - they should have them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you stop the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Scotting. I was going on board a ship about some business, and left the prisoners with my man - Dobbings told my man he would go and fetch his landlady to the character of his wife - that she came honestly by them. But before the Justice he denied she was his wife. My man, while I was gone, found out the marks. I went down to Greenwich, and heard that Dobbings had been a <rs id="t17450116-5-deflabel25" type="occupation">pensioner</rs>

               <p>Dobbings. I went with Holmes to sell them; she told me she had them from her brother in New-England. I knew no better. I did not know there was any mark upon them.</p>

               <p>Holmes. On the Saturday morning between one and two he went out with a bag, and said he was going to move some goods. He came home between 5 and 6 with these pails. I asked him how he came by them; he sa id he had them by chance.

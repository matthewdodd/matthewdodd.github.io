               <p>On the 16th of December at about 9 o'clock at night I met with the prisoner; she asked me if I would give her a glass of gin; we went into a public house, I took out two half crown pieces and a six-pence; I paid the woman for the quartern of gin and gave her the threepence halfpenny; then she asked me if I would take a walk; I said I did not care if I did; then she took me into an entry and laid hold of me round the waist; I found her hands in my pocket, but I had no thoughts of her taking my money till I missed it.</p>
               <p>Was not you stronger than her? - I did not try for that; then she said the watchman was coming and would take me up; I charged the watch with her; the constable examined her and found one half crown in her pocket and the other tucked in her hair.</p>

               <p>I am a constable: on the 14th of December between 9 and 10 o'clock in the evening the prisoner was brought to the watch-house and searched there; the prosecutor accused her of taking 5 s. out of his pocket; I found one half crown and a shilling only in her pocket; when she had put on her cloaths I observed another half crown stuck in her hair.</p>

               <p>I had but one half crown about me; I had a half crown in my hand; I was lifting up my hat; I had been hard at work; for I have three small children to maintain; the person I lived with some years is gone to America; he said if I would give him one half crown piece I might keep the other; I had no more than my own money; the beadle behaved very indecent to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to William James Benson, of Lud-gate Hill, watch manufacturer—on Tuesday, 22nd December, about 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came in and asked to look at some charms—I handed a tray of charms out of the window, and placed them before him—I partly turned round to close the window, keeping my eye on the goods at the same time, and whilst I was partially turned away, he lifted up a seal and key with his right hand and throw it down his left sleeve—I immediately turned to the counter and asked him to give me the seal and key that he had in his sleeve—he said "I have not got one"—I said "I can see it inside your sleeve"—he still said he had not got one, when I caught hold of him by the wrist, and in the struggle it dropped out on the counter—I drew the attention of the shopman who was standing next to me, and asked him if he had seen what had happened—he said he had, and I immediately sent for an officer, and gave the prisoner in charge.</p>

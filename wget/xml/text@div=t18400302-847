                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. James Cuff Pearce, a hosier in Oxford-street. On the 21st of February, shortly before one o'clock, the prisoner came and wanted a pair of woollen gloves—I showed him some—they were too small—I then showed him some leather ones—he said they were too large, and asked if I had any others—I said, "No"—he then said he would leave 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on a pair of leather ones, as he had not sufficient to pay for them—he gave me a sixpence—I went to the till, and told him I had no change—he said he would leave the sixpence, and call again—I noticed he was putting some silk handkerchiefs by the side of him—he asked me the price of them—I made him no answer—he left the sixpence, and as he was going away I went before him, and said I thought he had more than he ought to have—he proceeded to the counter again, and took off his hat, and took three silk handkerchiefs out of it, and laid them on the counter with some others—I struck the floor with my foot, and my master came up—I told him what had happened—the prisoner de<lb></lb>nied it—an officer was sent for—these handkerchiefs are worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Marsh-street, Walthamstow, and am letter-carrier for that district. On Saturday, the 14th of Dec., my collection was the half-past three o'clock, called the three o'clock—Reeves, another collector, takes the half-past twelve o'clock, and Wilson the half-past eight o'clock in the morning—they are called the eight, twelve, and three o'clock collections—I know Mrs. Carter—on that Saturday I saw her at the Cock public-house, Marsh-street—she spoke to me about a letter she had sent—I did not go to the prisoner that day in consequence of what she said, I went on Monday afternoon, the 16th of December, about five o'clock—he is the letter-receiver at the post-office, Marsh-street—I said to him, "I have an inquiry to make, at the request of a lady, concerning a foreign letter, whether the charge of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was correct, and whether you sent a boy for the extra 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or not"—he said it was quite correct, "I did send a boy, I sent my own son"—he said, "Oh! Mrs. Carter"—I replied, "Yes, Mrs. Carter"—he then showed me a paper stuck on the wall, that I might see that he had charged correctly for the letter—I replied, "Very well"—he requested me to come round the counter to look at it—I said I could see it—I told him the lady seemed very particular, or anxious, to know whether the letter was gone or not, and asked him which collection he sent it by—he replied he sent it by me—I replied, "No, you did not"—he then said, "I sent it at the right. time, by Reeves"—I was about to leave the shop, and he said, "Please to tell the lady that I have added the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on, or else she will think I have been robbing her"—that is all that passed at that time—I carry the letters to Whipp's-cross, in the parish of Walthamstow—I did not have any letter such as is described—when I receive letters and money, the prisoner himself makes the bill, and hands the bill to me with the money—I had no letter on that day addressed to Calcutta—I had made only one collection that day, which was the half-past three, and had no such letter at that time—I delivered at Whipp's-cross all the letters and money I had, to Thomas Cox, the charge-taker—this is the bill I delivered—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—there are thirty-four unpaid letters, and fifteen paid letters, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there was one 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. letter—on Monday, the 16th, I did my duty in the same way—I received this bill and the money—there were twenty-four paid letters, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was no Calcutta letter—the prisoner puts his paid letters into a drawer under his counter—I have seen him put them there—it wai a drawer peculiarly appropriated for that purpose—I communicated what had passed to Mr. Cox, at Whipp's-cross.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the presidents of the Post-office. In consequence of directions which I received on the 17th of Dec. I went to Walthamstow with Mr. Hill from the Solicitor's office, and Peak the officer—we arrived at Walthamstow about three o'clock, and went to the prisoner's house there—he came in shortly after our arrival—I told him who I was, and asked him whether a letter had been posted there on the Saturday before for Calcutta—he said he recollected there was a letter posted that morning, the 14th—I asked him what time he sent it to London—he said he had sent it by the twelve o'clock despatch—I produced the letter bill of that hour, which I have here, and asked him whether those figures were in his handwriting—he said, "Yes"—I then said, "How could you have sent the paid letter, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at this hour, there being only nine paid letters, 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the bill?"—that appears on the face of the bill—he said, "Oh, I recollect now, I sent my son back to the party who posted the letter for 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more; my son returned with the 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. too late far the letter to be forwarded to town by the twelve o'clock despatch, but I sent it by the three o'clock despatch"—I had with me the bill for the half-past three o'clock despatch—I turned to it immediately and showed it to him, and asked if the figures were in his handwriting—he said yes they were—seeing there was only fifteen paid letters, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., entered on the bill, he immediately said, "Dear me, I must have sent it without adding the postage"—I said, "I am sure you did not send it to London"—he said, "Can you prove that I did not send it?"—I said, "I can"—he then said, "Oh dear me! I recollect now, I gave it to Holmes the postman, and forgot to put it on the bill; he said, "Oh, I recollect now, I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and half-a-crown, and he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out"—I said, "That would not make it right, for there is 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the bill, and the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the postage of this letter, would make it 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. there fore he thought to have given you 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out"—he then appeared quite confused—while this was going on Peak came into the room, and I asked the prisoner whether he had any objection to be searched—I directed Peak to search the boose—before he returned to the room the prisoner's wife came into the room, and said the letter was found in one of the drawers—the prisoner said, "Oh dear me!

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Moritz Platow and another, brass found<lb></lb>ers, High Holborn<lb></lb>Le Cheminant was in their service as fireman and brass<lb></lb>founder—in consequence of something that occurred on the 29th of Aug. I went to Mr. Pasco's cart at the end of the factory—I took from the shaft a nose—bag—it contained about 13lbs. of brass and lib. of copper—I know the metal—it belonged to Mr. Platow's firm—Mr. Pasco is the contractor for the ashes, and this cart came to remove them—it had no business to have any metal in the state in which I found this—Cummins and Pye came with the cart from Mr. Pasco's—as I returned into the factory with the nose-bag I met the three prisoners—Le Cheminant asked what I had got there—I remarked there was something wrong, and if he wished to see, if he would return to the factory he would be satisfied—they returned, and were given in charge—this metal had been taken from a bench near the furnace—I had seen some of it in the morning—I had delivered some of it to Le Cheminant to melt—the other two prisoners are servants to Mr. Pasco.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBIHSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know the metal? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We had no bolt copper but this—it is the same sort as I delivered—Le Cheminant is fireman, and has been in the prosecutor's service two years—it was his business to melt metal by the side of the ash-pit—the bench was on the left hand side, the furnace in front, and the ash-pit on the right—the fur<lb></lb>nace is about three feet from the bench—he should have been melting while the other prisoners were there—if the metal comes over it will form a cake—it very seldom goes into the ash-pit—it is not common to find pieces of metal of this size in the ash-pit—some pieces may have got in—it may have happened that pieces have come over and got hard and been kicked <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the ashpit—it is not common—I have known Le Cheminant send the boy down to get pieces out of the ash-pit—it is the duty of a melter to be always attend<lb></lb>ing to the fire—it requires a good deal of care <hi rend="italic">to</hi> see that the fire is kept to a certain height, and the metal does not boil over—a certain quantity of metal is given to Le Cheminant, and he had to account for the surplus at the end of the week—we allow for fair waste—I have had no particular disagreement</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184609210090"></xptr>
               <p>with him—there are generally jars with men in factories—I recollect his stat<lb></lb>ing that I had had a lamp from the old metal—I had it made up for my own use, and I have it in use now—that is about two months ago—he has some<lb></lb>times said, "I hope the lamp burns well," but pleasantly enough—the firm does not generally allow beer to the men who come for the ash, but the fore-man gave those men 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on that occasion—when I saw the prisoners they were going to a public—house—I think Le Cheminant has complained of Ay<lb></lb>ton several times—I believe it has reached Mr. Platow's ears, because I was ordered to look for another boy—he was what is called core-boy there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Pye. Q.</hi> You stated you saw me and Cummins and Le Chemins and going into the public-house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You were going towards the public-house—you were on the door-step, all three together—this is the metal I gave out to Le Cheminant that morning—it is stuff that would have gone into the furnace and been melted down again, not that would be put in the ashes—this bolt I de<lb></lb>livered to him, and this screw was a bad one, and I gave it to be melted again.</p>

                  </hi>. I am core-boy at Messrs. Platow's—I saw Cummins and Pye come on the 29th of Aug. to load away the ashes, and Le Cheminant assisted them—Pye went into the ash-hole to throw the things in the basket, and Cummins was with the basket—while this was going on I saw Le Chemi<lb></lb>nant take metal off the bench and <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it in the basket—not what came oat of the ash-hole, he took it off his own bench—after it was put in the basket Pye <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the ashes over it—Cummins carried it out to the cart—Le Cheminant and Pye helped the basket on Cummins's shoulder—when this large piece of brass was put into the basket, Le Cheminant said to Cummins," That is rather a heavy one."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> He made that observation as he was helping the basket on the head? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I was standing at the other end of the shop—there are two furnaces at one end, and at the other end they serve—it is not unusual for pieces of metal to be in the ash-hole, that run over from the pot, but I never knew such as these to be in the ash-hole—Le Cheminant and I have always been on very good terms for what I know—I am still in the service, I have been there twelve months—I am to remain there—no complaints have been made of me by Le Cheminant, nor to me by him.</p>

               <p>but it would be inquired into—this qdatilify of metal in a week's work would not have been missed—I do not think Ayton is acquainted with the complaints which have been made against him—it was of being late in a morning, but not for dishonesty—I think his impression was when asked about it, that his master had been informed of some dishonesty—Le Cheminant and the other men have complained of him—they work very hard, and they want him to work as fast as they do—it requires a very expeditioiu hand to ketep up with those men who work piece-work.</p>

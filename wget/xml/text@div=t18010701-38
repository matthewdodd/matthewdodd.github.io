             sworn - On the 20th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock, Hughes brought the prisoner to my house; I am sure he is the same man a black man in a sailor's dress, and about half past five in the morning I got up, and found the prisoner at the door; he asked me what o'clock it was; I told him it was half past five, and then I let him out, and as soon as he had gone out Hughes came down, and said, it serves me right, he has robbed me; he went in pursuit of him, and in the course of half an hour brought him back; we took him to the Police-office, and they would not take him in charge; then we took him to Whitechapel, and there the constable found every article mentioned in the indictment upon him.(Richard Osman, the officer, produced the property, which was identified by Hughes.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was very much intoxicated, and in the morning, being very dry, I went to a public-house to get a pint of beer; I put on his clothes by mistake, and he came after me and said I had robbed him. <rs id="t18010701-38-verdict217" type="verdictDescription">

                  </hi>. I am a shoe manufacturer, at 19, Whitecross-place, Finsbury-square—about 3 o'clock, on 4th March, I was standing on London-bridge, where there was a great crowd looking at something—I stood about two minute, walked away from the crowd, and an officer 534 attracted my attention by pointing to my watch-chain—my attention was drawn to Owen by a young man standing near, and I saw him go to Griffiths and hand him something—I went to Griffiths, and said, "Give me my watch"—he said, "I have not your watch; I have not got anything"—I said, "You have something in that pocket"—I saw him distinctly put some<lb></lb>thing into his trowsers' pocket—when Owen saw me and the officer coming towards him he ran away into the crowd—a constable near me had hold of Griffiths, and we said we would take him to the station—when we had got three or four yards the officer said, "I will see what it is," and he put his hand in Griffith's pocket, and took my watch out—the bow of the watch was broken.</p>

On 4th March, a little before 3 o'clock, I was on duty on London-bridge, regulating the traffic—I saw the last witness coming towards me, and I pointed to his watch-guard, which was hanging from his pocket—he put his hand here, and said, "I have lost my watch"—I told him to follow me—I went through the archway, and saw the two prisoners and another person standing together by a public-house—I caught hold of Griffiths, and he said, "What do you want me for?"—I said, "Hold hard a minute"—I directed another officer to follow Owen—I then searched Griffiths, and found this watch in his left trowsers' pocket.</p>

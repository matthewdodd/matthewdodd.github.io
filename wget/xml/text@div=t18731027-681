               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187310270081"></xptr>
               <p>she asked to look at some hats, and I showed her some—she selected eight and I told her the price—she said she wanted two for herself, two for the daughter who came with her, a girl about 14 or 15, and two each for two little children who were at home—she then asked me the price of some dresses which were hanging in the shop, I told her and showed her some others—she selected three dresses and five mantles—she tried one on herself and one or two on the little girl—altogether she selected goods to the amount of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; there was one mantle which we were to make for a little girl—she said she would have them sent to 61, Old Broad Street—she gave the name of Mrs. Summers, and said it was a luncheon bar—I asked her if she would pay for the things then, and she said "Oh, send the bill with them and I will pay for them then"—I made out an invoice and put a receipt stamp on it, and gave it to the porter, Hunt, with the goods, and I gave him directions not to leave the things without the money—he went away with the parcel and the invoice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was in the shop nearly half an hour—I made out the bill myself, and I made one out for Mrs. Watkins, next day when she went to try and get the money—I had got the account against Mrs. Summers in the book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mrs. Watkins—two baskets of goods and an invoice were given to me by Miss Hindley to take to 61, Old Broad Street—I went and found a refreshment bar there—it was about 2.30 or 2. 40 in the afternoon—I saw a girl about fourteen—I waited about half an hour, and the prisoner came in, she said "Are you the young man who has brought the goods?—I said "Yes I am"—she took the goods out of the basket and handed them to her daughter, who took them up stairs—I handed the prisoner the invoice, and said I had orders to receive the money or take the goods back—she said "I see there is a receipt stamp on the bill, but it is not receipted"—I said "No, I will receipt the bill when You have paid me the money"—she said "I think you had better take the invoice back, and bring it again in half an hour, and also some boxes that were ordered"—I said "You will excuse me, but my orders were to receive the money or take the goods back"—she then said "You had better wait till my husband comes in"—I waited about 20 minutes or half an hour when rather a tall fair man came in and spoke to the prisoner, and then he said to me "Oh, young man, you don't seem inclined to leave the goods, it will be all right, I will go and get a cheque, and send it on in half an hour"—I said I had orders not to leave the goods without the money, therefore I would rather wait there for the cheque or the money—he said "Well, if you don't seem inclined to leave, I will go and get a cheque and bring it on here in half an hour"—he went away—it was then about 4. 40 or nearly 5 o'clock—the prisoner was still there, I waited till about 7 o'clock, but the man did not come back—I said to the prisoner several times "The gentleman does not seem to come with the cheque, I would rather take the goods back, and bring them in the morning"—she said "I thought my husband would have been back before this; you had better wait a little longer"—I waited about ten minutes, and then I said "I see the money is not forthcoming; I am determined to have the goods and bring them in the morning"—she said "You can't do that,</p>

               <p>for I have sent them on to my house at Walthamstow"—I said "What right have you to send the goods away while I am waiting here for the money? how have they gone?"—she said that was best known to herself—I said I had better wait a few minutes longer, and she said "I shall turn the light out, and go and see if he has got the cheque"—the light was turned out, and I was left in darkness, and I left, thinking I should be locked up in the place all night—I did not consent to part with the goods at all—the same evening I went with Mrs. Watkins to the Shoreditch Low Level Station, and saw the prisoner with the same man who said he would go and get the cheque—Mrs. Watkins demanded the money or her goods back—the prisoner said "It is a fine thing to be put down as a thief on the platform; give me into custody"—I caught hold of the parcel that the man had who was with her—he wanted to know what right I had to do that—I said "I want to know whether this is a part of the goods"—he tore the paper, and I believe it contained two or three old dresses, not any of our goods—he said "Are you satisfied?"—I said "I am quite satisfied they are not our goods, and therefore I can't detain them"—and they descended the stairs hastily, and were gone—I attended before the Magistrate next day, Friday—the goods were afterwards shown to me at Guildhall on the first examination, except one mantle, which I saw on the second examination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in Mrs. Watkins's employ about six months—I generally take things out to persons when they are sent—the place I went to was one room in the basement of 61, Old Broad Street, with a chemist's shop above it—there are two staircases to the house, but they did not both come into the room where I was—Mrs. Summers was behind the bar when the tall fair man came in—Mrs. Watkins did not tell me there was a mantle ordered which had not been sent—the goods I had were 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I was to receive that or take the goods back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a milliner, at 3 and 4, Norton Folgate—I went to the Shoreditch Station at 11 o'clock, and before that Mrs. Summers was a stranger to me—next day, Wednesday, I went to 61, Old Broad Street—I remained there till 1 o'clock, and afterwards from 2 till 5 o'clock—it is a cellar, and the gas had been out off—five men came down for half a pint of ale during the whole time I was there, and one for a cup of tea, and I also saw rather a tall fair man—I did not see Mrs. Summers at all, nor my goods—I consulted a solicitor, and went to Guildhall, and obtained a warrant—I afterwards saw the goods, and they were given up to me by order of the Magistrate, and have since been sold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took a bill with me to 61, Old Broad Street—I did not present it—I put it iu my newspaper, and it was stolen, at least, I missed it after the fair man had gone—Miss Hindley put a stamp in the envelope, and the envelope and stamp disappeared—I did not miss anything else—the bill was in the envelope—I put them on the table at which I was sitting—I did not see anyone take them—I did not say anything about this at the Police Court—I told my solicitor when I saw the second bill that it must have been stolen—I missed it when the fair man had gone—I was going to demand the goods, and Miss Hindley said "Perhaps you would like a bill?" and she gave me one—I did not take anybody to carry my goods back—I will swear that I did not take the bill with the intention of giving it to Mrs. Summers, and I will swear that I don't know how it went out of my possession—I saw it before the man came in, and while he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187310270083"></xptr>
               <p>was talking to me and telling me he would give me a cheque, and I said I must have either the goods or the money—I missed it immediately he left the room—I told him I thought he had taken it, and the next day he called to say he was not Mrs. Summers's husband at all—I saw the man open the parcel at the Shoreditch Station the day before I went to Broad Street, but there was nothing of mine—mine is principally a ready-money trade, but if we send goods home and have no reference, we always expect the money, and the porter has general orders not to leave the goods—I believe that all the goods were sent that were ordered—the order was complete.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There was no stamp on the bill I took—I saw two invoices at he Police Court, in the hands of the prisoner's solicitor; that was the first time I saw the one again which I missed at 61, Old Broad Street.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Dacre-street, Westminster. The prisoner and his wife lived in the next room to us—her name is Mary Ann—on 4th Aug., between 12 and 1 o'clock in the morning, I was awoke by a noise, and then beard the prisoner's eldest girl, who is eight years old, crying, and saying, "Pray, father, do let mother come down"—the girl then came and knocked at my door; and in consequence of what she said, I and my husband went into the room immediately—I saw the prisoner's wife hanging up, with a rope doubled over the cupboard door; her feet were about a foot from the ground; her body was swinging—the prisoner was sitting on the foot of the bed, about a yard from her—her hands were up to her neck, as if to keep the rope from hurting it—my husband lifted her up in his arms, and I took a knife and cut the rope—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my husband took her into our room, and laid her on the bed—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes she recovered, and burst out crying—the prisoner remained sitting on the foot of his bed all the time—when I first went in he was stooping, as if he was undoing his boots—I think he was in liquor—I went into his room, and said he was a good-for-nothing villain to hang the woman—he said the next time he did it he would do it effectually—I said he would have done it effectually now if it had not been for the cries of his children—a policeman took him away, and the woman went down with us to the police-office.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived in the same house with the prisoner, in the kitchen, under his room. On 4th Aug. I heard something fall in his room—I got up and stood at the door, with a candle in my hand—I heard the girl say, "Pray, father, let mother down"—I went, and saw the woman hanging, with her feet off the ground, and her hands holding the rope—the little girl said, "I will give you a knife if you will cut mother down"—I said, "I cannot cut her down if you will give me the world, my dear"—the prisoner was sitting on the bed, trying to undo his boots.</p>

                  </hi>. On 4th Aug. the prisoner's daughter came to me—I went to their room, and saw a female hanging, by the neck from a top-cupboard-door, which was at least eight feet high—I could not reach the top of it—I took her up in my arms to relieve her of the weight—her feet were at least a foot and a half from the ground—I conveyed her to my bed, and laid her on it—her countenance was turning black—she did not speak for a quarter of an hour.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, B</hi> 264). I was fetched to the prisoner's house about 20 minutes to 1 o'clock, and the prisoner was given into my charge—he was drunk, and made no reply to the charge—Rigg gave me this rope—I saw the woman that night—she attended the first examination, but not the second.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did not I tell you, going to the station, that any woman or man that attempted to hang themselves, generally did it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; your wife was not in the room in my presence—I saw no water in the room.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The woman did it herself, on account of my having a little drink in me, but she threw it on me when she saw the policeman, and she got these people to go against me on account of my being a little intoxicated; her feet were not off the ground; she is five feet eight high, and the cupboard door is not high, which would leave the rope slack; although my child was heard to call out, no noise was heard in my room, which, if I had attempted to hang her, would have been the case; for a drunken man to put a rope round a woman's neck would be a difficult task; the distance of her feet from the ground was from the man holding her up, and before that time the room was in total darkness.</p>

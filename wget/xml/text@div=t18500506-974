                  </hi>. I am potman in the service of Mr. Shepherd, who keeps the Brill, in Brewer-street, Somers'-town. I went to the dust-hole about two o'clock on Saturday afternoon, 27th April, and found a purse on a shelf over the dust-hole—I should know it again—I did not open it—I took it to my master directly, and left it with him—this is it—I received it back from him in about twenty minutes—he gave me some directions, in conse<lb></lb>quence</p>

               <p>of which I put it where I got it from—the prisoner was barman there—he slept in the same room that I did, but not with me—the dust-hole is in the back yard—I saw the prisoner go to that back yard about nine the same evening—he then came back to the bar—I went to the dust-hole after he had been out, and found the purse still there—he and I slept in the same room—we got up about nine the next morning—from that time I watched the pri<lb></lb>soner—he was in the yard, about half-past nine, for about half an hour, and he was away again about eight in the evening—I saw the purse there about nine o'clock that evening—we went to bed, and got up at five o'clock the next morning—the prisoner went down first, and when I came down the back door was unfastened—there was no one up in the house who could have opened it but him—he was out in the yard when I came down—he came in in about ten minutes—directly he came into the bar I went to the dust-hole, and the purse was gone—I gave information to my master, and on that the servant maid was sent out—she returned, and after that I observed the policeman look in at the window of the private door—the prisoner was then in the front bar, and on seeing the policeman look in, he jumped over the counter and went out into Brewer-street—Brill-yard is four doors down that street—he went towards Brill-yard—he was gone about a minute—directly he got in the policeman came.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Brill. On Thursday, 25th April, I marked two half-crowns, two shillings, and two sixpences; I placed them in the till—on the Saturday, Archer brought me this purse—I opened it, and found in it twenty-eight shillings and sixpence—there was a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence which I had marked on the Thursday—Archer told me where he got the purse from, and I gave him directions as to what to do with it—on Sunday, about eleven o'clock, I marked two sixpences and one shilling, and put them in the till—they were marked in a different way to the money I had marked on the Thursday—on the Monday morning I was up at a quarter before five—from my window I had a view of the back yard, and I saw the prisoner go down in a direction to where the dust-shed is—I could see him within one yard of it—in two or three minutes Archer gave me information, and I called a female servant and sent for a policeman—I came down myself soon afterwards—the prisoner had then left—I went out at the centre door, opposite Skinner-street, that is a way from Brewer-street—I came in again, and the prisoner came in at the Brewer-street door just as I came in at the other—I gave him in charge—he was searched, but no money was found—I went with him to the station—on the same morn<lb></lb>ing, about seven, the policeman searched Brill-yard, and found this purse; I was not a great way from him when he found it—he and I went to my</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You found no money on the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> None; I told him he was a thief—he said there was law for him as well as for me, for accusing him of being so—no one in my establishment knew that I marked any money—I told the inspector after the purse was found, and advised with him—I am sure Archer did not know it—he never knew there was marked money in the purse, though he brought it to me—I did not then tell him that there was marked money in it—Archer has been with me nine months, and the prisoner three months—I put the marked money in the till at the counter where the prisoner works—that till is accessible to the head barman—Archer could have access to it—I knew by my returns that money was missed—I had begun to miss money six weeks before, in consequence of which I gave the prisoner notice to quit.</p>

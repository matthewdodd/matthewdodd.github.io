                  </hi>. I live in Crawford-street, Marylebone, and am a linen draper. The prisoner was twice in my employ, for about fifteen months altogether—on Saturday morning, the 19th of March, Mr. Atten<lb></lb>borough came and stated, in the presence of the prisoner, that he had been to his house the night before, offering this piece of lawn on pledge—I asked him how he came by it—he made no answer at first, but at last he said it was entered to him—he had no right to take any thing and have it entered to him, unless it was entered by me or the principal young man, Mr. Sharp—another piece was entered on the Saturday morning, but the piece he offered to pledge on Friday night is not entered at all—this is the piece which Mr. Attenborough was talking of—I asked him when it was entered, and he said, "Thomas entered it this morning"—this conversation was on Saturday morning—I said we ought to search his boxes, and he was quite agreeable to it—we searched, but found nothing—the prisoner then called me into an adjoining room, and said, I have lived with you a long while, Mr. Lowdon—this is the first offence—I never did any thing of the kind before."—and he wished me to let him off.</p>

It did not tell the Justice that the prisoner said it was his first offence, it was because it slipped my memory at the moment—I measured this piece at the police-office—there is seven yards and a little hit of it, I rather think—I have not my books here—the measure of this piece in the book in seven yards and a quarter—I cannot say that this is not seven yards and a quarter, because I have not measured it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman and cashier to Mr. John Lowdon. I was in the shop on Saturday morning—the prisoner called me to him—he said, "Enter this lawn to me"—he was speaking of this lawn—that is not the piece Mr. Attenborough produced—he had not then arrived—there was no one to enter it but I and my brother—I have not entered it—when he told me to enter the second one, he said, "There is 7 1/4 of it, but I do not believe it measures that length"—I said, "To be certain, we will measure it"—but, at the same time, I put down 7 1/4 yards in my book, when he told me there was 7 1/4 yards of it, before we measured it—when he measured it, he said it measured not quite 6 1/2—then says he, "It is not for me, but it is entered to me"—I replied, "It is very strange I should ester it to you, if it is not for you"—he said, "Oh, never mind, just make a memorandum of it"—I did not any thing more to it after that—he said, when I questioned him again, that he was going to Spring-street, but he did not tell me where to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a pawnbroker, and live in Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square. The prisoner came on a Friday evening, about half-past seven o'clock—I do not know whether I took this lawn my<lb></lb>self, or one of my young men; and I, seeing that he put one or two question, went up myself—he offered to pledge this seven yards and nearly one quarter of lawn—when I had taken it, I said to him, "What do you call this?"—says he "Linen"—I said, "No, it is not linen"—he said, "Cambric, aye, cambric"—he said, "No, it is not cambric, I think it is lawn—very fine Irish"—from his very confused manner I was doubtful, and asked where he got it; he said his sister bought it to make the fronts of a set of shirts—I asked the prisoner his address, he said, "No. 1, St. James-place, Hampstead-road"—I asked where he worked, he said, "That is no business of yours; if you do not like it, you may give it me back"—I said, "I cannot do that; if you will give me where you live, you many rely on my treating it with all the delicacy I can"—he then said, "I live at Bell and Bentley's, in Chespside"—I at last let him go—I went that night to Bell and Bentley's—I then went to St. James-place—I found he had lived there, but had left—I made some inquiries, and found the prosecutor—this is the piece he brought me, and which I took to his master's.</p>

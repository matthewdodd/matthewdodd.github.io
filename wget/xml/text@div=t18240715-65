He slept in the room over me, and Finch slept in the next room to him. On the 13th of July, between three and four o'clock in the morning, my wife awoke me; I heard a noise in the adjoining room to where I sleep, on the first floor - I got up, and knocked at that room door to alarm the parties; I heard a lock pushed back - I sprang my rattle, and then went into the room, and found the hat and bonnet boxes taken from the cupboard, and thrown about - there was a chisel in my secretary. I missed a time-piece, a coat, and a pelisse, worth 40 s.; a shawl, worth 3 l.; six silver spoons, worth 20 s.; a pair of sugar-tongs, worth 10 s.; a hat, and thirty pairs of stockings - property worth much more than 40 s. was gone from that room. The secretary had the bottom broken open by violence, and the coat, pelisse, and shawl taken out. My brother and Finch came down; we went to the back door, where I saw my wife's bonnet and part of the time-piece. Two hats were shewn to me by my wife; I think in the first floor, where the property was taken from; they belonged to nobody in the house. I went into the next street after dressing myself, and the prisoner was brought to the front door without his hat, in custody; he was examined at the watch-house; I did not notice his shoes.</p>

            . I lodged at the prosecutors' house, and was alarmed by the rattle. I went to his assistance, and on getting into the passage I saw two hats, which belonged to nobody in the house - I took them up to the first floor. The back door lock had been picked and a bar put in by force to open it, and the back window had been forced with a bar. We found a crow-bar on the copper in the kitchen, and I observed marks of a person having got up on the copper, by mortar being scraped off - the copper joined the window ledge; a person coming through the window would come in contact with the copper, the mortar of which was fresh, and there were marks of shoes scratching the bricks outside the window - there was the impression of a footstep on the fresh mortar of the copper. I went out into the yard, and saw a bonnet, a veil, a frill, and the feathers of the bonnet; they were taken into the home. I went into Crown-street, and found the watchman asleep - I stated the circumstances to him, but he never offered to move, and on going up the street I met the prisoner without a hat, knowing him before, I passed him, and turned after him; I followed him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182407150027"></xptr>to the door which had been broken open, and saw him put his hand upon the latch, but it had been fastened - he then returned into King-street; I called a watchman, who secured him. I saw mortar on his shoe, similar to that on the copper, and that in the yard; it was fresh. I saw one of the hats put on him; it appeared to fit him. Pople said at the watch-house, in his presence, that he had not the least doubt of the hat being his, for he had particularly noticed it when he was in his custody before. The prisoner said the lining of his hat had been torn out in Tothil-fields prison, and that his hat was at home, under the counter. The lining of the hat was quite out when it was picked up. He said he was merely taking a walk without his hat (it was between three and four o'clock in the morning); I first saw him in the adjoining street, about two hundred yards from the house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said at Queen-square that you saw me lift up the latch - Witness. Yes, I did. I was not round the corner.</p>

            . I am a constable of Queen-square. I know the prisoner. I saw a hat on the Magistrate's table when he was examined - I have seen that hat repeatedly before, in the prisoner's possession; the last time I saw it it was on his head. I had examined it on a former occasion, and saw the inside of it, and am confident that it is the same. I was stating to the Magistrate that the lining was torn out when he was examined before; the prisoner said it was not, for it was done in Tothil-fields. I am certain it is his. I saw his shoes when he was at the office; one of them was very much covered with fresh white lime: he was endeavouring to rub it off with his feet as he stood at the bar.</p>
               <p>Prisoner (producing another hat. This is the hat I wore.</p>
               <p>[The prisoner was here desired to put on the hat found on the premises.]</p>
               <p>Witness. I have no doubt of that being the hat he wore commonly. After the examination the hat which he has now produced was brought to him, with the ends of the thread hanging to it, as if the lining had just been torn out.</p>
               <p>JAMES M'DONAUGH. On the day before this robbery happened I saw the prisoner about forty or fifty yards from the prosecutors' house - he had a blue coat on. I took particular notice of him, and particularly noticed his hat, and as soon as this hat was put upon his head at the office I knew it again; my attention was called to him from seeing him there. I have no doubt of its being the hat he then wore.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can you swear to a hat you never saw before - A. I know it. or I would not swear to it.</p>

Next morning I found the kitchen windows open, and saw the mark of a crow-bar on the window, and the door was open - I had secured both the night before. A crow-bar was found in the kitchen. I had been on the first floor the day before; the property was all safe, and every thing secure when I went to bed.</p>

            . I lost a waistcoat the first of November, a shirt, a pair of man's worsted stocking, and a pair of clogs; I lost them out of my house, she lived with me, she was out of service: I gave her board and lodging, my husband wanted his things the Sabbath day, and I missed the waistcoat; she was below when I went up for the waistcoat, then she went away when I missed it, and finding she was gone, I pursued after her to one of her acquaintance, and there I found her, and she owned that she had pawned them.</p>

            . All these things are my goods.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mrs. Withers consented I should pawn these for nine shillings, when I was like to be in trouble.</p>
               <p>Withers. The pawnbroker said, she had brought the waistcoat twenty times, but I never missed it; She took it out again before it was wanted.</p>
               <p>Atkins. The Prisoner has brought the waistcoat to pawn several times, I cannot say how many, but I have lent three shillings upon it, and four shillings upon it, and all within 2 months, it has been fetcht and brought again.</p>
               <p>Q. to Withers. Did you send her to pawn any thing?</p>
               <p>Withers. I never did pawn but one mob and a gown, when I wanted a little money.</p>
               <p>Q. to Barker. How long have you known this woman?</p>
               <p>Barker. I have known her for some years charing about in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Atkins. What is her character ?</p>
               <p>Atkins. I have known her 4 or 5 years, and have had dealings with her 4 or five years, and she has<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174712090015"></xptr> always dealt honestly; she has been sent by some neighbours to pawn things for them.</p>

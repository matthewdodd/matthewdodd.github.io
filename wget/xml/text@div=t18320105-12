On the 28th of November he was at the house, and went away about five minutes before two o'clock in the afternoon; he had come to nail some matting over a passion flower in the garden - he then came out of the garden into the kitchen, and staid there for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, the outside; I let him out at the side gate leading to the garden - the milkman came to the door, and the tallow-chandler's-man, with candles; they were the only persons I saw that afternoon; I did not go up stairs at all - I went into the kitchen, but no further, till about a quarter to five o'clock, when my fellow servant went up to shut up the house, and called me; I went up, and found the hall door open - I went into the dining-room, but missed nothing there; I found the drawing-room window open, and the clock gone off the marble slab; the window opens in front of the house - there is a small lawn before it: it was a French clock - my fellow-servant went out to get assistance; she brought the prisoner, who lived a short distance off - I asked him to look over the house, for it had been robbed; he said he would go, but it was an unthankful office - we went into four bed-rooms; we first went into the bed-room over the dining-room, and missed mistress' gold watch off the mantel-piece; it had a chain and seals to it; I saw the chain and seals afterwards at Hatton-garden, but not the watch: master and mistress were out - both the doors of the wardrobe in the bed-room were open; I cannot say whether any thing was gone from there - we all came down stairs, and the prisoner said, "You may shut up your house - it is very safe now; don't frighten yourselves - there is nobody in the house;" my fellow-servant went to fetch mistress - the prisoner came into the kitchen once while she was gone; Mr. Wilkinson's coachman was there, and saw him; the priosner said, "You don't want me, I will go;" mistress came home - I missed a kitchen cloth out of my drawer: I had not been in the drawing-room all day before the alarm; I was taken into custody, and bailed - I do not know when the prisoner was taken: a dusting-brush was lost off a marble slab, and a bottle cover - I was cook, and had nothing to do with the drawing-room: the bottle cover belonged to mistress' dressing-case, which was in her bed-room: I afterwards saw them at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You had known the prisoner some time? A. No, about two months - he had been in the habit of taking tea with me, and we were friendly together: I supposed him to bear a good character - I did not know he was married, but have understood so since: he was working as journeyman to Mr. Protheroe, a nurseryman - he had been in the house before, and in the kitchen with both of us: the property was safe in the morning, no doubt - he came into the kitchen from the garden, and remained in the kitchen with me till he left; I never had him out of my sight - he did not returned to me till after the property was missed - I never saw him in the house: Mr. Gostling's father lives in the neighbourhood - he has a gardener named Isaac: he was in the kitchen with me and the prisoner that day, and had a drop of beer: the prisoner never left me, and I never left him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was fetched did he use all diligence in searching the house? A. Yes: he had been in the habit of coming to the house for five or six weeks - we never missed any thing before; I had asked him to tea that evening, and he said he would come down - I go up stairs every day to help make the beds, and have seen the bottlecover by chance, when mistress has left her case open, and this appears to me to be like it; the brush was to dust the ornaments in the drawing-room - the prisoner knew the housemaid was gone for mistress; he came into the kitchen while she was gone; he went out directly, and said as the house was safe inside he would stand at the gate, and watch - the front door is wood: I found that door open - I believe it was always kept with the chain up when master and mistress were from home; I do not know whether it had been chained that day; the drawing-room window was found open, as if the person had come in at the window, and gone out at the door; the prisoner attended to his work regularly while there - Isaac went out of the kitchen I suppose a quarter of an hour before the prisoner; the prisoner both eat and drank there that day; he was on friendly terms with the servants - I did not lose sight of him at all; when he left our house he said he was going to Mr. Harrison's, to work - he came at his dinner hour to do the passion flower, and as we were at dinner I asked him to take some: Mr. Wilkinson's coachman came while the servant was gone for mistress - I cannot say whether the drawing-room window was fastened; there is only the lawn between that and the road; it has a very low balcony - it is not a French window: it cannot be reached without getting on the balcony, which a person could easily do from the ground - the prisoner came between one and two o'clock: he did not come into the kitchen till he had nailed the flower, which took him about ten minutes; I had seen him come in: I do not think he had time then to get in at the window, and take the things: he left at two to go to work -I did not see him again till he returned with the housemaid.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him what had been lost? A. No - I said the house had been robbed; he went with us to look over the house, and saw what was missed; we all three went into mistress' bed-room together.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Edgware-road, Paddington. On the last day of November, or the 1st of December, the prisoner came to my house, and offered to pledge an ormoln clock, with a shade, for 8l. - it was a large French clock, with the figures of Milton and his daughter; it had and oval wooden stand containing music - I asked who he brought it from; he said from a gentleman in Caroline-place, Regent's-park:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050011"></xptr>I asked if he would allow my young man to go and see the gentleman - he said No, he was a strange sort of man, and he did not like to see any one, or something to that effect; I asked if he could bring a note from the gentleman - he said No: I then told him he might take away his clock - he did so; the figures represented Milton's daughter writing from his dictation; I did not try the music - it appeared like the music of a musical snuff-box- he told me there was music in it, and I saw there was a string to pull out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have been a pawnbroker many years? A. I have been there six years and longer in the trade; his account was suspicious, but I was not positive he had stolen it - my suspicions were not strong enough to detain him; I do not know that I ever saw him before - it was either on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday: I think it was a fine day, but cannot charge my memory - he had a brown coat on; I should say it was the same as he has now - I talked to him for ten minutes; I cannot say what figures were on the clock - my impression was that it was a silver dial; it was white, I believe- I can almost swear it was not a gilt one; it was a round pendulum, I think, but it is impossible to recollect those minute particulars; Milton and his daughter would strike any body before any thing else - it was superior to what I see on many clocks; I cannot say whether there were two holes to wind or one, or whether it would strike.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you open it? A. No.</p>

On the 22nd of December a young man came to me, with Burford, for the clock, but I refused to deliver it to any body but the person who left it - they came a second time; I did not deliver it, but went next morning to Marylebone-office, stated the case to Alderson, the officer, and the Policeman came and received the clock.</p>

            . I was housemaid in the prosecutor's service. I saw the prisoner in the kitchen, between one and two o'clock on the day of the robbery - I did not see him come in or go out; I was only present part of the time - he came into the kitchen while I was there, and I left him there; I found the door open about a quarter to five o'clock - I went over the house, and missed the clock, which I had seen in the drawing-room that morning - I did not go into mistress' bed-room till she returned; I found the wardrobe open - I missed nothing till mistress returned.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183201050012"></xptr>Prisoner to MARY THOMPSON. Q. Did you or the housemaid follow Isaac out? A. I did not, but believe the housemaid did - he went out before you, and so did Elizabeth; Isaac could not go up stairs without my knowledge, nor could any body.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think he could have gone up instead of going into the yard? A. I do not think he could - you were in the kitchen about twenty minutes; you went into the wash-house with me, and put some straw up the chimney for me - you said, "Good by, girls, take care of yourselves;" I cannot say whether the property was safe then.</p>

            . I am a nurseryman at Highbury-park. The prisoner was doing a job for me at the time of the robbery, and had been about a month with me - I thought well of him; he was working for me on the day of the robbery, at Mr. Harrison's, but I had not seen him there - I did not see him at all that day.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not see me about half-past eight o'clock in the morning? A. That was the day after the robbery; you looked ill, and I asked what was the matter with you; I do not recollect seeing you about four o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

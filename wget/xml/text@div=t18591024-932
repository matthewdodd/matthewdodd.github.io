I was second mate on board the barque <hi rend="italic">Margaret,</hi> an English vessel, belonging to the port of West Hartlepool—Philip Barker was master of that vessel—there were thirteen hands on board—the vessel sailed from Hartlepool on July 9th. with a cargo of coke; we reached Lisbon on</p>

               <p>the 28th of the same month—when we were at Lisbon, the man who acted as cook and steward was taken ill; it was necessary to send him on shore to the hospital—I do not know his name—the prisoner joined the <hi rend="italic">Margaret</hi> either on the 10th or 11th August, I cannot say which, to take the place of the man who was ill, as cook and steward—we left Lisbon on 11th August—the prisoner is a foreigner, a native of Rio Janeiro—he was at this time the only foreigner on board—after we had sailed on the 11th August, matters went on quietly until Thursday the 18th; on that day a few words passed between the prisoner and the men forward, but I did not know at the time what it was about—I did not hear what the words were; they were angry words—Captain Barker came out of the cabin and went to see what was the matter; the prisoner was there when he came out—the Captain asked what was the matter, and the men told him that the prisoner had refused washing their dinner things up, and he called the men d—d sons of bitches—the captain said he would not have any such work as that aboard the ship; he said he would not allow the prisoner to be imposed upon by any man aboard—he said that if anything was the matter they ought to come and let him know—he told the prisoner that he must wash the dinner things up for the men every day—there was nothing else said then—Cumming was one of the men who were present on that occasion—after that Thursday, matters went on quite well; nothing was the matter—the captain did not keep watch on the Sunday following, August 21st, till half-past 9 o'clock at night—the captain never kept his watch—I kept the captain's watch—the captain walked the deck from 8 o'clock till half-past 9, with me; at half-past 9 o'clock he left the deck and went to his cabin—we lived on deck—it was a cabin on the deck—the state room where the captain slept was on the starboard side—the chief mate's cabin was also on the deck, on the port side, opposite the captain's—my berth was on the starboard side, adjoining on to the forepart of the captain's—the chief mate, I, and the captain occupied that cabin on deck, and the prisoner slept underneath my berth, not below deck, but on deck also—he slept in the same cabin as I did, only underneath me—all these berths were partitioned off into separate cabins; the captain's was partitioned off by itself, and mine was the same, partitioned off by itself—the men slept in the forepart of the ship, in a house on deck—when the captain went into his cabin at half-past 9 o'clock, I remained on deck till 12 o'clock—there were five men in my watch—my watch was relieved at 12 o'clock, by the chief mate Mr. Sharp—at half-past 9 when the captain left the deck, he left orders with me to call him at 12, to let him know how the weather was; and at 12 o'clock midnight, when I was relieved, I went to the captain's berth—the captain was in bed; I told him that the weather was about the same, that it was a fine night, and how the ship was lying; he said "Very good, we will let her go that way till the morning;" I then turned into my own berth—the prisoner was then in his berth underneath me—I slept till 4 o'clock—I was then aroused by the chief mate, Mr. Sharp, to relieve his watch—I got up—the prisoner was on deck when I took charge of the deck—when I was first aroused, and getting up, he was sitting on my chest, putting his clothes on, in my berth—when I had dressed myself I went on deck—I saw the prisoner there, he went into the galley—I relieved Mr. Sharp at 4 o'clock, and he went into his own cabin—the watch went to their beds also—there was a seaman of the name of Joseph Cumming in Sharp's watch, the man I mentioned before—while I was on deck I saw the prisoner go to the galley, I should say that was about ten minutes after the mate had left the deck; he was in the galley</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240035"></xptr>
               <p>about ten minutes; and after Mr. Sharp had been in bed I should say about ten minutes, the prisoner went into the cabin where we lived—the cabin is all under one roof, but is separated off into different sleeping berths; you go from one berth to another—it is one cabin under one roof, and under that roof was the captain's cabin, the chief mate's cabin, and my cabin, all different compartments—I did not notice which compartment the prisoner went into—he went into the cabin which we took our meals in—in the centre part of the cabin is the place where we live, and the little places where we sleep are cabins out of that—the prisoner went in at the cabin-door; I cannot say whether he went into any of the small cabins, or where; he then came out on deck, and a few minutes after he returned to the cabin again—he then came out again—he might have been about ten minutes in the cabin, at the longest, both times—when he came out the second time, he went forward on the starboard side and turned round as if he was looking to see if I was watching him—when he saw me standing looking at him, he came aft again into the galley—I still walked to and fro in front of the cabin, across and across; he then came out at the galley door on the port side; he went forward on the port side; he stood still a second or two, and when he saw me looking at him he returned in to the galley—I then went forward to the fore part of the ship; I was talking to two of the men, and while I was talking to them I heard a scream—that was perhaps 10 minutes after I had seen the prisoner return into the galley—I did not see him leave the galley on this occasion—the time between my seeing him go into the galley and hearing the scream, was about three or four minutes at the outside—when I heard the scream, I jumped on to some spars on the port side—I saw the prisoner standing, holding a five-barrel revolver pistol in his right hand; standing threatening the men, with his right hand up—he was standing about three yards from the entrance of the door where the men lived, where they slept—he was standing with the revolver in his right hand, and a knife in his mouth—Cumming was standing at the entrance-door of the place where the men lived—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the revolver and this is the knife; he held it in his mouth by the blade—the revolver belonged to the captain—when I saw Cumming, the fore part of his shirt, and his cheeks were covered with blood—he said, "The villain is murdering of us"—on his calling out that, I ran into the cabin to arouse the captain—when I got to the entrance of the captain's state-room, where he slept, I called to captain Barker; I called his name out twice—I received no answer—the door was open—it had been open all night—it was open at 12 o'clock—I went in—I went to take hold of his leg, and in so doing I discovered blood running under my feet—I immediately looked up to the captain's face—he was lying with his head nearly off his body, in a complete pool of blood; he was lying on the bed, not exactly on his back; he had a little <hi rend="italic">cant</hi> on one side; his throat was cut, and his head was nearly off his body—the bed clothes were uncovered from the chest upwards—I rushed out of the captain's cabin to call the chief mate—I found his door shut—I called out, "Mr. Sharp," twice—I had to break the door open; I could not open it from the outside—I called twice and he answered; he got up directly—I told him the captain was murdered—he said he was locked in—I found that to be so—there was no key in the door—the door was locked; I burst it open—there were marks of blood near the key-hole; I could not find the key—when the chief mate came out, after I had burst the door open, I saw the prisoner standing amidships, outside the starboard-cabin talking to the men—he then made an attempt to come aft to the</p>

               <p>cabin where the chief mate and I were—I shut the cabin door, and I and the chief mate ran inside—the prisoner had the revolver and the knife with him at that time—I shut the door until we got something to arm ourselves with—there were no other fire-arms nor weapons of any kind on board the ship but this revolver—I took a screwdriver, and the chief mate took a saw—I then opened the cabin-door and we both went out on to the deck to secure the prisoner—he was on deck standing holding the revolver, threat<lb></lb>ening to shoot the men that had been asleep, the watch below—there were four or five men standing there—the chief mate went on the top of the long boat to watch his movements—I then went to the fore-part of the vessel and mustered my own watch, and got them armed with anything they could find about the deck—the prisoner then ran into the cabin—the mate immediately went and shut the cabin door and shut him in, and the other men on board armed themselves with anything they could find—I watched the prisoner in the cabin, through the glass-door—he was in the after-cabin—I saw him breaking the drawers open; I saw him break two writing desks and the chronometer—the drawers were in the after-part of the cabin, not in the captain's state-room—I do not know what he broke the writing desks with, I could see him smashing; he had the knife in one hand and the revolver in the other—he broke them most likely with the revolver—the chief-mate was at the top of the cabin, looking through the skylight, watching the prisoner's actions—he broke two or three pieces of glass, and threw them in the prisoner's face—the prisoner snapped the the revolver twice, pointing it towards the mate—the caps on it went off—the mate said, "Ah, you villian, it is not loaded"—after that the chief-mate called to me to look out, that the prisoner was coming towards the door—he came towards the door—I then opened it—the prisoner came out and threw his arms up, with his back towards the poop, the cabin—he had not the revolver with him then, nor the knife in his hands, that I saw—when he threw his arms up he said, "Me kill the captain; me kill no more peoples"—the mate then struck him on the right shoulder with a scrubbing-brush, he was on the top of the cabin above the prisoner, and I struck him with a belaying pin—we secured him between us—he had on a wide sash twisted round his waist—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I searched the sash, and found this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) concealed in it; also this tin box (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) containing pistol, bullets, and caps to suit the revolver—there were about a dozen and a half of caps, and eight balls—they were concealed in the sash round his waist, in the folds of the sash, and the knife also, tucked between the sash and his body—the pistol balls and the caps were both in the same box—we secured him and put him into the long boat—when we secured him and took the things from his sash, both his bands were bloody—after we had secured him, we mustered the crew and went to the captain's cabin, and saw the captain—on searching the after-cabin, I found this blue frock (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)it belonged to the prisoner—he had it on at 4 o'clock in the morning—when we took him he had this striped frock on—he had this striped frock on that morning, and this blue one over it—I got this large knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the chief-mate, that same morning—there were spots of blood on it—I took the two knives to the prisoner about half an hour or an hour after we had him in irons—I showed them to him, and asked him which knife he killed the captain with—he said the big knife—I asked him what he was going to do with the small knife that he had on him; that is the one that I took from the sash; he said to stick some people, suppose they strike him—they are ship's</p>

               <p>knives; the carving knife was generally used in the galley, the prisoner used it—the other is one of the table knives—they were both used in the galley, they belonged to the ship—there were spots of blood upon them, and they had been fresh sharpened on the grindstone—I showed the prisoner the blue frock at the same time, and asked him how it came torn and lying in the cabin—he said, "When I go to cut Joe's throat, Joe tear it"—"Joe," is Joseph Cumming, the seaman I mentioned before—I did not find the key of the mate's door—it was found afterwards by the boy—we buried the captain on the fourth day after this occurred, in the ballast, we bore up for Falmouth, and arrived there on 31st August—the ship was at this time on the high seas—the captain's name was Philip Barker.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the chief mate of the barque <hi rend="italic">Margaret</hi>—on the voyage from Lisbon to Nova Scotia, on Sunday, 21st August, at 12 o'clock at night, I relieved the second mate, Faux, and kept watch till 4 o'clock—at 4 o'clock I called Faux—when he came on deck I went to my cabin—Cumming was also in my watch—when I went to my cabin the key of the door was in the lock outside—there was no lock on the inside, nor yet any handle to the door—there was a temporary button put on the inside, fastened with what we call a tack—when I turned in I fastened that button on the inside—after I had been a short time in my cabin I was aroused by the second mate coming there—he called out to me—I got up <hi rend="italic">momently</hi> and found that I was locked in—as soon as I found I was locked in I kicked at the door—it was burst open and I got out—I did not notice the key-hole of the door at that time—I did afterwards—there were finger marks on it, with blood, about fifteen inches above the key-hole, and also around the key-hole, just as if there had been the pressure of a bloody hand upon it—the key was gone; it was not in the lock—the captain's cabin and mine were abreast of each other—I went into the captains cabin and then I found that he had been killed—I did not look for the captain's revolver—I sung out for it—a boy that was in the cabin at the time told me that the prisoner had it—I remained in the cabin for a few moments—the prisoner was afterwards taken, after a little trouble—when the prisoner was inside the cabin I was on the top, outside—I "catched" hold of the revolver with my hand through a broken pane of glass—the prisoner was then in the after</p>

               <p>cabin—I broke three of the panes, and the first pane that broke he <hi rend="italic">up</hi> with the revolver and snapped it in my face—the cap exploded—I did not say anything to him till I had broken two more panes in—when he came up the first time I dashed some broken glass in his face that had come from the broken pane, and I hit him on the bridge of the nose—that was to disarm him if I could—it was afterwards that I laid hold of the revolver—he snapped two caps at me—it was the third time when he came up to the sky-light that I laid hold of the revolver—the chronometer was underneath me—I did not get the revolver from him, he stabbed me in the hand when I had hold of it through the pane, and I was obliged to let go—he came up to the skylight twice after he had stabbed me in the hand—he reached up from the inside—he had to put his knee on to something and come up—every time he came up I <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> a handful of blood in his face—as soon as I saw him make for the cabin I sung out to the men, and as soon as he came out of the cabin door I struck him with the brush and he was secured—I took possession of the sash, and Cumming gave me the large knife—this occurred on the high seas—after the prisoner was secured I went into the captain's cabin—I found some blood on the floor; nothing else—there was no purse there—that was found in the after cabin—it was the captain's purse—there was 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—it was handed to me—it was not found in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice on board the barque <hi rend="italic">Margaret</hi>—I remember the voyage from Lisbon towards Nova Scotia, and the day that the captain was killed—I remember having some conversation with the prisoner on 21st August, the Sunday previous to that day—he asked me for some gunpowder to put on his little finger—I was in the galley with him—he had torn a little bit out of it with the sail-hook—I told him that I would ask the captain for some for him, and he said, "No, no;" but I did—I jumped out of the galley and asked the captain for some—the captain told me to tell the prisoner to go to him—he went to him—the captain asked him what he wanted with the gunpowder—he said that he wanted to put it on his finger, and the captain told him that powder was no good; that he was to get a bit of rag and wrap round it—the prisoner said, "No, powder and vinegar will make it dry, and make it good"—the captain said, "Very well, I will give you some by and by"—he did not give him any, because the prisoner turned in directly after—the day after the captain was killed I had some conversation with the prisoner—I asked him what he killed the captain for—he said, "You know very well, Jem; the captain give me too much work"—then he said, "A good job for you Jemmy you came out of the cabin with the second mate"—he said, "Suppose you no tell me where the powder was, I cut your throat all the same as the captain's"—he told me the day after that conversation how he had killed the captain—he was not in the long boat then; he was on the after hatch, against the galley—he had come out of the long boat—he had irons on him—I said to him, "I would not be in your shoes for half-a-crown," and then I asked him how he killed the captain—he said he put his hand over his whiskers and the knife went all the same—he did not say anything else-after it was found that the captain was killed I looked in the cabin, the same morning that he was killed, Monday morning; I found the key of the mate's door under the table, in the ship's cabin, where the captain lived.</p>

I am a waiter—on 2nd May I was in Aldgate High Street, looking at some Volunteers that were passing—in consequence of something that was said to me I went up to the prisoner and said, "You have got my watch"—he said "I have not"—I laid hold of him, and said "Well, I will soon see whether you have got it or not," and walked on with him as far as the Minories—he made a little resistance, but he found I was determined—I called out "Police!" and he said "Hold your <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, you fool; I will give you your watch"—I said "If you give me the watch I will let you go"—he said "Come down here, and I will give you the watch"—I said "Very well"—we went down Jewin Street, and I said "Now, if you don't give me the watch I will give you in charge "previously to that a policeman came up and asked me if I wanted him—I said "No," thinking I should get my watch back by him saying he would give it me if I let him go—I said "Now, if you don't give me the watch I will give you in charge "—he called out "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, give him his watch"—the watch was passed into his right hand, and he dropped it with the bow off into my left—the police<lb></lb>man must have been following a little way behind, and he said "What is the matter?"—I said "He has stolen my watch"—he said "You had better give him in charge"—the prisoner ran off, and we followed—I was tripped up several times—the detective caught him.</p>

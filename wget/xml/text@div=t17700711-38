            . I am a taylor; I was at the time of this murder standing at the door of the Bull's-head in <placeName id="t17700711-38-crimeloc201">St. Martin's-lane</placeName>

               <p>Q. Do you know who the people were that pull'd him off his horse?</p>
               <p>Daily. I know two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner strike any body?</p>
               <p>Daily. No, I did not see that he did; he rid about sixty yards in the lane after he had mounted his horse again; the cart was following him; he dismounted and came to his cart, which was about nine or ten yards off; the crowd near him seemed to be encouraging him; then he jumped up and took a spade out of his cart; he put both his hands to it, and walked smartly down St. Martin's-lane, till he came to the bottom of Chandois-street; the deceased was standing there with some people; the prisoner put both his hands to his spade, and without saying a word to him, struck him on the left side of his head, and he instantly fell to the ground; I seiz'd the prisoner, and we took the spade from him; there were a great many people came with the prisoner hallowing and hozzaing.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of people were they that were near the deceased, were they any part of the mob?</p>
               <p>Daily. No; I had been in company with the deceased in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased among the mob before the prisoner came up?</p>
               <p>Daily. Yes; when the prisoner came up first he was about seven yards from him; I did not see him at the time the prisoner was pulled off his horse.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Can you take upon you to say you was sober at this time?</p>
               <p>Daily. I was as sober as I am now; the Bull-head is a house of call for taylors; I had been there in the morning, but I had not made any fitting.</p>
               <p>Q. from the jury. Did not you see some of the taylors strike him?</p>
               <p>Daily. No, they put their hands to him and pull'd him off his horse.</p>

            . I am a cabinet maker; I was at the Green Man and French Horn in St. Martin's-lane, at five o'clock; I saw the prisoner dismount his horse and go to the cart; he made a kind of a jump at the tail of the cart, and a woman in the cart gave him a spade; he took it upon his shoulder; there was a genteel man appeared like a farmer who attempted to take the spade from him, but he would not quit it; he walked down the lane; when the prisoner came up to the house where the deceased was, the people made a great hallo! upon that the deceased came out with his waistcoat open at his breast, and his collar open; as soon as the prisoner saw him he made a push at him; the crowd was so thick he could not strike him; he turned about and took the spade in both hands edge ways, and gave the fatal blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the people abusive to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Carney. I thought they were encouraging him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw the prisoner did he appear to be cool and compos'd, or irritated?</p>
               <p>Carney. He did not appear to be in a violent passion, but indifferent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say the carter appeared to be in a great passion?</p>
               <p>Carney. I never did say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. I am informed that before the coroner you said the prisoner appeared to be in a violent passion?</p>
               <p>Carney. I said the same words as I say now.</p>
               <p>Court. I will read to you what you said,</p>
               <p>"The woman gave him an iron spade, the carter appeared to be in a great passion, and carried the spade in both his hands down the lane."</p>
               <p>Jury. He says, he thinks the mob encouraged the prisoner to give the blow, and he said before,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110060"></xptr> that a man like a farmer attempted to take the spade from him.</p>

            . I live in St. Martin's-lane, opposite the Bull's-head; I heard a great noise in the street; I went to the door; there was a great uproar; there were a parcel of men striking many people, particularly two men in my passage; soon after this I saw the carter coming along very peaceably a horse-back, by the side of his horses; the crowd was so great he could not get by without danger of running over some of the people; he stopt his horses; I believe he entreated the people to get out of the way; he smack'd his whip, or moved it about for the horses to go on, thinking that would move the people; the horses went on, that enraged the people; I believe some of the men that were a-fighting went and laid hold of the reins of his horses, whilst others were beating him in a most unmerciful manner; they that could not reach up to him jump'd up upon one another and struck him. I did not see the blow given to the deceased; the deceased was the person that struck the two men in my passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased after striking the two men?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I did not; I have seen men standing about the door of the Bull's-head, with cleavers in their hands, for what purpose I don't know; I have seen mobs rais'd there by stopping people.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen any outrageous behaviour by people at this house?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I have; I once sent over to the man that keeps the house, to desire he would not let the mobs meet about his house; he sent me back for answer that I might kiss his a - e.</p>
               <p>Court. It is very proper that some account should be taken of that house; if we can root out the cause of such matters, that is the way they will cease.</p>
               <p>Q. I am informed that they have a custom in this house for what they call skirt money, that is, they take off the skirt of your coat if you don't pay 'em six-pence.</p>
               <p>Palmer. I have heard so.</p>
               <p>Court. Upon the ground that the case stands upon, I am clearly of opinion that it is only manslaughter.</p>

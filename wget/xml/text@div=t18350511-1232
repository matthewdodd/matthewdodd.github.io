                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty in the Strand, on the 9th of May, about a quarter to one o'clock, I saw the prisoner and two others walking on the opposite side to me—I saw three gentlemen before them—I saw the prisoner lift the skirts of a gentleman's coat with his left hand, and draw a handkerchief about three inches out—they afterwards passed the gentleman, and looked into a silversmith's window, till after the gentleman passed them—they overtook him at Temple-bar—one of the three pushed by, and the prisoner lifted the skirt of the coat—drew a handkerchief out, and gave it to his companion, who was behind him—he ran across the road up Shire-lane—I followed him; as soon as I caught him, he asked what I wanted—I said, I did not want the hand<lb></lb>kerchief he had drawn from the gentleman's pocket, but I wanted to see if he had any more about him—I found he had none—I told him I had seen him give the handkerchief to another—he said he did not know any thing of it—I did not know the gentleman.</p>

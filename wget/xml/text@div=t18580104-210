                  </hi>. I am servant to Alexander Dod, of Lee. On Satur<lb></lb>day, 5th Dec., about a quarter past 1 o'clock, I had occasion to leave the back kitchen to go up stairs for five minutes, leaving the area door open, and when I came back a man was just leaving the area—I ran after him, but could not catch him; he turned round, and I saw his face quite plainly—the prisoner is the man—I saw a pair of boots sticking out of his coat pocket—I described him to a policeman—I missed two pairs of boots, and found one pair in the back area.</p>

On 5th Dec., I was on duty, and saw the prisoner about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's house, going towards it—at a little after 2 o'clock I was passing the prosecutor's house, and received information and a description of the prisoner, in consequence of which I apprehended him in New Lane on Sunday morning, the 6th Dec.—thelast witness was with me, and identified him—I told him the charge—he said that he was not round that way on Saturday—I asked him if he remem<lb></lb>bered seeing me on Saturday—he said, "No"—I took him to the station—hethen said that he would admit that he was round that way, and that he also remembered my face, but he had not been near the house where the boots were stolen from—I did not find them.</p>

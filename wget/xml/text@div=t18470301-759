I lost the articles stated from my workshop—they were safe on Friday night, 19th Feb.—the next morning my wife came running up to me, and said the place was broken open, and my tools stolen—I went down and missed them—here are a part of them which the officer brought to me—all the most valuable of my tools I have not seen again—the prisoner had been at my premises on the Wednesday before I missed my tools—he asked for a job—I offered to give him a job, but he did not come for it—on the Wednesday after the robbery he came again, and said something about a job, but I did not suspect him them.</p>

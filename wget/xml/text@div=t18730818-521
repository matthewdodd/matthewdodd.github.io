                  </hi>. I am a glass cutter, of 124, St John Street Road—on Saturday, 12th July, a few minutes after 11 o'clock, I was in Goswell Road, going home—I saw the prisoner and two other men standing just off the kerb, in the roadway—as I came in front of them, one of them crossed my path and tried to trip me up—I told him if he did it again I should strike him—the prisoner turned round and said "You will, will you?"—I said "Yes I will, if he attempts to <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> me down again"—he told me to take my coat off, and he would keep his on to fight me—he struck me on the chin with the stump of his arm; the blow knocked me down—I got up, and then we had a bit of a <hi rend="italic">melee</hi> together—I was knocked down again with the stump of his arm—he has only one arm—when I got up, somebody said "He has got your watch and chain"—the prisoner was gone then, and my watch and chain, too—I did not see the other two after I was knocked down—I saw him eight days afterwards at the police station, and picked him out of seven or eight others—I am sure he is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 81, St. John Street, Smithfield—I saw the prisoner strike Bates under the chin with his stump—they got him down in the roadway, by the gutter—a gentleman said "Where is your watch and</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 21, Noble Street, Goswell Road—I saw the two men fighting, and I saw the prisoner had only got one arm—I got between them—the prisoner caught him with the stump of his arm, and they went to the ground—I saw that Bates had no watch guard, and said "Have you lost your watch?"—he said that his watch and guard had gone—I went to the station and described the man—two men got in front of me, and stopped me running after the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wholesale clothier. The prisoner has been in my employ for about six months—on the 13th of August he had a piece of cloth given him to cut certain garments from—in the course of the day I went to the board where he was at work, and saw his hat under the board close to his feet—I found it was heavy, and kicked it up, and in it was stuffed as hard as could be, some cloth, and a handkerchief placed at the top—I took it out, and asked the prisoner what it was—he said it was some bits he had left, off the last piece, which he thought was of no use—I took them up, opened them, and asked him if they were of no use—they were large enough to make a waistcoat, and are worth 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he was then at work at a piece of blue cloth—this is black—he had finished that <hi rend="italic">job.</hi>

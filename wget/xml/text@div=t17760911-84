               <p>What was the description? - The description Mrs. Watson's maid gave me of the man was, that he was tall, dressed in a soldier's coat rather shabby, with either blue or green cuffs, and a blue collar, with blue lapels; her mistress could not say whether it was blue or green, but she believed it was blue.</p>
               <p>What did she say as to his hair? - I remember she said he was a tall man, and of a pale face.</p>
               <p>What part of this description did you think applicable to him? - This day fortnight I had seen the prisoner near a house of my master's; I thought the description of the person and the cloaths agreed very much; I had seen him in a neighbour's house very near my master's, this day fortnight; he was dressed in a dirtyish red coat, a blue collar, and cuffs upon his sleeves.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of the blue cuffs? - I am; as to the lapels of his coat, I will not positively say that he had lapels, though I verily think he had, but the buttons of the coat were quite plain, and of a largish size.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>

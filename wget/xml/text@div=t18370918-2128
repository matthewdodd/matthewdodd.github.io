                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Broackes, a surgeon, in the City-road.

At the request of the parish officers I proceeded to the prisoner's house in Moneyer-street, and saw the deceased—I found him in a state of very great exhaustion and debility, something like the debility arising from fever—I recommended his removal, and thought the place not fit for a lad in his condition—he was in a very filthy condition, both in his clothing and also his person—he was removed as soon as possible, in an horizontal chair, to the workhouse—I had him placed in a warm bath and thoroughly cleansed, and placed him in a clean bed in our infirmary.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment as a medical man, independent of any statement he made himself, could you account for this fever—from what it might arise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did appear to me to arise from want of proper necessaries—after he was cleansed I had port wine and beef-tea given him, in small quantities, not to injure him—he rallied after a few days, and I allowed him a mutton chop—I was obliged to give him food in very small quantities—he would have taken large quantities if I would have allowed it—he eat very ravenously, I must admit—he rallied for a time, and about the end of three weeks his disease returned, and on the 14th of the following month he died—I saw him every day from the period of his coming into the infirmary—he did not express to me his conviction that he should not recover—I was still in hope he would recover—he told me he was not likely to recover, but I did not encourage him in that idea—he said he thought he was going to die—he said so first, it might be, about a fortnight after he was placed under my care—I did not encourage him in that—I tried to raise his hopes, but he did not reply to me—he continued under the same impression—he repeated the observation to me on several occasions afterwards—he did not at any time appear encouraged by what I said—he said he felt himself sinking—perhaps he did not believe what I said, but he did not say whether he did or not—he made no reply—he repeated the observation three or four times—I continued to encourage him, and gave him as much hope as I could; but I think he continued under the impression that he should die, for I heard him tell his sister as well, after I had encouraged him, that he should not live—he stated to me that he had not had a sufficient quantity of food, nor any necessaries which his situation required—I think that was all he said—he was very much emaciated when I first saw him—his appearance corresponded with that of a person who had been kept without food—I think that would account for the low kind of fever I have described—I examined the boy carefully, on the day following his death—the external parts of the body were very much reduced—I then proceeded to make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I did not find sufficient internal disorder to account for death—the lungs were adhering to the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> from previous inflammation, but that would not account for his death—no other part of the body presented any appearance of disease whatever—my attention was directed to the <hi rend="italic">mesenteric</hi> glands—they were in a state of disease, which may arise from defective nutriment—the stomach was blanched—it did not seem a healthy stomach, but still not in that state which would kill a man—I should think it would become unhealthy from the want of food—if he had been kept short of food the state of the stomach would be such.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I visited the prisoner's wife on one occasion, about two years ago, and saw the apprentice there—he was very lame at the time and limped—he was living in their house in Britannia-row—I had every opportunity of seeing how the deceased was fed while I was there, for I lived with the family—the prisoner's wife was lying in, and I was with her two months—there was not the least difference in the victuals of the master and his apprentice—he had four meals a day, the same as we had—I am no relation of the prisoner's—there was not the least appearance of ill-treatment or starvation—they were very kind, and gave him sixpence on a Sunday if he wanted to go out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a spring-maker, and live in Clerkenwell-close. I have known the prisoner six or seven years—I knew the deceased before and since he was apprenticed—after he was apprenticed I occasionally worked at the prisoner's father's, at the time the deceased worked there—our hours of business were from eight o'clock in the morning till eight o'clock at night—we had half an hour at breakfast, an hour at dinner, and half an hour at tea—I went home to my meals—I did not see the apprentice have his meals when I worked there, but I saw him at meals at his master's father's—he had a good bellyfull then—he appeared to have sufficient food—I never saw him eat at the prisoner's house—he was a very dirty boy—I have told him of it, and told him he ought to take care and wash himself, but he used to laugh at me—I told him of it twice—our business is not very clean.</p>

I am the wife of Mr. Nicholson, of York-street, Commercial-road. I am a relation of the prisoner's wife—I knew the deceased—I have occasionally visited at Moneyer-street when he was alive, and often saw him at his food—he had four meals a day—I have given him his meals myself for a fortnight together, when the prisoner's wife was unwell—I should consider he had enough to satisfy anybody—I considered him a dirty boy, generally speaking—I have frequently remonstrated with him about not washing himself.</p>

On the 19th of November, in the afternoon, about an hour before this happened, I wiped the window outside - there was no pane of glass out then, but one was cracked, and these things were in a tray close to the glass; the Policeman brought the prisoner into the shop about twenty minutes to nine o'clock that evening, and showed me a snuff-box, which I knew to be masters; I then found a corner of the pane had been broken out, large enough to admit a boy's hand - I missed five boxes, two cigars, and tubes; I had been this box on Friday morning, but cannot say whether I had seen it afterwards - one of the boxes has master's private mark on it; four of them were yellow, and the other a kind of tortoiseshell.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the 19th of November, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, I was in Tabernacle-walk, and saw the prisoner showing a box to his companion; he immediately ran away - I followed, and caught him about one hundred yards off; he dropped a snuff-box, which I took up - I secured, and took him to the light; seeing it was a new box I took him to the first tobacconist's shop, which was Jacobs'- I found his window had been cut or broken; I found another box in the prisoner's waistcoat pocket, with a cigar and tube - he gave no account of himself; he at first said a boy gave him the box.</p>

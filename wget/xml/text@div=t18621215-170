I am a butcher, at 24, Bath-street, St. Luke's—on the night of December 15th, about 7 o'clock, I was passing in front of Mr. Balderson's shop, in Goswell-road, and noticed ten sheep hanging up there in front—I passed on, and came back again, St. John's-street-road way—crossing over the road to come up a turning which leads to the side of Mr. Balderson's shop, I met the further prisoner (<hi rend="italic">Grimble</hi>) with a carcase of mutton on his shoulder—I followed him into St. John-street-road, and saw the other prisoner join him—they then went some distance down the road on the left-hand side, and a man with a small van passed them, and Storey halloed to him, ran after him, and stopped the van—I saw the carcase put in the cart—they both put it in together, but Grimble had it on his shoulder—Manby is the man who had the van.</p>

I am a greengrocer, of 60, St. John-street-road—I was going up St. John-street-road with my van on the night of 15th December, a few minutes before 7 o'clock—Storey, whom I did not know, called to me—he said, "Hi!"—I looked back and saw him running across the road to me—he came up and said, "I can put a shilling or two in your way"—I said, "What for?"—he said, "To go on the other side of London bridge"—I said, "What to do?"—he said he had got a sheep from the market, where they had been all day, and he was obliged to kill it, because it had got bad feet, and his mate had carried it as far as he could, and if I would take it to London-bridge he would give me two shillings—I said I could not do it, as I had other business to attend to—he said, "If you would, you would oblige me"—I then said, "I must run home and tell them I am going"—I then ran home, and when I came back the two prisoners were with the van and the sheep—Storey first said he would give me two shillings to go to London-bridge, and then he said afterwards, if I would oblige him he would not mind giving me half a crown, and something to drink—I then proceeded on to London-bridge, and was stopped by the policeman, Poole—I did not see the sheep till it was in the cart.</p>

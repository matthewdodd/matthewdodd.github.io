On Saturday, the 28th of July, having missed a variety of articles, I desired my wife to search the house - her box was searched first; a piece of lace, and afterwards four others, were found in it. She took out a bundle herself and endeavoured to secrete it, by putting it behind her, and, on opening it, most of the articles stated in the indictment, were found; they must have been taken at various times; a shift and pair of stockings were found on her person. She begged forgiveness, and we consented to her remaining with us; but about four o'clock in the morning of the 30th, the watchman rang the bell, we found she had escaped out of the kitchen window; he brought her back, with a bundle. Four napkins, a pair of ear-rings and a razor were found in her pocket, and my umbrella in her hand.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 30th of July, about four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner thirty yards from her master's house, I called to her, and when she turned round I knew her; I said, What brings you out so early? she said, she was going to the country to Charing-cross, she had a bundle and umbrella; I said she was going the wrong way. I enquired at the prosecutor's, and then fetched her back, with the things in her hands, which were claimed by the prosecutor.</p>

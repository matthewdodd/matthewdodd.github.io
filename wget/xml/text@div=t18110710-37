            . On last Sunday evening, about eleven o'clock, I first saw the prisoner in Long Acre, I was coming home to Bear-Yard, Clare Market; the prisoner asked me for something to drink, there was another woman with her; I told them that I had no money; they both began feeling my pockets and pulling me about. They said that I had money; I gave them sixpence, and kept walking along the street, and at the time I gave them the sixpence the prisoner drawed my watch out of my sob; I called for assistance, the prisoner gave my watch to the other woman, she ran away with it; the prisoner held me by the coat till the other woman was out of my sight, so that I could not run after her, after some time the watchman came, I gave charge of her. The watch I never saw again; it was a silver watch, a metal chain to it, a gold seal and a metal one.</p>

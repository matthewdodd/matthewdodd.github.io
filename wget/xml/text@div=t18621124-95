                  </hi>. The deceased, Mrs. Day, was my daughter—she was thirty-three years of age—she was married to the prisoner; it would have been three years come Christmas—they lived together two years and nine months—for five or six weeks they were lodging at Rochester-row, West<lb></lb>minster—I was living in Tower-street—my daughter was with me there for five weeks; she left the prisoner and came to reside with me, but he was continually coming to my house to annoy us—the day before she left Rochester-row, I was there—the prisoner was aware that she was about to leave—he swore, with heavy threats, that he would murder her if he found her there on the Friday—he said if the things were not removed he would take the hatchet and break them all up to bits—"So," he said, "you had better take them away"—when he came home to tea he began quarrelling over the tea-table, and he quarrelled very much indeed with her, so much that I made her leave the room—I then went into the room, and he began to talk to me about my daughter's leaving him; and he swore bitterly to me, that if she was not out of the house on Friday, he would take her b—life away, and break up everything in the place—I said, "Harry, these are horrid words for a mother to hear; do you really mean Annie to leave you? let us do it quietly; don't take her life; spare her for me, as I am getting old"—he said, "No, I won't stain my hands with the b—b—; she may go; and let some other b—man have a tying up with her, as I have had"—he said he meant her to leave him; he was quite tired of her—I then said to him, "Harry, you had better write out on a piece of paper what she is to take," meaning the goods; and I asked him if there was anything he chose to have left, to say so, and not, when we were gone, to say that we had robbed him—he then said what was to be left, and what was to be taken—I said, "I had rather Mr. Parcel, the landlord, came up as a witness;" and Mr. Parcel came up, and heard what the prisoner had to say; and it was finally settled that Annie was to go away on the Friday—I went there on the Friday—I did not see the prisoner there that day—my daughter left on the Friday, and came home with me, and the things that had been named the day before were removed—that was about five weeks before this transaction—during that five weeks the prisoner came several times to my house—he came on a Sunday morning, when I was pre<lb></lb>paring the dinner in the shop, sat himself down, and asked if I had got any beer—I said I had a little in a bottle—he then stayed and dined with us, and remained all night, and he slept there the whole of that week till the Friday, when I wished Annie to go back and live with him again: I thought it would, perhaps, be as well if she gave him another trial; and she went, poor thing, with great reluctance—she remained with him from the Saturday night till the Friday following—I did not go to the house to Rochester-row that week, while she was there—she returned to me once more on the Friday—the prisoner came to the house on the Monday after, I think, and annoyed us very much, and broke a looking-glass in front of the house—he abused my daughter very much, and caused a great mob round the door, so much so that I was very much alarmed, and at last the policeman, Mr. Cook, came along and got him away from the door—the prisoner came several times: one night he came and broke the hasp off the door, and burst right in, and said he would come in—I sent for a policeman then and got him away—the policeman wanted me to give him in charge, but I did not, though I ought to have done so—I was not at home on Thursday, 18th September, when this happened—I returned home about a</p>

I am not a police constable now—I am at present lodging in Mount-gardens, Mount-street, Westminster-road—I live in the country—on 18th September, between 3 and 4 in the afternoon, I was at 75, Tower-street, Westminster—I don't know whether it was Thursday or Friday—it was at the premises occupied by Mrs. Savage—Mrs. Savage was there when I first went, and Sarah Ann Day, her daughter—the prisoner came in while I was there—he stood on the threshold of the parlour-door</p>

               <p>when he came in, and remained there—he had a hammer, chisel, and screw-driver in his right hand—the deceased was supporting herself on the side of the bed, in the parlour—I was sitting in a chair at the other end of the room, by the side of the fire-place—the deceased said, "Hallo, Harry, what do you want here?"—I cannot state what answer the prisoner made; there was some more passed—I asked the prisoner, shortly after his being there, if he had any claim on the deceased—he answered, "No"—I then said, "Why do you come here annoying her in the way you do?"—he made no reply—he asked the deceased whether she was willing to come back to him again or not—she answered, "No, King, you never acted as a man to me, and not all your persuasion shall induce me to go back to you again"—with that the prisoner made use of some expression, but in too low a tone for me to hear what it was, and he struck the deceased in the abdomen with the chisel and screw-driver—during the conversation the hammer was passed from his right hand into his left, some two or three minutes before he struck the blow; the chisel and screw-driver were retained in the right hand—the deceased then gave a fearful shriek, and cried, "Murder" several times—I immediately sprang on the prisoner, so as to prevent a repetition of the offence—we had a struggle together, which extended to the shop door; I then let him go, and he went away—almost directly he was gone, the deceased called me and told me she was stabbed—I immediately went in pursuit of the prisoner, and took him into custody at the Engineer's Arms, in the Westminster-road—I said, "I arrest you for stabbing Sarah Ann Day; I am a police constable"—he said, "I did not strike her"—I took him to the station—when the charge was read over to him, he said, "She is my wife"—I said, "She is not your wife; you have got no claim upon her"—he made some further remark, that he knew all about it, for I had taken her away from him, or words to that effect.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the house, 75, Tower-street—the room in question is but seven feet long, and the space between the bedstead and the partition is about seven feet by three or four—as the witness described it as thirteen or fourteen feet, I thought it right to state this—the width of the room would be about six feet, or from that to seven—it is a square room, but the distance between the bedstead and the partition where the circumstance took place, would only be about three feet six—the room is about seven feet square; it may be a little shorter one way than the other—I was married in that same house, and have known that room for twenty-five years—I know the length and width of it, even by the tread of the foot—I have not actually measured it; but I am confident that is about the size.</p>

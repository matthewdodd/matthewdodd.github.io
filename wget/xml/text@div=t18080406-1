               <p>Q. What was the prisoner. - A. He was a <rs id="t18080406-1-deflabel5" type="occupation">labourer</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18080406-1-defend51 t18080406-1-deflabel5"></join> there; we were in the habit of melting our own fat, for the purpose of making into pomatum; we allow the men the pugs, after the fat is melted; that is the refuse, the skins. In consequence of a letter we received from a tallow chandler, we suspected that we were robbed of fat to some amount. On the 19th of last month I saw the prisoner take out a quantity of fat in a bag; I went after him and saw him selling this fat in Mr. Briant's shop, a tallow chandler in Greek street.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was the same fat. - A. I am sure. I followed him and the fat; I have no doubt but the fat I saw him take was the fat I saw him selling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have been in the shop sixteen years. I shewed Mr. 
               <persName id="t18080406-1-person56">Raine</persName>
             the waste of the skins, and the fat was the scrapings of the floor.</p>
               <p>Witness. As he passed me, he said you see it looks very brown; I saw it was brown at the top; I took no further notice of it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BRIANT. Q. You are a tallow chandler. A. Yes. On Saturday I bought the fat of the prisoner, I gave him eight shillings for it; the top of the fat was what was allowed them, the refuse of the skins; at the bottom of that was suet; I gave him three pence a-pound for it. If I had seen the bottom I should have allowed him sixpence a pound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I sold nothing but the scrapings of the floor and the pickings of the skins.</p>

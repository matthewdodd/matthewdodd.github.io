I am a greengrocer, of 8, Eaton Place, Dover Road—on 2nd February the prisoner came with another woman, who asked for 31b. of potatoes (the prisoner only came about a foot into the shop)—she gave me a shilling—I had no halfpence, and went to Mr. Carter, at the Sir John Falstaff, who gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers—I went back to the shop, and gave the woman her change—the prisoner was still at the door—they went away together, and had only got next door when Mr. Carter's servant, Ellen Lee, came across and gave me the shilling, which I found was bad—I went out and said to the woman with the prisoner, "Give me another shilling, for this is bad"—she used fearful language, and the prisoner snatched the shilling away—the prisoner used the worst language—she snatched the tenpence and shilling out of the other woman's hand, and said, "It is my money"—they ran away, and I followed the prisoner into the Dover Road, met a constable, and gave her in custody, with the shilling I received from Lee—I have not seen the other woman since.</p>

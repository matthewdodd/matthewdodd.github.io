                  </hi>. I live in Ropemaker's-fields, Limehouse. About six o'clock in the evening of last Monday month I was standing at my own door—Mrs. Mann was removing—I said, "You are going; it is a good job; have you got a feather pillow to sell?"—Mrs. Mann had a part of her bed<lb></lb>stead in her hand, and she made a run at me, and attempted to strike me—the prisoner was there—she had an iron bed-winch in her hand, and she struck me with it very severely on the temple—she struck me once, and would have struck me again, but a person stopped her hand—the blood flew from my head, and 1 was attended by a surgeon, who is here—I was very unwell from it, as of course I must be, losing so much blood—I did not keep my bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live near the prosecutrix. I was there on the Monday evening, when this took place—the prosecutrix was not eery tipsy, but she was rather the worse for liquor—she and Mrs. Mann were fighting and quarrelling—they were striking one another, and the prisoner said if Mrs. Mann did not beat Mrs. Bryant she would—Mrs. Bryant made answer, "No, you will not beat me"—the prisoner said, "Yes, I will," and she struck her with the bed-winch in her hand—the prisoner had been drinking all day with</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No, I did not—Mrs. Bryant did not strike you first—I said I would say the same here as I did at the police-office—I have said no more than I did at the office, and what 1 have said is true—you said you had had some drink, because you had taken a ring off your finger, and pledged it to get some drink with Mrs. Mann, and your husband has now the duplicate in his possession—you told me that at the end of the court, when you came to strike me after striking Mrs. Bryant.</p>

                  </hi>. I apprehended the prisoner at Duke's-shore, Limehouse, just going across the water—she said, "I hit the woman over the head with the bed-winch, but I did not go to do it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I attended Mrs. Bryant—I found a slight contused wound on her left temple—I did not see it till two days after the accident—it was a slight wound—there was no danger whatever—it was a sort of wound that drunken persons might easily inflict.</p>

I found the clothes were not quite dry; I asked him if he was to go with the stage? he said, no; and he would not tell me where they were to go to; then I took him to the watch-house: then he told the constable of the night he was going to send them by the Leatherhead coach: he was brought before the justice, and committed; and I found out the prosecutor.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the landlord of the Red Lion inn, Mulgrave-place, in the parish of Woolwich, in Kent. On the morning of the 22nd of May, about three o'clock, I was in bed—my wife awoke me—I heard a parti<lb></lb> cular moaning or groaning, which proceeded from the chimney or the top of the house—I rang my bell, got up, and dressed—I went out of my room, and found my house full of smoke—I went into the different rooms, with the exception of the bar, which was locked—I went up stairs, and fetched the key of the bar—I then went into the bar, and found the grate and fender full of soot, all on fire—there had been a fire left in that bar—by this time my servants had come to me—after I had opened the front door and the window of the bar, I heard a moaning or groaning, which appeared to come from the chimney—I took an iron bar and put it up the chimney—I felt somebody up there, and the person said, " Oh don't, Oh don't; take me out, take me out; ring the bell "—I sent for a police<lb></lb> man—when the policeman came, the register of the stove in the bar was removed—the policeman and one of my servants pulled the prisoner out of the chimney into the room—he was without his boots or cap, and his trowsers were turned inside out—he had a military jacket on, but not so good a one as he has now—I heard him tell the officer where his boots and cap were—I afterwards went to the top of the house, and found a bag, which the officer produced—there was no way by which he could have got to where we found him, but from the top of the house—he laid he had got up by the side of a flue, two houses from mine, and that he came down the chimney, for the purpose of robbing and plundering the house—those were the words he made use of to my servant in my presence—I have heard that a cloak has been found since—I found a razor on the top, of the house, about two yards from the chimney which the prisoner came down.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. You stated that you found a turnscrew, not a razor—it was a turnscrew I screw my spurs on with, and which I took from the stable that evening. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>.

I knew that the bar had been closed about five minutes past eleven o'clock the night before, by my fellow-servant—I was present—there was not a soul about the house, to he best of my knowledge—if there had been a person in the chimney, I must have heard it—we make a regular rule of searching every place—when the prisoner was pulled down I took him to the front-door—I asked him what his intention was in getting into the chimney—his reply was, " To rob and plunder the house"—there is a door leading to the roof of the house, which I had fastened about a quarter-past five o'clock the preceding afternoon—he was taken to the front-door that we should discern who he was—he did not appear exhausted—it was between three and four minutes after I took him to the door that I asked what his intention was.</p>

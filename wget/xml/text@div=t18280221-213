On the 29th of January, about eight o'clock, I came into the shop and saw him with this piece of wood in his hand, and asked what he was making, and said, "Are you authorized to cut up my wood?" He said "I have only taken this one piece." I went to the door, and when I came back he was gone; but in the top of his bench, I found these six pieces of wood; when he came in the evening, I said, "You have been robbing me." He said, "I meant to pay you for it." I never suffer my men to take wood and pay for it afterwards - I am pretty certain it is all mine - one piece I am sure of, and have the piece it was cut from; it is cut for a bedstead which I never set him to make - he has worked for me eight years.</p>

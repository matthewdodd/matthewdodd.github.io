On the morning of the 14th of October, about twelve o'clock, I was in Fleet-street—I saw the prisoner with a man something like himself—there was a gentleman walking before them, and his handkerchief was hanging a little out of his pocket—I was going down to the City, and they seemed to follow him—by Rundell and Bridge's, there is a place where you must go on the boards; and they <hi rend="italic">whipped</hi> the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket—the prisoner went inside the boards—I went in and said, "You have taken that gentleman's handkerchief;" and he dropped it at his feet—the gentleman went away—they were so close together, I cannot say which took it, but I rather think the other one took it, and gave it</p>

On Sunday night week Murray and Parker came to my lodgings about ten o'clock - I was abed; they called out opposite the window, and said Mr. Jordan had some business with me - I said I was coming. I put on my clothes, and went out to them; they were waiting for me by a little gate at a distance - they took me into Jordan's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You went willingly - A. Yes, my Lord, they behaved like friends, sat me in a chair by the fire, and talked to me a great while like friends. Marray and Parker told me that Jordan wanted to settle with me about my money - I had an attachment against him from the Court of Requests.</p>
               <p>Q. They talked friendly with you for sometime - A. Yes, then Churchill put a red rag over my mouth - they covered my mouth and nose. I then felt Weldon come and give me one stab; I received three more, but I do not know who from. All the stabs were on the bony part of my breast - they did not go any great depth.</p>

They found me bleeding, brought a sponge to do the blood away, and laid a wet cloth over that; they then threw me down into the cellar, and tied my hands behind me - after throwing me down they tied them as tight as they could, then laid me on my face, and said when the last of the blood was out I should be dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in the cellar - A. I fainted away, and am not able to say, but I think I was there a little before twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get away - A. They said I was dead. Churchill gave me a kick on my shoulder, with which I was very bad, and then went out. Murray came down, turned me over, and said,</p>
               <p>"Are yon alive?" then struck me on the ribs, and said I was dead.

               <p>"You will see he is not, unless his throat is cut;" Murray said I was, and that I had no business there any more. He rose me up, and dragged me up by my coat. Churchill and Weldon dragged me out of the cellar. When I heard them talking about my throat being cut, I pretended to be dead; they rifled my pockets of every thing - of all my papers, and Parker crammed them down my throat with a stick - I heard a noise of water coming in. They washed the rag that was over the sponge, and put it into my pocket with the sponge. They carried me through part of Grub-street, and turned me into a court there - my feet and hands were tied; I felt a rope on my feet as they laid me down, which broke from my legs by my struggling. I was stiffened with cold, and cannot tell how long I laid there. The watchman found me there, and I was taken to the hospital; I was informed that they would wait to see if I stood there, and I stood still. I heard the watchman coming, and made as much noise as I could; he and others came, cut the ropes from my hands, and took me to the watch-house. I told them the rope which tied my legs was broken at the end of the court, and they went and found it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You knew very well where they lived - A. Yes, I lodged with them about three weeks before I went to where I now live. I left on account of a dispute with them.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of this dispute you was put in prison - A. Yes, but I had the first warrant against him. I was tried at Clerkenwell - it was done to prevent my appearing in Court; I was only in prison seven days, as the gentlemen found out that it was false. I never said that I would be revenged, and have them all in a string for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Kirby and Griffin - A. Yes, they would hang me if they could - I know Molloy; I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010019"></xptr>said so to either of them - they swore any thing against me, but the Magistrate knew them, and would not believe them. They threw me right down the cellar - it hurt me very much, and I was bruised; I went to the hospital that night, and came out two days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you try to make your escape from the hospital - A. The doctor told me that I should be discharged next day, I called for my shoes and stockings, but could not get them.</p>
               <p>Q. The nurse removed your shoes and stockings to prevent your escaping, and so you ran away without them - I did, and two of the gentlemen followed me. I said I would not come back. One of the gentlemen said I should catch cold, and so I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken to the House of Correction since that - A. The officer thought I was going away, in order not to appear here, and I was taken there. He has the rag that was found in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you halloo out - A. No, I could not when I heard about my throat being cut - they took me a great way from their house; I do not know how long I remained in the court. I was carried out a little before twelve o'clock, and the watchman found me there a little after twelve.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were all the persons in the room when you received the stabs - A. I cannot tell, for they were going in and out - my eyes and mouth were bound up.

             DEAN. I am assistant to Mr. Blundell, who is a surgeon, and lives in Chiswell-street. On the morning of the 22d of November I was called out of bed by the watchman, about two o'clock, and saw M'Ginnis at the watch-house very faint and weak. I examined his breast, and found a wound, also one or two scratches, not deserving the name of wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the wound - A. On the right side of the breast - it was a very superficial wound, by no means likely to be attended with any danger; there was no chance of its being mortal - it was on the bone, in a part not at all dangerous. It was not likely to disable him or do him any grievous bodily harm.</p>
               <p>The Court here informed the Jury, that the charge could not be substantiated, as the wounds were not likely to produce grievous bodily harm, but were inflicted on a part of the breast the least dangerous.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Forrest, watch-maker, living in Wilmington-square: the prisoner was in my service about seven months. On Sunday, the 20th of Sept., between twelve and one o'clock, I gave my hus<lb></lb>band a box from my pocket—it was not locked—on his examining it, he found it contained six good sovereigns, and a coin very much like a sovereign—it was a sort of medal—there ought to have been seven sovereigns in the box—on the Saturday morning, between eight and nine o'clock, I had left my</p>

               <p>pocket, with the box in it, on the sofa, in the kitchen, for not more than ten minutes—there was then seven good sovereigns in it—I did not examine the box when I took up my pocket—when we missed the sovereign my husband spoke to the prisoner—she said she knew nothing about the box or pocket—we proposed to examine her box, which she consented to readily; but I did not examine it, having done so before, and found nothing—my husband told her a sovereign had been taken out of the box, and a coin put in, and asked her if she knew anything about it—she denied it altogether—she was asked if she had a pocket on, and she said twice that she had not—I felt, and she had one, but nothing in it—my husband noticed a projection under her right breast—she said it was the shoulder-strap of her stays which was broken-ny husband left the room—I then examined her, and took a purse from that place with a good sovereign in it—she took the purse out herself—I took it from her hand by force, and said, "Sarah, then you really are guilty"—I called my husband—he asked her how she came to take it—she said she took it on Saturday morning, and put the coin in—he asked where she got the coin from—she said her brother gave it to her in the country—next morning I found she had left the house in the night, and taken her boxa away.</p>

                  </hi>. My wife gave me the box on Sunday morning—there were six good sovereigns and a coin in it—the prisoner denied knowing anything about it—I observed a little projection under her breast—she said it was her stays—I left the room—my wife called me in, and gave me the sovereign and the purse—she bore a very good character.</p>
               <p>----(<hi rend="italic">policeman.</hi>) I apprehended the prisoner—she met a female when she was in my custody, who said to her, "I hope you did not do it, Sarah"—she said, "I did, but meant to replace it."</p>

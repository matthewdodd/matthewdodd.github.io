                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker—the prisoner is the same. On the 26th of February, I called on him to know if he had any work—we went together to a public-house, and had two pots of porter among four of us—we then went to the corner of Bedfordbury, and had two pints of half-and-half, for which I paid—he told me he had nothing but 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I treated him, knowing him as a shopmate—I was not tipsy—we then Went to the Star and Garter in St. Martin's-lane, and being cold, had a pint of porter—I fell asleep there, having been up very early that morning—before I went in, I had put a half-crown in my right-hand waistcoat pocket to buy a piece of binding as I went home, that I should not break into it—the prisoner was with me when I did that, but I do not know whether he saw it—I had the half-crown when I went into the Star and Garter—I paid for the pint of porter out of my left-hand trowsers pocket, not out of the half-crown—it was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening when I fell asleep—the prisoner was there at the time—I was awoke by a soldier and a boy—they told me I had been robbed—the prisoner was gone then—I felt my pocket, and the half-crown was gone—I ran directly to the Crown, where I knew the prisoner used to go, and there found him changing a half<lb></lb>crown at the bar.</p>

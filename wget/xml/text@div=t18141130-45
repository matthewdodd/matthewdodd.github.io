            . I am a constable. On the night of Tuesday, the 15th of November, I was in Billeter-lane, about two o'clock when I was there, in company with Bray; I saw the two prisoners in company with two other men; I knew them perfectly well; I observed their conduct; I was about sixteen yards from the premises. I saw three of the men make up to Mr. Framptons' gate, and one was patroling the street; one left the four, and three went to the gate; one patroled the street; I heard the rustling of some keys, apparently at the gate, as if they were sorting them out, as if they were handling a bunch of keys; I heard one enter the lock; I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181411300035"></xptr>then so near, I could hear that; the morning being still and no person walking in the street at the time; I heard the lock open with some difficulty, as if the door stuck, it sounded when opened; I saw the two prisoners enter the premises, with another, and after they had been in ten minutes, one came out, thinking they had been disturbed by the family, I thought with Bray to secure each side of the gate; Bray instantly made up to the gate; I was close to him: just as we got to the gate, he cut down the prisoner Turnwell, he apparently fell; Bennett rushed out of the gate. I cut at him with my cutlass; I missed my blow; he instantly struck me on my cheek-bone, which caused me to fall, he struck me with that double crow, what they call a jemmy, it did not stun me his striking me on my cheek-bone. I perceived the prisoner stumble nearly across the road before he recovered; I got up, and went after him, crying out stop thief; he ran down Billeter-lane, he turned on the right hand in Billeter-square, in turning the corner of Billeter-square; he turned short; I saw the watchman laying on the ground, that was Curtain, the watchman; I thought he was murdered; I found he was wounded; I jumped over the watchman at the time, He proceeded to the right of Billeter-square, where there was no thoroughfare; at that time, I could not get my pistols out, I meaned to shoot him, and when I came to him, I aimed a blow at him with my cutlass, and missed my blow again. He ran down Fishers-alley, into Fenchurch-street, then he crossed into Mark-lane; he threw himself up against a house in a dark part, there was not a lamp near the place, that I might over run him; I cut him across the head; he had a hat on; I collared him, and took from his right hand the crow that he struck me with; he said, do not murder me. I brought him back again to the premises of Messrs. Frampton. there I found Bray with the other prisoner, close to the gate; we then took both the prisoners to the watchhouse. I searched Bennett; I found on him a phospherous bottle, a small bunch of matches, two pieces of wax-candle, and a piece of candied horehound. After we secured the two prisoners in the watchhouse, I came back again, and found this green bag rolled up in the gateway, and a cord round it. We then alarmed Mr. Frampton. We found these two keys; I believe Mr. Frampton picked up one; they are skeleton keys; they were about three yards inside the premises, by the gate; at that time we desired the watchman not to shut the gate, but one of the watchmen shut the gate.</p>

            . I am a constable. I saw the man enter the gate: I knew them perfectly well. Three went in, and one stood outside; one came out that made his escape. Turnwell was just coming out, I sprang over, and cut him down with a cutlass, that is Turnwell, be dropped this green baize bag, he dropped these keys; they were wrapped up in the green baize bag. I immediately called to my partner, I have one; Bennett rushed out, and hit me on my arm with the crow; I thought my arm was broken; my partner cut at him. I never quitted Turnwell; I cut him down as he was coming out of Mr. Frampton's gate. I staid till morning, and found this key close to the gate.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CURTAIN. I am a watchman; my stand is at the entrance of Billeter-square. On the night in question, I heard the cry of stop thief; I went out of my box with intent to lay hold of him; before I could lay hold of him, I received a violent blow from the man that I was going to lay hold of: the blow knocked me down, and deprived me of my senses, and knocked some of my teeth out. I received the blow from a man that was running at the cry of stop thief.</p>

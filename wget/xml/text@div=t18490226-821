                  </hi>. I am a smith and tool maker, of Great Guildford-street; the prisoner was my apprentice. I accompanied White to a house in John-street—I saw Harriss there, and saw on the table, hammers and tools, and under the bed, some others, which I identified—these are part of the things I found in the house—this hammer has my name on it; I missed it the day after I had been there—it was there about a week before—the prisoner had absconded from my service in March, but had come back again; he then continued in my service, and was in my house on the day I found these things—I was out at work with one of my young men—I came home, and found him in the shop by himself, which was unusual for him in his dinner-hour—he had no business with these things off the premises—I have not the least doubt that these are all mine—this saw I have had these dozen years—I had it about a fortnight before—these tongs have "J. H." on them—they are made different to any that I ever saw.</p>

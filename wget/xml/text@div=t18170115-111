On the night of the 24th of December, I was out till rather more than half-past two o'clock in the morning. On my return home my servant let me in, I fastened the door myself, I fastened the private door, the shop street - door was fastened before I went out, but the door which leads out of the passage into the shop was not fast. My apprentice sleeps in the shop, I sleep in the two pair of stairs front room. On going up stairs. I found the windows shut and the shutters fastened, the one pair of stairs back window was shut down when I went out at half-past eleven o'clock, but I do not know whether the shutters were shut or not. I went to bed and was called up about eight o'clock the next morning, and told that I had been robbed. I went into the shop and missed the articles mentioned in the indictment, some of them were from my pledge stock and some from my sale stock. I published a bill from Bow-street and sent it round to the trades-people. I saw my property in the custody of Foy and Jeffries at Malborough-street, on Monday last, I knew it to be mine, it was in my possession the night I left the shop. On looking at my house the next morning, I found an entry had been made through the one pair of stairs back window, there was a pane of glass broke in the window - I believe it was shut down when I first saw it; a pane of glass was also broken in my back parlour, and an attempt made to force the shutters. The sash fastening had been pressed against the shutters, which made an impression<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181701150051"></xptr>that had not been there before; the outside of the window appeared as if a lighted candle had been put on the frame which had burnt it, there was also a match on the window frame. I have seen the prisoner frequently before, I believe he has been to my shop. North-street is within one hundred yards of my house.</p>

            . I am Mr. Hall's apprentice, and live in his house, I slept in the shop. On the 24th of December, I went to bed at a little before two o'clock; I awoke about a quarter before six o'clock, and seeing a light, I rose up in my bed and looked forward, but saw nothing at first, I looked in the front and saw a candle and the crown of a hat on a level with the counter, there was a quantity of jewelery and watches near the counter, it was the sale stock; the pledges were neariy level with the side of my bed, in some drawers, there was two doors before them, the drawers contained jewelery, &amp;c., there was spoons in both stocks. I turned a little more round and stretched a little more out of bed, and saw a man, who I at first thought was Mr. Hall, I said to him, 'Ah, who is that?' the man made no answer but turned round, and I thought put the candle out, I could not see it any more, I heard no more at that moment, but in a minute or two, I heard one step and the sash-window slide along, it is made to slide along, and the jewelery is behind it, it is the glass-window or case which incloses the things, I heard it slide back; soon after I heard the things tingle and something drop, which proved afterwards to be a miniature, I heard paper rustle at different parts of the shop, some of the pledged stock was inclosed in papers, I said nothing more, I did not cry out; I heard a man's shoes creak as if he was going out of the shop into the parlour, just as it was getting light I heard the private street door go, it leads into Paradise-street, all this from first to last might be about one hour and a quarter, it was just beginning to get light when I heard the door swing. In the morning I found some papers about the shop. My master got up about an hour afterwards. Soon after they went I rose up and thought I heard a noise among the boxes, I was alarmed and remained in bed for some time, I suspected it was thieves; I only saw one man. I found a miniature and a snuff-box on the floor, and some other things on the counter, there was also some duplicates which had been pinned on pledges, they were thrown about the shop.</p>

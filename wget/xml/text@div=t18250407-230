            . I am a looking-glass manufacturer, and deal in paintings and stained glass, and live in Chapel-court, Long-acre; the prisoner brought me some stained glass, called pot-metal, about three weeks or a month before Christmas; he asked if I wanted to buy any, as he knew a person who was taken ill, in the looking glass way, who had some to dispose of, as he was obliged to go into the country, and his wife wished to sell it to go down to him. I bought 15 or 16 lbs.; he came to me again several times with a woman, saying she was the man's wife. I dealt with him five or six times for the same sort of metal; I bought about 150 lbs. within about two months - some of it is here now. Mr. Hedgland and Mr. Bailey afterwards made inquiry about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the prisoner's brother? A. Yes; but he never brought me any glass, except on his master's account, a Mr. Headley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his brother was employed by Mrs. Muss? A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a particular sort of glass? A. No, it is made by every manufacturer.</p>

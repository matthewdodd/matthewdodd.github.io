            . I live with Mr. Serjeant, at the White-hart, public-house, Fleet-market. The prisoner came about six o'clock, on the evening of the 18th of June, and asked for change for a sovereign; I sounded it and said it was bad - he took it up and gave me another; I said this is bad likewise, he said he was sure they were not. I took them to Mr. Jones at the next door, who called Mr. Lynes, and gave them to him - he accompanied me to the house - they went into no persons' hands but Jones and Lynes.</p>
               <p>- JONES. I keep the Crown and Anchor, public-house. On Friday, the 18th of June, Hopkinson came to me and said</p>
               <p>"Look at these sovereigns, a young man wants change - I do not think they are good;" I called Mr. Lynes the beadle, and gave them to him - he went in with her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did not she say, that I sent her to ask if they were bad - A. Yes, she said you told her she had better come to our house to see if they were good; I think he could have gone away if he had thought proper.</p>

            . I am the Ward beadle. The sovereigns were shown to me by Jones - I searched the prisoner and found a good sovereign, a farthing and this purse - I asked him to tell me who he took them of, which he positively refused to do - these are the sovereigns (looking at them) here is a mark on them which I put at the time.</p>

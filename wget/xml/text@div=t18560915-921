The prisoner lodged with me—I saw the child alive in it's mother's arms on the Sunday night—it looked very bad, and I thought it would not live long, and on Tuesday morning about 10 or 11 o'clock, I saw it dead—I cannot say for certain whether I have ever seen her suckle it: yes, I make a mistake, I have—I think it must have been four or five months old—when I saw the child last alive, the prisoner seemed rather stupified; I cannot say that she had been drink<lb></lb>ing—she appeared sober to me; and I saw her on Wednesday, after it was dead.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon. I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> exami<lb></lb>nation of the child on the 23rd, I think—it was in a state of extreme emaciation—there were no external marks of violence—there was nothing externally to account for death—I found every organ perfectly healthy, the brain, the liver, and the kidneys—the stomach was collapsed, and remark<lb></lb>ably small—the gall bladder was perfectly charged with bile, sufficiently to digest food—the stomach did not contain anything, not even the usual mucus which is secreted—if there had been any nutriment swallowed by this child within twenty-four hours of its death, I should have discovered it—the bowels were in the same condition as the stomach—want of food, starvation, was the cause of its death—I do not know whether I ought to say want of food, I cannot say that food was not given—there may have been some incapacity in the child to take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The child died by reason of nothing coming into the stomach? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, from inanition; that is my judgment—it might have taken the nipple of the breast, and still not have drawn food—I have known the nervous system arrive at such a condition as to incapacitate a child from receiving food, even if offered; but I do not say that that was the case—there ie frequently paralysis of the muscles of the throat, the swallowing muscles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are the appearances on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examina<lb></lb>tion quite consistent with death from starvation, or from natural causes? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It appeared to me death from starvation, the want of nourishment—assum<lb></lb>ing that the death was caused by inanition, I should say that that had been going on, according to the observations I made, for some weeks—I have met with many cases in which infants refuse the breast, which I cannot trace to any reason, but not at that age; I have known it when they are born, and no one can assign a reason for it to the present day; but I never knew a child refuse it when it has once taken it, unless there was disease—if the nervous energies were weakened, there would be no <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>, appearance indicative of that state; it would be out of the power of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185609150102"></xptr>
               <p>science to detect it—it may certainly have existed in this case—I have heard that the prisoner's breasts were full or milk, and it would be a relief to her to suckle the child—if she had been denying the child milk for weeks, she must certainly have given suck to some child, or she would begin to get dry; after three days the breasts would begin to sink; it attains it's height on the third day, and on the fifth or sixth day she would have no milk—in my judgment, she continued suckling the child until a recent period before it's death—I have heard the evidence as to the milk coming from her breasts and therefore it is my opinion that she must have given suck recently, if she had such a full breast as to be overflowing, as the office has stated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COOPER</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long would the breasts be before the milk would go altogether? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Three days—is my opinion, the child being without milk for three days would not bring on that emaciated appearance that I saw—it must have been sinking for some weeks, a month, or I should my more—if the mother had given it tuck within two or three days, it could not have been as I saw it—if the mother had a breast of milk, some child must have had suck, but I do not believe this child had—if disorder of the nervous system prevented the child sucking, the mother would remain un<lb></lb>relieved—I am not assuming whether she had any other child to draw the milk—it was evident that this child had not received milk for some time; there was no muscular fibre and no blood when I out into it, and so humours, they were all dried up.</p>

I kept crying still the same, and I ran after Connor, and the prisoner Ward followed me, he swore a blasphemous oath, and said, you bitch, I will soon stop you from following him; he catched me by the throat, and attempted to throttle me; I got his hand from my throat, and then he gave me another knock, and knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060083"></xptr> me down under a coach wheel, and then he left me; the other man was caught with the linen, and brought to me in five minutes after.</p>

               <p>I am a journeyman plaisterer; between the hours of seven and eight on Monday night, I was coming from Well-street, with a pot of colour in one hand, and some oil in the other, I saw a woman sitting upon a basket of clothes, and I heard the cry of stop thief! and I went and saw a man kicking and struggling on the ground, I gave him two or three good kicks, I came up to a man in a darkish dress, and there was a man holding him, and he was looking at him, they took up the man and brought him to the women with the clothes, and they ordered the people to clear the way, and she said, she was knocked down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178504060085"></xptr> by a man in a white coat, and the woman said, that man was not there.</p>
               <p>Who was that man in the darkish dress? - I cannot tell, she said, the man in the darkish dress was the man that took the bundle, and the man in the whitish coat, was the man that knocked her down; there were several people shewn her, she said the man was not there, but the prisoner Ward was there the latest of the two.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she see the two prisoners? - No, she saw one of them.</p>
               <p>Did she see either of the prisoners? - I do not know that she did.</p>
               <p>But you say Ward was there, you said just now, that the tallest of the two was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did she look at either of the prisoners? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Connor. I have nothing to say, I have no witnesses.</p>

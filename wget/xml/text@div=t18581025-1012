                  </hi>. I live at 4, John Baily's-court, Deptford, and am a labourer. On 21st September I was at the Lord Nelson public-house, Dept<lb></lb>ford, from 12 o'clock till 4—the prisoner and two other sailors were sitting there drinking; they quarrelled, and I was asked by the landlord to inter<lb></lb>fere, and keep them quiet—they were going to fight, and I tried to persuade the prisoner to put on his jacket and not fight with them—he put on his jacket and came in again; they began again, and I saw a knife nourishing about—I took it from them and threw it over the bar; I cannot say in whose hand it was—I had no sooner done that than the prisoner struck me in the face, and several blows were exchanged between us—after that he ran outside the door, and coming to the side door, said, "Make way, I will settle him"—I was standing with my handkerchief wiping the blood off one of the other men's faces, and the prisoner struck me in the back with one hand, and on the head with the other—I turned round and saw him with a knife in his hand making another blow at me, I warded it off with my arm, and it just touched my chin—he attempted to jump over the bar, but I caught his legs and prevented him—he then shut the knife up, and in doing so cut his hand—he then ran outside into the skittle ground where there is a stair-case—I followed him there, and said that I was stabbed; I felt blood running down my back and legs—the prisoner came back again and said, "They cannot hurt me, I have got no knife about me"—he was given in custody—he was not sober—I am not under the doctor's care now, I left him a fortnight ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Lord Nelson public-house. On 21st September, in the afternoon, I was in my bar when the prisoner and the other sailors were there—I asked Braddon to interfere and keep them quiet—I saw him and the prisoner have some blows together, after which the prisoner came in and said, "I shall settle you now"—Braddon said, "I am stabbed"—I said, "You do not mean that?"—he said, "Yes, I feel the blood running down my legs"—I did not see the prisoner stab him, but saw them exchange blows, and saw the prisoner shut a knife—he then wanted to jump over my bar; I shoved him back, and he pulled the gas partly down and went down the passage which leads to the skittle-ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Does Braddon come in there very often? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He does not drink very much, he comes in sometimes of an evening and has a pint and a pipe; he was there when the others came—the prisoner was a little in liquor, but quite capable of knowing what he was about—he did not go out to get a policeman to my knowledge, he went out after the fight began—he did not try to separate them, he wanted to quarrel with a man in a red shirt because he struck his shipmate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joshua Nettleton, an ironmonger, in Sloane-square, Chelsea. On the 14th of Aug., between two and six o'clock, the prisoner came, and presented me with this order from Mr. Samuel Arch<lb></lb>butt, whom we did business with—he said he came for these locks, which were on the paper—I looked them out—the order says brass locks, but I did not give him brass, I gave him twelve locks, such at Mr. Archbutt gener<lb></lb>ally had of me—they were worth two guineas; and I also gave him a saw—I asked him where they were for—he said, "For a job in Oxford-street"—we generally ask where the things are for, to put them in the book.</p>

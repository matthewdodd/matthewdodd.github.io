I am a carpenter, at 22, Queen-street Seven-dials—I was at the Crown public-house on March I—when the man was hurt I got on a barrel to see what was going on—I saw the prosecutor standing—both of them were drunk—I saw the prosecutor afterwards laying on the floor—the prisoner spoke to him—after he was on the floor the knife was used—he kicked him on the face, and said, "You—, I will stab you"—he stabbed three or four times—I afterwards saw Crockett bleeding—I cannot say whether this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the knife—it was a small knife.</p>

               <p>—on the evening of 1st March, the prosecutor was brought there—I found a wound towards the back part of his left arm, upwards of five inches in length—I cannot say positively the depth—it was bleeding very much—he had a wound on his face which was bleeding, and bruised considerably—the wound on his arm might have been done with a knife like this—I think such a knife must have been used, to make a wound of that extent—the toe of a boot or shoe might have caused the bruises on his face—the prosecutor was tipsy—he remained as a patient up to 22d March, and then became an out patient.</p>

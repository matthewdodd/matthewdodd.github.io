               <p>Q. Did the prisoner bargain at all for them? - A. He did not; I asked him whether it was real brass or only cast, and I took his word that it was real brass.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you yourself bad the misfortune to be taken up upon this business? - A. No, I had not; Mr. Rogers desired me to come to the Office at six o'clock in the evening, and I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your husband at that time? - A. At work.</p>

               <p>Rogers.

            . I live in the prosecutor's house, and lighted the prisoner to bed; when he was in bed I took his candle away, and asked if I should call him up; he said if I chose to come to bed to him I might. He did not get up till between eleven and twelve o'clock: I went to call him, but he did not answer: I called three times: I heard a noise of his walking out of the closet; then he answered me as if he had just opened his eyes. I told him the time of the day. There was a hole I could see through, and I saw he was not in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he drest or not?</p>

We got a candle and lanthorn, and went cross the road, and there we found a parcel of keys in a bag. We carried them in to the Justice.</p>

               <p>When I went to lodge there, I did not know them, nor they me. When he came to take me up, he asked me, if I did not lie at his house such a time. I said yes. I gave that woman orders to call me about ten o'clock. I was up about half an hour after ten. As to being in the closet, I never was there at all. The keys they mention were not mine. I never was possessed of them. When I came down stairs, Mr. Pool was in the bar, and there was some dispute about an overcharge: I thought it too much for my supper and bed to come to 3 s. I disputed it with him. Then he said his wife made the charge, and he could not recollect what it was for. I told him I generally paid 6 d. for a bed. Then he reduced it to 2 s. I had no other clothes on than what I had on my back. I never was out of the house neither backwards nor forwards.</p>

            . I am now a prisoner in the King's Bench. On the 10th of November I lived at the New Inn. Old Bailey - between five and six o'clock that evening I was a breast of <placeName id="t18281204-123-crimeloc646">Fleet-market, in Ludgate-hill</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Which way were you going? A. Towards Fleet-street; I became a prisoner about ten days after; I had come straight from the New Inn; I had drank nothing that day - I did not go to see the show, but was out on busines, and on the Fleet-market side; he followed me and tripped me up; there was a great crowd and confusion - I did not fall from the pressure of the crowd, but was tripped up; I felt his hand in my pocket - he was behind me; I did not count the gang, but the officers and several people said there were seven; the crowd did not push me down.</p>
               <p>Q. The man who tripped you up was behind you - how do you undertake to swear it was the prisoner? A. I looked him in the face just after I was down - there was a great crowd near me.</p>
               <p>Q. And seeing him, you conclude he is the man who tripped you up? A. Yes; he was taken immediately and searched, but no property found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see the prisoner from the time his hand was in your pocket? A. Yes, immediately I was lifted up; I did not see his face at the time his hand was in my pocket; only when I was lifted up.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street patrol. I saw the prisoner and a number more round Prater - that was the first thing I saw; I am quite certain of his person: a drove of bullocks was coming out of Fleet-market- they stopped the way; the procession had passed nearly an hour - Prater was going into crowd; these men surrounded him, and forced him on - the bullocks passed, and the crowd went on; I heard Prater cry out that he was robbed - I pushed into the crowd and seized the prisoner. who was down on his knee close by Prater; I laid hold of him, pulled him out of the crowd, and took him into a shop opposite - I searched him, but found nothing on him - Prater did not point him out, but I considered he was the man being close to him; he was tripped up before I got to the spot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he did not, in your presence, charge him with the robbery? A. No - I took him from seeing him near his person; it was between five and six o'clock, and nearly dark.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was at the corner of Fleet-market about half-past five o'clock, and saw Mr. Prater; I saw the prisoner with several others pushing about in the crowd - they were not going on, but remained nearly in the same spot; as soon as a throughfare was made, by the oxen passing, I heard Prater call out that he was robbed - he was then on the ground, and the prisoner kneeling down by his side on<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040057"></xptr>one knee; I went up and saw the prisoner draw his hand from the prosecutor's pocket - I laid hold of him immediately, and the others I believe went off, but I took the prisoner away directly; he was searched afterwards, but nothing found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any body in the crowd that was not pushing about? A.Certainly - they were all in motion, trying to go on, but they were stationary; they could not get on for the oxen - I might be two yards from Prater when he was knocked down, but I did not see it; he was down before he called out, and was surrounded immediately he fell - I pushed through them; I was behind him - the prisoner was down on one knee by the right-hand side of me, and on the right side of the prosecutor, who was on his back; I was to his left, and saw the prisoner draw his right hand from his right-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say he drew his hand from his pocket, or out of it? A. From it - I cannot swear his hand was in it.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he not down assisting the man up? A. I cannot say, but I do not think he was; there was a gas-light - I did not seize him by the hand, but by the collar; I saw his right hand distinctly, but saw nothing in it - my brother officer was on the right-hand side of him; I do not know which of us got up first.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at work till twelve o'clock that day, and said to my wife I should like to go and see this show, because they talked about Gog and Magog; I went - there was nothing of that; I was returning when this officer came and took me, and said I had robbed a man; I was going home, only the beasts coming by made me stop - I was brought up on the Tuesday morning; the prosecutor said he could not swear to me, he believed I was the man, and on the Saturday he swore I was the man, by the officer's persuasion.</p>

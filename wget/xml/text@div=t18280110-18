The prisoner lodged in the same house, in a lower room; last Thursday he came into Mary Lyon's room, where I was, and said, "Are you here, Mrs. Hicks?" he seemed angry; I turned about, and said, "I am, Brown;" he asked if I knew any thing of his quartern loaf, butter and sugar - I said, "I know nothing about it, but wait till your wife comes, and you may get some intelligence of it;" he said,"You lie, you b - y thief, my wife was not there;" he did not charge any body with taking his loaf; we told him to be easy, till his wife came in; and that she was in the room at the time, taking out a bundle of clothes, as she was afraid he would pawn them; he went away, and I went down stairs directly, to get a jug of water up, and had occasion to pass his room door, which was open - I heard him, as he was going into his room, swear by the Holy Father, that he would stick me; when I came opposite his door he came out towards me, but I did not see him coming, till he ran a knife into my left breast - I only staggered - Mary Lyons was with me - I went out to a doctor - I was able to walk there; there was not much blood from the wound. The prisoner had called me down into his room that morning, before this happened, and treated me with gin - Lyons was not there then; we first had a quartern; he drank none of that; he went out for another quartern, and had some of that - I paid nothing for the gin - I never drank with him before; it was between eight and nine o'clock in the morning - I never quarrelled with him; he stabbbed me between two and three; he was very drunk - I was not drunk - I did not attempt to strike him - I took no sugar nor butter of his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were you in my room, or out of it at the time? A. Out of it - I was on the stairs; he was never at variance with me. I never knew him behave ill to any body.</p>

            . I live in this house. Hicks came into my room with a pipe in her hand, and a bit of paper; she said something to me about being idle; she was going to the fire to light her pipe; Brown came in, and said, "Are you here, Mrs. Hicks?" she said Yes; he said, "Have you seen any thing of my loaf?" she said, "No; your wife has been in here, and, perhaps, she has taken it;" he said, "You lie, you thief; my wife has not been here:" I said, "Yes, your wife has, and brought a bag of clothes in her hand, and told Mrs. Hicks she was afraid you would pawn them;" he said,"You lie - you are a parcel of thieves." I said, "Brown, don't come here to give me any of your insolence; if you are drunk, behave yourself, or I will throw you down head foremost." He went down stairs; there are only five stairs from my room to his; Hicks followed him down, and said,"Brown, look about for your loaf, may be you may find it; or have patience till your wife comes in." He then walked back into his room; she stood on the landing-place, and I on the first stair; he walked about, and went to his workstool (he is a shoemaker); he took the knife off the stool, ran towards her, and said, "By God, you thief, I will stab you;" she slid round, and the knife came against her breast; when he struck her with the knife, she ran upon him, and said, "You villain, will you murder me;" he had struck her with the knife before she ran upon him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he strike her breast? A. Yes; he ran against her, and stuck her in the breast with the knife, and then she ran in after him into his room; as he ran in he dropped the knife by his working stool; I picked it up, and delivered it to one of the officers; there was blood came from the wound- I went for an officer.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How can you say I lifted the knife to that woman? A. I would not swear it if you had not done so; I never lifted my hand on him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I assisted in taking the prisoner; when I got him down stairs, I asked what made him use such violence; I did not threaten or promise him any thing; he said his reason was, because he had lost his bread, butter, tea, and sugar; that she was coming down stairs, and he was coming out of his door, with a knife in his hand, but he thought he was hitting her with the handle of it, thinking he had the point in his hand; he said he had struck her on the breast.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Part of the knife went into my hand, as well as on her breast. - Witness. He did not show me his hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been in his Majesty's service twenty-one years, and was knocked down for dead in an engagement in 1794: I afterwards fell down the hold of the Sultan, and am quite deranged if I take the least liquor. As to this affair, I am as great a stranger to it, as if I had never seen the light - it is their own faults; they knew my failing, and might have kept away from me, and my gin too; I found myself pennyless; my wife denies taking any thing: these two were together, and robbed me.</p>

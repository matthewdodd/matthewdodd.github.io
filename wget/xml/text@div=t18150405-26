I found my outer door broken open, the lock is in Court, it is bent; I then went to enter the chambers; and the moment I entered the lobby, a man came forward, and rushed by me, he aimed a blow at me, but I leaned back; he rushed by me, and went down stairs; I followed him; he run up the inn towards Fetter-lane; he was taken; the people that took him asked me if that was the man? I said it was; Mr. Fletcher the constable searched him; none of my property was found on him, but there was a bunch of my keys; which he dropped down on the bottom of the stairs, which I had left on my desk. The prisoner was taken to the Compter; no person was in my chambers. I missed nothing but the bunch of keys, they were found on the staircase; these are them, they are my property.</p>

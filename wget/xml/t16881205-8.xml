Mathews, gave him so forcible a blow over the head with a Stick or Cane, that stunning him, he was obliged to fall on the Bed, and from that Time languished sensless till the 4th of November, and then died. In excuse of which the Prisoner pleaded, That he was altogether a stranger to the Deceased, and that he never had any Malice towards him; but that when the unfortunate Blow was given, he endeavoured, what in him lay, to support, succor, and contribute to his Recovery, not attempting to make his Escape; But it plainly appearing that the Provocation begun and continued on the part of the Prisoner, he was found <rs id="t16881205-8-verdict35" type="verdictDescription">

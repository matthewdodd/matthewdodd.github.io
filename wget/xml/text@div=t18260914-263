            . I am a carver, and live in Tash-street, Gray's-inn-lane. On the evening the prisoner was taken, word was sent to me, that it was for things she had pawned through distress, and if I could in any way assist her, she would be obliged; I went and saw Mrs. Stote - I told her that I could not make up the money to release the things that night, but I could the following morning, and I paid 1l. 12s. 6d. to a man named Ward, who lodged there, with this proviso, that I was to pay 16s. more.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Mrs. Stote agree, if you paid this money. to forego the prosecution? A. Yes - and I paid 1l. 12s. 6d. to the man, but the Magistrate ordered him to pay it back again.</p>
               <p>MARY STOTE re-examined. Q. Did you ever agree to take this money? A. No, never in my life - I never received a single farthing.</p>

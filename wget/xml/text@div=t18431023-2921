                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, and live in Stanhope-street, in partnership with David Boobbyer. On the 14th of August, about ten o'clock, the prisoner came to my shop, and brought this order for some locks—I told him he should have them next day, if he called—I could not get them ready that day—he went away, and came next day—I told him he could not have them all—I gave him some then—he came in the afternoon, and had the rest—I handed him two dozen locks altogether, worth 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was induced to let him have them in consequence of this order, pur<lb></lb>porting to be Samuel Arch butt's, whom I knew.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable F</hi> 106.) I produce this order, which I got from Mr. Boobbyer's shopman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I sent for West to the prison, and told him where Donoghue lived, who worked for Mr. Archbutt, and gave me the order. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">prisoner's Defence.</hi> On the 14th of August, I met Daniel Donoghue in the Minories; he asked if I was at work; I said I was going to look after a job; he asked what I earned a day; I said, if I had plenty of work, I could earn 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; he said he would give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that day; he said he was sent for some locks, and did not like to go into the shop, as he owed some money which he could not pay at present; he gave me an order for 2 dozen locks; he showed me the shop, and said, "If he asks you where they are going to, say to the Edgware-road;" I came out, and told him what was said; he said, "Very well, you must go in the morning for them;" he took me to a house in Chelsea; we had a pint of beer; he went out, came in again, and gave me an order from Mr. Archbutt to Mr. Nettleton, for a dozen locks and a saw; he said, "If they ask you where they are going to, say to Oxford-street;" he then told me to meet him at the corner of Newman-street, which I did; he took me to a house, and told me to wait till he came back; he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and told me to meet him next morning, which I did; he gave me a basket, and told me to go to the prosecutor for the locks; I got 1 dozen, and was told the rest would be ready at three o'clock; I saw Donoghue in the Strand; I gave him the locks, and told him; he said, "Go for them in the morning;" I went with him to Chelsea; stopped in a public-house till two o'clock; he then sent me for the locks, and said I was to meet him there, which I did; he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him the locks; next day he came to my house, and sent me to the prosecutor's for 6 brass locks, and gave me a basket; I got them; I met Donoghue again about five o'clock; I gave them to him, and he said he must work late that night to put them on the doors; he gave me 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; on Thursday morning I went to market, and was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184310230101"></xptr>
               <p>told that Donoghue wanted me; I went to Aldgate church, and saw him; he gave me an order to go to Mr. Woods, and he refused it; I went to Do<lb></lb>noghue's house, and told his wife that I did not get them; Donoghue came to me the same night; I told him; he said, "Never mind, I will call myself to-morrow morning;" he paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and said he would try to get me constant work at Mr. Archbutt's; he went away, and I have not seen him since; I told the officer where he lived in Chelsea. I throw myself on your mercy, for the sake of my wife and children, solemnly declaring, I have been the innocent victim and dupe of Donoghue—he worked for Mr. Archbutt.</p>

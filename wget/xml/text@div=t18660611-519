I reside at William-street, Chiswick—on 28th April, I was at the Feathers public-house, having a pint of beer—William Dawes, and Henry Carter, and the prisoner and his brother came in, and wanted to kick up a disturbance with William Holmes—he wanted to fight him, and he kicked up a bother for pretty well half an hour—I said to my mates</p>

               <p>"We will go outside the bar"—the prisoner and his brother followed us out there, and I gave them a glass of beer between them—I was just going to drink, when the prisoner took the glass out of my hand, and drank the beer, and said, "I will fight you"—the landlady said, "Don't fight here"—when we got outside, the prisoners brother rushed at me and got hold of me, and while he had got hold of me, the prisoner came up with his knife in his hand, and he stabbed me under the arm, and then the prisoner's brother threw me on the ground underneath the window, and the prisoner drew the knife across my mouth—I don't know anything after that—I was taken away senseless to the hospital.</p>

I am a carpenter, and belong to the 3d Middlesex militia, and live at Ealing—on 28th April, I was at the Feathers public-house, at Chiswick—there was a disturbance there—the prisoner and his brother wanted me to stand a pot of beer—I said, "I have been drinking with some one else, and I don't want to drink with you"—then he used very bad language—I went to the bar, and the two men followed me, and wanted to fight with me—after that, they wanted to drink, and then one of them struck at me over another man's shoulders, and the prisoner's brother struck at me with a militiaman's belt which he had, across the head—I said, "Putting the belts on one side, I will fight, and if I get flogged, I get flogged," and I went out—I got the best of the prisoner's brother—the prisoner pulled out a knife and said, "I have a knife, and a long one, and I will kill any b—and be hung for six to-night"—while I was fighting his brother, he pulled out a knife and stabbed me—his brother got <hi rend="italic">bested</hi> by the last witness, and the prisoner struck him under the right arm, and they fell together, and through the fall, he drew the knife across his mouth—I saw that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of George Wray—I live at Woolwich, and am employed in the wire mills—I remember 8th October last, when I was standing at the door with my mother; I saw the prisoner, and my mother spoke to him about knocking my little brother about the Sunday before, and he began to cheek my mother and made faces at her, and I gave him a kind of knock with my fist—I do not know exactly where I hit him—he took up his knife and stabbed me with it—I saw the knife in his hands before he stabbed me—he struck me in the left side—he had the blade in his right hand—I think the blade was the downward side—I ran across the road to my mother, and hallooed out that I was stabbed—I then became insensible, and was carried off to the surgeon—the prisoner ran away, when my father ran after him—my father was not there at the time; he was washing him<lb></lb>self, and my mother called to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. I never cheeked his mother at all. We came from school, and I went for a walk down Chapel Street and bought some apples, and was going down the street and Mrs. Wray said something to me about knocking her boy about the Sunday before. I made a face, but never said a word to her. The boy ran across the road and struck me and knocked me down. I never knew how it was done. I went home. I heard him say he was stabbed. <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. I did not knock him down; he did not fall down.</p>

I am a gunner in the C Field Battery of the Royal Artillery—on 8th October I was walking up Henry Street, and met the prisoner at the bar, paring his nails with a knife—the boy that was wounded was standing at the door, alongside of his mother—he ran across the street and struck the prisoner on the left shoulder, and the prisoner turned round and struck him here with a knife which he held in this way (<hi rend="italic">describing—he</hi> then ran away, after a minute or two.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, R</hi> 220). On the morning of 23d March, about five o'clock, I saw Parfrey in Church-street, carrying a bag on his shoulder—I stopped him and asked him what he had got there—he said, "Flour"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "From Mr. Callers, in Bridge-street"—I said, "How is it you are out so soon in the morning?"—he said, "Some flour was required to be brought in early"—believing his statement I let him go—on the following morning I saw him at four o'clock, going up Wellington-street in the direction of the prose<lb></lb>cutor's house—I followed him—I saw him go to Mr. Parsons, and knock at the cellar flap with his foot—the cellar flap was opened, a man then came into the street, and it was shut as soon as the man had passed by—it was opened again, and a bag was passed out; Parfrey picked it up and put it on his shoulder—I went up to him immediately, and found the same sack on his shoulder; it is not here—I asked him what he had got there—he said, "Flour"—I said, "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "From Mr. Callers, in Bridge-street"—I said, "It has just been passed up through the cellar flap of Mr. Parsons'"—he said he was ordered to go there by Mr. Steward—I said, "Who is Mr. Steward?"—he said, "He works there at Mr. Parsons'"—I said, "You must go with me to the police-station"—he</p>

               <p>said, "Do let me go this once, Mr. Steward will give you four or five shillings to morrow"—I said, "No, you must go with me to the station"—I took him to the station, left him there, and went back to Mr. Parsons' and saw him—in consequence of what I told him Steward was given into my custody for stealing flour and dough—he said he had not taken any flour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About four o'clock in the morning—it was a very light morning; had it not been light I could have seen as there was a lamp near the cellar flap, about twenty-three yards off—the trap door was raised twice—from where I stood I was unable to discern the person underneath the flap who raised it—I gave the sack to Mr. Parsons—Parfrey was twenty-three yards from the place where I stood—I did not take him straight to the station; I took him round another way; down one street and up the next, so as not to go past Mr. Parsons' again—the putting the bag up, and the rest of it, occupied about four minutes—I did not go up to Parfrey directly he took the bag from the cellar flap, because I should then have lost Steward, he would have got away—I did not know that the only exit from the bakehouse was from the cellar by the flap, I do know now—Parfrey saw I was a police-constable—I was in uniform—I went back to take Steward at a quarter-past four; he was at his work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of Wellington-street, Deptford—Steward was in my employment about six weeks—I always examined my accounts of flour once a week—on the night before this Steward came in—it was about half-past twelve on Saturday morning—the premises were secured on Friday night—I locked and bolted the front door and another door that leads from the front room into the passage, and two other doors—there is no mode of ingress or egress into the bakehouse, except by the flap—no one was work<lb></lb>ing in the bakehouse except Steward—it is a part of his duty to call me in the morning—he called me on that morning at a little past four—I didn't get up then—he called again in about a quarter of an hour, and I then got up directly, and went down into the bakehouse to work—I had not been down more than ten minutes when the policeman came and told me what had occurred, but not in Steward's presence—the sack is not here, because I have baked the flour and dough—the bag I sent back to Mrs. Steward; it belonged to her—the value of the flour and dough was about seven shillings.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When Steward was locked in the bakehouse he had no means of getting out of the bakehouse except through the cellar flap into the street, is that so? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the flap was fastened inside so that the person inside could open it—I have been examined before the Magistrate—I said he could not get out of the bakehouse except by the cellar flap, which was left unfastened in case of accident, so that he could get into the street—we sometimes commence work at two o'clock in the morning; it depends upon the work—Mr. Chapple is my attorney in this matter—he represents himself to be an attorney—I went to him—I was recommended to go to him. <hi rend="largeCaps">STEWARD</hi>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Samuel Whatley, a cheese<lb></lb>monger in Tarling-street, St. George's-in-the-East. On the 10th of April the prisoner came to the shop—after she was gone, I missed two pieces of pork—I went after her, and just as I was going to lay hold of her, she threw the pork into the gutter—I took it up—it belongs to my master—she said she had not taken it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I had not been outside above ten minutes. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes, I saw you outside about three quarters of an hour—you had not two females with you in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I went from the hospital, where I had left my child dead; I met a woman whom I know; she asked me to wait outside, as she wanted to buy something—she went in, and I waited—she came out, and two women came and walked behind—the shopman took hold of me, though I was not in the shop at all.</p>

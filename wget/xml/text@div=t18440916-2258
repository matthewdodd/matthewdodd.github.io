                  </hi>. I live in Hungerford-street; I get my living by needle<lb></lb>work. About four o'clock on the evening of the 10th of Sept. I went with one of my neighbours to a public-house at the corner of Hungerford-street—the prisoner came and sat alongside me—he chucked me under the chin, and several ways meddled with me that I did not like—I told him to keep his hands off me—he was a stranger to me—I had a pint of beer before me—he said, "Old girl, I shall drink"—I told him he should not—on that he called me a b—b—I told him I was not so—he said I was, and a wh—as well—I directly took up the pot the beer was in, and said I would throw the beer over him—I threw it over him—he directly took up the pot, and struck me with it—I got the blow on my arm, and then again he struck me with it across the head—I cannot tell whether my arm was up or down when he struck me—my head bled very much—he struck me twice, but only once on the head, that I know of—he had attempted to strike me with his hands before, and the gentlemen in the place tried to hinder him from striking me—he attempted to strike me several times with one hand, and the pot in the other—when be struck me with the pot, the men stood before him, and tried to prevent him—I came outside, and first went to a doctor, and then to the hospital—I have remained ill ever since, and am very ill now.</p>

I went out with Mrs. Burton on this night, and went to the public-house—we sat down—the pri<lb></lb>soner was there—he came and touched her several times under the chin—she told him to keep his hands off, and if he had a wife of his own, to go home and handle her—Mrs. Burton is married—he laid hold of her pint pot, and said he would drink—she said he should not—he used a very bad word, and said be could drink out of a better woman's pot than hers—he called her very bad names—she snatched the pot from him, and <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> the beer at him—it went on his hat—with that he flew round the table and struck her with the quart pot on the side of the head—I saw two blows given—the first did not strike her because two gentlemen saved her—he struck her over the gentleman's shoulder the next blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Coach Makers' Arms, Commercial-road East, on the night in question, with John Beard. I saw the prisoner there, Mrs. Burton and Davis—I was there before them—I saw them come in—they brought some beer with them, and both the females commenced singing—they were drunk—the prosecutrix was about four feet from the prisoner at that time—I paid very little attention to the song—the prisoner said it was an Irish song, and they were Irish—the prosecutrix then poured some beer out of several pots into one, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> it at him—he took off his hat and said, "The beer has not gone in my face, now"—the prosecutrix said, "I will <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> the b—pot in your face"—she was in the act of doing so—the took up the pot, and was in the act of throwing it, when the prisoner got up and went to her to prevent her doing it—a scuffle ensued—Beard and I got up to stop them from fighting—the pot was in her hand when the prisoner got up, it was over her head—we separated them—I did not see any blow struck—when we had separated them, the pot was down on the floor—I did not see that she was wounded till she got into the front room—I then saw</p>

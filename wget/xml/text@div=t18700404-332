March, I heard a cry, looked out of my window, and saw the prisoner on his hands and knees on the tiles—I saw him open the window; and as soon as I lost sight of him I heard a crash—he had something in his hand, I could not tell what it was—I had fastened that window when I went to bed—he opened the window with something he had in his hand—I am sure it was the prisoner, I saw him by the lamp in the court—the tiles are 12ft. or 13ft. from the ground.</p>

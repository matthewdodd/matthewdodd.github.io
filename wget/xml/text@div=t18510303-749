                  </hi>. I am a coachman; I am at present living at Brompton Hospital. On Saturday, 25th Feb., I was at the House of Charity in Rose-street, Soho—the prisoner was also living there—I had a silver watch, chain, and seals, which I put on the bed about two minutes to four o'clock in the afternoon, while I went into the next room—I left the pri<lb></lb>soner sitting on the side of his bed—I returned in about a minute, and he was gone, and my watch also—it was worth 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have never seen it again—the prisoner did not come back—I saw no more of him till Mon<lb></lb>day last—it is Mr. White's dwelling-house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Is there not a back-door by which any one could have access to the room? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are back-stairs, but no one is allowed to come up them—I had heard you say you were about to leave the house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a servant at the House of Charity. The pri<lb></lb>soner lived there, and left on 15th Feb.—I saw nothing of him after that till the night of 2nd March, when I met him in Holborn—I asked him what he had done with John Clinton's watch—he said he had <hi rend="italic">blewed</hi> it—I did not know what he meant, unless it was that he had got rid of it—I told him I must give him into custody—he begged me not, and said most likely he should be transported if I did—I gave him into the custody of the first officer I met.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The gentleman before he went to bed he gave me a few halfpence to get something to drink, and among them halfpence he gave that piece of coin.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I gave her no halfpence; I gave her a pound note. This piece of copper coin is mine; it was doubled in three papers; she took this and the gold coin; it was an angel of Henry the Eighth.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you give her a note, or that in the halfpence. - A. I could not give her that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me a handful of halfpence, and among that was the copper coin; he gave me a one pound note, I returned him fifteen shillings; in the morning he had a great many more notes; if I had a mind to have robbed him I should have taken them.</p>
               <p>Jury. You said you gave her a one pound note, you did not say she returned any money to you. - A. She returned me fourteen shillings in the morning; I had no more notes about me; she was in bed when I got up. I do not know that she had been cut.</p>

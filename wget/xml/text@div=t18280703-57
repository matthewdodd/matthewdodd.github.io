            . I am clerk to Nicholas Brown and Algernon Wallington, of the Castle and Falcon Inn. On the 6th of June, the two prisoners brought a small box; I said to Jones "I want 2d." he borrowed 6d. of Edwards - I looked for the change, but they went off without it; as soon as they were gone, I missed a parcel which had been on the counter, it had come from Mr. Woods, for Lee and Sons, Coventry; I went to Jones' employers and waited till he came home, and gave him into custody - I said he had brought a parcel to our place and had a man with him; he said he had no man with him, but as we were going along, he said if I would intercede with his master he would tell me where the property was, and he told me part of it was at a pawnbroker's - from a place near his master's be took out these seven pairs of boot-tops; we then went into his master's office - Edwards was afterwards taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. It was through Jones you found the property? A. Yes: I knew he came from Mr. Weston's of Bond-street, at they have a mark on their boxes - he was not intoxicated.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he appear intoxicated when he first came? A. No: but when I took them they appeared to have been drinking.</p>

            . I took a parcel to the Castle and Falcon on the 6th of June, to go to Lee and Sons of Coventry; there were lasting, Denmark, and seven pairs of boot-tops in it; I saw it packed up - these are the boot-tops and the lasting; they have the dresser's mark on them - the Denmark is missing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does not the dresser put marks on other people's work? A. Yes; there is no mark of ours on them; the dresser is one of the first in the kingdom - four pairs of them are marked D. W. with a P at the top.</p>

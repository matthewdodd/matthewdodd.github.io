               <p>You are sure the prisoner is the person? - I am. I took him at large on Ludgate-hill, on the 23d of July.</p>
               <p>How came you to take him? - Because I knew he was at large; as soon as any of the convicts escape, word is sent to Sir John<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177909150045"></xptr> Fielding's. I belong to Sir John Fielding's-office.</p>

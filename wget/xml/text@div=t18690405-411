                  </hi>. I am a foreign commission merchant, of Fenchurch Street, under the style of P.

               <p>asked for the tickets—he hesitated, and after some minute gave them to him—we got a warrant at the Mansion House next day, and then found that the prisoner was in Whitecross Street, and had to wait till he came out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> You say I had the dessert service from you on the 15th it was the 12th. You wanted 301. for it, and I advised you to advertise it.

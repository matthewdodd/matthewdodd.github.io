            . I am a coal-dealer, and live at No. 13, Westman-street, Chelsea. On Monday morning last the prisoner passed my house, with this copper on his shoulder; I said I hoped he had got it honestly, as if he had not I knew him before, and should know where to find him; I asked how it got those dents in it; he said he had it of Mr. Lloyd, and it had been in the stable; I asked if he wished to sell it - he said he did; I sent one of my boys to get it weighed, and gave him 6s. for it. I then straightened it a bit, and found it had a hole in it, and would not do for the purpose I wanted it; I then sent for a person to buy it of me.</p>

            . On Monday last I received information of the copper being lost; Valbanoe said he had bought it of the prisoner - I went after him, and found him in a public-house; he got out, and the prosecutor cried Stop thief! I got up with him, and took him - he was taken to the watch-house, and I asked him where he got it - he said from Mr. Bosbury's on Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went to sleep in the place where the copper was; I was very hungry, and had no money. I took the copper. I have slept there night after night when I had no money.</p>

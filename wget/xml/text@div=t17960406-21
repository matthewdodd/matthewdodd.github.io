               <p>Q. Are you sure this very piece was shewn him upon the counter? - A. Yes; I have valued them at 34s. I gave more for them.</p>

               <p>I am a distant relation of Mrs. Bloomfield's, I was there by accident to buy the shawl I have now on; I saw the prisoner in Mr. Bloomfield's shop on Saturday evening, about twenty minutes past eight; he asked to look at some handkerchiefs; Mr. Bloomfield asked him if he wanted some square ones, or corner ones; he said he did not want white ones, he wanted coloured silk handkerchiefs; he made a great deal of objection, he had several pieces shewn him; he said, they were not dark enough, he wanted one darker than the one he had on, and they must be India ones; he asked Mr. Bloomfield if he had no better, he said, no, he had not; he asked him again, three or four times; he then said, they would not do, and went out of the shop; when he had got about two yards from the counter, I said to Mr. Bloomfield, he had got some handkerchiefs, they were stuffed into the sleeve of his lame arm; I did not see him take them; I did not see them till he was about two yards from the counter, when I gave the alarm; and Mr. Bloomfield and his young man ran out of the shop; I staid till the handkerchiefs were brought back by Mr. Bloomfield, the man was not brought back; Mr. Bloomfield desired me to put a mark upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that appear to be the same piece of handkerchief that you saw in his sleeve? - A. It is impossible for me to say, it was of the same colour.</p>

               <p>I am a servant to Mr. Bloomfield; I saw the prisoner come into the shop, and my master shewed him some handkerchiefs; he objected to them, and said, they were too much of the Spital-fields sort for him; he said, he wanted a better sort; he then went out of the shop, and Mrs. Fearne said, he had got some handkerchiefs about him; the prisoner immediately ran out of the shop, I jumped over the counter and went out immediately; I lost sight of him for a moment, and at last saw him running by the side of Newgate; I immediately ran after him, and he ran between the first and second coach on the stand; he turned round, and saw me very close to him, and then he went through between the second and third coach; I followed him there, and he went through between the first and second again; when I got there, he got into the broad way, and I immediately cried stop thief; I was close to him when he was stopped, and he was then detained; a man came up, and said, here are the handkerchiefs, I have just taken them from him, and gave them to Mr. Bloomfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the hearing of the prisoner? - A. Close to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see the handkerchiefs about me? - A. No. (The constable produced the handkerchiefs).</p>
               <p>Mr. Bloomfield. It has my private mark upon it, I believe it to be the hand-writing of one of my young men, it is my private shop mark; I had just been taking stock the 9th of last month, and this corresponds with my stock, within two, which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179604060017"></xptr>some of my young men think I have sold; it is an article I keep very few of, for they only bring me in such customers as these.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was going to Deptford, I am wounded in my thigh, and have got a pension for it, besides losing my arm; I have got one about my neck of the Spitalfields sort, and it is all gone to pieces, and I wanted something of the India kind, and in coming out, a young man was behind the lady, she cried out directly, the man has got something; I went out and cried holloa, you have got something; I could not run, I walked, and there was a mob, and a cry of stop thief; my friends are not here, and who could prove that I never had any thing on more than I have at present; I have been nineteen months in the French hospital, I never wore a book, or any thing of that sort, it is impossible that I could have put them into this sleeve; I will leave it to any gentleman whether my arm would uphold a hook, the French surgeons cut it six or seven times, and my thigh too; I did not expect my trial to come on till to-morrow.</p>

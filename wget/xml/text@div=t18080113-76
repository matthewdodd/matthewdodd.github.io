               <p>Q. When you gave her two pair to look at did she buy any. - A. No, she asked to look at some with heels; I went up stairs to get some, leaving a lad in the shop; I came down, she fitted a pair on and offered me four shillings; I told her we could not take it; some officers brought the prisoners into the shop in about three quarters of an hour afterwards; they produced two pair of shoes; I did not miss the shoes till the officers brought them; they were of the same description with those I had placed on the bannisters.</p>

            . I am one of the conductors of the patrol of Bow-street. On the 18th of December I was in Holborn; I saw Macrae and Wood in a stocking shop; Jennings was out side of the window; Wood and Macrae came out; they went up Holborn about twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the shop of Mr. Wasp. - A. About thirty yards; I saw Jennings standing at the corner of Chancery-lane, that is about eleven yards from Mr. Wasp's, on the same side of the way. I went down Holborn, and Jennings passed me running, she had something in her lap; I went up Holborn again; I met Macrae and Wood, they were coming down Holborn, they were between Mr. Wasp's shop and Southampton-buildings, as if coming from Mr. Wasp's shop. Macrae called out Mary three or four times, they crossed over the way and stood against Gray's Inn coffee-house; I saw them all join; I sent Lines and Preston to watch them; I went to Mr. Wasp's shop to know if two women had been there; they told me they had. I suspected they had when I missed them. From information I went over to Warwick-court, there I saw the three prisoners together I went and took hold of Jennings and Wood; Macrae run away. I got hold of Jennings with my right hand I found something drop from her; I had got hold of Wood with my left hand, I was between them; the shoes dropped close to my right foot on the side Jennings was; then we took them to Mr. Wasp's shop; when I heard them fall I stooped down and picked them up immediately; I have had them in my possession ever since; I searched Wood; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180801130063"></xptr>did not find any thing upon her. I took the prisoners to Mr. Wasp's shop, and then to the office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. It was Macrae that called out Mary; you have no doubt that the shoes that fell at your right hand were dropped by Jennings. A. No doubt at all.</p>

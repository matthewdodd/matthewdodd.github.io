                  </hi>. On 20th February last, I went to the Windmill public-house, in the New-cut, Lambeth, about half-past 6 in the evening, accom<lb></lb>panied by other officers—on entering I saw the prisoner Mac Carthy behind the bar, and Murray standing against a post which is in front of the bar—on Mac Carthy turning round and seeing me, he put his left hand in his trousers pocket, took from it this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and attempted to stuff it down the hole where the pipe leads from the bar to the cellar—at that time Murray rushed forward, and took from his right-hand coat pocket a bag, and attempted to stuff it down the same place—I called Inspector Bryant's attention to it—he picked up the bag, and I picked up Mac Carthy's bag—when I saw him putting it down behind, I seized him by the collar and attempted to pull him away—he had an iron wrench in his hand, and he held it up in a menacing attitude—it was an iron wrench for screwing nuts, about 4lb. weight—he said, "You see I am at work for this man, Mr. Brannan," meaning the barman, who stood close by—I said, "Oh yes, Mr. Mac Carthy, I see the work you are at; you were endeavouring to stuff this bag down the hole"—while I was struggling with Mac Carthy, I heard two packets drop on the floor—I looked round and saw Matthews standing close by, with her baby in her arms, with her left arm under its clothes; and from under the baby's clothes fell this packet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), which contains ten counterfeit shillings—they were all separately wrapped up, as were all the other packets—in the bag which Mac Carthy had, there were three packets containing ten counterfeit shillings, each separately wrapped in paper—I then said to Murray and Mac Carthy, in the hearing of Matthews, that I had received instructions from the Solicitor of the Mint, to look after them as dealing largely in counterfeit coin—Mac Carthy answered, "I dare say you think yourself very clever for an Irishman; that woman is innocent," meaning Matthews—the prisoners were secured, and taken to the station—I also picked up two more packets containing ten shillings each, close to where Matthews stood, but I could not swear that she dropped them—I heard two fall.</p>

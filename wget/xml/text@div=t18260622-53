On the 22d of June I went to bed about twelve o'clock - I was the last person up; the house was fastened. I was alarmed a little before two o'clock in the morning, by my wife saying there was somebody in our room; I said it could not be: she nudged me again, and said, "I tell you there is somebody" - I would not believe it, and in a quarter of an hour she got out of bed, and immediately a man spoke - I instantly got up, drew my curtain aside, and asked how he came there - it was the prisoner; he was laying on the floor, and appeared intoxicated; he said he thought it was his sister's house, and he had come there to lodge. I said, "Which way did you get in?" he said at the up-stair window, and had shut it down again; I found the up-stair window shut, and the curtains drawn - it was not broken at all. I threw up my room window, called my neighbours, and we secured him; I went down to let my neighbour in, leaving him in the room with my wife; I found the street door as I had left it. When I came up again I found these things had been taken out of the box, and laid on the floor; there were two spencers, half a yard of silk, a book, and four shifts - a basket of linen down stairs was rolled up in a blanket, and put to the ground floor window, ready to be carried away - that window was open, and the shutter also; it was fastened overnight. - The up-stairs window has a sliding sash - he could get to it by stepping on the cills of the places, as it is a low house, about fifteen feet from the ground; I never saw him before.</p>

I heard a noise in the room - I rose up, and awoke my husband; the prisoner was at last found in the room, laying on the floor; my husband went down to let a neighbour in; the prisoner kept rubbing his head, as if in liquor - he said he did not know how he got there - he had made a mistake.

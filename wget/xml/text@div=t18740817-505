Sir,—I omitted last night to give you another extract from the last edition of 'Every Man his own Lawyer,' under the head of Landlord and Tenant. My year's tenancy of your rooms dates, therefore, from the date of the expiry of your notice to quit, viz., from the 24th April, 1874, and from that date I can if I choose, (and I do choose, in consequence solely of the reputed Mrs. Micklethwaite's</p>

               <p>disgraceful and cowardly note of last night) remain a year in your house and then prove all the other conditions of your contract with me, but don't be alarmed; you will be met in the County Court on the 21st, and we shall then see whether you and your alleged wife can commit perjury as glibly as I should not be at all surprised at your doing, &amp;c, &amp;c. What your reputed wife is I was told on Sunday night, and the person who informed me declared it to be his intention to set a watch upon her and in time prove her to be what he alleged she had long been and was at present. <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT MILLAR</hi>, M.D., Surgeon-Major.

                  </hi>. I live at 124, Marylebone Road, and am a crinoline manufacturer—I have been married since 1871—I was married by license at Broxbourne—in March this year the Defendant became a lodger at my place—I have become acquainted with his handwriting—these two sheets of paper, marked A and B, are in his writing—the papers were handed to me by my servant, Annie Constant—she rapped at my bedroom door and gave them to me—the Defendant was lodging in my house at that time—this letter was also sent to me on 15th July in the Defendant's writing—before he was committed for trial he was bound over by Mr. Mansfield to keep the peace for six months towards me—that was on the 11th June—he was committed for trial after that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The dispute between us was that I gave him notice to quit and he would not leave—he said he was a yearly tenant—he never said he would quit for the sake of peace—he did not say "I will quit if I am a weekly tenant, and will pay for the last week I am there," and I did not say "You are a yearly tenant, and shall pay me for the whole year"—I gave him notice to quit on 16th April'—on 27th April there was an action in the County Court for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for gas fixings and breach of contract—Dr. Millar was the complainant—it was dismissed by the judge with 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs for me—he has entered another action since, and I believe that is now pending in the Court of Common Pleas—I don't know that there is one to be tried in the County Court on the 24th of this month—I have not received any notice—I believe it was on the 16th May there was a summons for an assault—that was when he was bound over to keep the peace—the date of the libel is the 14th of May—I believe the assault was before the libel—on the 22nd May I levied on the defendant's goods—he never proved to me he was a yearly tenant—the judge did not tell me I was wrong—he was non<lb></lb>suited—I summoned him for an assault on the 3rd June—he took out a cross summons against me, and they were both heard on 11th June, and were both dismissed by the magistrate—I don't know that he summoned my wife last week for an assault—I was abroad—I have been absent three weeks—this letter is in my handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 13th April</hi>, 1874, <hi rend="italic">and addressed to Mr. R. Millar</hi>). I wrote that letter—he had written eighteen infamous letters before that—I said it would do for black women and not for white, because he went about the house naked, without his shirt on, and I had three young girls in the house—one of the girls is here, Annie Con<lb></lb>stant—I did not hear the magistrate say he would not believe a word she said—there are three sisters, and two of them saw him go up and down the stairs only with a short shirt on—I have seen it myself, and I forbad him, and he spat in my face—I have seen him half-a-dozen times—I saw him on the boat-race day—I don't know the date—he went up and down stairs with only his shirt on, and my girls came and told me, and I saw him go into his</p>

               <p>room—he got into his room before I could get to speak to him—it was in March, I believe; it was the boat-race day, at 8 o'clock in the morning—it Was not an Indian dress of calico trousers and jacket; it was nothing but his bare flesh that was to be seen—I swear that—I said in my letter that he went to 120, but they would not let him have rooms for double the rent, as the man was a detective, and he was cautious as to whom he had in his house—I don't know who the detective was, or that the defendant ever went to 120—I thought he was a fit person for the Colney Hatch Asylum—I also said in my letter, "I shall forbid my girls coming in your rooms, and I hope you will do the same, as you have stirred the dirty water so you must drink it"—the girls used to wait upon him at breakfast, and he "went about the room in an abusive manner and a naked state, and they complained to me several times, and I forbad them to go in, and I told him I hoped he would forbid them likewise to go in—I shall know Dr. Millar is married when his wife shows her certificate, and not before—I have always treated her as Mrs. Millar, and I have been told to the contrary—I never told Dr. Millar to his face that his alleged wife was no wife of his—at the time when I forbade the girls to go into his room the lady was living with him as his wife, and also at the time when he went naked about the passages—they had a bedroom, and sitting room and bath room—I don't know that there was any detective living at 120; if there was a street named I could tell—I wrote this, "You have been to 120, but they won't let you have their rooms if you were to pay double, as the man is a detective, and he is cautious who he has in his house"—I wrote that out of my own head—he had written me sateen or eighteen insulting letters, and that was the only one I answered; his abuse has been disgraceful, and when I wanted to correct him he spat in my face—I know Mr. Friar—I recollect him coming to my house on the 16th May—that was after the libel letter—he came there to do some gas work. (<hi rend="italic">The Court ruled that evidence could not he given of what took place after the libel</hi>.) I know Dr. Millar's brother—I saw him after the libel—I don't know Mr. Maynard—there was a person came and brought some article of furniture for Dr. Millar—I can't swear whether that was before the libel—I won't swear it was not—part of this letter of the 13th May is in my wife's writing—the bottom part is not; it strikes me that is Dr. Millar's—I did not see my wife write that, and I know nothing of it—I did not tell my wife to write, and I knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>, Sixteen or eighteen letters had been sent before I answered the letter which has been put in—sometimes letters came every morning—in my letter of the 13th April I said ""You can leave at once and make room for some one else"—I was willing he should leave because he did not pay his rent—from the 13th April till 14th May when the libel was pinned to the chair I never wrote a word—he is still in my house.</p>

               <p>Edward Stone thus deposed: About 11 in the Morning, I and the Prisoners took Coach near the Queen's-Head Alehouse in the Minories: I had then 32 l. in my Pocket. We went to Bow together, and there we dined. From thence we drove back to London. Frances Field got out of the Coach, and left us somewhere about the Old-Baily; and from thence we drove to Long-Lane, where I stopt the Coach, and leaving them in it, stept out to buy a Hat and a Pair of Breeches. I did not go out of Sight, before I mist my Gold, which was in a green Purse. I presently taxed them with it. They said, For God's Sake, don't make a Noise, for Frances Field has got it, and she's gone to Islington, and there we found her. Ann Smith in particular told me, that while we were in the Coach together, she saw Frances Field put her Hand two or three times into my Fob, and at last pull out a green Purse with Gold in it.</p>

             thus deposed: I saw Ann Smith take a green Purse with Money in it out of the Prosecutor's Pocket; but they all being acquainted together, I said nothing, because I thought she was only in jest. The Prisoners in their Defence said, the Prosecutor had kept Company with Elizabeth Field three quarters of a Year; that he'd invited them all out, and pretended he'd marry her. They dined at Bow, and there he and Tom. Squire got drunk and lay down upon the Bed to sleep. As we came back he asked Betty Field to go to an Inn, and lie with  Night ; and gave her Sister Fanny a Shilling But Betty refusing to do as he would have her   D - him we had robb'd him, and he'd swear    away, if we would not consent.</p>

            ; when we got to the court, about ten yards beyond the first door, there was another door, where I could perceive a light; facing that door, about fifteen or twenty yards from the house, at the back of the house there appeared to be a stable; the front of the house is in Petticoat-lane, we went in that way because we would not disturb them; there was a wall about twelve feet high, which I got over upon a shed, and there I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179609140117"></xptr>could perceive the light more distinctly; I there saw something move backwards and forwards, which afterwards I had no doubt was a fly and a press at work; there was a blanket hanging to prevent the light being seen, but I saw over the blanket; I then got down from the shed, opened the door, and let my brother officers in; I went strait forwards to the light, and saw three men, one at each end of the fly, and the other by the dies, he had just got up; I saw him get up, he had been sitting upon a stool, he was in his shirt sleeves, and one of the others, Canter, was in his shirt sleeves; there were a great number of blanks lay by him, as if he had been seeding the dies (that was Barnard) they put the candles out immediately, there were three burning, they put two out, and the other fell down, I picked it up; one of my brother officers had a dark-lanthorn, and when he turned the horn of the lanthorn, we had a light immediately; Barnard said, don't use us ill, gentlemen, we will go with you, you have caught us at work, we know the worst of it, it is only a twelvemonth and a day; we searched the place, and found a great quantity of blanks, and some struck halfpence that had just fell from the dies (producing a quantity of blanks;) I found this bag of blanks close to where Barnard was sitting; we then took the press down, it was fixed; Barnard said, they were very unfortunate to be caught so soon, it was only the second night; we then took the prisoners into custody, there were these ropes upon sticks, fixed at each end of the fly to pull it backwards and forwards with. (The press and dies produced, and a great quantity of halfpence found in and about the press.)</p>

               <p>Q. Look at these dies, and compare them with the halfpence, and see if they correspond? - A. I should believe they were struck from these dies, this press is very good for the purpose, this is called cecil, that the blanks are cut out from, this is a pot, that with a liquid these halfpence may be boiled in, in nets, which turns their colour, in short, it is a compleat set of implements for coining.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Smith). Did you examine the hands of the prisoners? - A. No; after I had taken the press down in the out-house, I went to the dwelling-house, and there we found a cutting engine fixed on a stool.</p>
               <p>Barnard. Q. You saw three candles? - A. I am almost positive there were three.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you see them burning? - A. I do not know exactly the situation of them, because they put them out as we got in.</p>
               <p>Canter. Q. Was I not standing at the door when you put a pistol inside the blanket? - A. You were at the end of the fly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you knock me down with a pistol? - A. No. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How high is that wall, do you think you could get down such a wall without our hearing you? - A. There was some water kept running by the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, as soon as you got in, make two of these halfpence? - A Yes, I tried two of them.</p>

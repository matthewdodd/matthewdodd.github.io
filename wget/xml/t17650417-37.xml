            . I am an officer at Stratford: I was called upon last Saturday to detain a thief; he was suspected to be such, by offering saddles to sale about the streets under price. I took the prisoner in custody, and asked him what authority he had to sell the saddles; he said they were not his own, but belonged to the hostler at the White Horse and Leaping-bar, Whitechapel: not having an opportunity to go to a magistrate directly, we sent to know if there was such a person; but there was no hostler at that house: before the magistrate he said he found the two saddles in a ditch, as he was coming from Islington to Moorfields, covered with dirt; he was committed for farther examination: on the Sunday morning I went on horseback to Islington; the hostler at the Angel inn said, he recollected a Gentleman had lost a saddle or saddles; on farther enquiry we found out Mr. Simms; upon my telling him the affair, he came to Stratford and owned the saddles; his servant and a constable from Middlesex came with a warrant, and the prisoner and saddles were committed to their care.</p>

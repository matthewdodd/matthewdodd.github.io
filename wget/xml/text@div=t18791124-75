                  </hi>. I live at Forest Hill, and am superintendent in the service of the P. and 0. Company—about 2.30 in the afternoon of 21st October I was standing on the quay of Victoria Dock—I saw Mclntyre on a dummy between two vessels, the Pekin and the Denmark; I saw him in the act of taking Akook Ali up and swinging him into the water; the boy was passing him at the time on the dummy; he picked him up by the arms, gave him a swing, and threw him into the water, as he would have done a dog—I can't describe it in any other way—I think the boy was thrown out quite 12 feet from the dummy—he rose in the water—he was fully clothed, as you see him now—the water is about 28 feet deep in that part—I was standing probably 6 or 8 yards away from Mclntyre, on the quay, and I rushed down and took him by the collar as he was making his way to get on board his ship, which was just about to leave the dock—the boy was rescued by some other persons—I had not heard him say anything to Mclntyre before this occurred—I called some of my men and the quartermaster on board the Pekiu to come to my assistance, and I held the man until assistance was sent for—Hay ward was the quartermaster—I then saw Murphy take a knife from his pocket—I think he could have seen what the other man did; I don't exactly know where Murphy was standing at the time, he could not have been far away; when I first saw him he was by the side of Mclntyre, on the dummy—I saw him try to rescue Mclntyre on the dummy—he said "I will clear the way. for you to get on board your ship;" those were the words to the best of my recollec<lb></lb>tion—the Denmark was about leaving the dock, and Mclntyre's effort was to get on board to escape; the Denmark was the ship to which he belonged—Murphy produced the knife at the time he used the words that I have stated; he pulled it out of his pocket—he was secured by some of the men—the lad was taken to the doctor on board the Pekin and examined by my orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say I observed the condition in which the men were—the first thing I noticed was Mclntyre seizing the boy and throwing him into the water, that attracted my particular attention, and I prevented Mclntyre from going on board his ship—I have not said that they were both drunk; I don't believe they were—Mclntyre may have been, but Murphy was certainly as sober as I am now—I did not know the state the other man was in—I did not then know Mclntyre was a sailor on board the Denmark, I afterwards learnt that he was once a fireman on board.</p>

I am quartermaster on board the Peninsular and Oriental Company's ship Pekin—she was lying in Victoria Dock on 21st October—a little after 2 o'clock I was standing on th) quarter of the Pekin, from where I could see the dummy on which Mclntyre was, quite plainly—I saw him take the boy up by the two arms and throw him in the water—I could not say whether there was any conversation before he did that; the boy had not been on the dummy exceeding three minutes—after throwing him into the water, Mclntyre made for the vessel first of all; he made a mistake, he ran up the accommodation ladder belonging to the Pekin instead of the Denmark—I saw Captain Angrove run on to the dummy; he made a communication to me and handed Mclntyre to me—at that time the boy was being taken out of the water—I held Mclntyre, a mob got round, I dare say there were nine or ten people—I did not see Murphy at first, till he asked me to let Mclntyre go; I told him to stand</p>

               <p>still and be quiet, and speak to the superintendent, but he became restless, and he stooped down and put his head underneath my chin twice in succession for me to let him go—Murphy came towards me with a knife; he did not do anything with regard to Mclntyre, he only came towards me and Mclntyre; I then let Mclntyre go—Murphy did not say a word when he came towards me—I have seen the knife produced, I could not swear to it, it was a knife similar to that; by the handle I should think that was the same knife—Murphy held it in this position by his side, underhanded—he ran off the dummy as soon as he found I had released Mclntyre—several people belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company then came to my assistance—Mclntyre tried to get away—he attempted to get up the accom<lb></lb>modation; it was put over to the Denmark, and I called out to them on top of the Denmark to haul the ladder up to prevent his going on board—they did haul it up—both prisoners were then taken into custody and taken to the police station—I accompanied the constable on the way at his request—Mclntyre got rather restless on the way, he asked me on one or two occasions what he had done—I said "You will know more about it by-and-by ":—he said he did not know what he had done—at the police station, when I told him what he had done, he said "I did not want to do any harm to the boy, I did it out of a joke"—he was the worse for drink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said at the station that he was the worse for drink; he burst out laughing after he had thrown the boy into the water—Murphy did not strike me at all; all he did was to try and assist Mclntyre on to the vessel—I have not seen Murphy before—Molntyre would not have been so restless as he was had he lot have been pro<lb></lb>voked by a number of other men who were there belonging to the same ship; they seemed to be all accomplices together—they were seafaring people; they were about to leave the dock—this mau was rather the worse for drink, and the other men were not only encour ging him, but carrying on'their pranks as well.</p>

On the 31st of May, I left my house about seven o'clock in the evening, leaving nobody in it - I came out at the street-door, which I shut - it was fastened on a kind of latch, which was its usual fastening - there is a keyhole to the street door (seven o'clock was the last time that I went out) - I returned at one or half-past one o'clock at night, and found the street door on the latch, as I had left it - I went in at that door - I opened it with a key - there is another very strong door at the bottom of the stairs, which I had left double locked; I found that door broken and wide open, and the two patent locks on it broken to pieces - close to that door on a sideboard, in the passage, there was a crowbar, a dark lantern, and I think a clasp knife, it was a strange knife belonging to the thieves - I smelt a smell of phosphorus and heard people speaking up in the first floor - I then went out at the outer door into the street; I had no light with me when I saw these things, but the gas light is so close to my door I could pick up a pin in my passage - I went out into the street and saw but one person of any kind, that was a Mr. Cohen, I said to him there are housebreakers in my house, he refused to go into the house; I then asked him to stand on the step and watch the door, and I went in search of a policeman; I found one shortly after and returned with him; I think his name is Legg - I saw Mr. Cohen, who I had left at the door, struggling with a man, apparently endeavouring to detain him, he said the man had come out of my house; it turned out to be the prisoner - I can swear he is the man - he was taken into the house; by that time another policeman had joined us, and we all went together into the house, to search if anybody was concealed in it, but found nobody - I went up to the first floor and found a trunk broken open and all the contents on the floor, tied up apparently ready to be taken away; all the things mentioned in the indictment were collected; there was a great quantity of women's apparel, and things that were in a trunk locked up when I left the house; the trunk was broken open; there was some women's bed-gowns and a silk spencer - there are two things missing, which I have not seen since - there was a drawing of Paul Sanby, which cost thirty shillings, and in the passage I then saw a sword which had been drawn from the scabbard, and was put in the passage, apparently ready for use - I had left the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183308170005"></xptr>things secure in different places, when I went out - the sword and all, I missed altogether a woman's silk dress and a Dresden China dog; the silk dress was kept in the same trunk, and the dog stood on the chimney-piece, on the first or second floor, I do not recollect which; the sword was in the second floor room, but I found it in the passage - when we went down in the kitchen, we found another crow-bar and the kitchen cupboard was open, that cupboard had not been locked; it is where meat and bread are kept - there is a back door to the house, it was bolted inside; the things were all my property - I am not married - the female apparel was new and had not been worn, I think not, but they were my property, and had been paid for, worn or unworn - the sword and all were mine - three or four days before I found a broken picklock in the door, and they entered, no doubt, by a false key - the picklock was in the latch, I had occasion to move the latch and it dropped out of the street door, it was five or six days before this - I mentioned the fact to the police to look out; it had broken in the lock, and they had not got in - they got in, on this occasion, by a latch key - they could not get up stairs into the other part of the house, without breaking open the door, at the foot of the stairs - the things I found tied up were up stairs, and the door split to pieces with a crow-bar, and both the locks smashed - the sword was kept up stairs in a bye-corner in the scabbard.</p>

I live in Quebec-street - on the morning of the 1st of June, I saw Mr. Disney, about one o'clock, I went to his door by his request - I had not been there more than two minutes, when the door opened and two men came out, I seized them both, I got one by the collar, and the prisoner by the coat tail; the one whose collar I held got away from me; I held the prisoner till the policeman came and took him from me; he said, "I had got the wrong person, that he had come round the corner, and he was not the man" - I am certain he came out of the house.</p>

I was only the width of the flag stone from the house, and there are two or three steps up to the door; the gas lamp was close by - I do not suppose I could be more than four or five yards from the door - I was set to watch the house and was looking at the door; it opened, and the two men came out, he was one of them.</p>

On the morning of the 1st of June, I passed Mr. Disney's house, a few minutes before one o'clock, and the door at that time was closed; this was about ten minutes before Mr. Disney came home; I heard somebody calling out, Police, and I ran and saw two people scuffling together, and just before I got there, the other policeman came up - it was the prisoner and Cohen; they were scuffling - I searched him and found on him a knife, a pocket handkerchief, and a card - I went into Mr. Disney's house, and saw the door inside broken open, and I saw the dark lantern and the crow bar - I went up stairs and saw things scattered about the room, and a trunk broken open, and some ladies' wearing apparel about - I did not see the sword.</p>

            . I am a policeman. On the morning of the 1st of June, I went to Mr. Disney's house, a little after one o'clock - I saw the prisoner and another leave the house; I am sure I saw him leave the door of the house, and Cohen seized them both; one escaped from him, and the other was struggling with Cohen when I went up and took hold of him; the prisoner is that man - I afterwards went into the house and found the inside door broken, and saw a crow bar and dark lantern laying on the sideboard - I went up stairs on the first floor and saw another door broken; I went into the room and saw different articles of women's wearing apparel laying about on the floor - I saw a trunk also which was broken open - I did not see the sword - The prisoner said he was not the man, that he had come round the corner; I am certain he did not come round the corner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before the witness went up, he and Cohen were speaking together; he had been speaking to him all the time - the evidence is quite different to the former trial - I made a defence before, and therefore must throw myself wholly on your mercy; but on the 6th of July, one Henry Nyman was tried for burglary, and found guilty, at the conclusion of the sessions, he and seven others were brought forward, and the judge told them that in consequence of a doubt of the bills being right the court gave the benefit to the prisoners - I trust you will give a similar benefit to me.</p>

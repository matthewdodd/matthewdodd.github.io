                  </hi>. I am a policeman, stationed at Ealing, No. 137 T. On the 20th of Jan., about four o'clock in the morning, I was on duty in the Uxbridge-road, near Ealing, and between the Green Man and the Coach and Horses, I met two of Messrs. Fountain's wagons—I did not see either of the prisoners at that time—the wagons were loaded with flour—I saw a truss of hay behind each wagon—in consequence of information, I folded a piece of paper, and put a piece into each truss—the teams stopped at the Coach and Horses, as I expected they would—while there I saw Newell, who is ostler at the Coach and Horses, take a truss of hay from behind each wagon, and place it in the shed where he keeps the corn—it was clover and grass toge<lb></lb>ther—Barber and Foster were not standing by—they were in the house, I believe—I procured assistance, and went after the teams—I asked a boy, who was with the wagons, if they had left any hay at the Coach and Horses—he said, "No"—the prisoners Barber and Foster were one in each wagon—I spoke to the boy loud enough for them to hear—I then asked Barber, and he said he had—he did not give me any reason why he had done it—I then went to the other wagon, and asked Foster if he had left any hay there—he said he had not left any, and never did leave any, and did not know that any was gone—I then went to the Coach and Horses, and found the two trusses of hay in the shed—they were the same which I had marked—Newell had been to bed—he got up, and came down to the door when I went to his house, I asked if he chose to give any account of how he became possessed of the hay—he said, "I sup<lb></lb>pose</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184702010006"></xptr>
               <p>you know how I got it"—I asked him if he had any objection to my taking possession of it—he said, "If you take it away, I shall expect you to bring it back again, but you may take it if you like"—on their return with the teams from London I took Barber and Foster into custody—I knew the wagons of Messrs. Fountain—Barber and Foster were in the habit of coming up with them—I have seen them stop at the Coach and Horses.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Barber.</hi> I was riding on the wagon, and heard him say to my little boy, "Have you left any hay?" I looked out of the wagon, and said, "Yes, be<lb></lb>cause I had more than my horses would eat, and my hay would be all right when I came back." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not hear anything of the sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Foster.</hi> I did not know the hay was off the wagon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Newell.</hi> The policeman called me up; he was standing at the door, drinking with me when I went to take the hay in; I had been having three parts of a pot of beer with him. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I had been drinking with him in the course of the night, but not then—after he got the hay he asked me if I would have part of a bottle of sherry, or some brandy and water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Barber.</hi> The policeman told me himself that he stood at the door at the time Newell took the hay and put it in the shed, and he said, "I am going to take it and put it in the shed till the men come back." <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> He did not say anything of the sort—he tried to prevent my seeing where he took the hay to—he went round the back of some carts, instead of going straight up the road.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-constable T</hi> 131.) On the 20th of Jan., at five o'clock in the morning, I went with Champ to the Coach and Horses, and found the two trusses of hay with the paper in them, which he had put there—I asked Newell how he accounted for the possession of them—he said they were left there by Mr. Fountain's men—I told him I should take possession of them till I had communicated with Mr. Fountain—I took Newell into custody, with the hay.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">EDWARD FOUNTAIN</hi>. I am in partnership with my brother, as millers at Hillingdon. Barber and Foster have been in our service—they were so on the 20th of Jan. last—it was their duty to drive two wagons laden with flour early that morning—I have seen the two trusses of hay taken by the police<lb></lb>man from the Coach and Horses at Ealing—I believe it is my property—the prisoners had no authority whatever from me to leave, or consent that Newell should take any portion of my hay into the Coach and Horses—my instru<lb></lb>ction were for them not to take any quantity that they could make away with—they were not allowed to take half the quantity they did take—they took what they had, themselves—I have told them repeatedly what they were to take, and they both knew—that day the horses went twenty-two or twenty<lb></lb>three miles out—they had other bait in their nose-bags, independent of the hay—I know of no reason for leaving either the trusses, or any other quantity of hay belonging to me for my horses at the Coach and Horses, or I should not have appeared here as a prosecutor—they would come back to the Coach and Horses and have a bait there—that was their only baiting place—if they wanted hay, it must have been to feed the horses on the road—they had a sack of bran, chaff, and beans, besides the nose-bags—I had refused them having hay for some time, and they reported that their horses did not go on as well without it, and I allowed them to take a small quantity for the purpose of feeding on the road, and only that—I allowed them to put up at the Coach and Horses for bait, with what they had with them—they had my orders expressly not to take hay in trusses behind the wagon for the purpose of the horses—the quantity they had, exceeded what they could have any occasion for.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Barber's Defence.</hi> The reason I left my hay behind was, that the man that cuts the chaff had not been well, and we had no chaff for our horses; the truss I had behind my wagon I opened on Tuesday afternoon, and cut some to take with me to London on Wednesday morning; I cut a bit to put into the nose-bags, and another bit to give them in London; I gave the ostler charge to take care of the rest till I came back.</p>

            . I am a policeman. I was on duty about 150 yards from the prosecutor's house, and met the prisoners - Redding was carrying a bag of fat on his back- I did not stop them then; but afterwards hearing a noise at the back of Mr. Brewer's premises, I made inquiry - I then went in the direction they had gone, and met the prisoners in about twenty-five minutes coming from a brick-field, where they had hid the fat - they were wiping their hands on dry straw, and they were all over fat; their hands and faces also - I took them both in custody; and found the fat in the brick-field which they were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183404100070"></xptr>coming from, concealed under some straw - they did not work in the brick-field - there was about 25lbs.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer at Chingford. On 23rd Feb, my attention was called to the loss of some hay from my shed, and I observed marks of something being passed over my paling, near the shed—I traced it across the fields about 300 yards, to Webb's garden, where I found nearly a truss and a-half of hay, which I identified—in consequence of a question I put to Webb, he opened a shed door and I took up some hay, and said, "This is my hay, and I will swear to it"—I found Kirby lying down near the hay, and I asked him if he knew anything about it; he denied all knowledge of it, and so did Webb—he said he did not know how it came there—I sent for a policeman, and when he came Webb begged for mercy, wished me to settle it, and said he would pay me for it—Kirby has worked for me several times.</p>

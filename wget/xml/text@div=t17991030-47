               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. It weighed near thirteen ounces, it is worth full three pounds. On the 26th of September, about a quarter before eight, I was opening the shop, I had carried part of the shutters up the passage to the private door; I was coming back for more shutters; I saw the prisoner, and Mr. Boggis called to me to come to his assistance; in looking round upon the grating of the kitchen window, under the shop window, I saw this tea pot; I suspected the pot had been stolen, and helped to secure the prisoner; in one hand he had got this knife, which Mr. Boggis has produced; we continued holding him till the knife was taken from him; we secured him, put him in a coach, and took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are the brother of the prosecutor? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you in partnership with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose tea pot was this? - A. I do not know; a stranger brought it to me.</p>
               <p>Q. He is not here to give any account of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it of a modern make? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not so modern perhaps but it may have been in use two or three years? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Independent of the fashion of the thing, do you mean to say, it is worth three pounds? - A. I think it is worth more; it has the weight marked at the bottom, thirteen ounces five penny weights, which I observed when it was brought to me the night before.</p>

I do not recollect the day, but I saw Mr. Boggis and the prisoner struggling very hard in the middle of the street; I instantly called somebody into my shop, and I went out; the prisoner had got a knife in his hand, I laid hold of his arm, and somebody took the knife from him; Mr. Cording then came up to our assistance; I went over to Mr. Cording's shop door to endeavour to prevent his windows being broke, and I saw the silver tea pot upon the grating, under the shop window; there was a labouring looking man standing by, who said, what is this, and he immediately gave it into my hand; I took it into the shop, and staid there till the man was secured.</p>

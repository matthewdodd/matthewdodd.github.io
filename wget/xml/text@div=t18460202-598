                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Parkfield-street, Islington; it is my dwelling-house; Caroline Beckensall is my sister. On Friday morning, the 16th of Jan., at a quarter-past six o'clock, I was in bed in a sound sleep—I was awakened by a noise of a person moving about in the back room, which is separated by folding doors from where I was—one of the doors was ajar—I was afraid my wife would be alarmed, and I said, "Stop, stop, stop!"—there was a noise as of a person escaping—he stumbled over the mat in the passage, and made a great noise—the street door was opened and slammed to—I had hung my great coat behind the door in the back room where I had heard the person, and from which the person escaped—I went into the pas<lb></lb>sage—I found the street door shut—the policeman brought me my coat—this is it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When the coat was taken off my back the sergeant took it to the prosecutor, and asked him if he could swear to it; he said no, it was very like it. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> No—I know it by a particular mark—one pocket, which was worn out, I had lengthened and made longer than the other—I have not the least doubt about it being mine—I never expressed a doubt about it.</p>

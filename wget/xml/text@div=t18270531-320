            . I am in the employ of Mr. Brooks, a merchant, of Sambrook-court; this bill was delivered to me on the 30th of March, by Oulds, to the best of my recollection; he often delivered goods; I paid him 4s. according to the ticket; to the best of my belief it was two shillings and a half-crown piece; he said he had no change; I told him he might take the man who had assisted him with the goods, and spend the 6d. over the way; he had delivered five sacks of potatoes and some bacon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Can you, with certainty, say you paid him two shillings and a half-crown? A. To the best of my belief it was - I recollect giving him the 6d. over - I had received parcels from him before, and am certain he brought these - I am sure I gave him one shilling.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Sepulchre. I took Marshall into custody about a month ago - I neither threatened nor promised him any thing - I told him I took him for making bad entries in Mr. Hearn's book - he told me, at the top of Newgate-street, that he was drawn into this case by the two porters, Oulds and Satchell.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What case? A. This case of felony - he said, "I was drawn into it by the two porters" - this was as he was going to Guildhall, to be examined on this charge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he was first taken did he say any thing? A. He fell down on his knees to Mr. Hearn, who said, "I do not want any of that nonsense."</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS to S. JESSOPP. Q. Do you keep the accounts of the office? A. I receive all monies from the porters - this would be entered in the book B.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you receive it? A. Oulds comes to me and accounts for monies he receives for different parcels - Marshall enters it in the book B. I check it off from that book into the cash-book - when Oulds brings the money he pays it to me only - he ought to do it every night; but never less than every other night - he might bring me 3l. or 4l. I have an account of the payment made on the 31st of March, be paid me 4l. 14l. 8d., - I entered that in my cash book, it is not here; it should appear in this book B - the items are entered here and the different sums. I and Oulds cheque them off from the delivery book B. Marshall had nothing to do with the money - he was only to enter the parcels and deliver the tickets to Oulds.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Then, when goods arrive from the country. does Marshall take an account of them and make out the tickets for the porters to deliver? A. Yes; he enters on the ticket the amount charged - and in the evening the porter gives me what he has received, and I tick it off in this book. I enter the gross sum in the cash-book - the fraud could not be effected but by the joint operation of Marshall and Oulds - if Marshall had entered the 4s. in the book, Oulds must have accounted to me for it; as it would have drawn my attention to it, and I should have had to demand the 4s. of Oulds.</p>
               <p>MARSHALL's Defence. (written.) I have just to say, that if I made out the tickets it was with proper charges, and if anything happened afterwards the account was made to Jessopp; I knew nothing about it. I have a wife and four children to support.</p>
               <p>OULDS' Defence. The way of settling was sometimes twice a week or oftener. As soon as we settle the book we cut the leaves out. I had no opportunity of knowing whether any money was deficient - if any was short I had to make it up.</p>

He had a delivery-book, which he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182705310121"></xptr>took it out that day, I cannot say - Marshall made that book out, as he called the parcels over to the porter - the leaves are all here - as soon as they are full they are taken out and filed - they are all here - the goods of this date are entered here, but these are not there.</p>

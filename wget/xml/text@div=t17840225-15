               <p>On the 21st of December I lost my cloak, a little after six in the evening, I was going up <placeName id="t17840225-15-crimeloc84">Constitution-hill</placeName>

               <p>In what manner did they stop you? - The first man just passed me, and the other immediately spread out his arms and stopped me, the prisoner at the bar turned about, and put his hand on my mouth, and said if I spoke a word, he would kill me immediately, I pushed him off me, and begged he would let me alone, and let me go about my business.</p>
               <p>What did they do or say about that? - They said if I spoke a word they would kill me immediately.</p>
               <p>Did they take any thing from you? - Yes, my Lord they took a black sattin cloak from me.</p>
               <p>Did they take any thing else? - The prisoner took my patterns out of my hand.</p>
               <p>Did they go away when they had taken them? - They went away, and then I was going after them, and they turned about and saw me going after them, and they came up to me again and threatened me if I stirred; the prisoner put something to my face, and said, did I see that, I said yes and they desired me not to stir, and I said I would not.</p>
               <p>What was that he put before your face? - I do not know, I was so frightened cannot tell.</p>
               <p>They did not attempt to any thing else from you, did they? - No.</p>
               <p>Did they ask you for any money? - No.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards was the prisoner taken? - They both of them set a running again, and I run after them, and as soon as I saw somebody coming, I called stop thief; the other was taken and tried last sessions, the other man was stopped just by the Queen's Palace; the prisoner was taken the 26th of January.</p>
               <p>How came he to be taken up? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Was your cloak and pattens ever found? - No.</p>
               <p>Was any body with you when you was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250046"></xptr> robbed? - No, Sir, nobody but myself.</p>
               <p>What light had you by which you saw these two men? - It was just under a lamp where they robbed me, just by the Queen's Palace, that side next to the Queen's Palace, not in the Green Park.</p>
               <p>Had you any light but that lamp? - No.</p>
               <p>You was very much frightened at his stopping you? - I was not so much frightened then.</p>
               <p>The prisoner passed you and turned back? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then at first your back was to the prisoner? - He was not above a yard or two from me.</p>
               <p>Was not you very much frightened when the prisoner put his hand over your mouth? - I thought it was some man that had a little liquor, and so I did not mind it.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to say that you had opportunity enough to observe the prisoner by the light of that lamp to know him again, at above a month's distance? - Yes, they stopped so long with me, they were with me six or seven minutes, the Justice sent for me, there was a cloak found in his pocket, and I went to see if it was mine, but it was not, and then Mr. Bond told the man to take me over to the publick-house, and there I saw the prisoner, there were a matter of thirteen or fourteen prisoners with him, I knew him as soon as ever I saw him.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that he is the man? - Yes, I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When that woman came to Bow-street when I was as a prisoner, she came into the office backward, and was asked if she knew any person that were present, she looked at me several other persons, and said she knew nobody, Mr. Wright said, what, do not you know any body? she then came and looked at me, and when she looked at me, she said I was not the man, she was present when I was examined, the man was brought to swear to me, he declared I was not the man, he should have known me.</p>
               <p>To Prosecutrix. Is this so? - No, he was in the middle, and I knew him direct.</p>
               <p>Did you say at first that you knew nobody there? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>I went by Sir Sampson's orders, on Monday the 26th of January, with Mr. Macmanus and several more down into Essex to search for them, and we found the prisoner and five other old offenders, in searching this man a cloak was found, and notice was sent to the girl, and she was ordered to attend; I was not at the office when she came.</p>

               <p>I did not think my trial would have come on, therefore I have nobody present, the other person that was robbed in the Park before did not know me; nobody knew me: but by the persuasions of Mr. Wright, that woman said she knew me; there were two men and a boy were called upon, and none of them knew me, only this gentlewoman by the persuasions of a man, swore to me for the lucre of gain. I had called in at a house to receive some money, for some coals for my father.</p>

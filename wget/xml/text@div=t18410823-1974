                  </hi>. I am a watch-maker, and live in Holywell-street, Strand. On the evening of the 18th of July, I was in Fleet-street. near Farringdon-street—I saw the prisoner—he crossed from the opposite side of the way, and came in front of me—I went to the right, and he also went to the right—I then went to the left, to allow him to pass, and he again got before me—I then stood still, that he might pass which way he thought proper, and he made a snatch at my pin—I saw it in his hand—I caught hold of his hand—he tore it away from me, and endeavoured to pass the pin away to a second party—I caught hold of the second party's hand, consi<lb></lb>dering he had the pin, and the prisoner ran away—a policeman went after him, and brought him back—I still held the other party, and he was taken to the station—the pin was afterwards produced—I made it myself—I saw something blue in the prisoner's hand, which I believed to be the pin—I caught his hand very near my face with it—when he obstructed me I looked in his face, to ascertain whether he was in liquor, previous to his taking the pin.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No</hi>. 375.) On the 18th of July, about a quarter-past ten o'clock at night, I was passing by the corner of Poppin's-court, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor quite close together—the prosecutor said, "I have been robbed of a pin"—the prisoner immedi<lb></lb>ately ran up Poppin's-court, up Harp-alley, and into Shoe-lane—I fol<lb></lb>lowed, and a brother officer stopped him in King's Head-court—on the following morning I found the pin lying in the carriage-way, about twenty yards down Poppin's-court, in the direction in which the prisoner ran, and about twenty yards from where it was taken from the prosecutor—it ap<lb></lb>peared to have been stepped upon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time did you find the pin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About half-past three o'clock in the morning—I was looking for it, knowing the prisoner had run that way—it was not pointed out to roe—I found it my<lb></lb>self—no one else was present—when I first came up, the prisoner and prosecutor were standing at the corner of Poppin's-court—immediately the prosecutor told me he had the pin, he ran away down Poppin's-court, and up Harp-alley—I was close to him—I only lost sight of him in crossing Shoe-lane—he was stopped about five yards up King's Head-court, and I took him there—I only lost sight of him once, and that not for a minute—he only turned one turning—I can swear he is the same person I saw in Fleet-street—I noticed his face once or twice so as to know him again—I did not hear the prosecutor say he thought the prisoner had stolen the pin—he said he had robbed him of it.</p>

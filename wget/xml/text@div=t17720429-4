I heard a noise. I asked the maid if she had fastened the window. The street-door was on the latch; and the windows were fastened. At first I thought it was the cat. I went into the parlour with the candle in my hand, thinking it was the cat; and I saw the prisoner go out at the window. The door fronted the window. I called out that there were rogues and thieves in the house. A young man was coming in; he run after the prisoner, and stopped him. I did not see the prisoner's face.</p>

            . I lodge at Mr. Sheild's. On Saturday night the 18th of April, about a quarter before twelve, I was coming home to my lodgings. When I was at some little distance from the house, I saw a light in the parlour; and, as I passed by the parlour-window, the shutters were violently thrown open against me. I thought it had been the maid, and called out what are you about, but received no answer. I stopped about a minute, while I scraped my shoes, when the prisoner jumped out at the window. In a moment after that, I heard Mrs. Sheild cry out there are thieves in the house. The prisoner ran away; and I pursued him up Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this Martlet's-court?</p>
               <p>Macardel. One end comes into Bow-street, the other into Russel-street. He turned into Broad-court, at the top of Bow-street; I still kept on; he turned about, and asked me what I wanted. A chairman came up, and we both laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other man in your pursuit of this man?</p>
               <p>Macardel. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the man that turned round in Bow-street was the man you saw come out of the window?</p>
               <p>Macardel. Yes, I never lost sight of him, but just as he turned the corner; we seized him. Mrs. Sheild examined the room, and a pier-glass was moved a little off the skrew; the glass was hung upon a skrew. I don't suppose that was done with an intent to be taken away; I suppose it happened by his endeavouring to get out at the window. We searched further; but we did not miss any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. from the Prisoner. How far was you from the window when the man jumped out?</p>
               <p>Macardel. I was at the door, near the window.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had the man got when you began the pursuit?</p>
               <p>Macardel. About ten yards; he had a particular dress; he was in a round hat.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Great Missenden, and am a coach proprietor. I have horses standing at the George Inn, Uxbridge—Stone was my horse-keeper for more than six years—I purchase oats and beans of Mr. Adams, a corn-dealer, at Uxbridge—on the 5th of March, there ought to have been a mixture sent into my stable of two different kinds of oats, and a trifling mixture of barley in three sacks—there had been some beans delivered some days before—the three sacks ought to have contained twelve bushels.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a corn dealer. On the 5th of March, about a quarter before ten o'clock in the morning, I supplied Mr. Woodroff with three sacks of Scotch oats, English oats, and a mixture of foreign barley—they were so peculiar that I can swear to them—this is a sample of what I sent—here is a little foreign barley amongst them—I have not the least doubt about this being part of what I sent—I cannot positively swear to the beans, though I have not the least doubt about them—I sent them in Mr. Bourne's sacks, of Brentford.</p>

               <p>the 6th of April, about a quarter past eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoners standing in the road, over something—I walked up, and asked what was the matter—East said he had got two sacks, which had come undone, and he wanted to tie them together—he afterwards got them on him, one in front of him, and the other at his back; and Stone went into his own house, which was nearly opposite the spot—East walked along—I walked by his side, and asked what he had got—he said some corn, oats, beans, and brans, which he had had of Messrs. Busby and Bassett—I put my hand on the sack whieh was at his back, and asked if he had that at Bassett's—he then said, "I have brought all I have got from Giles" (which is a beer-shop)—he repeated that several times—I took him to the station, and then he said he did not know what was in the sacks at all—this is a sample of the oats that were in the sack, which was marked with the name of Bourne.</p>

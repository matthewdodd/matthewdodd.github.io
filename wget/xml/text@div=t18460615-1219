                  </hi>. I am the son of Thomas Knight. He has a farm at Enfield-highway—Larman was his carman, and Thorogood was his hay—binder—on the morning of the 30th of May I told Larman to go to the shed in the marshes and fetch a load of hay for the horses, with a one-horse cart—the distance is about two miles and a half by the road—I told him to go through Ponder's—end by Thorogood'8, to get the key of the shed—I afterwards beard that Larman had been detained by the police—I, sent for the cart, and found it bound down properly with the tilt over it—I had the trusses counted, and found thirty-one—there ought to have been thirty-six—Larman had no business to stop at the Goat, or at the White Hart, or anywhere—those houses ara in a direct line from the marshes to oar bouse, but not in the way I ordered them to come home—I saw some hay produced by the policeman—it corresponds with the hay that was in the shed—there was a quantity bound there—I could not swear to it, but I believe it is the same.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. On the 30th of May I was at Ponder's-end—my attention was drawn to a load of hay opposite the Goat—I saw Larman and Thorogood with it—they were drinking together—I hid myself, and I saw Larman come into the road—he looked towards the spot where I was concealed, and near where I had been standing before for a short</p>

               <p>time—he then returned to the front of the public—house, and shortly afterwards Thorogood came to the road—he looked in that direction, and returned, and they drank again, and afterwards one of them came out, but I cannot say which, and he looked towards the spot again, and returned—shortly after the third time of their coming into the road, the cart was driven off towards Mr. Knight's—the White Hart is between there and Mr. Knight's—I went on there, and I saw a man come out from the yard, and from noticing his manner I hurried on—when I came in front of the yard of the White Hart, I saw Hunt at the bottom of the yard with a truss of hay in his hand—he was just inside the door of the stable—I could not tell where the cart was then, but I hurried round to the other side of the house, and met Thorogood coming from where I afterwards found the cart, which was behind the public—house, within four or five yards of the stable—I then saw Hunt shutting the stable-door, and he walked away—Larman was on the wheel of the cart where the load of hay was, and I saw a quantity of hay was littered from the cart towards the stable—door—I opened the stable-door, and went in—I saw the three trusses of hay, which I afterwards produced to Mr. Knight—they were in one of the stands on the left-hand side of the stable—there was no other hay there besides those three trusses—I then said to Larman, "What are you about here, come down and take that hay out again?"—he did not make any answer—I repeated the question, and he said, "What hay do you mean?"—I said, "That hay that you put in the stable"—he said, "Well, don't be in a hurry"—he then went to the stable, took the three trusses of hay out, and put them down by the cart—it was put on the cart—I took it to the station, and the cart afterwards went back to Mr. Knight's—when Larman brought the hay out of the stable, I said to him, "Is that your hay?"—he said, "Yes, Mr. Knight's; I took it off the cart because it hung"—the White Hart is not a mile from Mr. Knight's—there is a ford which they must go through to go to the Goat and the White Hart—there is no ford the other way—I kept Lar<lb></lb>man in custody till I got assistance—I then took Hunt and the other matt who was discharged—Thorogood was brought to the station on the Monday morning—I told him I should detain him for being concerned with Larman in stealing that hay of Mr. Knight's—he said, "I was not there at all"—he was the man who was drinking with Larman at the Goat, and who was close to the cart at the White Hart—there is no doubt about that—Hunt is ostler at the White Hart—I was present when the trusses of hay were counted—there were thirty-one—I have compared the three trusses of hay I took with the hay on the cart—they appeared to agree—I know the writing of Mr. Williams the Magistrate—this is his writing to this deposition—it was read over to Tborogood.</p>

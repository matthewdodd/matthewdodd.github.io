On the 8th of March I was in St. Paul's-churchyard—the prisoners passed me, one on one side of me, and the other on the other—as Williams passed, he said, "George," and pointed to Davies—I saw Davies go and lift up the prosecutor's pocket, and take this handkerchief out—I did not then know who the prosecutor was—I collared the prisoners, and called out, "That gentleman has got his pocket picked"—the prosecutor then turned, and I knew him—I said to him, "Mr. Jones, I want you"—the handkerchief was put out of sight, but I saw it afterwards close by the prisoners' feet—I left the prisoners in the care of Mr. Jones.</p>

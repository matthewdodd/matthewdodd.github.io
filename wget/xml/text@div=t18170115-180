I put up my hand to take care of my bundle, which was on my shoulder; the other women swore they would murder me - I was alarmed; the prisoner went away and I got out, and told the patrol, and described the prisoner to him. I saw her again in about five minutes. I am sure she is the person. She was searched, and a 6d. found on her, which I described to the patrol before I saw it; it has a figure of 3 marked on it.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM COATLEY. The prosecutor came to me about half-past six o'clock, and described the prisoner to me, he pointed out the place. I apprehended the prisoner about ten minutes after, at a public-house just by. The prosecutor laid hold of her, and said, she was the woman; he said he had lost 20s., and a 6d. marked with a figure of 3, which he could swear to. I searched her, and found a 6d. on her, and 7s.; he knew the sixpence when he saw it. He was quite sober, (I produce it).</p>

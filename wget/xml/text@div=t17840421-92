            : Gentlemen, the facts to bring this charge home to the prisoner are short. The prosecutor on Thursday the 5th of February was walking along St. James's-street, Covent-garden, when he was accosted by a person he did not know, and they got into conversation; they soon stopped, and stooped and picked up something, which upon examination proved to be a purse; he immediately said to the prosecutor. I have been so fortunate as to pick up a purse, and you are intitled to half of it; the prosecutor,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270125"></xptr> who has returned from Gibraltar, was highly pleased with his good fortune, and fell into the trap; they went into a house, and were soon followed by the prisoner; and when he came in, says he, Gentlemen, has any thing extraordinary happened; no, nothing extraordinary, only a purse found; says he to the man, did you find it, was that gentleman in company with you? yes; Oh! then he is intitled to half certainly; to be sure, no doubt of it: one end of this purse contained a receipt from some eminent jeweller, for two hundred and ten pounds, paid for a brilliant diamond cluster ring; and in the other end of the purse was this diamond ring; pray, says the prisoner to the other man, have you any money; says he to the prosecutor, have you any money; says he, I have none about me; perhaps you have got some at home; yes: so they all three got into into a coach, and away they went to this man's lodgings at Chelsea; he had only twenty guineas and four doubloons; it was then proposed, Sir, you have the ring and I have this twenty guineas and four doubloons; and, Sir, I will have the ring myself, and return you one hundred pounds for your share, and proposed to meet the prosecutor at the Chequers; the poor man, mightily pleased, called at the Chequers, and might have waited from that time to this, for neither of the gentlemen ever appeared; application was made to Bow-street, and those gentlemen described who were very well known there, and Mr. Moor was taken into custody, he affected to return part of the money, the poor man would gladly have received it, and 13 l. odd was given back, the remainder was not paid; and the Magistrate told him, you cannot do it, the justice of the country requires that this man should be brought to justice: Gentlemen my Lord will tell you that this is a complete robbery; for wherever a person makes use of a fraud to get into their possession the property of others, fraud will not excuse the felony; these very cases have been submitted to the twelve Judges, they have determined this offence to be a complete felony: Gentlemen, the next question will be for you to judge, whether the prisoner was or was not concerned with the other man, and whether it was not a scheme to rob and plunder the first man that they met with; the prisoner goes into a public house and interferes as an innocent man would not have done; then goes into the coach to this man's lodgings at Chelsea, and comes away with the other man, then when he is taken up he offers to make restitution, these are for your consideration: If he is connected with the other, he is equally guilty of the felony; of that there cannot be a doubt in point of law, but if the facts do not warrant your verdict of Guilty, in that case you will acquit him.</p>

               <p>Court.

               <p>I took and read the receipt, says I to him, this is some gentleman that has dropped the receipt; however, says he, I have got the bird as well as the nest, and he opened the other end and produced the ring, (the ring produced) he gave me the ring to look at, and I returned it to him again; as we were talking together, in comes the prisoner Humphry Moore, rubbing his hands, with a glass of brandy; gentlemen, says he, is there any thing extraordinary, like a savage peeping out of a wood; yes says this other man, but I believe it is not worth mentioning, and he produces the receipt to Moore; he read it, O, says he, this is only some lady that has dropped it; O, but said Moore, with a large oath, it was the finest thing that ever he saw, which of you picked it up? it was me, says he; O, says the other, it is no matter, I suppose this gentleman was with you; yes, says he, I am a countryman come out of Shropshire, I carry on business, my wife is in the grocery, I come up here to buy some goods, I have an order here for three hundred and fifty pounds, mentioning the merchant's name; O, says he, I know him very well, he is just gone out, I was with him just now for cash; he said to me, what are you doing here? I suppose you are a serjeant, I said yes, perhaps you have some money, says he, I will be willing to settle it with you, as we are both strangers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. Had you differed before that at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Had either of you desired him to enquire into the business? - Not a word, he said to the gentleman, have you no money? no, I only brought a guinea and half to London with me, and my supper and my bed, and a friend drinking with me, I have very little left; says he, I shall have plenty tomorrow; says I, if you have not money, you had better advertise the ring; no, no, says he, we must not advertise it; I should have bought such a ring to have made a present to Lord Derby; as I do not want money, I will give you your share if you can be content till to-morrow, nine o'clock; the prisoner says to me, have you any money; I said I had none about me; have you any at home; I told him I had; can you get it if we go home with you; to be sure I can, says I; how much money do you think you have at home; I do not doubt but I have forty or fifty pounds at home; that will just do, says he, we will have a coach and we will go; we went all three in a coach, and went up to my lodging; Moore staid behind, the other man and me went up to my quarters, and sat down and drank share of a shilling's worth of punch; when I got the money, we left Moore in the Five Fields, but he was at the Cheshire Cheese when we came down, I put down the money, twenty guineas and four doubloons, the other man put it in his purse, and gave me the ring, and desired me to meet him the next morning at nine o'clock, that he would return me that money, and give me one hundred pounds for my share of the ring, which accordingly I did, I went the next morning, and waited there till four in the afternoon, but never saw the two strangers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. How long did they stay in the house at Chelsea after you gave them the twenty guineas? - Not two minutes.</p>
               <p>Did they go away together? - Both went away together, they would hardly stay to drink the punch I had treated them with; after that I gave information at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Look at that man, was that the man? - That was one of them.</p>
               <p>When he was taken up; what did he say to you? - When I went into the room, I told the constable that was the man.</p>
               <p>Court. When did you give the first information in Bow-street, where did you find this man? - I found him in a publick-house; I knew him directly, he did not deny it.</p>
               <p>What did he say? - He said he was the man, he was sorry for it, he would make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270127"></xptr> it up, and get me the money if he could.</p>
               <p>Court. What publick-house was it? - I do not know, he said he was sorry he had taken me in, but he would make friends and get me my money back again if he could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Your answer to my friend's last question was, that he was the man, that he was sorry for it; then you mended your evidence, and said he was sorry for taking you in? - I do not recollect I said he took me in.</p>
               <p>That is very material? - My Lord, I mean nothing but to be correct.</p>
               <p>You see when my friend asked you what passed between you when you first saw him, you said that he was sorry for it, then you do not recollect at all, that he said that he was sorry he had taken you in? - No.</p>
               <p>What did you charge him with doing? - I desired that he would get me my money.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you say when you first saw him? - I told him to his face, and the constable that took him, that that was the man that was in company when I was defrauded of my money.</p>
               <p>And like an honest man, and feeling for your loss, the prisoner said, I am sorry for it? - I cannot tell what was his answer rightly, I know he said something to that purpose, that he was sorry, and would get me the money if he could.</p>
               <p>I believe he was as good as his word, and did endeavour to get you the money? - I do not doubt but he did, he strove very much.</p>
               <p>You yourself proposed that a jeweller should be sent for, and the money divided? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Consequently you very voluntarily parted with your twenty guineas? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You have told us very freely too, that this man did not take the money, the other man took it from you? - The other man took it from me.</p>
               <p>My friend asked you if you met them the next morning; your answer was more correct, you said he gave me the ring, and appointed me to meet him; but it might be an omission? - I should have said them, because they both promised to meet me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did Moore promise to meet you? - Yes, I think so, to the best of my knowledge, but I will not positively say; they were both to meet there, because we were to give him a guinea apiece; therefore he must be there.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Then it excludes the possibilty of his sharing in the plunder.</p>
               <p>Court. That may be rather a stronger inference than we may draw.</p>
               <p>You went the next day to this place at Charing Cross? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Did you never leave the ring with any body before you went to Bow-street? - Indeed I did, I believe General Boyd and his lady had it; I cannot tell who had it.</p>
               <p>To whom did you give it? - I gave it to my son-in-law

               <p>Court. When was that? - I cannot say what day.</p>
               <p>Recollect as near as you can? - I dare say it was four or five days after.</p>
               <p>Before the prisoner was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long might your son-in-law have it? - I believe he had it a day.</p>
               <p>He returned it to you? - Yes; my son, as I have heard, gave it to General Boyd, I cannot tell what came of it when it was out of my possession.</p>
               <p>Did you make a mark upon it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>You are but very little acquainted with cluster diamond rings? - I am not, I never saw one before.</p>
               <p>And never may again perhaps? - I hope not.</p>
               <p>When the ring was produced by the stranger out of the purse, you took it for granted it was a cluster diamond ring? - Yes.</p>
               <p>It is only from the information of somebody else that you can guess that it is not a diamond cluster ring? - It is not.</p>
               <p>If I were to ask you upon your oath, and from your own knowledge, could you tell me whether this is a diamond ring or not? - I could not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270128"></xptr>Then the ring may have been changed, having no mark and you having no judgment in brilliants, it is possible? - I do not think my son-in-law or General Boyd would change it.</p>
               <p>But otherwise you have no mark, no guess, no possibility of knowing whether it was the same? - No, I had not.</p>
               <p>You say you never saw the prisoner in the street, previous to your going into the public house? - No.</p>
               <p>He was not in the public house when you first went in? - He came after we came in.</p>
               <p>While you were reading this paper, and examining that identical ring? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Now, was there any thing that induced you to think that that man at the bar and the other are at all acquainted? - To speak my opinion, I really took them to be strangers, I did indeed.</p>
               <p>I believe when you were picked up in the street you had a note of some value in your pocket? - Yes, I had a two hundred pound note in my pocket.</p>


               <p>Did you or did you not give that note of two hundred pounds to the prisoner to get it discounted? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>How many days had it to run? - Three or four days; the prisoner went out, and came back and delivered it to me.</p>
               <p>The two hundred pound note that had but two or three days to run was better to steal than twenty guineas; my friend asked whether they did not come away together? - They walked away together, or run, they were out of my sight in five minutes; I left the house when they left it.</p>
               <p>Did you not invite the prisoner to go to Chelsea? - No, for the prisoner proposed when he found I had some money at home, to take a coach and go.</p>
               <p>I believe you are not much a loser by this fraud, taking for granted for a moment, that neither you nor I know that this ring is not worth sixpence, I believe you are not much loser from the fraud? - Upon my word I am, where is my four doubloons?</p>
               <p>Have you or have you not a note for the remainder? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you never had? - There was some kind of a note that the prisoner drew out there; he returned me the money about ten hours after he was taken up.</p>
               <p>What is that note for? - For value receceived.</p>
               <p>His note is for a part of this balance? - I believe so.</p>
               <p>You had a note of Moor delivered to you? - I did not destroy it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You will find in the course of the witnesses, that Mr. Field accepted of the note.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was there, and burnt before all our faces: I believe I did read it, but I did not keep it in my possession half a minute, it was given to one Buckery, he was the person who was to keep it.</p>
               <p>You had no idea of prosecuting this man till it was put into your head at Bow-street? - I do not know whether I had or not.</p>
               <p>Was it not from the advice of the runners of Bow-street that you brought this prosecution? - I do not think it was; Sir Sampson Wright and Mr. Bond sent down some of his people, and took us all prisoners.</p>
               <p>For what? - I was not a prisoner three minutes, every one in the house was taken up.</p>
               <p>Did not Sir Sampson Wright say he would send you to Bridewell if you did not prosecute? - I told him I wanted to go over to Ireland, and he told me I should not go, I should stay and prosecute the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect writing any letter to the prisoner, since he has been in custody on this subject? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>What might have been the purport of that letter? - I have forgot.</p>
               <p>Was it not to obtain satisfaction that unless the notes were taken up, and satisfaction made, you would prosecute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You will find that the day I was taken into custody, that same ring was seen in the possession of a private soldier.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you not recollect<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270129"></xptr> sending to your wife by a common soldier? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Did you send to your wife for the ring? - I cannot tell whether I did or not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect that it was locked up? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect your being at the publick house with the Constable, on the day the 13 l. was paid, and then sending to your wife for the ring? - What the day the prisoner was taken up, upon my word I believe it was, I cannot recollect rightly.</p>
               <p>Then by whom did you send? - The person is not here, he was a Serjeant.</p>
               <p>Can you be sure this is the ring that he brought you? - I think I could.</p>
               <p>By what marks? - I did not mark it.</p>
               <p>It depends you know very much on the honesty of that man, whether he might not have changed it or no? - It certainly does.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to put another question to Mr. Field.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Send the question to me in writing.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect correctly whether the guinea apiece was to be given the next day, or that it was not given at

               <p>As to the ring, is that the same? - I really believe this is the same ring, I have not the least doubt in the world.</p>
               <p>Have you any doubt of the receipt being the same? - None, that is the receipt.</p>
               <p>When the man was taken up, he proposed paying you some money and giving you a note, what was that for? - For the remainder of the sum he had got from me.</p>
               <p>Did he ever pretend to you that he had not received any money? - Yes Sir, he told me he had received no money, he offered to get all he could for me.</p>
               <p>What was the purport of this note he gave you? - I do not know.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I believe you are an acquaintance of Mr. Field's? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you at any time receive from Mr. Field authority to settle the business which is the subject of this enquiry? - Yes, I live at Chelsea, in Jews-row, at the King's head, very nigh the prosecutor, when the prosecutor was swindled out of his money, I knew nothing at all of it till it was over, when he was going into the country he left an order for me to settle the matter for him, and receive what money I could get, he was then going to his officer to settle some matters in the regiment that he left unsettled behind him.</p>
               <p>Was there in consequence of that authority any negociation between you and any other person for the purpose of settling for him? - He was not gone when an order came up to Chelsea for me to go down and settle it, therefore I took him with me to settle it.</p>
               <p>What passed at the meeting in settling it, and who were there present? - There was the prisoner Moor, a Constable of the name of Rhodes, a Serjeant, and Mr. Field.</p>
               <p>What passed? - When we went in, the Constable asked Mr. Field if he knew the prisoner Moor, and he told him he did, and Mr. Moor said I am the man, Field said I want my money, to which Moor answered I have not the money to give, I am sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Was there any money paid at all to Field? - Yes, there was 13 l. in my presence, some odd shillings, with a bill of Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178403270130"></xptr> Foster's likewise, which was given in balance for the rest.</p>
               <p>In balance for what? - In balance for 35 l. I think for 20 guineas and 4 doubloons, 13 l. he got, and some odd shillings, and a note of Mr. Foster, a note of hand for 19 l. it was made in my name, that I was to receive the money for Mr. Field, it was a note of hand from Moor the prisoner for 19 l. that note was delivered to me for Mr. Field as a Trustee for him, i t was made over in my name, it made up the whole sum as far as I knew.</p>
               <p>What became of that note? - We destroyed it as we thought it was of no use, Mr. Field was satisfied with what balance he had got, as the man could not raise any more money, and we were all going away, there was a party came from Bow-street, by whose means I know not, and they apprehended the whole and took them to Bow-street, and Mr. Field was obliged to go with us, it was all settled.</p>
               <p>It was all over then, when that party came and fetched you, and the note was destroyed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Sylvester. When you was in company, what had the constable to do then? - Moore was in custody, then he was charged with dropping the ring.</p>
               <p>What else? - Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Yes, it must be something else? - Field charged him with being in company with another man, which had defrauded him of some money; the other man was charged with taking away the money, but he charged this with being an accomplice in taking it.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner say? - I am sorry for it; says the other I want my money; says he, I have it not to give you; he had not got the money at first, he sent out and collected thirteen pounds; I did not hear what the Justice said.</p>

I fastened up the house on Sunday night, the 4th of May, about twelve o'clock, or twenty minutes after—I fastened the front door with an iron bar and a prop, and the back door in the same way—there is an inner door near the bar, leading to the private part of the house, that fastens with I bolt only, nearest to the bar—I bolted it—about ten minutes after one I was called by the police—I went down stairs, and found the till taken out of its place, and put on the counter—I had left it in its place under the counter, and a little copper money in it—I believe none was taken—the doors were all three unfastened and open—about eleven o'clock on the Sunday night I had seen three persons in the tap-room—I believe the prisoner to be one of them—I saw them come in and out—the last time I saw them was coming in—I did not go into the tap-room after that, and did not see them go out—when called by the police I observed some soot on the counter, and likewise about the stove in the tap-room—I saw a cap and a pair of shoes lying there—they were also sooty—a person could get from the back of the house over the garden fence, and so get away over an open piece of ground—the policeman has the shoes.</p>

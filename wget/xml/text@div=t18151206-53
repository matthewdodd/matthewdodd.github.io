            . I was in the employ of Messrs. Oliver and Hibber, I was sent by them to sleep in the house where the goods were, at No.129, Wood street on the 2nd of December. I used to go to the house about every hour. I went at about five o' clock on the evening of the 2nd of December, and found the locks fast, and all was quite secure. I went at about a quarter past six the same evening, and found the padlocks and binges wrenched off the door, and the door shut quite close to. I opened the door gently and heard somebody on the premises, I immedaitely pulled it to, and held it quite close. As soon as I had done that, some person who was inside tried to pull the door open. I put my feet against the door post and held the hasp tight, and called for assistance; all this time the person inside was pulling the door trying to get out. That pulling tore the skin off my hand, and hurt me a good deal. As soon as assistance came which was Mr. Weller, and the person inside finding he could not get out, he bolted the doors, as we should not get in. As soon as we found the door was bolted, I asked some one to go to the next door for not to let them go to the top of their house, and I requested somebody else to get an iron crow, to break open the door; I requested all this so loud, that the person inside might hear it. In about three minutes, the person inside unbolted the door, and endeavoured to come out, when Mr. Weller seized him by the collar, and I likewise by the jacket. We forced him back into the warehouse, and there were lights brought immediately; it was the prisoner. We then found the articles named in the indictment, missing, and there were three pieces of bombasin lying on the floor; I had seen them myself on a temporary shelf which was made shortly before. It was quite dark when I went to the house at five o'clock, and saw it safe, and this was at six; I afterwards examined the door, to see whether it had been forced or not, and there were the marks of a chissel, or small iron crow. The hasps were on the door, and the staples were found out, and the locks were forced off, at the side of the door, and gone. I had seen an hackney coach as I came down the street at a quarter past six, a little way from the premises; I did not see it driven away, but it was gone as soon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181512060031"></xptr>as I came out for the purpose of informing my employers.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Wood street, precisely opposite to this house which was broken open. In the evening that this happened, I saw a hackney coach at that door. At about six o'clock I had occation to go into the Cross Keys yard, and on my return, I saw the coach door open, and the coachman giving something white, to what I conceived to be a female inside the coach, but that I am not certain. I went in doors, and took no more notice afterwards, until about a quarter after five, when I heard a cry of thieves! I went over and found the young man and Mr. Weller holding the door. They requested me to get a light, which I immediately did, but in crossing the road, A biew out; in the mean time somebody brought one from the Cross Keys booking office. When I came out, hearing a cry of thieves, the coach was at the door, but when I came out of the house after assisting in searching it from top to bottom, the coach was gone.</p>

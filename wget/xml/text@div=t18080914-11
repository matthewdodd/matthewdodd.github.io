On the 2nd of August in the evening, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner looking at some lace pinned on some calico inside of the door; I saw her unpin it; she stood outside of the door, reached her hand in and unpinned the lace; it dropped inside of the door; she picked it up and put it in her pocket and walked along the street with it; I stopped her and asked her what she had got in her apron; she said she had nothing. I opened her apron and saw the lace.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw her take it away, and the lace you found in her apron was your lace - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. As I was passing by the shop I put my foot on the lace; the mud is on it now. I stooped down and took it from under my feet. When he asked me what I had in my apron. I said that which I picked up coming along; he said there was a party that frequently robbed his shop; he would let me go if I would let him know who they were.</p>

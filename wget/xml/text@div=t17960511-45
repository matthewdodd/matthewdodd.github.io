               <p>Q. Do you at all know, of your own knowledge, whether the house was broke open, or how they went? - A. No; only from my wife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. All the intelligence you received was from your wife, and that a year and a half ago? - Yes.</p>

               <p>ANN BENJAMIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in Harris-street, in Blackman-street, in the Borough: About fifteen months ago, as nigh as I can possibly tell, Mrs. Glaves came to my house, and asked me to buy these pictures, that is all I know of it; I am a married woman, I did not buy them; she asked me a guinea for them, and I told her they did not suit me; she brought them under her arm.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know them again if you were to see them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. How do you know this was Mrs. Glaves? - A. They lived together as man and wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what business he followed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>THOMAS GRIFFITHS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable belonging to the Police-office, Whitechapel, (produce was picture and an empty frame); in consequence of an information that we had, we went to Mr. Graves's house; on the 4th of this month; we went about nine in the morning, and apprehended Mr. Glaves at his own house, in Molusery-street, St. George's.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from Mr. Brown's? - A. I suppose two miles; and in searching Glaves's house, we found these pictures hanging up in his parlour; we took them down and took them to the office, with the prisoner; this gentleman came forward, and said, they were his property, before the Magistrate; we had some bills printed, and by those bills being printed and delivered about, he came forward to the office; I have had them ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You found them at Mr. Glaves's this very month, in Whitechapel, at the distance of two miles from where they were lost? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Hanging up as any other pictures would? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And at fifteen months distance? - A. Yes.(They were deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mrs. Benjamin.) Are those the same pictures that were brought to your house? - A. Yes; and there was another picture in this empty frame.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have nothing to say, my Lord, but that I am very innocent of it.</p>
               <p>(Mr. Knapp took an objection, that there was no proof of possession by the prisoner but at the distance of fifteen months from the time of the loss, because the possession of a wife is not the possession of the husband, witness it is proved that the husband knew of that possession, and therefore contended that it ought not to go to the Jury).</p>
               <p>Court. I am of opinion that it should go to the Jury, because, I have always held, that where a possession is traced to the prisoner, it is a case for a Jury; and I never will take a case out of the hands of a Jury where the property is traced to a prisoner's possession; the circumstances of the case they will take into their consideration.</p>

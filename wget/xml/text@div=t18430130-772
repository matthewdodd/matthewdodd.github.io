The prisoner came there on the 6th of Jan., about half-past eight o'clock (I never saw her be<lb></lb>fore)—she said, "I want half a pint of gin and a pot of porter for Mr. Mace, next door to the baker's shop"—I served her—she came again, and said she wanted another half-pint of gin and a pot of porter for Mr. Mace, who was out, and as soon as he came in he would send over the money, and she had it—she came again for another half-pint of gin and another pot of beer—I let her have it—I saw Mr. Mace afterwards—the next morning I saw the prisoner come with the empty pots—I asked her how she came to come for the gin and porter for Mr. Mace, when he did not send her—she said she knew Mr. Mace did not send, but a gentleman whom he knew did.</p>

In July last, I had a temporary lodging at Norwood - on Saturday, the 5th, I left my house about six o'clock, to go to Norwood, and about a quarter to six on the following morning, I heard my house had been broken open and robbed - I came to town, examined the premises, and found the bricks had been taken out of the wall in the passage, leading between Mr. Taylor's house and mine - there was a hold large enough to admit the person of a man; the petition had been cut with a centre-bit, and the whole pannel taken out, so as to admit the party into the shop - I have only one door to my house, that is in the centre, in St. Ann's-lane; the shop is on each side - my door remained perfect: the passage has a blank door, opening into St. Ann's-lane - there is no way of opening that door, but from the inside, without violence; there is a large lock inside the door, which lock I found forced off- it is in the possession of the officer; I examined the church-yard gate; it was locked, but there was the appearance of it having been forced: I examined my shop and missed the articles stated in the indictment - the whole of my window was stripped; almost the whole of my jewellery was taken away, and the shop cleared - all except a few plated articles; the value of the property taken is between 400l. and 500l. - I have not recovered any of it; I also lost my day-book and ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the female prisoner before the 5th of July? A. Yes; about a week, or ten days, or possibly a fortnight before the robbery, she came into my shop, and locked at a penknife and some scissors; she got into conversation with me about the Post-office, and ultimately bought a thimble for 18d. and went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you leave any confidential person in care of your property? A. Yes; I left my brother-in-law, and a female servant: the passage I mentioned, runs between my house and Mr. Taylor's - it is only used for the purpose of the charity-children going to church; it was so used at that time, but is now nailed up; the door was kept locked, and was opened inside by the sexton - the children go from St. Ann's-lane into the door; I believe that was the only use made of it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. The property lost was all in your shop? A. Yes; the whole was in the window - there is only one door to my house in St. Ann's lane; the passage door is at the extreme end of the shop.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's service. On the 5th of July, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the male prisoner at the door; he came to the shop door, which was not open at that time - the window shutters were down; I went and opened the door to him - my master had gone into the country, and Mr. Allan, his brother-in-law, was not at home; he sleeps on the premises - there was nobody at home but myself; I opened the door - he nodded at some waiters in the window, and said"Are those silver waiters in the window?" I told him I did not know; he asked if I knew the price of them - I said I did not, that Mr. Hopping was not at home; he asked how long it would be before he would be at home - I said I did not know how long he would be, but his brother would be in presently; he said "How long do you think it will be?" I said about a quarter of an hour - he said very well, he would be back by that time; I am sure Heath is the man - I think I have seen him before, passing the door; I cannot say whether it was once or more. I went to bed about ten o'clock, and was disturbed about half-past three in the morning, and found the house had been broken into, and robbed; I went down the cellar with two watchmen - Perry had aroused me; I saw the wall in the passage, it was terribly broken down, and the bricks out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the waiters that Heath directed your attention to? A. No; but I concluded he meant a large waiter and two small ones in the window - whether they were there the next morning, I cannot say.</p>

            . I am Mr. Hopping's brother-in-law. I slept in his house in town in July last, and on the night of the robbery. He went out of town about a quarter-past six o'clock in the evening; and about seven I saw the prisoner come to the shop, he asked me "What is the price of those silver waiters?" directing my attention to a pair in the window - I told him they were not silver; he then asked the price of that large one, it was a good deal larger; I told him that was not silver - he then asked the price of a pair of silver fish-knives, and said "I suppose they are silver - what are they per ounce?" I said I could not exactly say, for Mr. Hopping was not within at present; I said they were silver - he looked about in the window for a minute, but asked no more questions - he went away; about half-past three o'clock in the morning I was called up by Harrison or Bates; I got up, and found the premises had been broken into and robbed - the fish-knives which he had asked me about were gone, and the three waiters left; some property was left in the shop, some was left in the passage tied in a handkerchief, but I did not find that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He inquired the price of an article, and you said you could not tell him, on account of the absence of Mr. Hopping? A. Yes; he was never inside the shop, but at the door.</p>

            . I am constable of Aldersgate ward. On the morning of the 6th of July, about half-past three o'clock, I was in Little Britain with Bates, an inspector of the watch; we were coming round Little Britain - I could not see the prosecutor's house at that time, I might be seventy or eighty yards from it - I observed two men come round the corner; they were merely jumping and dancing about, and one of them turned round the corner down St. Ann's lane, apparently from Mr. Hopping's premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you standing when you first saw them? A. On the opposite side of the way to St. Ann's-lane, towards St. Martin's-le-grand; I know the church passage, and the blank door there - they were coming from the right<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110053"></xptr>hand of the church-passage; I saw them come round the corner of St. Ann's-lane, and saw the side face of one of them, seven or eight yards from the church-passage, by Mr. Degrave's house, which is at the corner of St. Ann's-lane, and Aldersgate-street; they were nearer to the church-passage than to the church-yard gate, and were jumping and dancing about - they did not appear to have anything with them; to the best of my belief, the prisoner is the man whose side face I saw - my suspicions were not raised; Bates and I made a remark - we went over and spoke to the watchman; the persons went towards Falcon-square, they ran; we crossed over towards St. Ann's-lane - I saw Perry the watchman, coming down the lane towards St. Martin's-le-grand, I met him. I went to Mr. Hopping's premises, the church-passage door was then open - I went in with Bates, Perry also came into the passage, and there was one or two more there; I found the bricks taken out of the wall on Mr. Hoppings side of the passage, and the pannel cut out - two bread-baskets tied in a handkerckief laid in the passage: the hole was large enough to admit a man - these pieces of wood were taken out and laid in the shop, I have compared them with the apperture in the wall, they corresponded exactly - they have been bored with a centre-bit; I went into the shop with Bates - Perry had aroused the people of the house; I found a dark-lantern in one of the drawers inside the shop; I also found a phosporus box, centre-bit, and screw-driver - I applied the centre-bit to the holes in the wall, it corresponds - the screwdriver is a likely instrument to have broken the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not the back of the person you suppose to be the prisoner chiefly towards you? A. I only saw his side face as he passed me; I had no suspicion then - he was but a short time passing me; I observed him coming down the lane, and as he came round the lane, I had a view of his side face likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the prisoner afterwards shewn to you in a public-house? A. He was; I did not say he was not the man - I said I could not exactly see; the place was so dark I could not see him - Bates and I were sent in to look at him, separately; I do not think he was in the room with me, nor have I any recollection of Foster being in the room - he was allowed to go at large after I saw him in the public-house.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What did you say when you saw him? A. I said at that time I could not see him - he was up in a corner of the tap-room of the Castle and Falcon, which is very dark - it was on Sunday, the 6th of July, between eleven and twelve o'clock; that part of the room is particularly dark - he was stooping down, reading the newspaper, which was the reason I could not see his face; Foster, the marshalsman, told me to go in, and see if I could see him - there were other persons in the room; I went in alone - I returned to Foster, in the yard, and said at that time, "I don't think he is the person," because I could not see exactly, as he was in a very dark corner - I told Foster so; Goddard then went in, but nobody else; Foster then let him go; either he or Coutan went in, and told him he might go about his business; I saw him going; and when he came out of the tap-room he was in a much lighter place; I had very little doubt of him then, when I saw him standing up - I told Bates, I had very little doubt he was the man, but I could not say positively - Foster was gone, and he was allowed to go; I have very little doubt, from the appearance of his side face, that he is the man, but cannot take on myself to swear positively to him.</p>

I was with Harrison, on the morning of the 6th of July, at the corner of Little Britain, just turning into Aldersgate-street; I could see the corner of St. Ann's-lane - we were at the corner of Little Britain, when we saw two men coming from the corner of St. Ann's-lane towards us; they were, I suppose, twenty or thirty yards from the church-passage; I believe Harrison discovered them turning the corner; the prisoner is one of those persons; he was the nearest to me - I have no doubt whatever of him; they proceeded from the corner of St. Ann's-lane towards Falcon-street; they did not appear to have anything about them - the other man left the prisoner opposite Aldersgate church, and ran forward; the prisoner followed him, walking; I stood, and looked towards them, and the prisoner looked round at me very earnestly, just as the other ran, as he was walking after him - I had then an opportunity of seeing his face perfectly, and have no doubt whatever of his person - I first discovered his face by the Castle and Falcon gate; I was within thirty yards of him; I saw his face again as he went towards Falcon-street; he looked towards me when the other ran; we proceeded to the corner of St. Ann's-lane, endeavouring to see our watchman, to see if those men came out of St. Ann's-lane, and just before we crossed the road Perry appeared on his station; and in consequence of what passed we went to the house of Mr. Taylor - Perry described the robbery to us; we went in pursuit of the two persons I had seen, through Falcon-square, towards Cripplegate; Perry ran another way; we continued in pursuit not more than a quarter of an hour, not having anybody to protect the premises; after the pursuit, we returned to Mr. Hopping's premises - I found the blank door in the church-yard, leading to the passage, had been opened; the lock had been unscrewed, the bricks taken out of the wall, and the wood cut out of the pannel about a foot long; they had entered the shop there; I did not examine the church-yard gate - I waited till Mr. Hopping came to town, which was about seven o'clock, and told him the particulars - I described the man I had seen to Mr. Brown, the marshal, and between twelve and one o'clock that day I was sent for by Foster, to the Castle and Falcon, and there was a person in the tap-room, among sixteen or seventeen more; I went into the taproom, in consequence of what Foster said - it was rather-dark there; I looked about, and saw the prisoner sitting at the further corner, in the dark part of the tap-room, with his arms folded, reading the newspaper - I was satisfied immediately, from his countenance, that he was the man, in my own mind; but I wished to see his stature - I left the tap-room, went into the yard, and saw Foster; something was said to him; the prisoner was allowed to go at large - I saw him come from the tap-room, and had a much better opportunity of seeing him than when in the dark part of the room; I recognised him as one of the persons I had seen that morning, between three and four o'clock, at the corner of St. Ann's-lane.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182809110054"></xptr>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Does Little Britain lead into Aldersgate-street? A. Yes - you turn to the right and down St. Martin's-le-grand, before you can turn into St. Ann's-lane; I had turned into Aldersgate-street, and was coming from Little Britain; St. Ann's-lane can be seen from the corner of Little Britain: since the improvements for the New Post-office, the houses are all taken down to the church; I was in Aldersgate-street, in front of the church, and could see the corner of St. Ann's-lane, but not into the lane; I first saw them come round the corner - what part of the lane they came from I cannot say; they passed us - we were on the other side of the street, going slowly towards St. Ann's-lane, as they came towards us quickly; I was sent into the public-house to identify the man - he was over the newspaper, but I doubt whether he had light enough to read it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had he the newspaper in his hand? A. No, it laid on the table; his arms were folded, leaning over it.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Ann's-lane. - On the 5th of July, about half-past three o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Mr. Payne's, the watch-maker, about eight doors from the church-yard, fifty or sixty yards from the prosecutor's premises; I had been my rounds, and was trying Payne's shutters, and about three o'clock, when I went up there, I had seen a man standing by Mr. Payne's - I should know him if I saw him; he was a thin-faced man, about my height; it was not the prisoner. About half-past three o'clock I was standing at Payne's, trying the shutters, and looking down, I saw two gentlemen (as I took them to be) come out of Mr. Taylor's,(as I supposed) his shop is next door to the passage, going up to the church-yard - that is the passage they came from- they went towards Bull and Mouth-street; I supposed they had come from Mr. Taylor's: I found afterwards they had come from the passage; they walked - I did not suspect anything, as I had tried the doors going up, and found them secure; there was nobody in the lane but those two men - I only saw their backs: I cannot say whether either of them was the prisoner's size: they could hardly have turned round the corner before I saw Bates and Harrison - they could not have got more than two doors from the corner. In consequence of what passed between us, I went towards Mr. Hopping's premises, having first tried Mr. Taylor's, and found them secure; there was a bit of paper which took my attention, on the step of the door that leads up the church-passage - that step immediately adjoins Mr. Taylor's door; I found the pssage-door a little ajar - it is usually kept locked; we went in - the lock was off, and lying down in the passage; I found the wall broken through, and the pannel cut away; I did not go into the shop - the first thing I saw in the passage was two bread-baskets, tied in a handkerchief, and a card of rings by the side of them, and I think two purses; I called up the inmates. The church-yard gate, leading to St. Ann's-lane, was fast - I tried it.</p>

            . I am sextoness of St. Ann's church. On the Sunday morning before this robbery I was standing at the church door before morning service began, a little before eleven o'clock, and saw the male prisoner at the gate, trying something to the lock; I went down to speak to him, but when I got down I could not speak, for I was so frightened, and returned; he was trying the lock of the gate, and when I went down he took his hand away, and put something into his pocket.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Ann's. On Sunday, the 29th of June, I saw the male prisoner at the bottom of St. Ann's-lane, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning - I did not see him for above a minute then, as I had to go into church; when church was over I saw him again - whether it was directly after church, or about the beginning of the afternoon service I cannot say; I saw him at the church-yard gate - he was not doing anything; I asked what he was waiting there for - he said for a coach coming in; I said his standing about so much looked very suspicious - he said he was waiting for a coach; nothing more passed - I went away, and so did he.</p>

            . I know both the prisoners. I saw the female prisoner on Sunday morning, the 6th of July, at my house, No. 7, Three Herring-court, about twenty minutes before eight o'clock - she had a small box- I do not know what was in it, I never saw; it was a tin box - I was up: Mrs. Foster, who has just been called, was in bed in the room; I do not know where she is - she lodged with me; when the female prisoner came in she asked if I had done her cap - I said I had not; she then asked me to lend her a candle, which I did; she went into the passage, and sealed the box - I did not see the box till after she came in again.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that she sealed it then? A. She said she wanted the candle to seal the box; she was going to send it to Charles Turnley - I know Turnley by sight; she did not tell me what was in the box, nor did she tell Foster, in my hearing; I swear that. I heard Mrs. Foster examined before the Magistrate, and remember what she stated.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, I ask you again, did she say to Mrs. Foster, or to anybody else in your hearing, or to you, what was in the box? A. She did not, nothing of the kind; I never heard anything of the kind - she did not mention Heath's name, nor any name - I do not recollect that she mentioned anybody's name.</p>
               <p>COURT. It is right to remind you you are on your oath. Witness. I have said quite correct.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Look at that handkerchief? A. I know nothing of that handkerchief, Sir - I never saw it before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Recollect yourself, whether she mentioned any name? A. No; she did not mention any name - I have stated all she said; she did not state anything about anybody having been taken - I do not recollect saying so before the Magistrate.</p>

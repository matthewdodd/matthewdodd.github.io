I lost an iron column from a passage opposite my house - I had seen it safe two days before the 23rd of March, when I missed it; I found the prisoner and four other men offering it for sale in Cowcross-street - I could not get any assistance to take them, so I went and asked them if it was for sale; the prisoner said Yes, and asked me 1l. for it; I told them I would give them 15s. if they would take it to the end of the street - the man at the shop then came out, and asked me if it was mine; I said it was - the other men<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110086"></xptr>then said the prisoner had employed them, and they walked off - I took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not ask any price for it; I said these are the men that brought it - ask them. Witness. Yes, he asked me 1l. for it; he did not say the other men had brought it - it was laying down; the men were all in one party, and I suppose a quarter of a mile from my house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COALES. I keep a smith's shop in Clerkenwell. On the 23rd of March the prisoner and four other men brought an iron column to sell; the prisoner said, "Mr. Coales, will you buy this piece of iron" - I said, "Where did you get it?" he said he was digging, and a person gave it him - I asked one of the others where they got it, and he said he did not know; I declined buying it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM COSTELLO. I live at Hatton-wall. I saw the prisoner and the other men take the column from opposite our house, in the yard; I asked him where he was going to take it - he said his master had sent him for it; they took it down Hatton-garden - I went and told the prosecutor; I am sure the prisoner is one of the men.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Peter-street; I was pretty groggy after my day's work, and I met four men in Ray-street with this iron - I said, "You have got a heavy load;" "Yes, (said one of them,) do you know where we could sell it" - "No, (says I) but perhaps Mr. Coales would buy it, come and ask him;" I went and asked him - I walked round and left the men with it; this gentleman then came up, and said "Is this for sale?" "I do not know (says I) but there are the persons who belong to it."</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember her coming with her husband? - Yes. I went the next morning to see if I could find her husband; I found her at Marlborough-street. When I came there I found she had been in the watch-house after she had been out of my house; as soon as I see her I told her she must go along with me; as I was going along she whipped into a house, and she asked the woman in the house leave to go backward into the yard. After she came out I asked the woman what part of the house she went to? she told me into the yard; and I went back and found this silk handkerchief, and a sprigged muslin apron, a linen handkerchief, and two caps; I found them all in the necessary; I put them all in my pocket; I ran out after her, and told the person that was with me to watch her; when I came up to her, I said, you had better tell me where the things are; she denied knowing any thing about them; and I took her into my house, and my daughter took the shift off; I did not see it taken off.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was taken sick, and my husband came in and he held my head, and he brought me out a glass of water, and he persuaded me to take the things, because he said he had spent all his money at Mr. Cole's house, five shillings and sixpence, for supper and liquor.</p>

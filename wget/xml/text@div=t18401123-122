                  </hi>. Previous to the 21st of September, I was in the employ of Messrs. Hind, fringe manufacturers in Leonard-street. I remained there till I was taken into custody—I know the prisoner—previous to the 21st of September she asked me to get some of my master's fringe—I said it was a thing I had never done, but at last I consented to do it—on the 21st of September I had some unknotted black silk fringe to work on—I cut off about four yards of it, and about one o'clock, when I went to din<lb></lb>ner, I took it to the prisoner—she received it, and told me to get some more—I took her some more that week—she then said she would wash my cap for me, and buy me a new one—I took her some black fringe four times, and on the 24th of September I took her some puce fringe—in the week following I cut off some blue and drab fringe, but Mr. Hind found that on me—all the fringe the prisoner received of me was unknotted, in an unfinished state.</p>

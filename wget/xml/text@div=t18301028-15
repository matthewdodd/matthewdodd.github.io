The prisoner came to my house on the 17th of September - I am not aware of having seen him before; he said he was desirons of having a bill for 50l. discounted, and was recommended to me by a gentleman, named Wright.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it part of your business to discount bills? A. I am acquainted with gentlemen who discount them - they are friends of mine; I told him I would cause inquiry to be made, and if the bill proved to be good, I or a friend of mine would discount it - he produced the bill at the first interview; this is it (looking at it) - it is in the same state as when he produced it; I asked him what business the acceptor was - he told me he was chief farrier and smith, at Mr. Wood's, the coal-merchant; I called on Mr. Wood, who stated that Quin could neither read nor write - no money has been advanced on the bill; I took it to a friend, and saw Quin, who said he could neither read nor write, and had not authorized his name to be put to it - I should not have taken any steps myself, but Mr.Flight, who I applied to, to discount it, said it devolved on me to have him taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. On your oath did not the man tell you Quin had authorized him to accept the bill for him? A. I do not recollect any thing of the kind; I understood him to state it was the acceptance of Quin, unquestionably.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not tell you he had been authorized by the man to accept it? A. I am sure I cannot answer the question; I received 8s. for the trouble of making the inquiry - he gave me a correct address of Quin and his master.</p>
               <p>Q. How many gaols have you been in in the course of your life? A. That has nothing to do with this - I object to the question; I was never in Newgate for debt - I consider I am not bound to answer whether I was ever there; I do not know that I was ever in this Court before, or the other - I do not recollect it; I swear I was never tried for any offence in either of the Courts - I never was tried in either of the Courts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever here as a prisoner? Q. I decline answering that; when you say the Courts I conceive you do not mean the prison - I do not believe I was ever in either of the Courts; I have been in the Court of King's Bench, but there was no judgment passed - there was a conviction there, which was not good, and no judgment was passed; I went to receive judgment, and was discharged - it was for a misdemeanor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not spend two years in Newgate before you were discharged? A. I will not answer the question.</p>

I have known the prisoner two years and better; I can neither read nor write - I never saw this bill before he was in custody, not to my knowledge; I never gave the prisoner leave to put my name to any paper, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever tell him he might put your name to any paper concerning money? A. No, not to my recollection - he never asked my leave to do so; the acceptance was never written by my order or consent, not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it a thing you would be likely to forget? did you ever in your life give authority to any body to accept a bill? A. Never - I am in Mr. Wood's service now, and have been so for five years; I am to be found there from six o'clock in the morning till seven or eight o'clock at night - I remember being in a public-house in Northumberland-street with the prisoner; he asked what I would take, and then asked the landlord for a tent of ink - I did not ask what he wanted it for, nor did I see him with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure the paper was not produced, and that you did not give him authority to sign it? A. I did not - I have been in Ireland, and left there to get employment; I was confined there for twelve months about a turn out for wages; and I was once flogged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Quin ordered me to do this twenty times - I was to give him the price of two chaldrons off coals out of it, and not to tell his wife of it.</p>

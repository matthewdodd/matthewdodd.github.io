                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman X</hi> 221). On 14th March I was on duty in Lansdown Road about 11.40 at night, and saw the male prisoner there speaking to two other men—I went up to them and asked the prisoner what was the matter—he said "We have lost the plate out of our house"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060038"></xptr>
               <p>—I said "Where do you live?"—he said "75, Lansdowne Road"—I said "What time did you miss it?"—he said "I came home about 11.30; after I had been downstairs and taken off my hat and coat, on searching the rooms on my way to bed I missed the plate"—I and Constable Lewis then walked into the hall of the house—the female prisoner came and opened the door of the dining-room and the door of the sideboard which was in the dining-room, and she said in the male prisoner's presence "That is where the plate is gone from, it was wrapped in flannel"—I said "Have you searched the house?"—the male prisoner said "No, we have only been downstairs"—I then went up to the first-floor front bedroom, and on opening the door smoke burst out in my face—I said "You have a fire here"—I then took from the male prisoner a candle which he brought upstairs and entered the room—the smoke was so thick that I could not find the fire, and I had to leave the room—on entering a second time I placed my hand on the mattress; it gave way and the fire rolled out in ray hand; there were three mattresses—I then sent the other constable for the fire-engine; he returned and got water, which I poured on the mattresses and extinguished the fire—the bed-clothing which was on the bed I had previously taken off and rolled up in a ball—I then entered the back bedroom on the same floor—the female prisoner, who held followed me, exclaimed "Oh, some one has got in here; see, they have moved the drawers from the window"—one corner of the drawers had been pushed away from the window; it appeared that they had been in front of the window; there were flower pots on the drawers; the window was closed but unfastened, and the blind was down—I examined the window, there were no marks; there were bars outside, about 8 or 9 inches apart—we then went to the front bedroom second floor, and I there saw a mattress which had very recently been on fire, and a toilet-cover lying on it partly burnt—there was no fire, it was just burning out—I then went downstairs to the first floor again, when I, met Bolton, the fireman, and examined the back room with him—I found no marks of any entry having been made—I don't think any could possibly have been made without leaving marks—I saw Lewis take a box of matches from the table on the first-floor landing; he made some remark to the male prisoner about them, which I did not hear—I was afterwards present when the names and addresses were given—I left about 12.45—the house was quite close to where I first saw the prisoner—I was standing at the corner, and it was only one house from the corner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I was in plain clothes—the men the prisoner was talk<lb></lb>ing to were a tradesmen and a man in his employ, and a constable in uniform, on the beat—they were very nearly opposite the house—they are not here—I was standing so close to them that I could overhear their conversation, and I walked up to them—I believe I did not tell the prisoner that I was a constable before I went into the house—the con<lb></lb>stable in uniform did not go in, he remained at the gate—Lewis went in with me, he was in plain clothes—the prisoner was speaking to the other constable about the plate being lost—I did not inquire where he had been that evening, merely the time he went out and returned—he remained in the house till the fireman came—the mattress was burnt through—I believe it was a wool mattress—there was a hole burnt in it, but it had not spread to the rest of the mattress—that fire had died out recently—</p>

               <p>that does not apply to the other room, that was on fire—I could not say the length of time it had been burning—it was burnt from the foot to the head, and half way across the bed—the clothing was burnt—the man was taken into custody on this charge the next evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer of the London Fire Bri<lb></lb>gade stationed at Ladbroke Road, Notting Hill—on 14th March I was called to a fire at 75, Lansdowne Road, at 11.57, and I arrived there at about two minutes to 12 o'clock—I went upstairs to the front bedroom first floor, and examined the mattress and bedding—the fire was quite out then—judging from the appearances I should judge the fire had been burning from 15 to 20 minutes at the very outside—I have been 24 years in the brigade, and have attended a great many fires—on entering the room I discovered a peculiar smell, as if some chemical had been used in the process of the fire—there was a large body of smoke in the room—I can hardly describe what the smell was like—I opened the window to allow the smoke to pass out—I went to the second floor; there had been a fire on the bed in the front room; something like a toilet cover had been set light and thrown on the bed—the bed was perfectly bare of clothes, and the toilet cover had burnt itself on the mattress—it had not been burning many minutes—I examined the premises with the constable—the male</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187805060040"></xptr>
               <p>prisoner called my attention to the chest of drawers which had been re<lb></lb>moved from the window in the back room first floor, and said that some one had made an entry there—the drawers had been moved—there were some flower-pots on the drawers; they were top-heavy, and it would have been impossible to have entered the window and pushed them aside without overturning them—there were not the slightest marks on the window—I examined the garden; there were no traces of any footmarks or of a ladder—the soil was soft—we searched the house throughout from top to bottom, and did not find the slightest marks of any entry—I asked the female if she had any idea of the cause of the fire; she said she could not account for it—I asked what time she went out—she said about 6 o'clock—I asked what time she returned—she said about half-past 11 o'clock—I asked her if she had a light of any kind, gas or a candle, previous to going out—she said there was no occasion for it, as it was quite light when she went out—I asked if there had been a fire in the room—she said, "No"—I asked if she had had any matches about the place—she said "No"—I asked how she found the premises on returning—she said that on opening the street door, instead of the lock turning twice, she opened it with one turn only, showing that somebody had entered previous to her—I then asked her for the occupier's name—she went downstairs into the dining-room and got me a card with Mr. Corbett's name and address on it—the two fires were perfectly distinct and sepa<lb></lb>rate; there was no communication whatever between them—I should say they must have been wilful—there was no sign of their being accidental</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I can judge of the time a fire has been burning within a very few minutes—it would only take a very few minutes to consume the toilet cover—the tick of the mattress was also burnt just where the toilet cover laid—that was my reason for thinking that chemicals were used, from its burning so rapidly; I believe that something had been poured on to assist the fire in burning—I examined the lock of the street door—it was the usual street door lock—it acted pretty well—I certainly did not turn the key; it had a handle inside, I think, but I would not be positive—I did not notice any way by which a person could enter the house except by unlocking the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in Mrs. Corbett's service—when she left on 11th December I remained in the house till the following night—the female prisoner came to take charge of the house in the afternoon of 12th December—I did not see the man at all—everything was safe and in order when I left on the 13th.</p>

As far as I know everything was locked up—the keys were left in the cupboard and wardrobe, but nothing was left there except some curtains—Mrs. Corbett herself put the basket of silver in the chest, locked it and took the key abroad with her—no silver was left out but a little for your use.</p>

                  </hi>. I was cook at 72, Lansdowne Road, opposite 75—I have seen the prisoners go in and out of 75—I think in January I saw some things put in a cab that was standing at the door, and the female prisoner was standing at the door with a candle; it was about 7 o'clock at night—I can't say who put the things in or what they were—since then I have seen the man go in and out—he appeared to be living there—once I saw him leave with a bundle under his arm and the female had a baby in her arms—that was about a week before the fire.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live in Rosemary Lane. I saw the prisoner at Sparrow's Corner, Little Tower Hill, on the ninth of June, between the hours of eight and nine: he had a piece of bacon in his hand. His wife was standing by a crowd of people; he went up to her, and desired her to buy a piece of liver to eat with the bacon for supper. She was very drunk, and so was he. She had fell down several times. She cursed and swore most prodigiously. A cart loaded with green beans was coming along Tower Hill to cross the kennel; as the cart was come near them, he gave her a blow, and she fell; the wheel run over her he stooped as though he intended to catch her up: as soon as the wheel was gone over her, he ran to lay hold of the driver.</p>

I am a plumber, of 17, Carthusian-street, Aldersgate-street—on 31st October, about 10 o'clock, I was passing through Newgate-street, and, as it was raining, I turned into Queen's Head-passage for shelter—I had a purse containing two half-crowns and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I went just into the passage and the female prisoner came up and requested me to stand treat to her, which I declined—I then went to the further end of the passage to get out of the way, and she came up again, and requested me to stand refreshment—I declined, and she stood talking two or three minutes and then ran away—she had been very close to me—I directly felt in my left-hand pocket, mis<lb></lb>sed my purse, and went over to a constable who was standing opposite—I went with him to Angel-street and saw the two prisoners together—I saw Edwards fling the purse into the road—a little boy picked it up—I took it from him and gave it to the policeman who took the prisoners into custody.</p>

                  </hi>, (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman,</hi> 286). On 31st October, a little before 10 o'clock, I was on duty in Newgate-street, on the opposite side to Queen's Head-passage, and saw Edwards walking backwards and forwards—while he was doing that Smith left Queen's Head-passage, Edwards joined her, and they crossed the road in a hurried manner close by me—I looked to see which way they went, and soon afterwards Mr. Benham came up and made a statement to me—I went with him down King Edward-street, and saw the prisoners at the corner of Angel-street—I got close to them and heard the <hi rend="italic">jinking</hi> of money—they were both close together—I ran and secured them both, and Edwards immediately threw this purse into the road—it was afterwards given to me—I had to get assistance to secure them—Smith was searched by a female searcher, and only a latch-key found on her—I searched Edwards and found two half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence, in his right-hand trousers pocket, and in his coat pocket two half-pence, a small memorandum book, and these keys—this pair of woollen cuffs dropped from him at the station house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Do you know with which hand he threw the purse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> With his left—I have not heard what Mr. Benham has said—Edwards's right side was towards the kerb-stone, and his left towards the houses—he threw it in this way, from under a big cape which he wore—I had hold of him and of Smith also—Mr. Benham was asked by the Inspector what money the purse contained, and he said "two half-crowns, and two shillings"—I—had not told him what was found on Edwards.</p>

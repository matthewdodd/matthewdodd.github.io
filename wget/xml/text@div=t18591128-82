                  </hi>. I am single, and live at Woolwich—on Friday morning, 21st October, I was at the Crown and Mason's Arms—I went in about a quarter to 10—Oath was not asleep when I went in, but he said, "I will have a sleep"—he said so to the prisoner and another soldier that was there—he lay down and went to sleep—while he was asleep, I saw the prisoner put his hand in Oath's right-hand trowsers pocket, take the money out, and walk away—I did not see what money was taken—he drew his hand out and he never looked, but walked right away—I know it was money, because I heard it rattle when he pulled it out—I said to the prisoner, "What a shame for one soldier to rob another!"—he made no answer, but walked away and laughed, and then I saw the girl of the house rouse Oath, and I went and told the landlady at the bar.</p>

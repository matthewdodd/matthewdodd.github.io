            . The Watch was calling past twelve when Baker and I met Anderson and Ogleby by Charing-cross ; they ask'd us whither we were going? we said we could not very well tell, and so, after a little Talk, we went all together to the Night-cellar by Privy-garden.</p>
               <p>Court. Privy-garden !</p>
               <p>Wild. I don't know whether they call it Privy-garden or Spring-garden, but its over-against the Meuse.</p>
               <p>Court. What Discourse had you there?</p>
               <p>Wild. Nothing but Here's to you; we drank but one Pot there, and then we came up and went into the Hay-market, and coming to the Corner of St. James's-street, as you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173312050013"></xptr> go towards the Tennis-court, says Ogleby, Here's two Stalls where the People leave their Goods all Night, let's mill 'em, that is, break 'em open; we soon agreed upon it, and Anderson wrench'd one of the Doors open with a Chissel, but we found nothing there that was worth stealing, and so we look'd out for a better Chance. We came at last into Church-street, where, pushing against a Shutter, he said it was loose, and bid us stay a little; we stopp'd, and he put a Chissel betwixt the two Shutters, and, with a hard Wrench, forc'd it open; it made such a Noise that we were afraid it would alarm the Family, or the Watch, who stood at the Corner of the Street, and therefore we retreated for two or three Minutes, and stood at a little Distance to see the Event; but finding all safe, we went again, and blew out the Lamp that was at the Door. Then Anderson stood upon my Shoulders, pull'd down the upper Sash, and reaching over, undid the inner Shutters. Getting down again, he endeavour'd to push up the under Sash, but not being able to do it, Ogleby try'd at it, rais'd it a little with his Hands, and clapping his Shoulders under, forc'd it up high enough for us to enter. Anderson stepp'd over the Way, and getting up to a Lamp, lighted a Candle, put it into his Dark-lanthorn, and went into the House by himself, while we stood without to watch; he brought out a silver Mug, one silver Salver, a silver Stand for Snuffers, a silver Pepper-box, and a Man's Hat; if he took any Thing else he sunk it, for that was all we saw. By this Time it was between two and three in the Morning; we went thence to Stocks-market, and then it was near four. None of us having any Money left, I gave my Hat to Ogleby, and putting the Prosecutor's Hat upon my Head, went into the Brandy-shop on the left Hand facing the Market, and desir'd the Man to let us have half a Pint of Gin and 6 d. upon it till the Morning, tho' indeed it was Morning then.</p>
               <p>He refus'd to lend us 6 d. but said we might have the Gin, we agreed to it; the Gin was drawn, but while we were drinking, I thought he seem'd to be suspicious of us, for he look'd upon the Hat, and said it was a very good one, and then going to the Door call'd Lightfoot; we concluded Light-foot was a Watchman, so bidding the Man take Care of the Hat, we made haste away. Anderson pawn'd a Handkerchief for 6 d. and with that Money we went the same Morning and redeem'd the Hat. Thence we walk'd to

               <p>Ogleby. Where did you see me first?</p>
               <p>Wild. That was the first time when I met you at Charing-cross, but I have often drank with you since, at the Corner of St. Martin's-lane.</p>
               <p>Ogleby. I'll prove that I never drank with you in my Life.</p>
               <p>Wild. Do if you can.</p>
               <p>Anderson. And where was it you saw me first?</p>
               <p>Wild. I told you before, at the Corner of Cornhill, and that I saw you afterwards in Smithfield, and that this Fact was the first we committed together.</p>
               <p>Ogleby. Did you ever see me from the Time you came to England to the Time we committed this Transgression ?</p>
               <p>Wild. No, I told you just now, that this was the first time I saw you.</p>
               <p>Ogleby. And how do you know what Day it was?</p>
               <p>Wild. The last Execution at Tyburn was on a Saturday, and this was the Day before.</p>
               <p>Ogleby. Did you ever know any Robberies that I committed?</p>

When it was Dark we went out together, and pick'd Pockets till past twelve, and then meeting with Anderson and Ogleby, by Charing cross, as I said before, we went and broke open the House.</p>

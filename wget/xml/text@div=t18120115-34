            . I am a patrol belonging to Bow-street office. On Wednesday the 8th of January I had been down the Green-lane, I came to the top of Islington by the Angel; I saw the two prisoners go into Goswell-street, Fowler had a bundle under his arm; the other prisoner was with him; Frost and I went up to them and stopped them; I asked Fowler what he had got in the bundle; he told me that he had got linen, that he had brought it from his washerwoman; I asked him again, he repeated that he had got linen the second time; I asked Scott whether he knew what linen it was; Scott said it was sheets and shirts that he had brought from his washerwoman. Not being satisfied with that answer I took the prisoners into a corn chandler's shop and examined the bundle; when I opened the bundle I found it contained silk stockings and gloves; going along I asked the prisoner Fowler where he brought them from; he said his master's, 47, Fish-street-hill.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the fact where Mr. Barlow does live - A. Yes. After that Fowler told me he would rather give me fifty pounds than I should have taken him in custody; I told him I did not do business in that way. I then took them both to Covent Garden watchhouse, where they were lodged for that night. I went the next morning to Mr. Barlow, and informed him what had taken place; Mr. Barlow came to Bow-street; they were fully committed for trial. I omitted saying, I asked Fowler as we were going along what he was going to do with this property, he said he was going to take it to one West, a hawker. I could not learn where West lived. I asked him what he was to have for it; he said he had made no particular bargain, but West was in the habit of buying guineas, or any thing that came in his way, and he expected to have met West that night at the Angel but he had disappointed him.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was it when you took him up - A. It was near upon ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. The conversation was between you and Fowler, are you sure that he had the bundle his arm or on his shoulder - A. Under his arm I am sure of.</p>
               <p>Q. He has sent me word that you are not taken in saying that he had the goods from his master - A. I am not; he said so, I am sure. This is the bundle, I have had it in my custody ever since. Frost was in company with me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What part of the property can you speak to - A. This dozen of silk stockings I have sworn to, and I swear to them now, they are worth about six pounds. There are other things that I could make oath to in the bulk.</p>
               <p>- BROWN. I am shopman to Mr. Barlow. By the paper on some of the stockings I know them to be my master's property, and there is a piece of paper on some of the gloves of my hand-writing, by which I know them. There are one hundred and two pair of silk hose, and one hundred and six pair of gloves.</p>
               <p>Fowler's Defence. I most humbly beg permission to state that the prisoner Scott knew not the contents of the bundle, nor how I obtained it; I bought them of a sailor, whom I never saw before, nor since.</p>
               <p>Scott was not put put on his defence.</p>

            , who lives in Moorfields, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch. On the 3d of July this clock was missed off a hook at the back of the warehouse - I saw it safe two or three days before. The prisoner is a stranger. Upon missing it I went to Phillips, the maker, and found that it had been advertised. I went to Worship-street office, and found it there, and am certain of it - it has a private mark, in my father's hand-writing upon it. It cost my father 3 l. 5 s. to sell again.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was you the first person who missed it - A. No, Rose, the servant missed it first. I did not miss it till Friday last.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Sadgrove, who is a furniture broker. I missed the clock about ten o'clock one morning, about a fortnight ago. The shop is always open in the day time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long was it before you mentioned it to your master - A. Three or four days after, as I thought at first that it was gone to be cleaned, or was sold. It hung at the bottom of the shop, six or eight feet high - we have more clocks, but not in the shop. We used this to tell the time by.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Luke's. On the 3d of July, about half-past twelve o'clock at night I was on duty - my brother watchman, Garret, brought the prisoner up, and asked me to assist in taking him to the watch-house, which I did - he had a bag in his hand, and gave it to Garret to carry, and at the watch-house we found the clock in it. He said there that it was given to to him at the corner of Coleman-street, City, to clean, but did not say when it was given to him.</p>

            . On Saturday morning, the 3d of July, about a quarter to one o'clock I was going my rounds, as constable of the night - Grenville ran after me, and told me to make haste - when I returned I opened the bag, and found the clock in it; the prisoner was in custody there. Garret said in his hearing, that he had stopped him going into No. 11, James-street, Featherstone-street. I said to the prisoner,</p>
               <p>"Whose property is this?" putting my hand on the clock - he said,</p>
               <p>"It is mine." I asked how he came by it - he said,</p>
               <p>"I am a jeweller; I have been doing a great deal of jewellery work for a person, and have taken this in part of payment;" I said, it might be so, but where did he bring it from; he said, from the Queen's-head, City-road. I asked the name of the man he had it from - he said from Delander. I asked where he lived - he said he did not know, and that his own name was 
               <persName id="t18240715-5-person139">

            . I asked where he himself lived - he said,</p>
               <p>"Has not the watchman already told you; they say I have been cohabiting with a common prostitute for this five or six weeks, which is false, for I have not been there above three nights." I said,</p>
               <p>"Where do you live?" he said at No. 7, Tavistock-street, Covent-garden, and that he was a law-stationer. I asked where the office was that he worked at - he said, within two or three doors of Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane. While I was searching him I said,</p>
               <p>"Now, where did you get this clock; was you standing or sitting" - he then said,</p>
               <p>"At the corner of Coleman-street, City; I was standing." I asked what he was to do with the clock; he said he had it to repair; I said, it was already going, and did not appear to want repairing. Next day, as I took him to the office, I asked what part of it he was to repair - he said he did not know, for he was not to touch it till he met the man that evening, at the Queen's-head, public-house, City-road. I went to No. 7, Tavistock-street, which is a very respectable house; I found he was known there, and that his mother lodges there. I have not enquired at the law-stationer's. I enquired at the Queen's Head; they knew nothing of him. I found he had not been to Tavistock-street since January. The prosecutor's house is close to Broad-street-buildings, three hundred yards or more from Coleman-street. I could not find that he had ever been a clock-maker.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not give you an account of a person named Delander - A. No; I did not state so to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was at the Queen's Head, City-road on the evening of the 2d of July; a person was there who I had met five or six times before, and when the house was closed we walked together as far as Finsbury; he said he was much involved, and could I lend him 2 l. to pay his rent, as he expected his goods would be seized, and would I wait there while he went and fetched me a clock - I was to bring it the following evening to the Queen's Head. I have sent there, and understand he was there, and sent in for me, but would not remain.</p>

On Thursday, the 2nd of November, he was in my house almost the whole day; he had not a good deal of liquor to my knowledge, none at all, that I knew of; at a quarter past ten o'clock, I was in the bar, and heard a noise in the tap room; I went in, and saw the prisoner standing in a kind of fighting posture; but I did not see any fighting. I took hold of the prisoner, and pulled him out of the tap room, telling him at the same time, that if he would not be peaceable, I would send him to the watchhouse; I left him outside in the passage after I pulled him out of the tap room. I then returned into the tap room, and saw the deceased sitting upon a bench; he did not appear to have received any injury; I saw no blood nor any thing about his face; he staid some time after that in the house; I saw him go out at the door with the woman he lives with, and he said, good night to you all; he left my house at about eleven o'clock, and soon after I sent a lodger to see him, and after, that news arrived that he was dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Reynolds. I heard a noise like a quarrell. I did not see that the deceased was hurt at all; I neither saw blood nor any marks upon him. There were twenty or thirty persons in the tap room. Torvick appeared to me sitting as he always did, and staid about half an hour in the house, and then bid us all good night.</p>

            . I was in this house on that night; I was in the tap room; I saw the prisoner there; there was a girl there also. The girl and the deceased's woman were quarrelling together. I saw the prisoner and the deceased's girl quarrelling, and the prisoner said, have you any one to take your part, he said that to the deceased's girl. Then the deceased came out of his seat where he sat, and struck the prisoner; then they fought together about five or ten minutes; neither of them fell; then the deceased gave in. Then they went out and came in again in about ten minutes. Then the deceased wanted to shake hands with him and make it up, and the prisoner hit him over the left temple. He would have fallen, only somebody caught him and put him in the the seat. He looked very pale, and appeared very bad indeed; some water was got to wash his face with, but I can't say whether he fainted or not. He appeared better after that. and went out in about a quarter of an hour.</p>

            . I live in Bell alley, St. Catherines. The deceased lived in the same house with me. I was in this tap room of this public house. The woman who belongs to the prisoner, was quarrelling with another young woman; and the prisoner knocked me down, and Torvick took my part. He took hold of the prisoner, and shoved him, and they fought together, but not much. The prisoner struck the deceased in his left temple, and he fainted with that blow. Some water was thrown in his face, and he got better after that, and I went home with him. After he recovered, he said he should have a black eye, and that would prevent him getting into the hospital. He sat down when he got home, but never spoke after he sat down. He opened his eyes, and fell off the chair dead. He had not been in the house more than a minute, when he fell off the chair dead.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and was sent for to look at the deceased on the morning after his death. I found no marks of blows or violence whateves on any part of his body. I opened his head, but could discover no marks that I could naturally suppose was the occasion of his death. His head was in a natural state; and I believe his death was occasioned by an apoplexy.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Charles Edwards, a mechanic's labourer, of 3, Shoemaker-row, Blackfriars—I know the prisoner—his wife keeps a school in Church-entry, Broadway, Blackfriars, and he resides there with his wife—the children were accustomed to play in the square or passage before the school, the gates being left open—on 25th August, about 1 o'clock, I was in my room, from which I had a view of the schoolroom—I did not see the prisoner at that time—I saw some water come out of a second-floor window; I could not see who threw it; it came on the children, and wetted one of mine who was playing there—upon that I came down into the court—I then saw the prisoner speaking to Mrs. Evans—he was on the threshold of the gates, and he was taking a life-preserver out of his breast-pocket—I saw him take it into his right hand and twist the cord round his wrist, and he deliberately struck Mrs. Evans on the head with it, and knocked her down with the blow—I said to him, "Oh, you wretch!"—he then struck me in the mouth with the life-preserver in his hand; it made my mouth bleed, and knocked out two of my teeth—I flew at him and made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at him in my own defence, and I then received several other blows on my hands and my face—I had a frightful face, and he struck me at the corner of the head, which stunned me—I did not see the blade part of the preserver—I had one blow on my chest and one on my arm—I did not feel anything when I was struck in the chest, because I was in a stunned state—I did not see any policemen there, they came up afterwards; I was taken up by one or two females; the witness Loom was one—I was</p>

On 25th August, about half-past 1 in the afternoon, I was standing at the corner of Church-entry, and saw three or four children come round covered with water—Mrs. Evans came to see about it—I went down to the school-room, looked round the corner, and saw the prisoner there; he was just inside the gate—there was a mob, a few persons—as I was going down, I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185910240003"></xptr>
               <p>saw one woman struck, I do not know which it was, and she fell down—when I got there I saw Mrs. Edwards struck by the prisoner; that was not with the life-preserver—then the old man, Mr. Edwards, came to see about it; and the first time of my seeing the life-preserver was when he used it on the old man—he made a hit at him; I thought it would be on his head, but it hit his ear and rebounded on his shoulder—then there was a lot fell down together—with the assistance of a policeman, Mrs. Edwards was got into my shop, and I drew the dagger from her side—it was in her gown; I can't say whether it was in her flesh; I pulled it out; she looked very ill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I was house-surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital on 26th August—on that day Mrs. Edwards was brought there—I examined her—she had several bruises about the face, one on the forehead, one on the cheek, one on her mouth, and a bruise on the back of one of her hands—I also found a punctured wound on the left side of the chest, just below the region of the heart—it was about three quarters of an inch in depth—it did not penetrate the chest; it ran in a slanting direction back<lb></lb>wards and downwards—such a blade as the one produced would produce such a wound—it was in a dangerous part—it is quite well now—it healed in about a week.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am a bookbinder and live at 8, Broadway, close to Church-entry—on 25th August I was at home having my dinner; in consequence of hearing a noise I went out and saw the prisoner down Church-entry—there were fifty or sixty people there at the time; they were very noisy and fighting with the prisoner—I did not see him strike any one—I saw them strike him and knock him about—when I first saw him he was by the gate—I did not see him fall back—the next time I saw him was in the entry; they got him up into Shoemaker-row out of the entry—I saw the policeman come up in about 10 minutes; during that time there was a continuance of what I have described on the part of the mob; they all got on him; he could not do anything, some were holding him, and others punch<lb></lb>ing at him.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> About what time was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 20 minutes past 1—I did not hear the water come down in the yard—I have seen the children playing down there—it is not two minutes' walk from my place.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker at 1, Cobb's-court, Blackfriars—I could see from my house the place where this occurred—Cobb's-court is a continuation of Church-entry—on 25th August I was sitting at my dinner; there was a dreadful noise below—I went down and saw the prisoner in a fearful state, and before him was Mrs. Evans, old Edwards, another person, a painter, and the fishmonger, Langford—there had evidently been a great deal of fighting before I got there, because the prisoner was cut in the face and his shirt torn off—Mrs. Evans's daughter said to him, "If you hit my mother I'll hit you;" that was a watchword for another attack—there were a great many people there—the excitement was very great—I only wish to confine myself to the parties that struck him—old Edwards, the painter, and the fishmonger laid into him unmerci<lb></lb>fully; they knocked him into the shop of Mr. Trimm the butterman, who is one of Langford's party—Trimm was standing in the middle of the road at the time, and he came and shoved the prisoner out of the shop, and then the attack was renewed, Langford in a most cowardly manner beating him behind, and swearing he would have his b—liver out before he had done with him—the prisoner was no friend of mine; but I shouted out, "Take him off, I don't care what he has done," and that is how it was stopped—the policeman stood at my left but he did not interfere, he looked very pale—my cry stopped it by magic—I had never spoken to the prisoner previous to this, but he was a well-ordered, well-conducted man, I never saw aught against him—he went away very quietly with the policeman—he bears a respectable character in the neighbourhood.</p>

            . On the 5th of July I met the prisoner in Brick-lane; he asked if I should go to the fair - I said, No - he said he should go, and before he went he should cut his work out of the loom; he said it was bad, and troubled him; on the Wednesday following he came home, while I was at work, and I asked him if he was not sorry for what he had done; he said No, and for two pins he would cut all the work out, and then he should only have three months imprisonment, and get away from his master.</p>

            . I took charge of the prisoner - I asked if he had cut his work in the loom - he said, "Yes, because it went so bad."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have always done my best towards my master - and when I had bad silk I was always taken before the Magistrate - and he said I was lazy when I could not do my task of work - it was very bad indeed.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL GRAVENOR. It was the best silk I could get, but he was always altering it, and therefore it was disabled from working as it should do, he was so fickle minded.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to JOHN VINCENT. Q. Did not you know that I could not get on with the work? A. You said so several times - it was a new harness and not quite settled - if he had made three quarters of a yard, it would have done very well.</p>
               <p>JEMIMA MARGON. I know he complained of his work, and I went with the boy to look at it - it appeared to be bad.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL GRAVENOR re-examined. Q. Supposing the work to have been wrong, could it have been put to any use? A. Yes - it could have been made in another loom; the harness was new, and every thing in a complete state; the value of the silk, spoiled, is about 8l.</p>

            . On Monday night the 2d of August, about nine o'clock, as Mr. Hunt's apprentice, Parish, and I were going over <placeName id="t17731020-5-crimeloc27">Gardner's-field, at Marybone</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was it light at that time?</p>
               <p>Oram. It was not very dark; it was nine o'clock; he said, sir, your money? Parish said he had no money; he said d - n you, you have money; he said he had nothing but the bundle he had in his hand, and the prisoner took the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that is the man that took the bundle?</p>
               <p>Oram. Yes; I saw his face very well. After he had the bundle the other man asked the prisoner where his pistol was; the prisoner then took a pistol from a pocket, I believe inside his coat, and held it to his breast, and said he would shoot him dead if he would not deliver his money; the prisoner put his hand to his pocket, and said, d - n you, you have money; he turned out his pocket and found none; then the prisoner turned to me, and said madam, your money! I gave him two-pence farthing and two keys; the other man said give the lady her keys again; I took one and left the other in his hand. There were three men a-coming over the style which was not many yards from us; they seeing that, the prisoner took up the bundle and run a-cross the field; the three men came up; we told them of it, but they did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177310200006"></xptr> not pursue them. We were going to Mr. Hunt's garden-house; we met Mr. and Mrs. Hunt; Mr. Hunt got some people to his assistance, and went after them, but could not find them. I was at Mr. Whitefield's chapel on a Sunday a fortnight or three weeks after, and I saw the prisoner in the chapel; he was there when I went in; I knew him as soon as I saw him; he went out before service was over; I told Mr. Hunt of it. Parish came and told his master he had seen the prisoner cutting up a sheep in Oxford-market, which is not a great way from Mr. Hunt's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you live with Mr. Hunt?</p>
               <p>Oram. No; I live in Rathbone Place. Mr. Hunt sent his daughter for me to see if I knew the man; I went, and the moment I saw him I knew him again; he was taken up immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing?</p>
               <p>Oram. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found your key again?</p>

               <p>Francis Parish. I am apprentice to Mr. Hunt, who is a carpenter. I was going from his town house to his country house, by the Jews-Harp-House, at Marybone, with some clothes in a bundle.</p>

               <p>Parish. Yes; I am very sure he is the man. On the 10th of September I believe it was, about five weeks after, I was going through Oxford-market, about eleven in the forenoon; he was skinning a sheep or a lamb; I knew him immediately; my master was with me; I told him that was the man that had robbed me. My master sent for Mrs. Oram; when she saw him she said that was the man; the beadle was fetched and he was taken; I was not by when he was taken; I was before the Justice.</p>

            . I bundled up the things mentioned in the indictment, and bid Parish carry them up to the Garden-house; when I came back I met Parish and Oram, who said they had been robbed. About five weeks after my wife returned from market, and said she thought she had seen the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she tell you the particular shop where she had seen him?</p>
               <p>Hunt. No; she only said in the market. I went with the boy to the market; I saw the prisoner skinning a sheep; he said that was the man; I went home and sent my daughter for the girl; as she was coming through the market she said that was the man.

            . On the 2d of August I was in Mrs. Rumley's room between seven and eight o'clock; I saw the prisoner come up into his room joining to them; a little after that his wife came to borrow the frying pan; I staid till after nine o'clock; I never saw him go out; I did not see him go to bed; I heard him cough where the bed was; I was in Mrs. Rumley's room; he could not have moved out of the room because Mrs. Rumley's door was open, which is facing his room; if a cat or mouse had come out I must have seen them.</p>

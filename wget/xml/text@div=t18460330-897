On the night of the 14th of March I was on duty at Ball's Pond—I saw the prisoner with a bag—I asked what he had got—he said some pieces of brass which his father had given him to sell, and they had been in the house five or six years—I found this brass in the bag—I have compared it with the engine—there is the place where it was broken from the pump—it is partly copper and partly brass.</p>

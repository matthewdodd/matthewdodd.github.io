                  </hi>. I am the widow of John Cornwall, and am the prisoner's sister—I was present at his marriage to Mary Ann Mills at Shoreditch Church in 1837—she is now living, and is in the precincts of the Court—I have seen her to-day—I do not know where she has been living since they separated—there has been great provocation on his part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because he is a man who is given to going with very bad women—I am speaking of my brother—I have had no quarrel with him—I do not volunteer all this—I was summoned to speak the truth—his wife lived with him till 1843 or 1844—the two children were left with a person who kept the hairdresser's on the bottom floor of the house—I did not see them there—I was not in the habit of visiting her afterwards—I do not know that she lived with a person named Gayter, in Abbey-street, Bethnal-green, directly after she left her husband—she was accused of robbing Gayter, but he never came forward—I do not know whether she had been living with him—I do not know Thomas Tillett.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know William Crow? do you know that she has been out to Berlin with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing about the wife; and I have not seen my brother for ten years—he acted very villainously with regard to some property of my father's—there is a sisterly feeling on my part, but not a brotherly feeling on his—I heard something about William Crow, and her having been with him, but know nothing of the parties.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I am positive she was not living with any man before they separated at first—what she has done since the last separation I cannot say—I am not instructing the attorney for the prosecution, nor have I seen one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DOYLE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before their separation, was her conduct good? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She was a good wife to him, willing to do his bidding at any time—I was very much acquainted with them, living in the same house at the former part of their marriage—she left him for a very delicate reason in 1843 or 1844—he communicated some disease to her, and they were both at that time under medical treatment—the prisoner told me so, and I said that he ought to be ashamed of himself—he said, "I cannot account for it; I must have sat upon something"—I did not say, "What a shame, after you have been for<lb></lb>given before!"—I said that I would not believe it unless I was convinced of it; and my mother and several people said to him, "Remember, should your wife act wrong, you are the first aggressor."</p>

                  </hi>. On 17th January, 1851, I was married to the prisoner at Rotherhithe Church, Surrey. I had known him two or three years, and have had five children by him, two of them are living.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Has he behaved kindly to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I took care of his two children before we were married, his sister took care of them for twelve months, and when she left I married him. I was living with his sister as servant—I had no property, he told me he had been married before—I saw his first wife about six months after our marriage, she came to the house, saw him, and said, "You are married;" he said, "I am;" she said, "You supposed me to be dead, but I still live to torment you;" I did not see her again till last January twelve months, six years and a half afterwards, she did cot come then, but a message came, that she wanted to see her</p>

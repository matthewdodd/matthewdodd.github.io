                  </hi>. I am servant to the Rev. Mr. Pritchard, of Charlton, Kent—on 26th May I was walking towards his house, 200 or 300 yards from it, when two soldiers took hold of me round my neck—one of them said, "Will you give me some money?"—I said, "No"—the other one came up and said, "Give him <hi rend="italic">some,</hi> if he has not got any," and immediately the second man knocked me down, the shorter one—it was the taller who spoke first—I got up—I felt rather stunned for a moment, and scrambled away as well as I could to my mater's house—the tall one followed me—they wore the Royal Artillery clothes—I knew the uniform by living in the neighbourhood.</p>

I am a sergeant of the military police, stationed at Woolwich—on Friday, 7th May, I received information, and spoke to the prisoners in the barracks—I told Newman he must come with me, and I took him to Randall, who told him he would be charged with stopping civilians on Charlton-road, and demanding money of them, on Thursday last—he made no remark at first, but afterwards he admitted stopping them, and said that he had got 3 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of one—I then brought him back—I saw Broomhall that night; he was in confinement for another offence—I told him the charge, and that whatever he said would be taken notice of and used in evidence against him—he admitted that he had stopped civilians, and made use of filthy language, but did not say that he had robbed them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the firm of Alfred James Waterlow, and others, printers, No. 66, London-wall. The prisoner was in our service ten or twelve months; he collected advertisements for us—he has never accounted to me for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mr. Phillips on 1st Aug., or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received on 10th Oct.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you engage him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, Mr. Lipscomb did—he was to collect advertisements on commission, to render an account monthly, on the 5th of the month, and to receive the sum due to him on the 15th—the commission due to him would be on the advertise<lb></lb>ments inserted in the month for which the account was rendered, to be inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Northern Railway Times</hi>—no commission was to be due on advertisements prospective—if he got an order in June for advertisements to be inserted in July or Aug., or Oct., he would not be entitled to it—these</p>

               <p>advertisements were paid for to a collector, who was authorized to collect them—the prisoner did not generally collect the money—the money for the advertisements was generally paid to the collector—if the prisoner came to us with an advertisement, there was generally a written order—we insert the advertisement in compliance with the order, and we send the collector to get the money—we give credit—if an advertisement is sent on 3rd July, it would not be inserted till Aug.—the money would not be due till Oct.—the accounts would be sent, and the collector would call in course—where there were no written orders there were verbal orders by the prisoner, who was the advertisement collector, and occasionally he would bring in money, but it was not his particular duty—in cases where he came to us with advertisements and no written order he did not render himself responsible for it, certainly not—we never booked an advertisement to him since he has been in our service—if he brought an advertisement to us we should take his opinion as to the person—he never paid an advertisement in advance to my knowledge.</p>

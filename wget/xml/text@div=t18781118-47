I am a surveyor employed by the London Assurance Cor<lb></lb>poration—in 1877 I was employed to survey a coffee and lodging-house occu<lb></lb>pied by the prisoner at 22, Upper East Smithfield; the proposed insurance was 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I reported favourably to that extent—on 1st July this year I was instructed to inspect the premises, 236, High Street, Shadwell, a lodging-house in the prisoner's occupation—I was aware that the proposal was for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had the particulars—the place was fairly furnished—I reported favourably.</p>

I live at Wolseley Street, Mile End—the female prisoner is my aunt—I know 236, High Street, Shadwell; it is a good 20 minutes' walk from my house—on the night of 27th September the prisoners came to my place about 9.30—I was very ill with a fever, and my aunt said she would remain with me for the night; she did so—when I went to bed at 11 she was in the front parlour; I put a small mattress in the room for her—the male prisoner had gone away again directly after he came; he had not returned when I went to bed; there was nobody but us two—I locked my bedroom door; but the street door had no lock at that time; anybody could come in—I only occupy the two parlours; I slept in the back parlour—I got up next morning at 7 o'clock and went into the front parlour, and my uncle was standing there near the window—he was dressed—my aunt was there also—she went out soon after 7; he stayed a little while; I don't know at what time he left—I believe my aunt said that she was going home; he did not come back all day; he returned in the evening, and was then taken into custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. I had been ill for a long time before this; I was getting better then—my aunt came backwards and forwards to see me—she came to see me on the Thursday afternoon before this, and she then said if she had not much to do she would come and stay with me for a night, and I said I should be very glad—my room does not open into the other; you have to go out into the passage and then into the other room—I think my aunt was preparing to go to bed when I left her—I went to sleep as soon as I got to bed, and slept until morning—I could not hear my uncle and aunt speaking in the next room in the morning; you could not hear anything—my aunt came back that morning after she went out, and told my uncle that a gentleman wanted to see him—he said he could not go home just then; he had to look after two Mulatto sailors—when he left I think he said he said he was going to the docks to look after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. When my aunt came back in the morning she did not say anything about a fire having taken place—she went out at 7 o'clock and returned before my uncle left; I think she had been away about an hour and a half—I. first heard of the fire after my uncle was taken—he went out directly after she returned; I can't say which went out first—she remained till the afternoon, and when she went out I saw no more of her—she was gone when he returned in the evening.</p>

I did not say before the Magistrate "When I got up at 7 o'clock the male prisoner was in my parlour, and his wife asked him to go home;" that is a mistake; it was after she returned—when she came on the Friday evening she said "I have come to stay with you to-night"—she had never slept in my house before—I had been ill ever since I came back from Holland, which was about four weeks—my husband had been taken to the hospital a week before this Thursday, and I felt very lonesome, and my aunt brought me something now and then, and she said if she could manage and had not much to do she would stay with me for a night—she did not say what night</p>

               <p>him early on Friday evening, 27th September, about 6.30 or 7 o'clock; his wife was with him—we had no conversation then—about 11 o'clock he came in again alone—he remained about 20 minutes; he had a pint of ale and was talking, but nothing that attracted my attention—he left—I was out when the fire happened; I arrived shortly after, about 1.15; the engine and escape were then there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He used to come in for his supper beer of an evening, mostly about 10 o'clock—at times he would come in afterwards and have a glass—there was nothing unusual in his coming on this particular night at that time—there were other persons in the bar, neighbours that he knew—he did not take any supper beer away with him that night; he was talking of business matters—I gave evidence about this on the following Monday—he did not say where he was going when he left; he did not say he was going for his wife—the rent of his house would be about 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year; it was a sea<lb></lb>man's lodging-house; that is rather a rough sort of business—I do not remember a disturbance taking place there two or three days before; I do not remember two Mulattos threatening him in the street, or any sailors making a disturbance in front of his house—I never heard of anything of the kind—I did not say anything before the Magistrate about a dispute with a sailor—he turned a sailor out four or five days before, but there was no bother; I heard of it afterwards, I was not present—when I got home on the night in question there was a crowd in the street eight or nine doors from the house—I did not see any sailors about that night; I did not remain outside; I went indoors and got my wife up.</p>

               <p>on a shelf in the cupboard there was another candle lied up in paper saturated with oil, and surrounded with small pieces of wood and greasy paper—the other oilskins Were hanging over that candle and close to it—on the cupboard floor there was wood mixed up with coke—in the back kitchen I found some varnish and paraffin in two common glass bottles—there was about half a pint in one and a pint and a half in the other—as far as I could judge the fire had originated in the parlour—I could not say whereabouts, because the parlour was burnt out—after the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> was turned over we found some pieces of wood resembling cheese-boxes—I remained at the house till half past seven o'clock; at that time the female prisoner came to the door—I asked her if she lived there—she said "Yes"—I said, "Have you been at home to-night?"—she said, "No, I left last night at 9 o'clock with my husband"—I said, "Your house has been on fire to-night"—she said, "Oh, has it? Let me go in"—she then went in, and I followed her to the back kitchen—she said, "Have the upstair rooms been burnt as well?"—I said, "Yes, but you cannot go up"—she said, "I must go up; I have got a quantity of things there"—the salvage man said to her, "You cannot got up"—she then put her hand in her pocket, pulled out her purse, and emptied the contents, about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver, on to the table, and said, "If you will allow me to go up, you can have that"—I said, "You may put it back in your purse; you cannot go up"—I then said, "Where is your husband?"—she said, "He left last night with me at 9 o'clock, but he came back at 11 to look after the dog, and I have not seen him since"—I said, "Where is he?"—she said, "He has gone to Harry Box at the West End"—I said, "Do you know the street or number?"—she said, "No, but I could show you"—I said, "I will go with you, as I want to know whether he is insured or not"—she then said, "I cannot go; I don't know the place; but if you will allow me, I will fetch my husband within an hour"—she then left the house; I followed her—she commenced to run, and I lost sight of her; that was near upon 8 o'clock—about 2.30 in the afternoon she came back; I then gave her into custody, and she was then taken to the station—I there asked her where her husband was—she said, "I have not seen him; he has gone to the Docks to look after two mulatto men"—I asked her what office she was insured in—she said, "My cousin wrote it down on a piece of paper"—she took her purse from her pocket, and offered me a two-shilling piece; she shoved it into my hand, and said, "Take this"—I laid it down on the window-ledge—she then took a piece of paper from her pocket; I have not got it, it has been mislaid somewhere—it had on, "Mrs. Milller, No. 3, Wolsley Street, Commercial Road"—I read it, and she said, "That is not the piece; give it me back"—she then gave me this other piece of paper, upon which is written "Mr. Samuel George Brown, 97, High Street, Shad well, agent for the London Fire Insurance"—I told her I should detain her—she said, "I will go to the Victoria Docks with you and show you my husband"—we left the station for that purpose and went to the Shad well railway station; when we got there she said she could not find him, and she would not go in, and I took her back to the station—a little after 3 that day I went to 3, Wolsley Street with the piece of paper I had got, and I waited there till 7.30, when the male prisoner came and knocked at the shutters and went in—I followed him—I said "Is your name Julius Ehmes?"—he said "Yes"—I then said "lama police officer, and shall take you in custody for being concerned with your wife in setting fire to your dwelling-house"—he said "You will have to</p>

"—he said "No, I went to the house you have just brought me from"—I said "Have you seen your wife since 9 o'clock last night? "—he said "Yes, she slept on a mattress and I slept on a chair"—I said "Have you seen her this morning? "—he said "Yes, she got up at 7 this morning, had some coffee, and went to look at the house"—I said "Have you seen her since? "—he said "Yes, I remained there until she returned"—I said "Did she tell you anything when she returned? "—he said "Yes, she told me that the house had been burnt, and that the fireman wanted to see me"—I said "What did you say to that? "—he said "I shan't go; I want to go to the Docks to look after these two men"—the prisoners were then both charged with setting fire to their dwelling-house—the woman said "I don't want money; I have got plenty; I should never do such a thing to gain money"—the man made the same observation as before, "You will have to prove that"—when I first entered the house I saw a dog alive in the first-floor front room—I also saw a dead dog in the back parlour with its legs burnt off.</p>

I could not say in which room the prisoners slept, unless it was the front room; the best bedstead was there; there was no bedding or bed-clothes, only a mattress and palliasse—there were four small beds for seamen upstairs ready to be occupied, but they had not been occupied—I have known the house for years, but did not know the prisoners; it was in my <hi rend="italic">beat</hi>; it appeared to be a lodging-house carried on for sailors; there were no alterations in the outside of the house down to the 27th.</p>

"—after she had run away, I was surprised to find her come back again—she did not tell me that she had stopped at her niece's that night—she is a foreigner<lb></lb>she speaks English fluently—the male prisoner did not say on the way to the station "I don't know who could have done it"—he said nothing about a row—I understood everything that he said.</p>

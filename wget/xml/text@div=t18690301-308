I live at the Bank of Friendship public-house, in Bancroft Place—on 8th February, Phelps came in and asked for a half-pint of half-and-half, and gave me a sixpence in payment—I tried it, found it was bad, and told him so—he said if it had been a two shilling piece, or a half-crown, he might have taken more notice at the time he took it; being only 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he did not—he paid me in good money, and went away with the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Henry Wilde was in the house at the time.</p>

I am a printer, at Mile End—on 8th February I was at the Bank of Friendship public-house when Phelps came in—I saw him give 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to last witness, and saw her return it to him—she bent it, and said, "This is a had one"—he said, "Oh, is it, I will give you another</p>

               <p>one"—he had got it in his hand—I said, "Let me look"—he said, "What do you know about it?" or something of that sort—he paid with good money, and received 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change in coppers, and went out—I followed him, and saw him join Bowen and another outside—they walked along some little distance together, then they separated—as they were walking along I saw Phelps pass something to Bowen; he then went on ahead for some little distance—I afterwards saw Phelps go into the Britannia public-house—Bowen and the other man walked on ahead, but kept within sight of the Britannia—after Phelps came out, I went in, and asked them something, and the landlord showed me a bad sixpence—I afterwards saw the prisoner given in custody—the other man went away.</p>

                  </hi>, <hi rend="italic">butcher, Elstree.</hi> At a quarter past four o'clock in the afternoon of the 6th of July I was at the Green Man, at Kingsbury, with some meat in a cart—I was at the house half an hour or twenty minutes—I am sure my meat was safe when I went into the house—I came to the door once or twice, and was talking to two young men—I got up in the cart, and drove to where I was going to leave the meat, and it was gone—I had got about three quarters of a mile before I went to take it out—I had not uncovered the cloth from the meat—I had not stopped anywhere else—I immediately drove back to the public-house, and after that I drove to a field—I inquired for a person who I thought had taken it, and he was gone—I pursued Biggs, and accused him of it—he denied it—some time after that he said something, and I went after the prisoner—I saw him, and asked him where he had taken the steaks to out of the cart—he denied it—I told him once or twice that a man saw him take them—he denied it—I fetched a policeman, and gave Biggs into custody—Bolingbroke brought me some steaks—I do not know them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Harrow. I was coming out of the Green Man, at Kingsbury—the prosecutor was at the door with a horse and cart—I saw the prisoner there, getting off the prosecutor's cart—he had some meat with him—I cannot say whether it was beef or mutton—he went away, and I saw no more of him—I was charged by the prosecutor with stealing this—I de<lb></lb>nied it, and afterwards told who it was.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable S</hi> 215.) In consequence of information from the prosecutor, I went after the prisoner—I told him the prosecutor had come to give him in charge for stealing two pounds and a half of beef-steaks out of his cart—he said he knew nothing about it—he got into the cart, and rode out with us—he said he did not know where they were, and then he said they were in the field—I went back, and met Matthews with them, buttoned in his jacket.</p>

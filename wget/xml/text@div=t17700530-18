On the 17th of April, 1768, I heard a noise in the passage on that morning, between one and two o'clock, crying out, Looms! Looms! Looms! Broad Looms! Blast your eyes and limbs, get your pistols ready! Get your pistols ready! They were then in the inside of the house in the passage. There is a right-hand door and a left-hand door in the passage; the right-hand door leads to another house; they began breaking that door. One of them said, Blast you, Cox says it is the left-hand door. Cox was a journeyman in my house, and had left the outward door open for them, as I found afterwards; after that he turned evidence against Perrin. They began blasting their eyes and limbs, and called, Open the door! In about a minute they burst my room door open; two of them came in first; they turned the chairs and table up in the room, and got immediately on my bed, one with a pistol, the other with a cutlass. He with the cutlass was by me, the other was by my wife. I saw the glimmer of a light, and said, I would arise. He with the cutlass gave me three blows, one on my back, the other on my shoulder, and the other below my elbow; I was as black as my hat from my shoulder down to my elbow; this was as I raised myself up. The other kept with his pistol to my wife's head. They cried out, D - n them, blow their brains out if they stir. I was made to lie down again. I perceived them go to the drawer, where were four 10 l. bank notes, and one 20 l. thirteen guineas in gold and 17 s. in silver, and a crown in half-pence; they took it all, and seventy guineas worth of ribbon; there were an hundred pieces<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177005300010"></xptr> of it. The next day I went to Sir John Fielding and got a warrant, and took up Perrin. We went to see for the prisoner, but he got off to Dublin, with another man that stands indicted with him. Since that I advertised him, and he was taken at Coventry. I particularly know the prisoner's voice, because he formerly worked for me. He has a very odd voice; I could know it from an hundred people. He went by three names. I went to see if it was the same; I saw it was he, so I said no more. There was a light when they took the things, but they covered me with a pillow. I had heard the prisoner's voice before they came into the room, when they cried, Looms, blast your eyes and limbs! My wife is ill, or she would have been here; Cox is at Coventry now, I imagine.</p>

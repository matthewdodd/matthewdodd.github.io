                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Hill, of St. John's Wood. On 5th Oct. I saw the prisoner receive a sovereign from my mistress, to pay him 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for beer from Mr. Blogg—he filled up this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and gave the change—I saw a book in his hand—he wrote the receipt on it, but did not open it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Blogg's clerk. I copied the prisoner's sales from his diary in this book—it is a true copy—this 5th Oct. is my entry—here is no entry of money received from Mr. or Mrs. Hill—I cannot say whether I or Mr. Blogg took his money that evening—the prisoner used to come home, go to the counting-house, make up his book, and pay the money before he left—he has never paid me this 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he never paid me anything that was not entered—I was watching him with his dray—I do not know whether he saw me, but his brother did, and told him—he went on to the next customer, and left two casks—I went in and questioned the customer, and then went home, and afterwards heard that the horse and cart were in the Greenyard.</p>

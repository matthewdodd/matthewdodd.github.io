                  </hi>. I am a single lady, residing at Claremont Villas, Finsbury Park—on the afternoon of the 20th inst. I went to Messrs. Barclay, Lombard Street, my bankers, and received a cheque for 52<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was cashed, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes and 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—I put the notes in an envelope in the side pocket of my bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and the 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. gold into my purse, which had in it 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., making altogether 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I put the purse in the bag on the top, and carried the bag in my left hand—my sister was at my right side, touching me—we had just left the bank to cross the street to avoid the crush near the Mansion House, when I found my bag open a few inches, and saw the prisoner standing within a foot or so of me, with my purse in his hand, I put out my hand to take it from him and said, "Oh, you have got my purse! Give it to me," and he then ran in the direction of the crowd, and I called out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. The purse was just on the top—the bag was fastened, but not locked—I snapped it when I came outside the bank, and after<lb></lb>wards found it open, and at the same time saw the prisoner near me with the purse, and he ran away—I saw no policeman near—this was at the end of Lombard Street, near the Mansion House, at 3 p.m.—it was done instantly—I did not get to the Mansion House until late in the day, when I attended and signed the depositions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The prisoner was looking towards me, and did not speak when I asked him for my purse—I ultimately received the money from the policeman—this is the purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,).</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 622). I was on duty in Lombard Street on May 7th—the last witness spoke to me, and I then saw the prisoner running amongst the traffic towards the Mansion House, I ran after him to the front of the Mansion House, between the kerb and the 'busses, and he dodged about among the vehicles, and I came up to him on the foot-way near St. Mildred Court, just as another constable caught him—there was a crowd round him—the other constable held him by his right hand, and seeing the prisoner put his left hand behind him, I seized it, and he said, "What have I done"—I pulled up his left hand in front of him, and took the puree from his sleeve, and I left him in charge of the other constable—on examining the puree at the station, I found it contained 33<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and a farthing.</p>

The lady was standing near Mr. Webber's, the con<lb></lb>fectioner's, Lombard Street, when she spoke to me, and I was in the middle of the road directing the traffic, I saw a man running and followed him, and when the prisoner was stopped I found the puree in his sleeve.</p>

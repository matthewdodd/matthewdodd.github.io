                  </hi> I am a native of St. Christopher, in the West Indies. I arrived in London, having gone to America, on 14th or 15th June—on 15th July I went to Cremorne-gardens—I was smoking a cigar there, and the prisoner Barr came up to me—I saw no one with him—he asked me to give him a light for his cigar—I did so, and we got into conver<lb></lb>sation—we walked about the gardens, and eventually got to where the fire<lb></lb>works were—I am not exactly certain that I told him in the gardens where I had come from, but I did tell him—we remained in the gardens an hour, or an hour and a half, and left together at the time the gardens closed, I think near eleven o'clock—I intended to have come to town by the omnibus, but Barr said he was going by the boat, and there was a balloon going from Vaux<lb></lb>hall, and I went with him—we landed at Vauxhall-bridge or Waterloo-bridge; I think it was at Waterloo-bridge—no one spoke to him on board the boat—when we landed, my cigar was out—I said I should like another cigar—Barr said he knew exactly where I could get a very good one, and he took me to Outhwaite's, a cigar-shop in Little Russell-street—we had talked about places we had stopped at, and he told me he had come from Jamaica, and he was managing estates out there for a cousin of his—when we got to Outh<lb></lb>waite's, he said we West Indians were fond of a cup of coffee, would I join with him—we had some coffee, and while we were drinking it two men came in, whom I now know by the names of Lewis and Carter—they then went by the names of Stevens and Harrington—they did not appear to know Barr—after they had been in a little while, they were discussing some point of whist—there was some bet, apparently, on the point—they referred to Barr and me for our opinion—we had some discussion on the point, and one of them proposed that a pack of cards should be brought in, that the point might be more clearly exemplified—a pack of cards was brought in by the man at the bar, on the application of either Lewis or Carter—the point was then dis<lb></lb>cussed again, and then we commenced plying for coffee and cigars—I do not know who proposed it, but it was proposed to play for coffee and cigars—we then began to play for a shilling—Barr was my partner, he being my friend, and Lewis and Carter were friends—I know the game of whist—I have played it—I took up a hand that I considered a very winning hand, a hand that appeared impossible to lose—I had four honours and the two highest trumps, nine and ten—it was a beautiful leading hand—I had, I think, the ace of spades—I had no diamonds at all in my hand—hearts were trumps—when I saw this hand I laughed at the idea of playing such an extraordinary hand—Lewis had dealt it to me—when I said I had got a most extraordinary hand, Lewis said, "If any one would give me six to one, I should not mind betting him on the odd trick"—I thought I would give him the odds, as I was certain of winning it—I said any amount that he would bet I would bet</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184712130023"></xptr>
               <p>him—I thought there was no possibility of losing it—I was the eldest hand and the first player—I sat next to Lewis—I said, "If you will bet, I will bet you 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at six to one"—Barr said, "If you have got such a good hand, I don't mind betting it," and he made his bet too—I do not know whether it was 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but he had to place down his watch—I played off the six trumps and the ace of spades I believe, and that was trumped by Lewis—I cannot exactly tell what I had beside, but I know I had no diamonds—Lewis brought in his diamonds—he had been seven trumps to my six, and he had a suit to follow—neither his partner nor mine had any trumps at all—Lewis and I had all the trumps—when this was lost, I paid a 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank note down—I had to leave my watch for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more, and Barr put down his money and watch—I did not examine Barr's money—he had the arrangement of it with Lewis—after I had lost the odd trick we separated, and I and Barr went on to Evan's—I asked Barr if the watches were safe—he said he supposed that these men were known to Outhwaite, and we should get our watches the next day—I had received their names—Lewis was Stephens, and Carter was Harrington or Carrington—those names were given in the presence of Barr—Stephens was the betting-man—after going to Evans's, Barr and I went home together—he lived at St. John's-wood—I told him I was much astonished at my losing this trick—he said it must have been my bad playing—Stephens had given his address at the Tavistock Hotel, Covent-garden, and Barr and I were to go there the next day to redeem our watches—Barr called at my place next day, I think between three and four o'clock, and we went together—we met Lewis just in Covent-garden Market—he said he was just going out, because we had not been to our appointment—I believe we were some half-hour behind our time—Lewis said he had the watch at a certain place, and he would go and redeem it, if I did not mind going into this littler place—I have since understood it is the Bear and Ragged Staff, in Castle-street—I do not know whether he had the watch about him, or whether it was there—I got my watch there, and paid my 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Barr then paid his money and redeemed his watch—Lewis then said that he expected Carter very shortly, and there was some proposal made to play—I said it was about my dinner hour. I wanted to go home—I and Barr went away—Barr made an appoint<lb></lb>ment to meet me at Evans's, and I met him there—we went to the Bear and Ragged Staff—they had taken the rooms—I heard them tell the man they would be there at seven o'clock—Barr and I went there, and met Lewis and Carter—we all four sat down to whist—Barr was my partner, as before—we played for a bet, and I lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had a hand that I was induced to bet on against a good hand—Lewis dealt it—the bet was got up the same way as he other—Lewis looked at his hand and said, "I don't mind making a bet"—the bet was the last hand we played, but before that we were playing a match, which could get the greatest number of rubbers—we played a good while, and this heavy hand was given to me—Lewis looked at his hand and said he did not mind taking a bet, if anybody would give him odds—I looked at my hand and said, "I have a most extraordinary hand here"—Barr looked at his hand, and he encouraged me by saying he would join in a bet—I cannot tell whether I led, but I lost the odd trick in the same manner as before—it was quite unintelligible to me—I lost 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the that bet—we had been playing before for trifles—I had not own any other bet—this was the closing bet—I believe we were best off in the rubbers—I cannot tell what we were playing for, it was so much stake for a match—I think it must have been pounds—I might have won from Lewis a few pounds—I think I paid 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a Bank note, as near as I can remember, and I again deposited</p>

               <p>my watch—we then separated, and Barr and I went home together—Barr said he found I was not equal to play with these men—he said, "I will bring a man that will play the two of you, or any two men in England"—he then said it was Mr. Carlile, and Wyndham Club, of which Barr said he was a member, and Carlile and Barr were to play these two men, and I was to go in to back Barr—Barr invited Lewis, Carter, and myself, to meet Carlile at his house on the following Wednesday—Barr and I then went home together—I said to Barr, "I think they must have been cheating"—he said it was impos<lb></lb>sible, he had watched them all the time as closely as possible, it was only my careless way of playing—on the following Wednesday I went, according to my engagement, to No. 1, Manning-place, St. John's-wood—I only found Barr there—he said he had seen Carlile play repeatedly at the Wyndham Club, and no man could beat him—he seemed to be anxious about dinner—Lewis came, and we sat down—he would not wait for Carter—Barr received a note from Carlile, stating that his father was ill, and he could not come—Carter came at last, and after dinner Barr said, as Mr. Carlile could not come, he supposed these gentleman would not expect him to forfeit the stake—there had been a bet made of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to bind the match—they said we had behaved so honourably, that they would expect to play in out another day—Carter and Lewis then left, and I was introduced to Mrs. Barr—I was asked how I was going to pass my evening—I had just come from a concert that morning, and was going to a ball that evening at Hanover-square Rooms—he asked Mrs. Barr if she should like to go—she went up to dress, to go, and Barr and I sat down to play at ecarte—he said the way he had been accustomed to play at ecarte was, if he won the first hand he would double it—he said, "A man cannot win ten times or twenty; if you win a game it will be clear, and then go on again"—we went on, till at last he got me up to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said then, "I will leave off"—he said, "I will give you another chance, make it 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or nothing"—we played that game, and he won it—after that, he, and I, and the lady went to the ball—this was on Wednesday, and on the following Saturday I received a communication from Barr that Lewis had sent him an invitation to go down to Greenwich to play off this match, as Mr. Carlile had not come we must play it—we went on Saturday, 24th July, to the Yacht-tavern, at Greenwich; but previous to going down, Barr said, as I thought these men had been cheating us, he would take a pack of his own cards down, so that there could be no possibility of these men cheating us; as we were going down to an out-of-the-way place, cards could not be got, and these were to be introduced, and he would say he had brought them down with him that there might be no difficulty in getting them—while we were entering the rail<lb></lb>way carriage we saw Carter—Barr seemed to be disgusted with him—he said, "There is that fellow again, he is always in the way"—we were rather behind our time, and he thought he would be there before us—the observation he made was that he did not wish to see him—he said he was a sort of pig, that ate fish with his knife; and that they got betting about cannons, and that Carter got betting about cannons before invented—Harrington was the name I knew Carter by then—we dined at the Yacht and after dinner we went into a private room, the cards were introduced by Barr, and we ordered wine and nuts—there was only one pack that I saw—Barr said, "I have brought down a peck with me"—we sat down to play our match—we were to play for so many hours—there were different bets on the points, and so much on the match—we were one rubber a head—I had a most extraordi<lb></lb>nary hand—I was dealt nine trumps, and a very fair hand beside—I do not recollect what the others were—I said what an extraordinary hand I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184712130025"></xptr>
               <p>again, and Lewis wanted to bet—I said I had been so unfortunate by losing twice, that I would not bet—Lewis had dealt me that hand—Barr looked at his hand, and said, "My hand is such, that I should think I could give any one three to one on my hand"—he was my partner—after this a bet was made, Barr 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—that was 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I led off my trump, which was a heart—I said "Trump"—Barr said, "O, that is not trump, diamonds are trumps,"—and there was a great dispute about the trumps—he thought these men had changed the trumps—I said "No," hearts were trumps and we must abide the bet—I lost the odd trick because my partner had no hand—I think the heart I led was a three of hearts, the smallest I had in my hand—the end was that I lost the odd trick, and Lewis again had the command of all my trumps—I cannot tell how he did it but he again had it—when the odd trick was lost Barr thought it was through carelessness—he put his hand up to his head and said he was dis<lb></lb>tracted—I got up—they asked me to go down and take a glass of soda-water—I went down and took one—Barr would not take anything—he got up and came away—the bet always finished the evening play—I had a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in my pocket—I produced it on the table, and of course I left my watch for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Barr put down his watch and some money, or what appeared to be money—I always betted for more then I had—they knew the value I put on my watch—they would have taken it for any money—we all came to town together—the omnibus took us up—we made an engagement to meet again, as the match had not been played out—I was to meet them on Monday morning to pay the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on Monday morning the 26th, Barr came to my place—I said I could not make it convenient to pay the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that day—he said, "We will go and arrange about it"—we went—I saw Barr pay the money to redeem his watch—I did not see him take his watch out of the man's hand, but I saw him with it, and he had it not before—I made an arrangement to pay on 3rd Aug.—I left my watch because I could not pay that day without selling out—I met Barr on 3rd Aug., and accompanied him to Doctors' Com<lb></lb>mons to prove my father's will—it was necessary there should be two wit<lb></lb>nesses to the bond—they were Barr and Stephens—this is the bond—before I went there, I had been with Barr to the stock-brokers, and sold out 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. it fetched about 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Barr had said he could get his friend to sign as surety, and he left me at Doctors' Commons and brought Lewis with him in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—Barr said, "My friend was out, and luckily I met with Stephens" (we had appointed to pay the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Lewis that day)—Lewis signed the bond, and I paid the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and got my watch back—of course the match was still pend<lb></lb>ing—Barr brought me letters on different occasions saying, this man Stephens was worrying him to play out the match, and he wanted me to write him a note to say what I would do—I said "No, you have been corresponding with him, you must correspond with him, I will keep out of the way; I will not play with him, let the matter die off"—I said I would not play any more with Carter or Lewis—I expressed that several times, and Barr expressed himself just as willing as myself not to meet him—I still continued to associate with Barr—we were very intimate—he pro<lb></lb>posed to me to go into the country—he said he was going to Ramsgate for a few weeks, and was going to take Mrs. Barr—after he had been there a week he wrote to me to go down—I did not go—after he returned from Rams<lb></lb>gate he called on me and said he was very sorry I had not been down, and asked me to go down with him to Boulogne—I did not go—I expressed a wish to see Windsor Castle, and I left London with him to go there on 2nd Sept.—he told me he had some friends shooting near Windsor, and if I was fond</p>

I would not play club-law—I lost 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I lost 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Ralfs, and nearly 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the balance to Barr—I did not keep the exact amounts—Barr gave checks immediately for them—I did not read them—they were satisfied with them—I was to pay the money into Barr's hand—I told them I had no banker—I went the next morning with Barr and sold out 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was 870<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I and Barr got into a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and went to my lodging—I paid him the remainder there—Barr left me, to pay those checks, and to go into the country—that was the last time I played—after this, about the 8th or 9th of Sept., I received a note from Ralfs; he wished to see me—I called to see him at the Gloucester Coffee-house—he asked me what I intended to do that evening; he was going to the theatre, and his object in writing to me was to know whether I intended to go to the Doncaster races—if I would go be would go down, but he did not wish to go with Barr—he asked how I became acquainted with Barr—I said I picked him up in London—he said, "Oh!" or something, and he said no more—he then asked what I would do the next day—he said a friend of his, Mr. Gammon, was lame, and he had given him the privilege of shooting over his grounds—he asked me to go, but I declined—he asked what I intended to do on the Saturday—I said I was engaged then—he said Brewer and himself were going to Richmond to dine on Sunday, and he invited me—I accepted it—on Sunday I sent him an excuse—I did not go—Ralfs came to me on Monday about eleven o'clock—he said what was the reason I did not go—I said I had an engagement—he said he thought I was lazy, and he proposed that I should go with him to Brewer's to see some game fowls—I said I expected a friend to be with me; if he left me in time, I should be there about one o'clock—as he was leaving the room I said, "I hope that money with Barr was quite right"—he said, "Yes, quite right"—this was on Monday, 13th Sept.—when I returned home in the evening I received a letter from Ralfs, saying he wished to see me very particularly, and one from Barr, not to see Ralfs and Brewer till I had seen him—the purport of Ralfs note was that he wished to see me very particularly relative to the checks—Barr called on me on the Tuesday or Wed<lb></lb>nesday morning—his face was very much swollen—he told me he had met with an accident in shooting—his gun had kicked him—he asked if I had had a letter from Ralfs—I said, "Yes, about the checks"—he said a most extraordinary thing had happened to him in going down by the train, he met a friend who said, "Do you know Ralfs has been shooting at a pigeon<lb></lb>match and cheating?" and he said he did not go and pay the check—Ralfs called on me and said, "Did you see Barr?"—I said, "Yes"—he said Barr had been there to ask what business he had to write to take me down to Windsor—he asked me if I saw his face—I said, "Yes, his gun had kicked</p>

Mr. Barr, Mr. Kerie has paid me that money, and if you are a gen<lb></lb>tleman you will give it him back"—(I had not paid him any, but I had agreed with Ralfs that he should say so)—Barr turned to me, and told me he thought from the intercourse we had had, I ought to have told him I had the check—he said, if I would give Ralfs a check for the amount, and keep the check which he, Barr, had given, he would the next day pay me that amount—I declined it, and left the house with Ralfs—Barr said he had just brought out money enough to knock in a game at cards.</p>

Barr's expenditure for the cigars and coffee—I went by the name of Stephens, and Carter by the name of Harrington—it was Barr's suggestion that we should go by those names—he knew me and Carter by our own names before—he used to call at my lodgings frequently, and I on him—Barr gave me directions about meeting the next day at the Tavistock—I was walking near the Tavistock when Barr and Mr. Kerie came—we walked together—I asked Mr. Kerie to go and take a glass of wine—I said they were busy cleaning up at the Tavistock, and we walked on till we got to Castle-street—I proposed going in to Hitchcock's, the Bear and Ragged Staff—I there gave Mr. Kerie his watch—when we went in, Barr had slipped his watch to me privately, that I might seem to give it him before Mr. Kerie—I got from Mr. Kerie 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and from Barr some flash-notes—we were taking wine up-stairs, and a game of cards was pro<lb></lb>posed—Mr. Kerie objected, saying he was going to dress, and he would meet us at seven o'clock—he made that arrangement when he left about three—I ordered the room at seven, and Barr left us to go home with Mr. Kerie—Barr came back, and staid till five—he then left us to go to Mr. Kerie—it was arranged that we were to play and do the same thing with a different suit, or it might have been the same hand, but it was such a hand that it was certain for Mr. Kerie to lose, though to all appearance he must win—at seven o'clock Mr. Kerie and Barr came—I and Carter were partners, and Mr. Kerie and Barr—I believe we were playing long-whist, but I let Mr. Kerie, as arranged with Barr, have cards to make them think they were going to beat us—I had not played the stacked pack then, but we could give Mr. Kerie what cards we liked—we could give him good hands—we took care that we did not shuffle</p>

He has an appoint<lb></lb>ment with his uncle at five o'clock, to sign some papers. He will not be dis<lb></lb>engaged till half-past, when he meets me to dine, so you may expect to see us at Greenwich about half-past six, and I should advise you to look out for us at the Church, where you will see us pass. I shall be on the look out for you. I do not think we had better dine at the Yacht again, but at the Tra<lb></lb>falger, or Ship, lest he should think something.—Yours, in haste, A. W. Barr. Half-past ten o'clock."—"Dear Lewis,—I showed Kerie your letter, and he says he is engaged on Monday, but that on Tuesday, the 17th, he will be happy to play it out at the Tavistock; to be punctual at seven. Get all you can. I think we shall have to follow him to Liverpool. I did not say any<lb></lb>thing to him about your going to Doncaster. I shall not be there.—Yours, in haste. A. W. Barr."—"Friday, 20, 1847. Dear Lewis,—I received your letter, but not till this morning, so that K. has not seen it. He dined with me yesterday, and this morning started for Tenby to see his aunt, and will return to town on Thursday next. I therefore propose to tell him when he returns that I have fixed upon Monday, August 30, to finish our match, and when I hear what he says I will let you know. At. all events I shall see you as soon as he returns. Everything seems all right.—Yours, in haste, A. W. Barr."—"Dear Lewis,—I received yours this morning. I am going with K. to-morrow to spend two or three days at his uncle's, at Richmond, where he has invited me. I shall be in town on Monday with him, but should anything occur I will write to you. The business goes on well. He has proved the will, and goes to-morrow morning to lodge the papers at the Bank, where they remain eight days, when he will <hi rend="italic">touch</hi> 2700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., three and a half per cent.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You knew Brewer till you went to his house on the 17th Sept.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not personally—Carter and I went to his house—I left Carter outside—he waited while I had an inter<lb></lb>view with Brewer and Ralfs—Carter then came in—I had that morning com<lb></lb>municated to Mr. Kerie what I went I have stated to-day—I think it was not later than the 17th when I went to Brewer, because Barr had told me that Mr. Kerie was going off on the 19th—I have been a gambler and a cheat about two years—I was nothing else, but my own business—I was engaged for one firm, Mr. Andrews, for nine months—I swear I was never connected with any of the gambling-house in Leicester-square—I was never charged with extort<lb></lb>ing money from a person by charging him with an unnatural crime, before I went to America—I do not know such a circumstance—I left London because I wished to see America—I thought by entering into business there I might do better then in this country—that was my only motive for going—it was not in consequence of any charge made against me—when I got to America I did not become a banker, nothing of the kind—I did not open a bank with a crowbar that I am aware of—I staid there better then three years—I was not a journeyman there—I had a little money—my mother left me some—it was not by means of a will—she gave it me—I mean she left it me previous to her death—she was not dead when she gave me the money—it might have been twelve or eighteen months before her death—I did not intend the Jury to believe that my mother died and left me the money, she gave it me, as she had done on several occasions—I took out to America with me about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I took London—my mother was then dead—I had received part of the money from my mother in Wales—I brought up from Cardiff about 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saved some money hear myself—I was a journey-man nearly three years—the 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was not always in my pocket—it was in my possession—I kept it in my portmanteau and my desk—I did not put it out to interest—I might have speculated a little in pictures—I used to speculate if it suited me—I did not speculate with the bulk of the money—I might with 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if I thought I could get anything by it—the rest of the money I kept in my desk of box—that was part of the money that enabled me to go to America—I had once to go before a Magistrate for wining 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of a man—I played at cards myself with a man that time—that was the only time I was charge with anything—I was not charged then particularly—I gave the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back to the man, and he gave me what he had won of me—I was never in custody at Merthyr Tydvil, or at Dulas, for stealing paint—I remember a constable coming to my lodging.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Not coming to your lodging, but coming to the Church, and did you not take all the paint-pots, and mix them together, so that it would be im<lb></lb>possible to know one from the other, to prevent the possibility of their as<lb></lb>certaining how much had been stolen? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I mixed them, and I can</p>

               <p>give a reason for doing so—I had several men under me there at Dulas—I would foolishly allow them to go out shooting or fishing, and used to pay them their money; a man came from Bristol, named Cotterall, or some such name, I took him out shooting, and he told the gamekeeper who took him out, and there was a warrant for me, for poaching—I went to the Church were this man was at work—I desired him to go out—he would not—I might have a struck him, and made him go out, and he went and got a war<lb></lb>rant, and he went to Mr. Evans, who sent him back to tell me to let him work—I would not, and then Mr. Evans sent for me—he desired me to employ him—I said I would not employ him again, and he said, I might leave the work—there was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. due to me—they would not pay me, and my solicitor desired me to leave it—I went to the Church, and took a little burnt umber, and a little black, and mixed it, to alter the tone of the paint in the Church, and William Lewis came to the Church, and he understood from this man that I had spoilt his paint, and they sent a con<lb></lb>stable to my lodging—I was not taken—I shut the door against him, and locked it—I told him he must not come in there—in the meantime Mr. Evans got to understand what I had done, that I had only altered the tone of the paint, not spoilt it—the next day was Sunday, and I had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity of explaining the whole circumstance, and the constable was taken off—I know there is no person in that neighborhood but would give me the highest character, except for an acquaintance with a young woman there that I married—the only thing against me was, that I married a young woman—that is the only thing that any of them can say against me—it was on account of the paint they sent for the constable—I brought the young woman up to London—she is my wife—she returned home again—I do not remember a Captain Kelly preferring some indictments against some persons for swindling, or for gaming—I do not know any such circumstance—I was not employed to settle with the swindlers or the gamblers—it was usual for the prisoners and me to share in what was won by them—I was not the bead man, but they thought I had better never perhaps, and put me forward to do what was done—I did not always stack the cards—I did sometimes, and sometimes Barr, or Carter did—on the first and second occasion I was the person selected to change the cards—I did not stack them—I believe it was Barr who stacked them—one of us gave the pack of cards to Mr. Hitchcock, the innkeeper—I could not undertake to swear whether it was me, or Barr, or Carter—we were a little elevated, and I am afraid to tell a falsity by swear<lb></lb>ing which of us gave it him—I had seen Hickman before—we had been there frequently—I believe he knew I was a gambler and a cheat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember yourself, either seeing the cards given or given them to Hitchcock? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—one pack was given to him—I really could not swear which of us gave it him—one of us said, "Hitchcock, you may keep that pack"—most likely it was me or Carter—that was after the cards were played—I went down to Brighton in company with some person, with whom I have been since, because some persons came after me—I do not know who they were—they told me something, and I communicated what they told me to Mr. Abrahams—it was by his advice that I went to Brighton, and had a person with me during the whole of the time.</p>

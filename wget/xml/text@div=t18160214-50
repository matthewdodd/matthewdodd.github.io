I keep fowls. I used to keep them of a night in the shop. I saw my fowls at 12 o'clock at night. They were in a sort of cage up by the window. The glass of that window was all safe. It has only three squares of glass. I can't tell whether they might not be cracked, but there was no hole in them. The window was fastened up with nails. I did not hear any thing in the course of the night. The next morning I went to the shop at a little after nine. I found the window was broken, and a knife was lying at the outside of it. Part of one of the squares moved up and down in a wooden frame, but it was bolted. All the glass was out of the middle frame. I missed six fowls, and the other five were left. There was not room for a person to get in at the window, because it was barred. They must have put their hands in and reached the fowls out. I told my son what I had lost, and he went somewhere. In consequence of information he gave me, I went to Mrs. Hicks in Knightsbridge, opposite the Cannon brewhouse. She sells asses milk. Hawkins was her servant, and I found him on her premises. I told him what I had lost, and I had a suspicion that it was on those premises. I asked him if he had any objection to my searching to see if they were these to clear himself, and he said he had not in the least. I searched his bed-room, and nothing could be found. Then I asked him if he had any objection to my looking in the hay stable, and he said not the least; but the key could not be found. After some looking about he found it, and then he opened the door himself, and there we found a sack with eight fowls, quite open, not tied nor covered with any thing. They were dead in their feathers, but their heads were off, and lying in a copper. I asked him what he knew of it; and he said he had been in liquor the night before, and had let two men have the key of the stable to sleep there. Four of these eight fowls were mine; I knew them to be mine, and could swear to them. I then went for an officer, and took Hawkins into custody. That is all I know. I know nothing about the other prisoner.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to St. Luke's, Chelsea. Mr. Paul came down to me on Friday morning, and I went and examined the window of his house by his kithen, and saw the mark of the knife in the wood where the glass had been forced out. I then went with Mr. Paul to Mrs. Hicks's yard, where the copper was with some fowl's heads. I then apprehended Hawkins, and took him and the copper to the watch-house. He denied knowing any thing of the robbery; and I went in search of Lander the same day. It was from Hawkins's information that I went in search of Lander; then Lander told me in the back yard, Bow-street, all about it; he wanted to go out several times. I asked him if he knew this knife (producing it.) This is the knife I found at Paul's, by the window; he said he knew it perfectly well. He stated that he went to the White Hart, and staid there all the evening; that he met Rowe there, and saw Hawkins, and that he got the key of the stable from Hawkins to sleep there; that they quit the Hart at ten o'clock, and went to the premises of Mr. Pizey, and thence they took a copper and four fowls; that they then went to Paul's and took the glass out of the window, and got the fowls there; and after that they went to the stable and slept there, and left the things there. He then said it was a bad job, and he supposed he should have fourteen years for it.</p>

I am the person who first apprehended the prisoner Lander, in the pit of the Olympic Pavillion, in New Castle-street, in the Strand. I think it was a little after nine at night, on Friday the 12th of January. I told him it was for taking a copper and some fowls. He seemed much alarmed, and asked me what they would do with him; I told him I was not aware of the nature of the robbery. I asked him where Rowe was, and he said he did not know. When we got into Covent-Garden to the watch-house, he told me he would take me to where Rowe was. He took me down into Westminster, where I met with Westcoat. Before that, he told me how it was. I told him first that it was not in our power to promise him any thing. He said he had been drinking with this Rowe and a man named Hawkin's, and that they had stopped very late at Knight's-bridge, and that he was too late to get in to his lodgings; that he and Rowe asked Hawkin's for the key of his loft to sleep there. That in going along, they agreed to get some fowls; that they went to the house in a field, where the door was open, and took a copper and four fowls. I then told him he had named nothing of the fowls at Paul's; he said, that going by Paul's they head some fowls crow, and he put his hand in. and took four. I asked him if the glass was in the window, and he said, it was all out; a minute afterwards, he said it was only cracked, and he took the pieces out.</p>
               <p>Lander's Defence. I asked this young man Hawkins, and he gave me and Rowe the key, and we both slept in the loft; I sat down, and went to sleep, and in the morning I got up, and went away. In the evening I went to the play with a young man I know, and Mr. Ruthven took me in the pitt; they asked me a great many questions; but I don't know what I said, for I was rather intoxicated with liquor, and this Mr. Maybank that says I owned to the knife, swears false; for when I was in the winevaults eating some bread and cheese, he produced that knife, and asked me if it was mine, and it being very like mine, I said it was, and I have got mine here now, and it is very like it.</p>

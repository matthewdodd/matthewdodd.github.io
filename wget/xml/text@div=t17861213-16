That gentleman who stands there, when they took me in custody, took out of my pocket one guinea, two shillings, and one penny, which I will be greatly obliged to you to return before I speak; the night they apprehended us, I had been down to Edgeware to see a young fellow, who was a lad that drove a chaise; but I could not find him; returning back from Edgeware, I met these two young men on the road; they said, they were going to town; when these men took us all to a public house; where they searched us, and kept us all night in Covent Garden watch-house; and in the morning there were two young men that were Frenchmen that were in prison in the same room where I was; they had some gin, and I drank with them, and I smoked a pipe of tobacco, and it took a great effect upon me; I knew not what I said; I remember taking the pen into my hand; but I am innocent of knowing any thing of these men; I have nobody here at present; I expected my brother who lives with Mr. Dowry, in Billiter-square.</p>

               <p>Fra. Bull. On monday the 6th of this month I lost two handkerchiefs, a guinea, a nine shilling piece, and 10 s in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Bull. She was my <rs id="t17601022-9-deflabel58" type="occupation">servant</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you leave her in the house when you went out?</p>
               <p>Bull. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of your house was the money?</p>
               <p>Bull. It was in the till in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body left in the house besides the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bull. Only a little girl.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you meet with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bull. My wife found her the next day; we took her before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q What did she say for herself?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176010220013"></xptr>Bull. She did not own it particularly; I was not there all the time, we were call'd by one at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Bull. I can't tell every word she said.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your money again?</p>
               <p>Bull. The money was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the money, or any of it?</p>
               <p>Bull. No, I cannot; there were also two linnen handkerchiefs found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did they belong to?</p>
               <p>Bu ll. To my wife, as my wife says, but I don't know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are they?</p>
               <p>Bull. They are in the hands of the officer, belonging to Old Brentford, but he is not here. She was searched at the Plough at that town, the prisoner own'd she took the money and the handkerchief before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>Bull. I am.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bull. I and my husband were at Hounslow fair on the 6th of this instant, and upon our return the prisoner was gone, and the money too; I found her the next morning, and accused her with taking it; she denied it; she had two handkerchiefs on, my property; we took them from off her neck, they are but of small value, the officer has them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is he?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bull. I have not seen him to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bull. His name is Wheelwright; the prisoner was put into the cage at Old Brentford about three hours; I had an information she had some money about her; she was searched, and a guinea, a nine shilling piece, and two half crowns, and some shillings, were found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear her confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bull. She did not own any thing at all, as I heard, concerning taking the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say about the handkerchiefs?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bull. She said they were mine, but she did not think of stealing them, but intended to bring them back again; she had lived with me about half a year, I never found her dishonest before; I imagine she was set on by some men to do this, she is very young.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in her defence.</p>

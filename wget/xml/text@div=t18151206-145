I gave her one shilling and sixpence, and a shilling remained due to her. She never returned to me. I had no suspicion until the Thursday, the Lord Mayor's day, when Mrs. Godfrey came to me; I then went to the drawer, and found it open, that is unlocked; but it was pushed in as close as if it was locked; the forty-pound note, the five-pound note, and several small notes, were missing; there was some notes left in the drawer.

            . I live in Fore-street, and am a linen-draper. I recollect the prisoner at the bar, and a woman named Evans, called at my shop, on Wednesday, the 8th of November; she stated that she wanted some mourning, for her father was dead. The woman, named Evans, said, perhaps he wont change the note you have got, we had better go to the Bank, and we will call on our return; at that time, I did not know the amount of the note, and fearful of loosing a customer, I said I would change it. Then the woman, Evans, produced the note, as the prisoner's. When I saw it, I had a suspicion that it was not good, and not having any one in the house, I beckoned to a neighbour to go to the Bank, to see if it was good. He returned with two twenty-pound notes, and then I had no doubts, and therefore sold the prisoner the articles she wanted; she bought goods to the amount of upwards of five pounds. I gave her a twentypound note, and the difference out of the change of the other twenty-pound note. I tendered the change to Evans, as the prisoner seemed in such distress at the loss of her father; I gave it to Evans, because she said she had heard some account of the death of her husband also that morning, and seeing the prisoner over-whelmed with grief; I thought it more decorous to give it to Evans. The next day she came again, and bought some trifling articles; Evans had not then the property. She then tendered me a ten-pound note, which I believe to be one of those I had paid to her the day previous.</p>

When I saw her in Newgate, I was so much affected, that I began crying; she told me not to cry, that she had a friend who had sent her a twenty-pound note, to provide attorney and counsel, Mr. Fancom, in Tooley-street; she desired me to buy her a few things for the trial; she gave me the note. When I came home, I told my husband where I had been; he was very angry with me for going to Newgate, and said, if I did not go to Mr. Fancom, he would. I then went to Mr. Fancom, and in consequence of directions he gave me, I went to the Bank, where I found the note was stopped.</p>

            . I am an officer of the City of London. I recollect apprehending the prisoner on the 10th of November; I apprehended her in Ship-yard, Redcross-street; I made her acquainted with the nature of the charge. She confessed she had taken the property, but had got drunk, and did not know what she had done with it. I told her I must search her, and so I did, as far as decency would permit. I got a woman to strip her, and search her; there were sixpence, and six-penny worth of halfpence on her. She said, she had some property in the house where she lodged; that was at Evans's, who gave me up some property which the prisoner confessed she had purchased.</p>

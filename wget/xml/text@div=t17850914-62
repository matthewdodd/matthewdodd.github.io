               <p>And Wallis came in after that, did he? - I really did not take notice, whether he was there before or after, I know they were all in company together.</p>

               <p>How long after you went in was it before you all joined company? - Directly almost.</p>
               <p>Who else was there in company with you? - Why, there were two more that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178509140092"></xptr> are not here; they attended yesterday but they could not attend to day, because they were at work.</p>
               <p>Who were they? - Black Joe was one.</p>
               <p>Who is he? - A black man.</p>

               <p>And who else? - Another man, I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner go away before supper? - Before supper, Sir, we did not eat any supper there, we had beer and gin, but no supper.</p>
               <p>Then you did not stay long I suppose? - Yes, I did stay till half past ten, and better.</p>
               <p>And had you no supper at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>What drink had you then? - Only we had beer and gin plenty.</p>
               <p>How much, recollect, I do not mean to confine you to two or three pots, but whereabouts? - I do not know how much we had indeed, I cannot remember when I am in liquor.</p>
               <p>How much had you to your own share? To my own share, upon my word I cannot say, Sir, I drank pretty hearty.</p>
               <p>Did the prisoner drink pretty hearty? - Yes, Sir, he was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Were you all sober when you went in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Had you five pots or ten? - Upon my word, Sir, I cannot remember when I am in liquor.</p>
               <p>Who paid the reckoning? - We paid it among us as it came in, I did not spend above four-pence halfpenny, I had no more.</p>
               <p>Some of them spent more than that, did they? - I do not know indeed.</p>
               <p>Had you any gin? - I believe so, yes, we had some gin.</p>
               <p>How often was gin called for? - That I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Four or five times? - Upon my word, Sir, I do not know how often, we had it too often I think.</p>
               <p>Which of you went away first? - Let me recollect; Wallis went away first, I think to the best of my memory.</p>
               <p>And which next, do you remember? - I and the prisoner went together across the way.</p>
               <p>Where did you part with Wallis? - At the corner of the alley that faces the Shovel.</p>
               <p>Then you went out together? - We went all out together, one after the other, when Wallis went away, we all come out together, it was a little better than half after ten.</p>
               <p>What went with the other two? - They staid in the house till the landlord turned them out.</p>
               <p>So you had no supper at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Nothing but drink? - No.</p>
               <p>But plenty of that? - We had our share.</p>
               <p>How much do you think your share was? - Upon my word, Sir, we were all in liquor mostly.</p>
               <p>Cannot you form some judgement? - I cannot remember when I am in liquor, indeed, we were none of us very sober.</p>
               <p>You was sober when you went in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How much may you drink before it got into your head? - A little thing gets into a person's head sometimes to what it does at others, we might have two or three pots besides gin.</p>
               <p>Would two or three pots make five of you drunk? - No, I do not imagine it would.</p>

On the 5th of December I lost my handkerchief; the handkerchief I know was safe in my pocket a quarter of an hour before I missed it. It was intimated to me by a lad standing by me that my handkerchief was taken away. I was waiting while the militia were going to chapel at Whitehall, that occasioned me to stop. I took hold of the prisoner; I charged him with stealing my handkerchief; he said he had a handkerchief; that he had picked it off the ground. He gave it me. This is the handkerchief. My handkerchief was a similar pattern to this. I cannot swear to it being my property.</p>

On the evening of the 27th of January, I received information from a boy, and went to the watch-house; I saw the two officers - as we returned the boy saw the prisoner and two other boys - he said those were the boys who took the shoes - I sent him back for the officer - and as soon as he was gone, they began to separate and run; I saw the prisoner had got something - I followed him pretty close - I took hold of him, and asked what he had got - he said, a pair of shoes which he was going to take home to his father - and while I was looking at them, he ran off - the two officers were coming along and stopped him; I missed this pair and three more; he had them tied up in this handkerchief.</p>

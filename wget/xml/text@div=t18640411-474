I am a baker, at No. 49, Regent-street, Lambeth—on 2d March the prisoner came to my shop—I served him with a penny loaf—he gave me a bad half-crown—I gave him a two-shilling piece and five penny pieces in change besides the loaf—directly he got outside the shop he went away very quickly—I tried the money and found it to be bad—I put it on one side—the next evening he came in about half an hour later and asked for half a quartern loaf—I asked which sort he would take—he said he did not care which, he was not particular—I put the loaf on the scale—he tendered me a bad half-crown—I went round the counter, shut the doór, and detained him, and gave him in charge of the constable with the half-crown—he said he had just taken the half-crown—he said he was not there the night before, that he was at the play—I am certain he is the man.</p>

He asked the way to Regent-street, Westminster. I told him. I placed the half-crown in my pocket, and did not take any more notice of it. I went to try and get a pair of boots. I could not I went to the baker's to buy a half-quartern loaf to take home to my mothers to tea. I did not know it was bad any more than the dirt under my feet.</p>

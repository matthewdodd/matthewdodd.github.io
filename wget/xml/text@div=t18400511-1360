                  </hi>. I am an ironmonger, carrying on business in Tottenham Court-road. The prisoner came into my service in March 1839—in September last he was paid by commission—he was to re<lb></lb>ceive a certain commission on the goods he sold for me—I have an order-book—I hare looked into it, with reference to some goods which be furnished to Mr. Creswell, a customer of ours, on the 9th of Sep<lb></lb>tember—it is in the prisoner's hand-writing—the goods were supplied—their amount was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not receive that 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the pri<lb></lb>soner—there is another entry on the 25th of September to John Wain<lb></lb>wright for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I did not receive that on the 1st of November—there is an order to Ashley for 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—he has not accounted to me for that—it was his duty to account to me every day, and in my absence, to Mrs. Davis—I dismissed him on the 23rd of November—I made no specific charge against him—he went over his accounts after that, on the 3rd of December—he would then have an opportunity of making up his accounts with me—he did not account to me for either of these sums.</p>

               <p>the reserves were to meet bad debts—if he introduced me to one of his old customers, and it turned out a bad debt, that would be deducted out of the commission to reimburse me for the money I had advanced—I bought all the stock he had—when we settled the commission, I allowed him for what had been bought—I was never in his debt for stock—he stated he had some little stock—I would not allow his doing business for me, and on his own account, but I had no objection to his bringing it—I paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at first in advance, and the difference was paid from his commission—I had parted with the whole of that stock when he was dis<lb></lb>charged, with the exception of a few gridirons—he did not supply any thing to my customers from his own resources but once—that was some, glue to Mr. Paul—MR. Paul came to my house, and asked for his account—I made it out as 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "I have had some glue, I owe you more"—the prisoner said, "It is all right"—I supposed it had not been put down—I added it to the bill, and received it, supposing it was my own—when he was gone, the prisoner said, "It war a little, glue I had in my own stock"—it was what is called Scotch glue—I do not keep Scotch glue—I handed the amount to the prisoner, and forbid any thing more of the kind'—here is the entry in my book—I usually made the entries in the book—the prisoner made some, and Mrs. Davis made some—I have never had a dispute with the prisoner about coming to a set<lb></lb>tlement—a policeman was called in one night after the settlement, as the pri<lb></lb>soner behaved himself in a very abrupt manner, because I wanted a copy of the commission account—I called in the policeman for my own protection—I had a scuffle about the book in which he had the account of the commission kept—after I had settled his account, and made it up in his book, and he had given me an I O U for the. balance he owed me, I wished to have a copy of that account—he kept it in a book of his own—I insisted upon having it, and I caught hold of it—he had the book after giving me a copy—some months after that we went to Islington together, and some words took place—we had no quarrel—we did not part friends on that occasion—I kept a horse and gig, but we went with the prisoner's pony, as I had lent my horse—I understood a friend had lent the prisoner the pony—part of my harness was on the pony, and the other part was the prisoner's—he said a friend had lent it him to go round to the customer—he had to go to Hammersmith,. Clapham, Hounslow, and carious places wherever, he chose, with the gig—when we got to Islington that night, the prisoner was in a hurry, and said he wanted to go somewhere—I wanted to leave the gig at my brother's, and he role the pony, and left my gig—I took away the harness and the bridle, as they belonged to me—we had no words about the accounts—I think the prisoner called twice at my house alter he quitted me, to settle accounts—I am certain he did not call four or five times—I never beard of his calling after the 3rd of December.</p>

Davis has not claimed it, nor has the prisoner yet, he shall have it when he claims it—MR. Davis has claimed what I owe him, and more, but he has not claimed for that parcel—I think the parcel contained one thousand tenpenny nails, a quarter of a thou<lb></lb>sand twentypenny, two thousand tacks, and some glue—I should think it was 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in amount—I did not bring the bill—I have not seen it this month or two—it is headed in the way Mr. Davis's bills are, only "Bought of Matthews," not Davis.</p>

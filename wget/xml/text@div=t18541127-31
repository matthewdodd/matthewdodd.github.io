                  </hi>. I am a commission salesman to Mr. Russell, a pawn-broker, at No. 10, High-street, Shoreditch. I have known the prisoner nearly eight years; he is a bird cage maker—I have had dealings with him on and off for the eight years that I have known him—I have frequently bought bird cages of him—on 17th Oct. he came to the front of our shop, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon—he asked me if they could oblige him with change for another 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I said, "I dare say they will; if you will step inside I will ask;" he went inside, and I followed him—I asked the managing man behind the counter if he, could spare cash for another 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note; this produced is it—he presented it—I can swear to it by my own writing—Young, the managing man, said, "Yes"—I handed my pen to the prisoner to sign his name; he signed, "John Crow," and I put the date underneath—I see his name and the date here—the foreman then brought ten sovereigns, took the note, and placed it in the till, and the prisoner left—on the previous day, 16th Oct., the prisoner came between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and asked me if they would oblige him with change of a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—I said, "I dare say they will, if you will step inside I will see"—he went inside, and I followed him, and asked the fore<lb></lb>man if he could spare the cash for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note; he looked and saw who it was that was with me, and he directly said, "Yes"—I handed the prisoner my pen to sign his name; he did so, and I signed the date underneath—I asked if he knew the party whose name was on the back—he said, "Oh,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270030"></xptr>
               <p>yes!" I have known him eighteen months, and have done business with him—I asked where he lived; he said that he kept a shop over in Lambeth<lb></lb>marsh—the ten sovereigns was then given him, and the note was taken away and placed in the till—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also asked him on the 17th, if he knew the person from whom he got that note—he said he had known him for about fifteen or sixteen months, that he had continually sold him goods, and he kept a shop in the New-cut—that was John Cross—on 18th Oct. my master, Mr. Russell, brought me both the notes, and in consequence of what he told me, I went to the prisoner's father's house in Booth-street, Spitalfields; from that I learned nearly where to find his residence, I went there; I did not find him at his house, but at a chandler's shop in the neighbourhood; he was drinking a glass of ginger-beer—I waited outside for him, and then said, "Well, John, about these notes I—he said, "What is the matter with them?"—I said, "I don't know; Mr. Russell has brought them to me this morning, and says he shall look to me for the money, they are no use to him, and we must have the money for them"—he again asked me if they were wrong, or if any<lb></lb>thing was wrong with them—I said, "I do not know; you had better come with me to Mr. Russell, down at the shop, he is waiting there;" with that he accompanied me to the shop, but Mr. Russell was gone—previous to arriving at the shop, I asked him what he had done with the money—he said that he had been in arrears, and he had paid his debts—after we got to the shop, he said that we had better go together down to his mother's—when we got there we arranged to meet in the afternoon to see the father, by the mother's wish; as we were going from the shop to his mother's, he frequently asked me if I thought the notes were bad; and once he said, "If they are, I shall be entirely ruined for life"—I left him at his mother's house; I got the assistance of a police sergeant, and accompanied him to the Bank of England, where we proved that the notes were forgeries—we then saw the prisoner's father at his situation, and we kept in company with him until about 5 o'clock, when we took the prisoner into custody at his own house, in New-street, Bethnal-green.</p>

SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> During the eight years you have known the prisoner, have you ever heard the slightest imputation upon him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It never came across me to hear of it; I cannot say that I ever did—it was between 11 and 12 o'clock in the morning of the 18th that I first went after the prisoner, in consequence of having discovered that the notes were forgeries—he was not given into custody till nearly 5 o'clock in the after<lb></lb>noon—it was not when I told him the notes were valueless, that he said cross had a shop in the New-cut; it was on the day that we changed the notes—this is not the first time that I have ever made that statement—I am sure it was when he brought the notes, that he told me the names of the persons from whom he got them; I might have asked him the same upon another occasion also, but on my oath, I asked him the names when he paid the notes to me—I cannot exactly say whether this is the first time I have stated so—he never told me that he did not know where they lived; he told the officer so; I heard him say so when he was taken into custody—he did not tell me that it was eighteen months since he had had any pre<lb></lb>vious transactions with them—he did not tell me that they were hawkers, and he did not know where they lived; but that when he last knew either of them, it was about eighteen months ago, and then one lived in the New-cut, and the other in Lambeth-marsh—he did not tell me before he was taken into custody that they were hawkers, and that he did not know where they lived—he told the constable so in my presence, when he was taken—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185411270031"></xptr>
               <p>he had made an appointment to go to Mr. Russell's at 3 o'clock that after<lb></lb>noon—I cannot say whether he kept that appointment, no one can prove it—I was not there to meet him—I did not hear from Young, or any one, that the prisoner had called there at 3 o'clock—when he was taken into custody he was at his own house; he was not then engaged at his work, cage making; he was quite clean, ready to start out as I knocked at the door—that was about 5 o'clock—he stated that he had received each note in the course of his business; he said that one man had bought cages of him to the amount of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he had given him the difference; and the other had bought goods from him, amounting to over 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had given him the change—when I went to his mother's in the afternoon, she told me that he had gone to keep the appointment with me at his master's, and that he was then at his own place waiting for me—I went there and found him—he lived about seven minutes' walk from my master's, and about the same distance from his mother's.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Russell I have known the prisoner for the last three months, only by sight—he had been several times to our shop before 16th Oct.—I remember his coming between 3 and 4 o'clock that afternoon—Bull came in with him, from outside—Bull asked me if I could get change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I said I could—the prisoner laid a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note on the counter—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I looked at the back of it, and saw the two names that are now upon it—that was after Bull had given the prisoner a pen, and he had written some<lb></lb>thing upon it—I then took the note to the till, and gave the prisoner ten sovereigns for it—I did not hear Bull ask him where he got the note—on the following day he came again, about the same time—Bull came in with him, and asked if I could oblige Crow with change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; I said, "Yes"—Bull told him to write his name on the back of the note, and gave him pen and ink for that purpose—he did so this is the note—I received it after he had written his name upon it—the name of John Cross was at the top, and John Crow underneath it—Bull wrote the date—I then gave the prisoner ten sovereigns, and put the note into the till—the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note that I had received the day before was also in the till—there was no other note there, nor any other in the house at that time—next day, the 18th, Bull came again into the shop with the prisoner—they were in conversation together; but I was busy at the counter, at the time, and did not attend to it—I did not then know that the notes were supposed to be forged—I had never changed notes for the prisoner before.</p>

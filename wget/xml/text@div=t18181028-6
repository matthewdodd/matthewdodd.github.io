On the 5th of October, the prisoner came to my shop with a man in a soldier's dress. They asked the price of some knives in the window? I said they were 1s. 9d. each. I went to the window, took them out, and showed them one with two blades. They said they only wanted one blade. I turned to look for one - They went out of the shop quickly, and said, they were sorry to trouble me-nobody else was in the shop. I missed a pocketbook that laid on the counter between us. I went out in pursuit, ran round several streets, and found them in Grafton-street, they began to walk-they had been running before. I lost sight of them again, and found them in St. James-street, crossing into Park-lane - I there secured the prisoner - he was with the other man. I asked him, if he had not got something that did not belong to him? I found a map of London in his pocket, which I know to be mine. I took him into Mr. Middleton's shop, and found the pocket-book and memorandum-book on him, which I knew to be mine-the pocket-book was manufactured by myself, and has my private mark; it cost me 10s. 6d., and the map 9s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I make any resistance - A. No.</p>
               <p>JOHN FEATHERTON. I am servant to Mr. Middleton, the prisoner was searched in our shop, and the things found in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met a young man in Oxford-street, we went to Bond-street - he wanted to buy a knife. I went into the shop with him. The prosecutor said he had none to suit us. In passing along the street, the man gave me the things to dispose of for him.</p>

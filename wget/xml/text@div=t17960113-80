               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. Sometimes the coffee is spilt about the floor? - A. The floor is full of coffee.</p>

I was; the prisoner was employed there, with one more; I was on the ground floor, where I could see who goes up and down stairs; the prisoner and his party came to me between two and three in the afternoon to be rubbed down, which is the custom of every one who leaves the warehouse; not taking his hat off, which is customary, I gave his hat a tap, and it did not found hollow, as hats generally do; I said, what in the name of God have you got here; he said, nothing; I bid him lean his head down, and I took off his hat and found three pounds of coffee loose in it; I said, do you see that, he said, yes; I said, how could you do this, he cried, and begged I would forgive him; I told him I could not, it was as much as my life was worth; he then jumped out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179601130126"></xptr>of the loop-hole of the warehouse window, about four or five foot from the ground, I went down the steps, and we soon took him again.</p>

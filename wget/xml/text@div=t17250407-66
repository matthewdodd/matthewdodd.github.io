             depos'd to this Effect: On the 25th of February last, about 11 at Night, O' my Shoul, I wash got pretty drunk, and wash going very shoberly along the Old-Baily, and there I met the Preeshoner upon the Bar, as she wash going before me. I wash after asking her which Way she wash walking: And she made a Laugh upon my Faush, and told me to Newtoner's-Lane. Arrah Joy, (shaid I) you should always have Somebody with you, when you go sho far alone. She told me she would be after taking me with her, if I would give her any Thing. Arrah, my dear Shoul, (said I) you shall never fear but I will give you shome thing, if I have got nothing myself. Sho we went together; but not having any Deshign to be consherned with her, I paid her Landlady a Shilling for a Bed. For it ish my Way to make Love upon a Woman in the Street, and go home with her, whenshoever I intend to lie alone. But ash to the Preceshoner, she wash after making me shit upon the Bed with her, and sho tumble together; but I wash after shitting in the Chair, and then she was coming to shit in my Lap; but I would not let her, and sho she shit beside me; and then I wash hoping that she would be eashy; but for all that she would not let me shit at quiet, for she wash after being concerned with my Breeches, and got away my Watch whether I would or no; and I pulled, and she pulled; and sho for fear she should get it from me, I let go my Hold, and went for a Constable, and he carried her to the Watch House, where he took the Watch upon her. He found it in a Plaushe that my Modesty won't suffer me to name; for ash I am a living Chreestian, she had put into her ***.</p>
               <p>The Constable depos'd, that he took the Watch from the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner thus made her Defence: I met the Prosecutor under Newgate; he took hold of me, and asked where I was going? I told him to my Lodging in <placeName id="t17250407-66-crimeloc353">Charles-Street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17250407-66-crimeloc353" type="placeName" value="Charles-Street"></interp>

My Landlady opened the Door, and then I desired him to leave me; but he catch'd hold of her Hand, and said he would come in and drink, for he was as well acquainted there as I was So he called for two or three Quatterns of Brandy, and having no Money to pay for it, he pawn'd his Watch to her for 5 s. He was so impudent, that we were both found to fall upon cut Knees to keep his Hands from<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172504070008"></xptr> under our Petticoats. Then he would have gone up to Bed with me; which I refusing, he threatned to swear my Life away; for he said he was an Irishman, and could swear farther than ten Englishmen. Whereupon I call'd in a Watchman, and so we were both taken into Custody. It appearing upon the Prosecutor's Oath, that she took the Watch from him violently, and with his Knowledge; and she being indicted for stealing it privately, and without his Knowledge, the Jury <rs id="t17250407-66-verdict354" type="verdictDescription">

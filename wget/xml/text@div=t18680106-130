                  </hi>. I live at 11, Morton Place, Pimlico, and am a joiner by trade—about ten o'clock at night on 31st September last I was in my back kitchen—my attention was attracted by a faint <hi rend="italic">click</hi> at the latch of the street door—I ran up stairs, making no noise, as I had light shoes on, and I saw the street door open wide to the wall, and the prisoner standing apparently leaning on the rail with his elbow—I can't say whether I was seen or heard, but the prisoner gave an alarm or signal—I am not exactly positive to the word—I believe it was "Hallo" or "Below," and some one</p>

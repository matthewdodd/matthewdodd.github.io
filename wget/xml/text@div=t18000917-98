             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am a cabinet-maker, I work with Mr. Platt, No. 29, Greenhill's-rents, I have worked for him five years.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you are acquainted with the prisoner at the bar? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to appear as a witness for him? - A. I saw an advertisement in the paper, on Saturday the 13th. (Mr. Knowlys produced the Morning Herald of that day, the witness read the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of that advertisement, attend on Monday, at Bow-street? - A. I did; I was passing by this gateway on the Thursday afternoon, to the best of my recollection, it was about five o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another man.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner was one of the persons? - A. To the best of my recollection he is the man; I heard the man say a guinea and a half; the prisoner shook his head, and said, it was too much; and that was all I saw or heard of it; I attended at Bow-street, and the Magistrate said it was of no use to give that evidence there, whatever it might do here.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever been in the habits of intimacy with the prisoner? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the Court. Q.Where had you been that day? - A.To Piccadilly, upon business for my master, I was going home to the shop in Greenhill's-rents.</p>
               <p>Q.You were walking out upon your business? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw the prisoner before? - A.Never.</p>
               <p>Q.What gateway was this? - A. It was the right-hand side coming up from Piccadilly.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take notice of him? - A. His dress was remarkable, he had a black waistcoat, and breeches, and stockings, and a light coloured coat, with a velvet collar.</p>
               <p>Q. What was there extraordinary in that? - A. His face was remarkable too.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not stop at all? - A. I did not stop above half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you stop at all for? - A.Seeing two men with a trunk, excited my curiosity.</p>
               <p>Q. What excited your curiosity? - A. The two men with a trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Does your master take in this paper? - A. No; I saw the paper at the Castle, in Greenhill's-rents.</p>
               <p>Q. Not knowing this man before, and having nothing to excite your attention, you just stopped long enough to hear one may say a guinea and a half, and the other, that it was too much? - A. That was all.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the other man dress? - A. In a dark-coloured coat.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was it from the trunk-maker's? - A. I do not know the trunk-maker's.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that that is the same man? - A. To the best of my recollection he is the same man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Joseph Wilson, who keeps the Anchor beer-house, Crisp-street, Poplar—on Friday night, 18th November, the prisoner came and gave me a bad sixpence—I told him it was bad, gave it to my husband, and saw him give it to the constable—my husband asked him where he got it—he said that he did not know—I had served him with half a pint of beer on the Tuesday before, and he gave me a bad sixpence—I found it was bad directly he had gone, and put it in a work-box by itself—I afterwards gave it to Cliffe, the constable.</p>

On 18th November, I came out of my parlour, and saw the prisoner and my wife looking at a sixpence—she gave it to me, and asked me whether it was good, and said, in the prisoner's hearing, "This is the young man that passed one last Tuesday"—he said nothing—I asked him where he got the sixpence—he said that he did not know—I asked</p>

These are two medals filed down on the reverse side, and silvered over so as to represent sixpences—they are just the size of a sixpence, and have a knerled edge—the colour would be the same, but the silver is worn off—they have the Queen's head upon them, but not the legend.</p>

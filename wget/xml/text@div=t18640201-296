On the night of 25th January, I was in the Camberwell-road, about half-past 12, and saw the prisoners there carrying a clothes-basket, and a bundle—I asked them where they were going—Brooks stated that he was going to take them to his mother in Brandon-street—I asked him where he got them from—he said he had been to get them from Prince's-street, Albany-road—knowing there was not such a street in the neighbourhood, I told him I should wish him to go back to Prince's-street—another constable came up, and we went 400 or 500 yards down the Albany-road, when Brooks dropped the basket and said, "We won't trouble you any further, it is all wrong; you have got us to rights"—we then took them to the station—Grant did not say anything—I showed the property to Mrs. Ridgway—I went back with another constable and examined Albany-road till I came to 350—I there found a side-gate leading to the rear, open—I made a further examination, and found the laundry window and door open—I aroused the inmates and Mr. Ridgway came down with his brother Mr. Little—the other constable saw some marks on the window.</p>

            . I am steward and butler to Lord Belfast. On the 21st of December his lordship inquired for his desk - I could not find it; I got an officer, and about nine o'clock that night the door bell rang; I went to the door, and found the desk on the step of the door. I saw a man go by - in consequence of what passed between me and the man I followed the prisoner; when I first saw her she was walking quietly on the opposite side of the way - the man whom I had spoken to went away without accompanying me; I had never seen the prisoner before; I said I thought she was the person who left the desk at the door - she said she knew nothing of it, and told me to let her go; I asked who she was - she said her husband was a servant out of a situation, and he had lived at Lord Belfast's; I did not ask her name, but took her back to the house - she was not out of my presence till she was taken up to Lady Belfast; Avis, the officer, whom I had fetched, told her he could make her no promise, nor did I promise or threaten her; the officer and I wished her to see Lady Belfast - I took her up to her ladyship, and she stated to her that she got in at the area steps, with a view to borrow some money of the housekeeper, but not seeing her she went up the back stairs, and meeting nobody she went into his lordship's library, and took this desk - that she came down the front stairs, and one of the footmen let her out at the hall-door - she acknowledged that she took it to the house of Lilly, got it opened there, and took the watch out, which she pawned in Tottenham-court-road, for 35.; she produced 30s. of the money, and said she had given a girl, who went to the pawnbroker's with her, the other 5s., for her trouble, and had destroyed the duplicate; she seemed extremely sorry for it, and begged for mercy, saying the devil had tempted her.</p>

I saw the watch in her hand; I kept my seat, and did not get up to look in the desk; she asked Owen to accompany her to raise something on the watch - they went out, returned, and told me what they had got for it- I began to think things were not right, and begged her to take the desk home again from where she got it, and as I persuaded her, she packed it up in brown paper, and asked Owen to accompany her; the prisoner took it out under her cloak, as she had brought it in.</p>

The area-door had been left unlocked longer than usual, but there are two doors before that in the passage - I cannot say whether they were fastened - they might be ajar; if so she could get to the library without opening any door, but there is a door on the top of the stairs, which has a spring-lock - it is possible that might have been open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a ship-broker, and live in George-yard, Lom<lb></lb>bard-street. A vessel called the <hi rend="italic">Rose</hi> was under my care for sale—I believe she belonged to a company called the Newcastle Company—Henry Mitchell is one of the owners, and I know there are others, but I do not know them—they own the <hi rend="italic">Rose</hi>, and the articles in it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you swear Mitchell has more than one partner in the vessel? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The only answer I can give is by the correspondence—I have corre<lb></lb>sponded in the name of him and others—I simply directed to W. Mitchell, Esq., and received answers signed "H. Mitchell"—he did not sign for himself and colleagues, because he was managing man—he has told me he was a director—I cannot swear it—I believe it—I do not think it is an in<lb></lb>corporated company.</p>

                  </hi>. I am ship-keeper of the <hi rend="italic">Shell</hi> steam barge, in the West India Dock. I was sitting on the bulwark of the <hi rend="italic">Colchester</hi> steam-tug, in the South Dock, about eight o'clock in the evening of the 23rd of June, and saw the prisoner pass with a bag on the canal bank—the <hi rend="italic">Rote</hi> was about two hundred yards from me—in about twenty minutes I saw the prisoner come back again—as soon as he saw me, he dropped in to the bank of the timber-pond, with something in his band similar to this brass—he walked down along the water's edge, and was coming out at the cor<lb></lb>ner—he then had nothing in his hand—I told Shires to go and get the brass out—he went, and brought it from the pond where the prisoner had been—I went up, and gave the prisoner in charge at the gate—I am certain he is the man I saw with it in his hand.</p>

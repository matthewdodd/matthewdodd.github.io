I lost a shawl out of my box, between six and seven o'clock in the morning of the 6th of February; the prisoner lodged in the same apartment, and was to go away that morning: she slept in the same bed with me. My box was not locked; I am quite sure it was there - she had nothing in the room; she had slept there for a month - her mother lived in Middlesex-buildings. I got up about eight o'clock and went to my box to get some money; I had 10s. 7 1/2d. there; it was gone: the landlady, who slept in the same room, rose at five o'clock. I saw the shawl at the pawnbroker's on the Saturday evening following - I never had lent it to her; I only went there on the previous Saturday.</p>

            . I am an officer of High-street, Mary-le-bone. The prisoner came to the office to swear to the loss of a duplicate; Mary Varrell had told me of the loss of her shawl - the prisoner was not sworn, but I took her into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I took the shawl on the Wednesday morning, when I left - I took it to buy a pair of shoes to go to my uncle's; and if I had got the shoes, and gone there, I should have had money, and returned it that very evening.</p>

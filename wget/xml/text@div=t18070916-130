            . I am a dealer in Mahogany, Prince's-square, Ratcliff Highway; I was standing just before my gate, the prisoner had a watch in his hand playing with it; I asked him how he came by the watch, he said he was going to somebody in Ratcliff Highway with it, he did not know his name; he told me he lived at No. 42, Rosemary-lane, he was afraid of being beat by his master; I took the watch and gave him my card; I said, tell your master to come to me at eight o'clock; his father came to me, he said the boy had found the watch as he was flying a kite, he hoped I would let him have it, as it was not owned. I afterterwards was informed Mrs. Lawrence had lost a watch and five shillingsworth of halfpence.</p>

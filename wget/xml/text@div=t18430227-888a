                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Passenger, a china-dealer, and live in Friar-street, Black friars. Mr. Passenger had bought some houses in Tash-street, Gray's Inn-lane—the prisoner occupied one of them, No. 30—on Saturday, 11th of Feb., I went to that house with Rutter, who is in Passen<lb></lb>ger's employ, and Manning, a carpenter—I went up stairs with them, to three men who were in the house—I had some conversation with them, came down to the foot of the stairs, and asked which was the woman's door, meaning the prisoner's door, and what was her name—one of the parties on the stairs im<lb></lb>mediately replied, "Williams"—at the same time the door of the back room was opened by the prisoner, who said yes, her name was Williams, what busi<lb></lb>ness had I there, or what was it to me—I told her I had been sent by Mr. Passenger to remove the doors—she then commenced abusing me, called me a <hi rend="italic">snotty</hi> little whelp—she was very angry and violent indeed, and raised her hands to strike me, but I prevented her doing that, by striking her, and seizing her by the wrist—this was in the passage—she struggled to get at me—I held her a short time, then let her go—she went into the room—I followed her in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184302270104"></xptr>
               <p>—she again rushed at me, as I was standing between the door and the centre of the room—I succeeded in taking her by the hands, and turned round to see what the carpenter was doing—he was standing still—I said, "Make haste, let us have these doors off"—I then pushed her from me, and she appeared to go into a fit—she screamed, "Murder" very loudly several times—the things in the room were her own property, and there were two children in the room—there might be three—I then noticed her feeling in her dress—she then rushed at me, and made a blow at me again, which I parried off, by pushing her off—she rushed at me again, and I received a blow on my left check—the carpenter was at this time taking the door off—I was then about to strike her, when Rutter laid hold of my arms, and said, "Don't strike the woman"—she threw herself from me—I perceived, as she retired, she had something pointed in her right hand—I then found 1 was wounded just below my eye—the two wounds now on my eye are what I received—I immediately said, "I am stabbed"—the carpenter then asked me if he should continue his work—I told him to proceed, and I would get a policeman—she was then taken into custody—when I returned from having my wounds strapped up, I said I thought I had been stabbed with scissors—she said there were no scis<lb></lb>sors there, but it was with her finger nails—no scissors were found, that I am aware of—she made some remark, which was a threat, as I fancy, as the answer I made was I thought she had done enough already—she said she wished it had been into my lights—she was in a great passion—she said at the station that I had broken the window, and a piece of the glass cut me—I had not been near the window.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a traveller to Mr. Passenger, and live in George-street, Blackfriars-road. I accompanied Bourne to the house in Tash-street—when we knocked at the door, one of our party opened the door—we pro<lb></lb>ceeded up stairs to the top room, and found three men who had been there—we came down to the foot of the stairs—Bourne asked, "What is this woman's name?"—she immediately opened the door, and said what was it to him, and began abusing him, and struck at him with a push—he laid hold of her hands, to prevent her striking him—he held her hands two or three minutes, and by that time they had got into the back parlour, this having happened between the doors in the passage—when they got into the room, he let go of her hands, and told the carpenter to proceed to take the door off—he had told her before that he had come to take the door off—Bourne and I were in her room, and the carpenter at the door—the other three were either on the stairs or in the passage—she first made the attack on Bourne when he was in the passage—she did not bid him go out—she was determined he should not take the doors off, I suppose—she struck Bourne—he did not retreat to avoid</p>

               <p>her—he could have gone away—I saw her stab him—I thought it was with scissors—I saw an instrument in her hand—I saw the point—it was larger than a large knitting needle—I saw the wound on his face.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. On the 11th of Feb., about five o'clock, Bourne came to my surgery—his face was covered with blood—I found two wounds on the left cheek, the lower one immediately over the cheek-bone, from three-quarters to an inch long, nearly an inch deep, proceeding down to<lb></lb>wards the mouth—it was a clean cut wound—the other was immediately under the eye, about an inch from the other—the lower one soon got well—the upper one was contused and ragged, and evidently produced by a blunter in<lb></lb>strument than the other—it could not be from the finger-nails—there was no danger from either, but considerable inflammation round the eye.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surveyor, and live in Queen-street, Cheapside. I have been to the house the prisoner was in possession of, and endeavoured to get possession—I first went the day after we had paid for the houses, or the next day, and was much surprised to find her in the house, as I under<lb></lb>stood from the vendor that she had left, as the attorney gave me a new key to the house—I opened the door, and found her there—she said she could not get a place to go to, and begged I would allow her to stop a little longer—I said, under the circumstances, she having a family, she might stop a week, if she would promise to go out that day week—she said, "Certainly, I will"—at the end of the week I found her still there—she begged for another week, and at the end of that week she was still there—I said it was very wrong, I must really put her out into the street—she said I dare not do that, the house was hers yet as much as Mr. Passenger's, and she should not go out at all—I did not propose any terms for rent—on the 3rd of Feb. I went to take posses<lb></lb>sion—she had come to me a week or two before my calling on her, and said she should not go—I said if she did not I should certainly come and put her goods and family into the street, it was a great pity she had been so advised and did not go—I went on the 3rd of Feb.—she was not at home—I went in with two or three men, one man at first, and saw her eldest daughter—while there she came in, she went into a violent passion, and said what right had I there—I said I had come to put her out, and put her out I should—she said she would murder me, if she was hung for it—she took a knife out, and came towards me, but her daughter prevented her doing anything.</p>

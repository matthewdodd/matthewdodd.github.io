The Prosecutor's Servant deposed, that the Prisoner came to his Master's shop to bespeak two plates of Silver, and came at night to fetch them; that be afterwards missed the ingot. The Prosecutor depos'd that a Neighbour's Servant came to him and told him, he had been at a Pawnbroker, that the Pawnbro-ker's Son shewed him an Ingot of Silver, which he suppos'd to be his, bearing he had lost one; that claiming the Ingot, the Pawnbroker did not deny it, but gave it to him, promising that he would secure the Prisoner, which he afterwards did but let him go, having receiv'd the Money that was lent on the Ingot. The Prosecutor endeavoured to apprehend him, but could not find him, till it happen'd that the Prisoner having arrested a Man, one came to him and told him if he would get the person arrested, at liberty, he would give him an opportunity of apprehending the Prisoner, which he did, when the Prisoner was sent for to agree the matter with his Debtor. The Pawnbrnker's Son depos'd, that he lent the Mony, viz.48 s. on the Ingot, unknown to his Father, he not being at that time at home. The Prisoner in his Defence owned be pawned an Ingot to the said Broker's Son, but said It was an Ingot he had cast of the Filings and Parings of Plate and some Silver he had bought, he being by Trade an Ingraver and Snuff-box Maker. That the Prosecutor having apprehended him by the Stratagem before mentioned, he was obliged to take a Note for 6 l. of the Man he had arrested, Instead of 20 l. that was owing to him. He likewise produced an Evidence who depos'd, that he went to Mr. Lewis, the Prosecutor, to desire him to be favourable in the Prosecution, and that Lewis told him, he would favour him all he could if he would be an Evidence against the Broker, he being the Man he aimed at, and would spend 100 l. to plague him, because he was a Mughouse-man.

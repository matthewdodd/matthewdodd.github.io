                  </hi>. I am undertaker to St. Pancras workhouse—I have charge of the dead-house there. This is the cloth that I took off the baby that was brought in on the 16th of July.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to St. Pancras workhouse. I do not recollect the prisoner coming into the workhouse, but I remember her being there—I believe the first time I saw her was immediately after her confinement—I saw a child with her occasionally—I recollect the dead body of a child being brought to the workhouse—I examined it—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am a horse keeper—on 28th March, about 1 in the morning, I was in Cable Street—three men came across the road and collared me—two tried at my pocket and one at my parcel—I shook the two off and the one tore the, parcel and got a boot out—they then turned my pocket out and took the silver that was inside, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it might be more—I recognise Bond as one of the men—I saw the policeman catch him and bring him back with the boot in his hand—I went to the police-station and Selby was brought there—I could not recognise him, but I am quite clear about Bond—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the boots I had under my arm.</p>

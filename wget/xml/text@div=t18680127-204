                  </hi>. I live at 8, Lower Chester Street, East Green<lb></lb>which—on 14th October I resided at the house of Frances Reynolds, at No. 5, in the same street—the prisoner lodged in the same room with me—he slept in one bed and I in the other—about ten minutes to six that morning I got up and went to work, leaving him in bed—there was no other man in the room—I left a jacket, waistcoat, and trousers in a bag in the cupboard, and a watch—I was sent for a little after eight, and found the bag on the bed, and the watch and clothes gone—I gave notice of my loss to the police—I did not see the prisoner again till boxing-night, he was then at the station—he said he would make it up to me if I would not go against him, and offered me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. What do you mean by saying I offered you money? I can prove you to be a liar. Don't you live with the woman you call your land-lady as man and wife? <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>. No; she is a married woman—my wife left me through going with other men—when you left my place you had much more hair about your face than you have now—I do not owe you any spite—I did not want you to settle the case—your mother and sister wanted to give me money to make it up.</p>
               <p>Frances Reynolds. I keep the house, 5, Lower Chester Street—the prisoner lodged there in the same room with the prosecutor—I remember the prosecutor going out about six o'clock on the morning of the 14th October—the prisoner came down about ten minutes past six—he went out and washed himself, and went up stairs again, a thing he never did—I said. "How late you are!"—he said, "No; it is only ten minutes past six',—he went out muttering to himself—about half-past eight I went up to make the bed as usual, and found the bag out of the cupboard on the bed, empty—I sent for Jones, and he missed his things.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Don't you and Jones live together as man and wife? A. No, we do not, and you cannot prove it—my sister is married to Mr. Kirton—Jones does not keep me and my child—his clothes were not in my room, unless I took them there to take care of—on my oath he never slept with me—he has no spite towards you—I was never up with you till one o'clock in the morning that I know of—you were one of a party at the Standard one night, and my father was there—I did not ask you to take me to Westbourne Park to see the Foresters—you asked me all these things, but I did not consent to it—I did not like you—you owe me a week's rent—I don't keep fancy men, and fancy men don't keep me—a shoemaker lodged at the house one week; that was before you came—he lodged there twice—he was not able to pay his rent, and I told him I should not expect it.</p>

I know the prisoner—on the morn<lb></lb>ing of 14th October, at twenty-three minutes to seven, I saw him in Church Passage, Greenwich, carrying a bundle—I saw a part of some black cloth trousers hanging from it—at that time I had not received any notice of a loss—he was coming from the direction of East Green<lb></lb>wich—I am quite certain it was the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman P</hi> 173). On boxing-day I went to 19, Waterloo Street, Camberwell—from information, I took the prisoner into custody there—I told him I wanted him for a job down at Greenwich—he said, "Berry, it was not me done the job: I was implicated in the affair through drink "—I took him to the station, and from there to Green<lb></lb>wich—on the way to the police-court he said he was a much better man than me, and he should not go along with me—I said, "You will have to go any how"—he turned very violent, and tried to throw me down—in doing so we both fell, and I believe he had his shoulder-bone frac<lb></lb>tured in so doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you took me at my mother's house, and said it was for the Greenwich job, did not I say, "What Greenwich job?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—you did not say you were implicated in this affair because you were seen drinking with the man—the words you used were, "I am implicated in the affair through drink "—I did not ask you to pay for a cab—when I was taking you along the people said, "There goes a Fenian!"—I had you handcuffed before you were knocked down—you were very violent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I left the house to go to Camberwell to see if I could get money to pay my week's rent. I went to my mother's, and she gave me the privilege of stopping at her house to see if I could get work. I stopped with her a fortnight, but I went back to Greenwich the day after I had left to see if a job was going on. I fell in with the shoemaker. He wore a greasy coat, a stitched hat, and no beard; and I suspect him to be the man, because he was a lazy fellow, always at the public-houses.</p>

I am the prisoner's sister—I live with my mother—the prisoner was at my mother's house the latter end of last September—he was there a good while, on and off—he came first on a Sunday—I think it was the 29th September, because I had got off a bed of sickness, and I had just gone to work on the Monday, and he was there the day before—I know it was on 30th September that I went to work at Norwood—I used to go of a morning and come home of an evening—he used to come there and sleep sometimes, and sometimes not—I can't say exactly for how long, I dare say a fortnight or three weeks at a stretch—I expect after that he went to his lodging at Greenwich—I produce his likeness and his cap—he wore a full beard then—this is the cap he wore at the time—it is not a stitched cap—I always knew him to wear a full beard till a few days before Christmas, and then he shaved off the lower part.</p>

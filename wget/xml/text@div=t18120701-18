               <p>Q. Did you lose any articles from your shop - A. Yes; a great quantity. About the latter end of March, 1811, I lost them from my shop and warehouse, No. 3.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of

             - A. Yes; he was a servant in my employ. He left my service at the end of March, 1811. I discharged him, having strong reason to suspect him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what have you to state, in order to shew that he stole any of these articles - A. I missed, a few days before I turned him away, a variety of coats, waistcoats, and other things. About two months ago I received a letter from a person under confinement. I went to Hatton-garden. I got a search warrant against some of the pawnbrokers, where I found a great deal of property. I went to Mrs. Denham's house, 24, Jewin-street; I found no property there. The prisoner had lodged there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your property in the possession of the prisoner - A. I found a duplicate of a pellisse, which property I had got out, previous to my taking the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prisoner - A. At the Bell and three Mackerel, Mile-end Road, where she was in service. One of the officers charged her with it. She denied knowing any thing of it or the parties, in my presence. She stated, that she knew no such person as Molloy. She wished very much to get out of the room, but the officers would not submit to her going. One of the officers brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181207010034"></xptr> down a box, with the duplicates, into the room where I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the officers that went with you - A. Cook and Matthews.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden office. On the 16th of April, the prosecutor came to the office for some search warrants, to search the different pawnbrokers for several articles. I and Matthews went with the prosecutor to the Bell and three Mackerel; we found the prisoner in service, at that public house. Matthews searched her in my presence. He found nothing that led to any part of the property about her. I left her in Matthew's care, and asked the landlord which apartment she lived in. The boy shewed me her apartment, and, under the head of the bed, in the same room, I found a little box, with a parcel of duplicates in it. I brought the box down, into the room where the prisoner was. I told her where I found it, and asked her, whether it was her box; she said, yes. The box was locked; I unlocked it. Matthews took the key from her person. When I opened the box, I found a great quantity of pawnbrokers tickets. We had the property prior to having the tickets. I said to Mr. Swift, here are the tickets of your property. Mr. Swift said, yes, I have no doubt of it. The prisoner said, the tickets were her own property. We got some more of the property from the duplicates.</p>

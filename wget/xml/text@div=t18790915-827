On 7th August I went with another I officer and Mr. Fisher with a search warrant to the prisoner's shop, 55, Hare Street, Bethnal Green—the name over the door was "Goodyear, I hosier and haberdasher"—I saw a female in the shop—Mr. Fisher I picked up this piece of feather trimming behind the counter—I went I upstairs, through a private passage, into the bedroom, and there found this I box of feather trimming (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I brought it down into the shop to Mr. Fisher, and he identified it—the prisoner's son was in bed—I inquired I for his father; he took me to the Hop Pole, in Whitechapel, where I saw the prisoner—I said "I am a police officer, I want to speak to you"—he came out and said "What is it all about?"—I said "I have a warrant to 1 search your premises, and have found a quantity of stolen goods there"—I I took him back and showed them to him—he said "Well, I suppose I have the invoice somewhere, let us have a look"—we looked, but failed to find one—he then said "My wife carries on the business, I suppose she know all about it"—I said "I believe you have carried on the business here for the last three months"—he said "That is so"—he said at the station "Everybody knows I could not be guilty of anything of this kind."</p>

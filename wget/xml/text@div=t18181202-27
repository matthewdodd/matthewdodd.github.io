On the 16th of November I met the prisoner in St. Paul's church-yard, with the articles stated in the indictment. He was wearing them. He had come from the Isle of France in our ship. I asked him how he came by them? He said he would tell me, but I must not think anything of it. I told him I should think of it. He took me to Kershaw's. He said he broke open my chest, and took them out. I afterwards went to the ship and missed these things and others. I gave him in charge.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner in charge. Rainer claimed the clothes, brooch, and rings he had on. He said if we went to his lodging, we should find the rest of the property. He took us to Kershaw's. Rainer claimed the chest. The prisoner said he gave the other things to Kershaw. She said she returned them to the chest.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was shipwrecked, and taken up by the ship. The prosecutor and I shared clothes and money with each other. I went ashore, leaving the chest safe; on Saturday I went on board and found it empty. I told the prosecutor what had happened; he said the ship was seized, and told me to get his things ashore. I broke it open to shew the officers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am married, but living apart from my husband at 8, Great College Street—on 4th April, I met the prisoner near Charing Cross—he said he would write me a letter—I received a letter next day—he came on the Thursday when I was moving from my last residence—my friend Emily Ashton was with me—he came with me to College Street—he said he was Lord Willoughby—he came and sat opposite me in the room, my friend being present, and said he wished to talk to me very seriously, he had a nice house at St. John's Wood, and I must give up my apartments and go there by 8.30 on the following Saturday, to meet him there to dinner—the address was Alpha Villa, Abbey Road—he said I was to have a carriage and pony and a nice little page and several servants, and whatever I did I was not to associate with the servants—he then asked what jewellery I had and said "I suppose it is all rubbish"—I said "Unfortunately it is" and showed him the rings on my finger—he asked for a plain ring which appeared to fit me the best, for a pattern, saying he would send me some better ones by a commissionaire from the Army and Navy Club, he belonged to that club, and if I wanted any more money I was to apply there for it—I said "You could take the size of the ring without taking the ring"—he said the had given a ring to another young lady and had lost it through not taking the size, and he took it—I also had some filagree earrings—he said He admired the patterns, but that they were rubbish, and if I would allow him to take them he would have them made in real gold—he shewed me a ring on his finger which had been left him through his ancestors 500 years before Christ—he put the earrings in his pocket—he then asked for pen, ink, and paper, and when it was brought he wrote on it and I was to give it to Messrs. Howell and James, as he wished me to have good clothing—he also enclosed a cheque in an envelope which he took from his pocket book—he said "Don't unseal it because they will think it is not from the Lord"—I was to take it to the London Bank, No. 12, Lombard Street—he looked at his watch now and then, and at last said "It is time you went to the bank otherwise you won't get this money"—after sitting a little while longer, my friend and I went out with him, and in' the street he said "Oh what a nuisance I have sent my brougham away, have you any loose change in your pocket?"—I said "Yes, I have 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—he said "Will you let me have it because you will have plenty when you get to the bank"—I said "You can lake 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. if you want it only for a cab"—I handed him my purse showing him the amount I had—he said "You may as well let me have it all because you will have more than enough when you get to the bank, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. will be</p>

I said,"You had better use better words and pay me for my coals;" for she owed me 8d. - she said, "I will have your life before I will pay you;" as I was sitting against the window they put some flour all over my clothes, and threw some in my eyes, then threw me backwards, throttled, and robbed me of a sovereign and a sixpence - the prisoner was kneeling on my breast, and was choking me; I felt her hand in my pocket - I could not call out, because she strangled me; there were a good many persons there in the same line - she keeps a bad house; there were two or three men there - they went and told my wife, who came, caught hold of her, and broke her hold: I did not go to tell any officer - next morning my eyes were so bad that I could not get up; before I got better she went and got a warrant for me, and when I told my tale they committed her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many people were in the room when she choked and robbed you? A. Five, six or seven - there was not a single man besides myself; two men went and told my wife, but they did not see any part of the row - after they went out of the house I did not knock the prisoner down, I am sure; I could not go that night to an officer or a Magistrate - I could not see out of my eyes; I did keep a house, but I had left it that day - I have had two lodgers, but I never took in lodgers by the hour, nor by the day; I have by the week, never by the night - I have been six or seven months in the potatoe business; I cannot tell whether I called for a glass of gin in the house - I never drank one; if I had asked for ten glasses of gin I could have had them - I have understood the prisoner's husband has died since this happened.</p>

            . I went to the house, saw the prosecutor on the floor, and the prisoner on his breast - she had her right hand in his right-hand waistcoat pocket, and said"You old b-r, before I have done, I will have your life;" I came out directly - I saw there was white-wash or colour on his back, and all about him; I afterwards saw his wife take him home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not the prosecutor your father? A. Yes; the report was given by the fiddler and plasterer- I ran over; I did not notice my father's eyes - I did not see him for two or three days afterwards.</p>

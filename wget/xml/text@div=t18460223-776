                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in John-street, Woolwich. The prisoner is my nephew, and lived with me—he has been out of employ—on the night of the 22nd of Feb. I went to church, leaving him at home—on the Monday I went to my drawer, and missed a purse, a sovereign, two half-sovereigns, and some silver—the prisoner was out—I found he was in the barrack-room—I missed some handkerchiefs from a box in my house, and they were found in the prisoner's pocket, in my presence—he had not made away with any of them—he had only spent a few shillings of the money, the rest was in his purse—he gave it up to the policeman, and said he was very sorry, but he meant to pay me again—he had behaved very well up to this time—there never was a flaw in his character—I think he wanted to go home to his friends, and it was not with a design to rob me, but to send it back.</p>

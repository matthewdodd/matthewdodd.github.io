                  </hi>. I am shopman to a pawnbroker, who lives in Maryle<lb></lb>bone. These boots were pawned by the prisoner on the 19th of December.</p>

I was never in his shop in my life. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There is a boy that comes that is shorter than him, but I believe he is his brother—I asked who the boots belonged to, he said, him<lb></lb>self—the prisoner is the person who pawned them—I asked if they were his own property, he said, "Yes"—he said he lodged at No. 16, Nightin<lb></lb>gale-street, which is where he was found and taken.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> When I got home, my brother told me there had been a policeman after me, and he did not know but he could put a crown in my way; he came and knocked at the door, and I answered him, and then he said I must go with him to the pawnbroker's—and as soon as they opened the door, they said, "That is him"—how can the pawnbroker tell it was me, when there are many go into his shop?</p>

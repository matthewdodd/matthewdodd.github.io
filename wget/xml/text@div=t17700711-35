            . Conoway and Richardson were concerned with me in the murder of Mr. Venables; we bought a pair of pistols in the Back Lane, near the turnpike.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with the prisoners?</p>
               <p>Jackson. About three months: we bought two pistols at a shop where they sell pistols and cutlery ware; we gave either seven or eight shillings, I can't tell which, for them.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of pistols were they?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Horse pistols.</p>
               <p>Q. New or second hand?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Second hand; they were brass-mounted.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the man you bought them of, if you was to see him?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Yes; we bought them of the man in the shop, not the master.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry them to?</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go there?</p>
               <p>Jackson. In the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from where you bought the pistols?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Only across the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No, only his wife; only I went in, the rest staid at the door. I put them behind a picture that hung behind the door; that was on Saturday night: Conoway stood at the door; he was not acquainted with Mrs. Thomas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she see him?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go from thence?</p>
               <p>Jackson. To where Conoway lived; we staid there till Sunday morning. We went over about nine in the morning to Spital-fields, to one Homelet's, a green-shop, where we met with Fox and Richardson: Fox lodged there. We went down Whitechapel road, and took coach to the Borough, and from there to Peckham: we came back to the Borough and discharged the coach; we went only for pleasure; we went to an alehouse opposite St. George's church in the Borough; we staid there till about four or five in the afternoon, then we went over London bridge to Ratcliffe highway. We parted with Homelet in Well-close square about half an hour after five o'clock. We left them, and then went about dusk over to

            's. I got the pistols; we all four went to Thomas's. Conoway, Richardson, and Fox, staid at the Children-in-the-wood, whilst I went in for the pistols: I saw his wife and brother in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the pistols?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I took them out myself, they saw me; Richardson and Conoway took them of me. They went towards the Ducking-pond, I went into Thomas's; when I came back they were loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lodge at Thomas's?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No; but he used to buy the goods of us. I went in to put a surtout coat on, and Fox went in to put a sailor's jacket on: they were putting the pistols under their coats as we came up, each had one. We all four went towards Stepney. We met with a footman; we thought he had no money, so we let him pass; this was in the front of the houses by the ditch side, it was below the Crown; we all looked at him as he went by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you speak to him?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No; this was about twenty yards before we met the two men; we met them by a row of houses by the cross post to prevent cattle going through.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of men were they?</p>
               <p>Jackson. They were both lusty men.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Jackson. The watchman cried ten three or four minutes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a night was it?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Not very dark.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the two men dressed?</p>
               <p>Jackson. They had light coloured clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell what passed.</p>
               <p>Jackson. Conoway said, I'll stop these men, and pulled out a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he speak to?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He spoke to us all: I said, I would have no hand in it if they did stop them, and I walked off.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say so?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I thought them too strong for us. Then Richardson pulled out his pistol: Conoway stopt one, and

               <p>Q. How far was you from them at that time?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Not above twelve yards.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110044"></xptr>Q. What was the consequence of that firing?</p>
               <p>Jackson. The man dropt; that was the man that struck at Richardson. Conoway fired directly after Richardson, and shot the other; he fell close against the wall that is before the houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the other man fall?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He fell nearer the highway.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any difference in their bulk?</p>
               <p>Jackson. The man that Richardson fired at was rather the stoutest. They came up to me; Fox had a hat in his hand; they bid me run. for, they said they believed they had killed the two men. Fox threw the hat away near Stepney church, by the sign of the Dolphin.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this from Stepney church?</p>
               <p>Jackson. About a quarter of a mile. We went to an alehouse below Cock Hill, at Stone Stairs, where we had a glass of gin apiece at the bar: we went away directly; we went to Wapping, and there robbed a man of his watch and eighteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in Wapping?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Below Execution Dock.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from where you had the gin?</p>
               <p>Jackson. That was in Shadwell; this was in Wapping. After we had robbed this man, we went to the lowermost public house in Darkhouse-lane, Billingsgate, on the left hand, there we lay till eight o'clock in the morning; we lay two in each bed, up three pair of stairs. The next morning we all went into the Borough, by St. George's church: we went to a public house just turning round the corner of the church as you go to Deptford, I don't know the sign; we had some veal cutlets for breakfast, and Richardson went out and pawned the watch for 30 s. He brought the money to us; he said he pawned it at the pawnbroker's over the way. I told this to Sir

               <p>Q. When was you taken up?</p>
               <p>Jackson. The Wednesday after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you go to the pawnbroker's for the watch?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I believe the Saturday following; but I can't be certain.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they say to the men?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Conoway went up and bid the man stop, and demanded his money; Richardson went up to the other man, and he began knocking him about with his cane.</p>
               <p>Q. from Richardson. Whether I shot him?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you did not say that you could not be an evidence, because you shot the man yourself?</p>
               <p>Jackson. Richardson fired; I did not.</p>

               <p>Dunn. Yes, guns and cutlasses, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. There was no remarkable difference between these pistols, was there?</p>
               <p>Dunn. No; only one about an inch longer than the other.</p>

               <p>Dunn. Horse pistols.</p>

             the other: I was looking over the window; they talked of buying a cutlass, but Conoway said, What signifies buying a cutlass? we shall not, perhaps, get our money for it on board of ship. They gave half a guinea, and he gave them half a crown change out of it. I know them very well; I have seen them together before, when they have been in trouble.</p>

               <p>Dunn. Jackson came in first, and asked if I had any second hand pistols. Conoway had only a shilling and some halfpence; so Jackson took out half a guinea, and paid for them.</p>
               <p>Q. from Conoway. Did not Jackson ask me to lend him a shilling?</p>
               <p>Dunn. No; I heard no such thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose use were they bought for?</p>
               <p>Jackson. All of our use.</p>
               <p>Q. Who paid for the pistols?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In what money did you pay for them?</p>
               <p>Jackson. I think it was a quarter of a guinea, and some silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether you had any change or not?</p>

He said, he supposed he should; but he should not so much mind dying, if Jackson was to die along with him; for, said he, he was one that committed murder as well as myself.

The night the murder was committed, exactly as the clock struck ten, my wife and I went up for a pot of beer; I live about one hundred and twenty yards from the place; we were talking at the door, and we heard two pistols go off almost together. I stood at the door some time, and I saw three men run by; they ran towards Stepney.</p>

            . I am the undertaker. I was sent for to get shells for Mr. Venables and Mr. Rogers; they were in the watch-house; they had their clothes on; one might put a child's fist in the wound in Mr. Venables' neck; Mr. Rogers had a wound in his head; I saw them on Monday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear to be shot?</p>
               <p>Pyle. Most undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177007110047"></xptr>Mr. Callop. I am a surgeon. I saw the bodies of Mr. Venables and Mr. Rogers before the coroner's inquest; Mr. Venables had a very large wound on the right side of his neck; the consequence of the wound must be immediate death.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a shot wound?</p>
               <p>Callop. Yes; the smell of the powder was upon the wound, and the place was black with the powder at the time. I saw at the same time the body of Mr. Rogers; he was shot on the forehead, on the left side of the head; the ball immediately entered his brain, and must be instant death.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you extract any ball?</p>
               <p>Callop. No; I did not attempt it.</p>

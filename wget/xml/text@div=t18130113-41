I saw the prisoners very active in rifling gentlemen's pockets. They were standing at the pastry-cook's shop where the large cake was. I saw Brett put his hand into a gentleman's pocket; the gentleman turned round, and the prisoners run off into Cornhill. I followed them. They stopped at Mr. Bish's shop, in Cornhill, a short time. They turned round, and saw that I was watching them. They went from that shop to Mr. Angel's, the pastry-cook, at the top of <placeName id="t18130113-41-crimeloc230">Cornhill</placeName>

The gentleman found that he had lost his handkerchief. The two prisoner saw that the gentleman noticed it. They both ran off. I pursued them into Bishopsgate-street. I laid hold of Brett. Green ran from me. I called out, stop thief. I searched Brett; I found a handkerchief on him. Green was stopped by a witness in court, and was searched by him. I only found one handkerchief on Brett. Though they were young, it was with difficulty we secured them. There was a gang of thieves got round us, and wanted to rescue them from us.</p>

            . I am a city constable. I was passing by Cornhill in Bishopsgate-street; I heard the cry of, stop thief. The prisoner, Green, ran; I stopped him. I searched Green, and on him I found four handkerchiefs. The silk handkerchief was in his bosom; the other three are cotton; they were in his hat. The silk one is marked G. M. No. 3. One of the cotton ones is marked G. A. No. 1. The other two are without marks. These are the handkerchiefs.</p>

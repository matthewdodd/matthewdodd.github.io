                  </hi>. I live at No. 10, Francis-street. On the night of 10th Oct., I was in the neighbourhood of Soho-square; the prisoner Wal<lb></lb>ton accosted me by St. Martin's-lane, and accompanied me to Soho-square—I had been a stranger, and absent from the country many years, and I asked</p>

               <p>her to lead me out of the square, to show me the shortest way into Oxford-street—I gave her no encouragement, but she kept by my side—she led me down Greek-street, and a man crossed over, and whispered something to her—Welch is the man; and then he said something to me, which I did not understand—I told Walton I did not want to go with her, and proceeded onwards; and almost immediately afterwards Welch jumped on my back, and tried to strangle me—I threw myself down, and tried to grapple with him—he knelt on me till Walton escaped, and then released me, and went after her—as soon as I recovered myself I missed my watch, and pursued them till I came in contact with a plain clothes policeman, who said that my watch was all safe, and the prisoners in custody—I was as capable of going borne as 1 am now—I had been dining with my friends—I was able to walk steadily home.</p>

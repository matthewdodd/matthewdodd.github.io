                  </hi>. My husband keeps a tobacconist's shop, at Hoxton Old Town—on 26th June last, the prisoner came into the shop and asked for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco, which was three farthings—I served her, and she gave me sixpence in payment—I put it in the till—there was no other sixpence there—I gave her change, and she left the shop—directly</p>

               <p>after she left I looked at the sixpence, found it was a bad one, and put it by—I was in the shop the next night when the prisoner came in—she asked for a quarter of an ounce of tobacco—my daughter Amelia served her, and I saw her put down a sixpence—my daughter gave it to me, and I saw it was bad—I knew the prisoner again, and told her it was a bad one, and I thought I must give her in custody, as she gave me one before on the last evening—the prisoner then left the shop and ran very fast away—my nephew followed her, and she was brought back by a policeman—I gave the two sixpences to him.</p>

I stopped the prisoner in Old-street-road, on the night in question—I saw a boy named George Fox pursuing her—I took her to the shop of Mr. Antill, and there received two sixpences, which I produce—Mr. Antill accused her of being there the previous night, and passing a bad sixpence—a good sixpence was found upon her—she told me she lived at No. 12, Old Montague-street, Spitalfields—I went there, and the house was empty; shut up.</p>

               <p>What are you? - I live in the Strand.</p>
               <p>Who with there? - With a lighter-man and waterman, with Mr. Mills, he is foreman to the Phoenix fire-office: I know the prosecutor, I was going to live with him in the country; before I was bound apprentice, I used to go to the prosecutor's every market morning; I was his boy at that time; I did not see the prisoner pay for the plumbs, I saw her take one half sieve of plumbs, and put it under her cloak; I did not see her take away any more; she gave them to a woman to take away, and desired her to carry them home; she did that in the open market.</p>

               <p>When was that? - I cannot tell you justly the day.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - I cannot.</p>

               <p>Did not you go to dinner there; he is one of the bail? - She wanted to make it up.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you offer to give money if the woman would make it up with you? - No.</p>
               <p>I have here three witnesses to prove it, if you dare to give that answer: did not you say that you did not mind giving a triffle to make it up? - I never offered any money at all to make it up; for I always said, I could afford to spend one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>I know you said you could spend one hundred pounds; did not you say last Saturday, at Tanner's, that you did not mind giving a triffle to make it up? - No, no such thing.</p>

               <p>You never said, I am sorry for what I have done, and if I have taken a false oath, God forgive me? - Lord have mercy! I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Did you say this, that the woman must not expect to make two great a property of you; but, that such a matter as four guineas you would give? - No, I never said so, they asked me to give four guineas.</p>
               <p>What business had you at Tanner's house? - He was one of the bail for this woman; she asked me to go in there.</p>
               <p>What conversation had you at Tanner's? - About the woman; whether I would make it up or no; I said, we cannot make it up now.</p>
               <p>You said that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>But if I could, I would give something to make it up? - No, by the living God.</p>

               <p>Do you know Mr. Aldus in the market? - No.</p>
               <p>Have not you applied to a woman that you knew very well by the name of Aldus, to ask her to get the prosecutor to make this up with you? - I never asked any body, I will be clear upon my own conscience; they came and talked to me about, this, that and the other, but I never desired any body to make it up; I could not make it up without money; they are a parcel of scoundrels; they all hang together.</p>

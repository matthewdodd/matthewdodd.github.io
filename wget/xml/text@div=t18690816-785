                  </hi>. I live at 11, Silver Street, Rotherhithe—I had a famished room in the prisoner's house, in Queen Street, Rotherhithe—on Monday afternoon, 26th July, a lodger went away, and we had two or three words about it—my husband knew nothing about the lodger going away, and I said so, and Honor a put up her fist to my nose and swore what she would do—I gave her a <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> back, and pushed her hand away—she struck me with a lump of glass which stood on the table for an ornament, and Jeremiah got an adze and cut me with it on my shoulder, and made it bleed very sorely—I became insensible—my husband came in, and I was taken to Guy's Hospital—I had to go there three days a week—I had to go there still last week, and this was three weeks ago.</p>

I am a surgeon, of Union Road, Rotherhithe—on 26th July, the prosecutrix was brought to my door in a cart, almost insensible, and bleeding profusely about the body and head—I found some wounds behind the ear, one on her forehead, one on her shoulder, and the skin of her nose was cut right across—the one on her shoulder was un-questionably' an incised wound—considerable violence was used.</p>

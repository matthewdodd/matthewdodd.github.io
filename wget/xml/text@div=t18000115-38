               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, the crime with which I am charged, I am intirely innocent of; I am consident my word, as a prisoner, will avail but little; but, my Lord, it was regularly signed by the parties who had a right to sign it, and made over to me, and therefore I conceived myself justifiable in converting it to my own use; knowing the sufferings of those, who do commit such crimes, would have deterred me; but these men knew, that if I had not made the property good, it would not have been made good, and they have applied to the Bank to make it good; they have done it, and my life is in danger; I hope, gentlemen, you will take my case into your consideration; and when you have so done, if you are of opinion that I am guilty, I shall contrive to meet my fate with as much resignation as my situation will allow.</p>

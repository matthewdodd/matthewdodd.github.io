            : on Tuesday evening the 28th of November, about a quarter before five I was in the shop, and looking through the window I saw two lads lurking about, and I suspected them? I went to the door and desired them both to go about their business, at that time I did not know the window was broke; they both went away; about a quarter of an hour after, I went to put up the shop shutters, and I missed some things out of the window off the shelves; I missed three gold shirt buckles, a gold locket set with garnets, a pair of silver stock clasps, and a stone shirt buckle set in silver; I had put up the end shutter, and on finding the window broke and the things gone, I went in pursuit of the two lads; returning home I met the prisoner at the bar, just at the corner of Hog-lane, I knew him to be one of the boys that were at the window; I brought him into the shop and sent for a constable, I had him searched, and part of the property was found in his breeches pocket; the gold locket, and the stone shirt buckle; he said he bought them of a boy in Soho-square, and gave him three-pence for them; the constable has the property that was found upon him.</p>

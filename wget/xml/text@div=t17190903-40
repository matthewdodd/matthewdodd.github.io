Sterry pleaded, that he hearing Dewer cry out, went up to her Assistance, and called several Persons by whose Evidence it appeared that the Prosecutor had forc'd the Prisoner to go along with him, promising him he should want for nothing; and that the Prosecutor formerly belong'd to the same Company in which the Prisoner was now a soldier, and behav'd himself very well; but that the Prosecutor was a very trouble-some ill Man.

                  </hi>. On 28th April, about 3.30 a.m., I was in Star Road, Fulham—I heard a noise at the church as if of the breaking of glass—I ran up as near as I could without being seen—I heard the noise again, and saw a dark object moving at the church window—I saw it go away towards a fence—I went there and came up to the prisoner, who was behind the fence—I said "Halloa! I have you"—he said "Stop till I have done up my trowsers"—I said "Is there anybody with you?"—he said "So help me God there is not"—at the place where he was stooping I found this communion cloth, three stoles, and two hoods—I asked him which way he got in—he said "Find out"—I took him to the station, returned with Sergeant Brooker, and found the church window smashed, 2 ft 8 in. high, and the glass driven inside, and there was room for a man to get in.</p>

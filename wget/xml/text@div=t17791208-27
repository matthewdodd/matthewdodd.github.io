I suspected the prisoner of taking things, from his pockets appearing to be loaded when he went out of the shop; upon the 8th of November he was going out about some business, his pockets being loaded I stopped him; I desired to know what he had got there; he made answer nothing but his own property; I told him if it was his own property he need not be afraid to show it me; he refused to let me see it. I got him into the counting-house; he said then if I would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177912080032"></xptr>promise to let him go about his business he would give me the things out of his pocket, and go away and never come near the house any more. I told him I could say nothing to that, I must see what he had in his pocket first. A customer came into the shop at the time; the prisoner desired me to go and serve the customer, and then he would pull the things out of his pocket. I went and served the customer; in the mean while I locked him into the counting-house, but he made his escape out of the counting-house window.</p>
               <p>That was on the ground floor? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where did that window go to? - Into Bridge-street. I pursued him into Black-friars; a gentleman who stood at the door when he made his escape told me which way he was gone. I called out stop thief, and a gentleman stopped him and brought him back again. I got him into the counting-house again, and Mr. Spaughton, an officer, came in, and I gave charge of him; he searched him, and found in his pockets more than two pounds of stone blue, about six ounces of wax-taper, and some flat prunella, and three keys; one a kind of a pick-lock key, which will open the shop-door.</p>
               <p>Did you try it? - Yes; there was another key that opens the boiling-house at Windmill-hill, where we boil oil, and the other key opened his box.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to any of the articles which were found upon the prisoner being your master's property? - They are articles we cannot swear to. He was taken to Guild-hall; from some talk in court I had a suspicion that his brother in Goswell-street was concerned with him.</p>

On Monday, the 8th of November, I came to town about eight o'clock, and found the prisoner and my shopman were gone before the sitting alderman. I went to them; the shopman told me he had a suspicion of the prisoner's brother. I went to Justice Blackborough, and got a warrant to search the brother's house. When I came back, the sitting alderman was gone, and the hearing was referred to Wednesday; on coming out the prisoner desired me to be merciful to him.

I went up stairs with him and searched the prisoner's box, there I found a pair of shoes of mine which I had in the summer, but they were rather too short for me, and a piece of a silver spoon that was my property. I had missed the shoes, but, as my house was repairing, I thought the workmen might have taken them, and therefore said nothing about them; my name is wrote in the shoes. I am sure the piece of a spoon is my property; I had sold the bowl of it some time before among some old silver.</p>

Parker said he wished he had a constable. The prisoner desired I would not get a constable, and begged me to intercede with his mistress for him. When he was in the Compter he sent me a note, desiring me to come to him. I went; he then said he should be glad if I would intercede with his master to be favourable to him, and he would give him all his clothes and all his money, and go into the country and amend his life. I said the best way to obtain his master's favour was to tell where he had deposited his master's effects.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, of 5, Feather's Court, Drury Lane—about 9.30 on the morning of 22nd January, I was standing with my barrow at an oil shop, at the corner of Cumberland Street and Goodge. Street, there is a butcher's shop at the opposite corner, and there was a butcher's cart standing opposite a pork butcher's, three houses above the butchers, the horses' head was towards Tottenham Court Road, and directly opposite that cart there was a little perambulator, or three wheeled track close against the kerb—the butcher's cart was not close to the kerb—there—was another costermonger's barrow between it and the kerb—I saw a four wheeled cab dtiven by the deceased coming from the Middlesex Hospital, towards Tottenham Court Road, he was driving very slow, a jig-jog pace—I also saw a cart driven by the prisoner coming in the opposite direction—he was not driving hard, and he was not driving very slowly, there were some window sashes in the cart standing upright, it was about five or six houses from the butcher's cart, and he went a little bit too far out to get past the butcher's cart, and he hit up against the fore wheel of the-old man's cab and pitched the old man out—I went and picked him up, put him in his cab and took him to the Middlesex Hospital—the pony in the prisoner's cart started with the force of the blow and threw the prisoner and his brother out—a man named Turner stopped the pony close against the cab.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The butcher's cart was standing outside the barrow and overlapping it; anyone coming from Tottenham Court Road, would have to pass between the butcher's cart and the cab—the prisoner was on his right side before he got to the cart, he then went more out into the centre of the road to pass the cart—I did not see the deceased rise up in his seat as if to look round, he fell close against the kerb; I should say his head rested not above 2 or 3 inches from it—at the time the cab was struck it was about 3 feet 6 inches from the kerb—I think there was room for the prisoner to have passed, or he might have pulled up.</p>

I live at 3, Feather's Court, Drury Lane, and am a costermonger—I was in Goodge Street, with my barrow standing next door to the pork butcher's, the butcher's cart had just delivered some meat there, the cab passed me going about 4 or 5 miles an hour, as I was looking at the butcher's cart I heard a smash, turned half-round and saw the prisoner's cart poked on one wheel, it stood so for about half a second, and the pony made a start and I missed the old man from his box; I did not see the prisoner's cart before the accident—I should say the cab was about 3 feet from <hi rend="italic">the</hi> kerb—the prisoner's was a light two wheeled cart, and the pony about 13 or 14 hands high.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gasfitter of Lonsdale Road, Notting Hill, I was in Goodge Street, within 3 yards of the baker's shop on the left, going from Middlesex Hospital, I saw the deceased's cab going in the direction of Tottenham Court Road at a reasonable pace for a cab—I saw the prisoner's dirt coming from Tottenham Court Road—he was driving fast—he got in collision with the cab, tilted over the wheel, and turned at right angles with the cab—he was in the middle of the road when I first saw him—the cab was about 3 feet from the kerb—there was plenty of room for the prisoner to pass—he had no reason to pull out towards the cab, he was trespassing on the other half of the road—it was 5 feet 7 inches from the gutter to the line of the road; I measured it directly after the collision; he had that distance to spare—in my opinion he could have avoided the accident, but I fancy the glare of the sashes fogged him, and he pulled the Wrong rein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not see him do so, that is my idea—the collision took place on the Tottenham Court Road side of the butcher's cart—the prisoner had not reached the cart, he was within, about 2 yards of it.</p>

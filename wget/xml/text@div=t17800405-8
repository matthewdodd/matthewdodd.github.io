                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050011"></xptr>Relate the circumstances. - As I was crossing the fields, I saw two men at a little distance from me. One jumped over a bank, and the other came out of the road. I knew what would be the consequence, and reflected on myself for going that way at night. When I came up to the footway to go into the fields, where they were, they let me pass a few yards, and then asked me if I was drunk or sober? I said sober. They said we have been drinking, and spent all our money, have you got any! I said I have not much, gentlemen, but what I have got you are welcome to. Then Allison, the evidence said, d - n you, stop and let us see what you have got. Upon which the other man came up and collared me. I said, gentlemen, I am only a journeyman and have not got much money. He held his fist to my face, and swore he would murder me if I offered to speak loud, or made any noise. The evidence unbuttonned my breeches and took out my watch, and my right foot shoe-buckle, but whether he took the left or not I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Did you lose both? - Yes. It was one of the men took the left, but which I cannot say.</p>
               <p>All this time there were but two? - Yes; after that they searohed me. I had fourpence halfpenny in a handkerchief in my great coat pocket; they took that out, but returned it me again. When they were going away I said, gentlemen, if you will appoint a place to meet me to-morrow and let me have the buckles, I will give you any thing you please for them. He that collared me, said are the buckles silver or plated? I said plated. He said if I spoke a word, or made a noise he would murder me. And then I went away.</p>
               <p>Did you find your watch or buckles again? - Yes. The watch and buckles were both found.</p>
               <p>(The watch was produced in court by Macmanus, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

After we came from the field, I and Hunter dined at the cook-shop in Tothil-street; from thence we went to the Chequers, in Tothil-street, where Graham joined us, and we drank together. Graham, I, and Hunter agreed to meet at Hunter's quarters that evening by four or five o'clock.</p>
               <p>Where was Hunter's quarters? - At the Stag's Horns, in Whitechapel. We met there. Bennett came in while we were drinking together. Hunter told me he thought he was a very proper man to go out with us that evening. We went from thence to my quarters. where we ate some bread and cheese, and drank a pot of half and half, and three or four half pints of gin.</p>
               <p>Where was that? - At a publick-house in Johnson-street, Whitechapel, and agreed the whole of us to go out that evening, and rob the first man we laid hold of in some fields.</p>
               <p>Did you go out together? - Yes, about eight o'clock, or a little after, from that house.</p>
               <p>Who went out? - Bennett, Hunter, Graham, and myself. They knowing the fields best, we went the way Graham and Bennett knew. When we got into the fields behind the church, we sat down behind the bank. The baker (the prosecutor) came by; Graham and Hunter agreed to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178004050012"></xptr>run off while Bennett and I robbed him, and to give us notice if any body was coming.</p>
               <p>Bennett and you made the attack? - Yes. Bennett laid hold of him and I took the watch out of his pocket. I unbuckled his shoe on his right foot, and Bennett took the buckles, and then I took the watch. Then we all four ran off together across the fields, and went into Whitechapel; after that we went into the fields again.</p>
               <p>What became of the watch and buckles? - I kept the watch and Bennett kept the buckles just then. We came between Bishopsgate and Shoreditch, in the main street, and went on till we came opposite Bishopsgate church, there we proposed to dispose of the things. I gave Bennett the watch, and Bennett gave Hunter the buckles. Graham and Hunter were to go and pawn the buckles, and Bennett and I were to pawn the watch that evening. We tried to pawn them at two places in Houndsditch, but it being late in the evening they would not let us into the shop.</p>
               <p>What time was that? - About nine or a little after. Then we agreed to give Hunter the watch with the buckles to keep that evening, being near his quarters. We went and drank a pot of half and half, where it was agreed for me to take the watch to dispose of it the best way I could the next morning, and they were to meet me at ten or eleven o'clock at my lodgings the next morning. I offered it to

He was then taken on one side and Hunter was examined, he acknowledged their meeting at his quarters, and that they went to Allison's quarters, and from thence they went to the fields. Graham was then called in again, and the magistrate asked,</p>
               <p>"How could you tell me that you was not at Whitechapel? Hunter says that you was." Hunter then said to Graham, you know very well that you was with us.

He called Gamble backwards and asked him to pawn them; he consented to go; he went and pawned them, and brought him the money. I had a share of a pot of beer there, and then went home, and left Gamble and Allison there together. I gave him the buckles and he went and pawned them, and gave Allison the money and the duplicate.</p>
               <p>To Gamble. Did you see Allison there? - Yes. Allison and Graham called me backwards; Allison asked me to pawn the buckles for him, but I got them from Graham.</p>
               <p>Did he call to Graham to give you the buckles? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who did you give the money to? - Allison.</p>

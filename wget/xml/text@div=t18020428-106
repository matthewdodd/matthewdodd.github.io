(The indigo produced).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Does any body else rub them down, besides you? - A. Yes; I first, the King's officer, and the gate-keeper.</p>
               <p>Q.It happens, that when a cask is opened, and new hooped, that some drops out? - A. It is in chests, and sometimes it gets out.</p>
               <p>Q. It is considered as no crime, in the warehouse, for a man to take up a bit, and carry it away with him? - A. I never knew a man do it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. He knew it was not his property? - A.Most assuredly.</p>

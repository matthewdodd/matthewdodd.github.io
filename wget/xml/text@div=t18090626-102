On the 13th of June last, about half past ten in the morning the prisoner came in and asked for half a pint of porter, it was drawn for her; she put down a penny piece, and then put her hand into her pocket to look for a halfpenny or a farthing as I supposed. I knew the prisoner for some years past; she has offered me base coin frequently before. I have taken three altogether of her, two before this. The half pint of porter came to one penny farthing; instead of her putting down a farthing, she put down a shilling; that was not the first time nor the sixth time that she had served me so; she took up the penny piece, I took up the shilling and walked out of the bar to a better light; I looked at the shilling, I saw it to be a bad one, such as she had offered me before. I sent for a constable and had her taken up; she was searched in my presence. I had the shilling in my hand, and the two shillings that I had taken of her before, I had spoiled by making a hole through them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the shilling she gave you on the 13th - A. I kept it and delivered it to the constable; when she was searched she had seven-pence halfpenny and a farthing in copper money, penny pieces and halfpence; she had a farthing.</p>

               <p>COURT. Which of the shillings did he charge her with having uttered that morning - A. That which had not been nailed down, that is it; and the two others I have got here; and these halfpence I found in her pocket; six-pence halfpenny I found in her pocket, and a penny farthing the landlord delivered to me; she said she had taken the shilling that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jones. How came you possession of that penny farthing - A. She delivered over the penny farthing after the constable was sent for.</p>

               <p>Q. You are acquainted of course with counterfeit money - is that a counterfeit - A.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. May it please your honour, I work at Spitalfields-market. I went from there to Billingsgate; I went to the Bull-tap with a hundred of mackerel; the man that employed me he was going off in the country with the coach; I asked him eight-pence for carrying them, he told me he could afford no more than six-pence; the man gave me a shilling and I gave him six-pence; the load being heavy I went into this man's place, I asked for half a pint of beer; I had a penny piece in my hand, he said had I not a farthing, I said I did not know; I gave him the shilling, he looked at it, he said he did not think it was a good one; I said sir, you should have looked at the shilling before the man went away; the man was on the top of the coach in Bishopgate-street; then he said I know it is a bad one, I think I nailed a shilling of yours down six months ago. I said it did not stand to reason, that if I had a bad one I should offer it to him. I can assure you, since the hour I was born, I never entered his door before. He said he would make an example of my country he would hang every man and woman of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180906260072"></xptr>contry. He took the five farthings, and then he sent for a constable.</p>

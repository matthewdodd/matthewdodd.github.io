             sworn. - I am a coach-maker: The prisoner came to our house, on Monday, the 15th of January, and asked if we bought left-off coaches; I told him, we did, sometimes; he said, he had got one to sell, and asked me to go and look at; I asked him where it was; he said, in Burleigh's-gardens, Old-street; he said, he had had it about two years, and had served it on a job a year and three or four months; he said, it had been standing four months in an open cart-yard, and only had a three days job for it; he asked me when I would come to look at it; I told him, we were going to Windus's, and then we would call, but it was uncertain when; and then he went away; he came again in about two minutes, and said, if I had a mind, he would bring it up next morning to our house in Wells-street, Oxford-road; the next morning it was brought in a cart; he told me, he had brought the coach; I told him, if he would leave it till next morning, I would speak to my father, and he should have an answer; he appointed me to meet him the next morning, at the Six Clerks office, Chancery-lane; I met him there; he asked me what was the most I would give; I told him, ten pounds; he said, I should spend a shilling then; and I said, I was not so near as that; I then gave him a guinea earnest, and he agreed to call upon us on Friday, for the rest; then we went to a public-house just by, and had a shillingsworth of wine and water; I asked him what gentleman he had served with the job, for a year and three months; he said the gentleman was dead; he said, he bought the coach of one Old Howison, in Old-street-road; he said, he was dead too; I asked him what he was, at the Six Clerks-office, and he said, he was bag-bearer, that he had about eighty pounds a year; and he said, he had candles and lodging found him; he said, he had another way of getting money, he gave out writing, and paid a halfpenny for fifteen lines, and got a penny for it; and then we parted; I made enquiry the next day, and found the coach was Mr. Jones's, and I went to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not sell him the carriage.</p>
               <p>Leader. He sold it to me, and was to call for the remainder of the money, on Friday; I shewed the coach to Mr. Jones, and he owned it.</p>
               <p>Jones. I knew this to be my carriage by the two black supporters to the arms; the carriage was blue, and one black wheel the off side before, and another broke; the other wheels were blue; the lining had the same arms upon it.</p>
               <p>Leader. The carriage I shewed to Jones was the same that I had from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had this carriage of Jones for a job; I wanted a little money upon it, Mr. Leader told me, he would give me ten pounds for it, and I said, I would not sell it; they took my watch from me; I did not know of my trial coming on, or else I could have had plenty of gentlemen to speak for me from Chancery-lane.</p>

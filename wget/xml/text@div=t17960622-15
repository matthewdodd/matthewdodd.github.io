               <p>Q. What is the distance between the two places? - A. A mile and an half.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ally. Q. You cannot tell whether it went away, or whether any body stole it? - A. I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. You found it in Ramsden's yard, I suppose; he is a dealer in pigs, is he not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He keeps an open yard? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. What colour were those hairs? - A. A rusty colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Many other pigs have rusty hairs at the end of the tail? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen 10,000 pigs with rusty hairs at the end of their tails? - A. I never saw a pig like my own; I know her by her size and make.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said that you could not swear to it; upon further consideration, but that you could only swear it was your's, because the tail was a little longer than other pigs? - A. No, I never said so.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body should swear that, he would swear that which is false? - A. I cannot help what they swear.</p>

               <p>Examined by Mr. Ally. I work in the India-House, I have known the prisoner these sixteen years; I was at the door, at the same time that the prisoner, and Lewis, and the boy, were coming out of Lewis's house with the pig.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive it is the pig in question? - A. I went from there to his father's house in Eyre-street, and saw this pig in the stye, which I know to be the same sow he had from Lewis, and no other.</p>
               <p>Q. Lewis was present at the time? - A. He was just behind the prisoner and the boy; as they were coming out, I asked the prisoner if he had been buying that sow, and he said, yes; I have seen the pig since at Mr. Ramsden's yard, and since that, I went to the prosecutor's house and saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that Mr. Lewis was near enough to have heard this conversation? - A. I do think he must have heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. The pig, however, could not have come out of the possession of Lewis without his knowing it? - A. No, it could not.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take so much notice of this sow? - A. I have known Montague many years, ever since we were boys together; I happened to be coming past at the time they were coming out with the pig; I observed it as we went along Brick-lane at the time.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was this? - A. The 18th of May, which was my birth-day.</p>

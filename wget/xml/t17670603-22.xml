               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room?</p>
               <p>F. Jeggot. No, she was not; my money was in my pocket, and my pocket by my side; when I awaked, I missed my money directly, then the prisoner was in the room and my husband was gone; I asked her where my money was gone; she said my husband had got it; I went to see for him, and was almost murdered in going after him; I never got my money again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask your husband about it?</p>
               <p>F. Jeggot. Yes; he said he had not 50 s. of it; he said Mrs. Smith laid it before him, and said he was a d - d fool if he did not take it all. The prisoner d - d me to my face, and said she had part of the money, and if it was to be done again she would do it.</p>

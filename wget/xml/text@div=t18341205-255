                  </hi>, Esq. On the 4th of December I was going down Mile-end-road, between one and two o'clock in the day—I saw Purkis take some hay out of his master's cart on his shoulder, and throw it down against the Coach and Horses public-house, close by the cellar window—when I had passed about twenty yards, I turned and saw a person in a smock frock, about the size of Rysley, put the hay down in the cellar—I gave information to Mr. Menzies.</p>

Pur<lb></lb>kis was my carter—I sent him to London on the 4th of December—he had a truss to feed the horses with—it was his duty to feed the horses with that truss—he told me he left some at the Bell, and when he came back he feeds the horses with it—the Coach and Horses is nearest to London—if he had fed his horses in London, he would not have had half so much hay as this left—here is about 48lbs.—it is worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had no right to sell or give it away—if he had any left, he should bring it home.</p>

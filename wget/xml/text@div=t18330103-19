On the 6th of December I saw the prisoner pass through the shop, about two o'clock in the afternoon - he went into the warehouse; I saw a bag under his arm, and followed him into the warehouse - I then saw he had a paper parcel of staples under his arm, partly concealed by the bag; I asked what he had there - he said he did not know, but he was going to take it to a person outside - it was a parcel of box staples; it had been kept in the shop, and I had seen it safe a few hours before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He might see the parcel under my arm when I went through the shop. Witness. No, I did not see the parcel - the bag was not my employer's; I saw the parcel when I went into the warehouse; it was all covered with the bag but the card in front of it - he was buying a small quantity of hooping.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">JAMES WILLIAMS</hi>. I am vicar of St. Giles, Camberwell—on the 20th December last, I went to bed about 11 o'clock—about 3 o'clock in the morn<lb></lb>ing I was awoke, and saw the backs of two men, in a stooping position—I did not hear them come into the room—they were in the act of opening one of the drawers with a screw driver—I had two pistols—these drawers were locked—there was a gold watch in one, not a very valuable one—I did not see the men's faces—the prisoners resemble them in dress—they had similar coloured clothes—I jumped out of bed at once—the prisoners walked off</p>

               <p>just as I landed on the floor, and were gone directly—I got hold of the two pistols, rushed down after them—I did not follow them down far—I believe they did not go down the staircase—I eventually found the back door open—the window on the second floor was pointed out to me afterwards by the I housekeeper—it was open a little—there were bars to the window about 8 inches apart—I examined the drawers in the bedroom afterwards—then were marks on them; they appeared to have been made by some instru<lb></lb>ment—I don't think it was by my screw-driver—I went into the back dining-room, that is below the bedroom—I found this bar (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there were marks on it—when I went to bed there were two screw-drivers in the dining-room, on the mantelshelf, and a powder flask in front of them—when I came down one of the screw-drivers was on the table—I saw the screw-driver afterwards; that was found in Mrs. Jones' house—I am positive it is mine—it has been in my possession for some years.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housekeeper to Mr. Williams—on 20th December I went to bed about 11.30—I fastened the house up perfectly safe—I fastened the back door with a lock, and chain, and bolt—the back window fastening was broken, but the window was shut close—I was awoke about 3.30 by a noise of footsteps rushing down the back staircase—I got up, and saw a light burning below—I went into the rooms, and found them in a disturbed state—I know this penknife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was taken fan my work-box from my sitting-room on Sunday night, or morning of the 21st—I also missed a thimble from the same box.</p>

The prisoners were brought to the station on 25th December—I produced a screw-driver given to me by Aplin, and showed it to the prisoners—I said, "This screw-driver was found in Mr. Jones' house, and it will be the means of bringing another charge against you, I have no doubt"—Epps said, "I think you are adrift there"—Soper said something I could not hear—on 26th December I searched a room at 17, South Street, Camberwell—Soper gave me that as his address—I found this penknife that has been produced, in a cupboard, as if concealed.</p>

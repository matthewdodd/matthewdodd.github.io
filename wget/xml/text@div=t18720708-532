I saw the deceased woman on Wednes<lb></lb>day, 26th June, in one of the rooms of the cottage in which I believe she lived—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—superficially there were bruises—there was one bruise behind the right ear; it was grazed down by some sharp or cutting edge—there was a cut about three-quarters of an inch on the ear itself, rather higher than the bruise—that was evidently done after</p>

               <p>death—there was a bruise over the left eye, and a large bruise at the back of the head—the bruise over the eye might have been caused by a fall against something not of large size and somewhat rounded, or a blow would have done it—the bruise on the back of the head was of large size, and must have been produced by a flat surface—there was also a bruise on the under part of the jaw—the tongue was bitten on the right side near the tip—the wounds were all recent; I mean within nine days, because the blood would alter in nine days and turn the colour—they might have been within two or three days or two or three hours—I found some older bruises on the arms and legs—the cause of death, in my opinion, was the effusion of blood at the base of the brain—it did not proceed from the large vessels, therefore it must have come from the small, and I could not trace the small vessels—I have heard the witnesses state the position in which the body was found—the marks of violence that I found could certainly not all have been caused by a fall against the tub—the bruise over the left eye could not, because it must have been done by something round and small; and the one on the jaw and the one at the back of the head could not have been caused in that way—I am not able to say which of the blows caused the effusion of blood; any one of them would have been sufficient—the violence which produced such bruises as those three, on the jaw, the back of the head, and the left eye, might have produced the rupture of those vessels, or the one behind the ear—the blow behind the ear might have been caused by falling against the tub; that is the only one in my judgment which could have been caused in that way—the heart was full of blood, some coagulated, both sides of the heart—the lungs were congested—that is to say, full of blood at the back, not at the front—I am able to say that the woman did not die from suffoca<lb></lb>tion, nor from drowning, which is a form of suffocation—in my judgment the marks which I found could not all have been caused by one fall—there must have been a number of falls, if caused by falls.</p>

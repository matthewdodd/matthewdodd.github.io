                  </hi>. I am a corn-merchant, at King's Arms Wharf, Belvedere-road, Lambeth. Higgs was in my employ as a carman on 6th Dec., and had been so for six or seven months—Mr. Reddin, of Holland-street, Blackfriars, is a customer of mine—on Monday, 9th Dec., I went to Mr. Taylor's premises, near the Horns, at Kennington—I found there half a load of second-cut clover hay tied with canary straw bands, which is very unusual—there was nothing particular about the quality of the hay, only its being second-cut clover—I also went to Mr. Dack's, a corn-dealer, in Lambeth-walk—I found about half a load of hay there, of the same description, tied in the same way, and similar in every respect—I had some hay of that description at that time, and on the previous Fri<lb></lb>day one load of it went to Mr. Reddin's by my order—I sent six loads to Mr. Reddin's on Friday, and one of them was this clover tied with canary straw bands—I saw Thomas Higgs take that load out of the yard about three o'clock in the afternoon—in consequence of information I went to George Giggs—he is the brother of Edward Giggs, who is in my service—George Giggs had bought two loads of hay of me sometime in the early part of that week—he had a written order from me to fetch one of those loads from the Great Western Railway—the hay that I sold him one load of, was lying there, and the bulk from which the other load was to come was at the Southampton Railway—the hay that he bought of me at the Great Western Railway was cinquefoil hay, and the other was black clover hay, neither of them were similar to this second-cut clover hay—they were very much inferior—he gave me 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load for the two loads he had—the hay I found at Taylor's and Dack's was from 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. better—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185101060096"></xptr>
               <p>it was worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a load—on the Monday I saw George Giggs in Stangate Mews, at the back of Astley's Theatre—I asked him if he had received a load of clover off a cart of mine on the Friday afternoon—he said he received no clover of mine on Friday afternoon—I then asked him where he got the load of clover that he sold to Dack and Taylor on Satur<lb></lb>day—he said, "I bought two loads of you the beginning of the week"—I said, "You did, but this clover was from neither of those loads, but quite different"—he said he bought a load of clover of some man in West<lb></lb>minster, but he did not name any one—I said, "Who is that man, point him out to me and I shall be satisfied?"—he then said, "I can't tell who he was, I never saw him before, I don't know where to find him"—I then said, "Show me the receipt for the load of clover?"—he replied, "I have got no receipt, I keep no books"—it is the custom in our business to send an invoice and delivery-note with any quantity of goods we send to a customer, and it is the duty of the carman to get that note receipted by the clerk, or some person at the customer's—this is the note for six loads of clover, on Friday, 6th Dec.

                  </hi>. I live in Mason-street, Stamford-street. I re<lb></lb>ceived directions on 6th Dec., from Mr. Trampleasure, to take some clover-hay to Mr. Reddin's—I left about four o'clock, as near as I can guess—Thomas Higgs and Kicks went with me, and Coombs came after—we three had each a load; and when we got a little way out of Mr. Bennett's yard, Higgs said to me, "Old fellow, one of these loads belongs to us"—I said, "What do you mean, <hi rend="italic">Tom</hi>?"—he said, "Why one of these belongs to us, we shall have one of these loads ourselves"—I said, "No, <hi rend="italic">Tom;</hi> I will have nothing at all to do with it"—he said, "Yes you shall"—I said, "No, I won't, by God!"—nothing more passed at that time—the three carts kept together, and we went on to Mr. Powell's, in John-street, Commercial-road—one of the two men there ordered a pot of ale, and they made me have a glass—I left the other two at Powell's, and I went home to get my dinner, in Mason-street—that was in my way to go to Mr. Reddin's—I took my load of hay to my house; it stood before my door while I got my dinner—after that I went with it to Mr. Reddin's—I saw Kicks there, and Green was there, but Higgs was not—I did not see him at Mr. Reddin's at all—Coombs came afterwards—when I had delivered my hay, we came away to a public-house in Holland-street—there was Kicks, Coombs, Green, and I—we had a drop of beer; and when we came out, Green jumped into Coombs's cart, and they went galloping on; I and Kicks went gently after—they said we were to go to Powell's—I said to Kicks, "What does he say?" he said, "He says we are to go to Powell's"—I went there, and Coombs's cart and Higgs's cart were both there—Higgs's cart was then empty—when I left it there before, it was full, and it had got a load of second-cut clover on it—I went into the tap-room at Powell's house, and they stood at the front of the bar—after some time, Higgs came into the tap<lb></lb>room, and said, "How are you, Mr. Hopkins?"—he caught hold of my right-hand with both his hands, shook my hand, and <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into my hand—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> what is this for?—he said, "That is what I owe you"—I said, "You don't owe me <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>"—he said, "Go on, you stupid old man;" I said, "I won't have it;" he said, "Go on, you stupid old man, you shall have it"—I kept it till I got out of doors—I would have given it him again, but he would not take it—I told him I wanted to give it him again—I said, "Here is this money back again, <hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> for I won't have it"—he said he would not have it—Green had gone some little time before Higgs put the money into my hand—Stangate is about half a mile from Powell's beer-house—I should think I was not away from Powell's more than an hour and a half or an hour and three-quarters before I got back—we started off about four; I do not think it was six when we got back.</p>

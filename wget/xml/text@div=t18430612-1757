On Friday night, the 12th of May, I went to No. 20, Steven-street, Lisson-grove—the female prisoner lodged there, and was in the room at the time with several other girls—they appeared to be quarrelling—I asked what was the matter, and a girl who was there said it had nothing to do with me—I said, "It has something to do with me; what watches are those you have been quarrelling about?" (I had heard something about watches) the female prisoner said, "It is two watches I have pawned for a young man who slept with me last night"—I said, "Where is the young man now?"—she said he was gone out—I asked where she had pledged them—she said, "One at Fairland's, Lisson-grove, and the other at Alexander's, in Church-street"—I took her to the station—this was about nine o'clock—she was not detained, as we did not know whether the watches were stolen, but next morning I heard Mrs. Setwell had lost some—I went with Mrs. Setwell to the pawnbrokers—she saw the watches, and claimed them—on Tuesday night, about nine o'clock, I met Baker in James-street, Lisson-grove, collared him, and said he must go with me to the station—he di<lb></lb>rectly made a rush to get from me—I said, "You cannot get away"—he said, "What do want me for?"—I said, "For stealing two watches and some money and gold keys from Queen-street, where you lodged"—he said, "I don't know any thing about them"—we went on towards the station—on the way he said, "I am very sorry for what I have done, and I got but very little by it"—I took him to the station, and he said he gave the watches to a female to pawn for him—next morning I took the female prisoner again—the house is in the parish of St. Marylebone.</p>

On the 14th of November, about half-past five or six o'clock in the afternoon, I was going home to the Kent-road, and before I got into Gracechurch-street, having lost handkerchiefs on that spot, I pressed my handkerchief down to the bottom of my pocket, and buttoned my coat quite tight, but as soon as I got to <placeName id="t18311201-20-crimeloc119">St. Peter's-alley</placeName>

            . I live in Shorter's-court, Throgmonton-street, with my father, who is a hairdresser; I am twelve years old. I was standing in Bishopsgate-street, near Peter's-alley, and saw Mr. Ruston with a gentleman; I saw the prisoner go near him, alone -I saw him take the handkerchief from Mr. Ruston's pocket; I turned round sharp upon him: Mr. Ruston turned round at the same time, and the prisoner dropped the handkerchief and ran off - I picked it up, went after Mr. Ruston, and gave it to him: the prisoner ran into Leadenhall-market, and was stopped before I lost sight of him; after Mr. Ruston collard him, he ran off a second time - I have not a doubt of his person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The place is well lighted, I suppose? A. Yes; there was no gang or acquaintances of his about.</p>

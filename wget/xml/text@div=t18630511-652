I went into the defendant's service on 5th December, at 25, Upper Eaton-street, as managing clerk, during his absence particularly—I was to attend to the books, and all matters that might occur during the day—there were two offices, his private office and my office—Davis was there when I went—one day in the week after 8th December the prisoner and his brother, and his son came, and the prisoner said, "Mr. Davis, I am quite prepared to pay you all that I owe yon if you will call at my other office in Blackfriars-road, and settle with you at once, if you will give me up my letters and papers which you have purloined; I will pay you everything?"—Mr. Davis said, "Those letters and papers are in my solicitor's hands; you must apply to my solicitor"—I heard no other conversation between them—these five books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were in the office, and these two green ones were in Mr. Lewis's private office—I made no entries in them, I was not there long enough—I was only there ten days, and Mr. Lewis's son inside made the entries.</p>

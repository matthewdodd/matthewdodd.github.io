                  </hi>. I am a porter, and live at 34, Whiskin Street, Clerkenwell—on Sunday night, 2nd June, about 11.30, I was in Percival Street, Clerkenwell, and received a blow on the back of my head from behind—my hat was knocked off; I picked it up, but before I put it on I was thrust against the rails by a mob of five or six, and my silver watch and gold chain were taken; a signal was given and they made off to the corner of King Street—my watch cost 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I ran after them and gave an alarm—the prisoners are two who were in the mob—a piece of my chain was picked up in the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carver and gilder, of 50, Percival Street, Clerkenwell—I was talking to two friends at my door, and heard blows, I looked out and saw Brown over the way—I saw him pick up his hat, and heard him call, "Stop thief"—I saw the prisoners running in front, and others behind—I turned back to King Street, and went back and checked them, and said, "What did you run for?"—I followed them, and a policeman stopped them—Brown was five or six yards behind them.</p>

I heard a cry of "Stop thief," and saw the prisoners; the last witness checked them—I turned my light on and said, "What are you running for?"—they said, "We heard a cry of stop thief, and were giving chase;" but they were running just in front of the prosecutor—I saw two others immediately behind them—there were about nine altogether—I found a piece of chain in Percival Street, which was identified by Brown, also a compass.</p>

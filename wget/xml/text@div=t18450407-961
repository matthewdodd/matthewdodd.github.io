                  </hi>. I reside at Enfield, and am in the habit of sending hay to Whitechapel-market—Taylor, Morrell, and Shepherd were carmen of mine. On the 20th of March I sent by them several carts to London loaded with hay—they started about two o'clock in the morning—Taylor took a load of clover hay—Morrell had a load of cinqfoil—Shep<lb></lb>herd and James Ovenall had each a load of clover bay—I went up to Whitechapel-market, and got there a little before nine o'clock—I found the carts all there, and apparently all rightly loaded, with thirty-six trusses in</p>

               <p>each load—this ticket was given me when I got there—it is a ticket of Mr. Sweeting's, my hay salesman, and indicates that Mr. Dixon, of Bar<lb></lb>bican, had bought three loads of clover and one of cinqfoil—I gave this ticket to Taylor to take there, and it was his duty to bring me back a counter ticket, acknowledging the receipt of the hay at Mr. Dixon's—I then sent off the four loads referred to in this ticket to go to Mr. Dixon's, and they went out of the market together—I think Taylor's cart went first, but I am not quite certain—it was their duty to go directly to Mr. Dixon's—Brick-lane would be their way to go if they went by Spitalfields church—Banks's shop is in Brick-lane, but it is some distance beyond where they ought to have turned to go by Spitalfields church—his shop is out of their way—some information reached me, and I went to Banks's shop, about ten o'clock or a few minutes after—I found one of my carts which had the load of cinqfoil, which Morrell had the charge of, standing at Banks's side door, and Banks was standing by the tide, of it—directly Banks saw me he made away into his shop—I went up to Morrell, and asked him what he wanted with his cart there—he looked down on the ground, and said they had been leaving a truss of hay a-piece.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Dixon. I remember Charles Tay<lb></lb>lor coming that morning with a message from Mr. Larman—I think it was between ten and eleven o'clock—I gave him this ticket, which I got from Angle, who was in the yard, taking in some straw—the last two carts were just about going out of the yard—I asked Angle what he had done with the ticket he had out of the counting-house—he said, "Here it is"—this refers to the clover-hay and cinqfoil—he took it out of his pocket—the carts which had left the meadow-hay were gone, the other carts were not—Angle did not give any reason why he had not given this ticket to the carman.</p>

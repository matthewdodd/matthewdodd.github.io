                  </hi>. I live at No. 49, Alfred-street, Harrow-road, Pad<lb></lb>dington, and am town traveller and agent to Mr. Thomas Bushell, a spiced cordial manufacturer, of Hoxton—I have been about twenty weeks in his employ—I know the prisoner; he is a licensed victualler, and keeps the Coach and Horses at Kensington—I have been in the habit of supplying him with cordials on behalf of Mr. Bushell—at the latter end of Dec. I received from him an order for half a gallon of ale spice, to be sent to his brother at Ramsgate—they make ale hot, and then put the syrup in, and it makes a very nice drink—I sent it on 3rd Jan.; and on the 5th I called on the prisoner on my regular round, and told him I had sent it; he gave me the money for it, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I gave him a receipt; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that was 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the stuff and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the bottle—after that I received a letter from his brother, George Stupple, in consequence of which I sent two more gallons of ale spice to Ramsgate on the 10th—I do not know what train it went by—I wrote the bill on the 9th, in the evening, put a letter inside, and the porter posted it—the body of this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing it is the one I put into the letter, it was not receipted—I saw the prisoner</p>

               <p>on Thursday the 12th, and told him that I had sent the two gallons of ale spice and the bill for the whole; he said, "I am very glad of that, it will be a great deal off my mind, for I have quite sufficient to pay my own debts;" I said, "Then I shall be indebted to you 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I have not sufficient in my pocket to give it you now, but when the carman brings the peppermint, which will be to-morrow, I will send you the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by the carman;" he said, "That will do very well;" he then gave me an order for half a gallon of ginger spruce—I did not go to my master's place on that evening, as I had had very severe walking, about thirty miles a day, and it wan severe weather, and I had a bad heel; I went there at 10 o'clock next morning—the carman was then gone his rounds to Kensington, and of course I could not send him the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on Thursday, 19th Jan., I met my master at the prisoner's house—I had not sent the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., because I had not had an oppor<lb></lb>tunity—I think I had been to my master's very day after the 12th; my master gave me a holiday on the Saturday, to see if that would do my foot any good, but it was no better, and I was away until Thursday morning, the 19th; when I went to the prisoner's house, and said to him, "What charge have you got against me?" he said, "You know all about it;" I said, "I know nothing about it; I hear you say I have been receiving a bill of you for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for goods which were sent to Ramsgate?—he said, "So you have," pulled out a file and pulled up some of the other bills, and held the bill up some<lb></lb>way from me on the other side of the bar on the file—I was outside the bar, some distance from him—I said, "I will swear that that is not my handwriting; he then went into the parlour, and I saw no more of him—I had asked him to show me the bill—I left the house—I was to meet my master there—I have not received the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the receipt was not in my writing, or written by my authority—on the following Monday, I was given into custody for embezzling the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I was immediately discharged by the Magistrate; who said it was a very suspicious case, and he should detain the bill in case he should hear anything further of it—the prisoner said he had received the bill from his brother at Ramsgate, and had paid me at 10 o'clock on the morning of the 10th—the Magistrate said, "How can that be, when the letter was not posted till 8 o'clock on the 9th?"—the prisoner answered, "I did not mean to say that, I meant to say Wilkins brought it to me"—he said, "Wilkins brought me the bill"—I was then discharged directly—the prisoner was afterwards given into custody.</p>

               <p>him who I received it from, nor did I for the other money I paid him with it—I have no occasion—if I pay a couple of pounds, it is taken off my account—my master puts it on a slate—I never saw him write, nor have I ever read any of his writing while I have been in his service—I am perhaps indebted to him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we have not had a settlement yet—I never render any account of the customers' names—it is trusted to me—if a customer goes away or fails I should be at the loss, and should have to make it up, because my employer trusts no one—they are not his customers, they are mine—I got most of them myself—my master had a small business before I went—I deal with them as if they were my own—I occasionally look out the goods myself—Mr. Stupple's goods were sent by the carman—there is no entry of them, except in the delivery book of what the carman takes—if there is anything left it is put down to my account—I paid Mr. Bushell the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. paid me by the prisoner, with other money—I cannot say I paid him that identical 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then there were two 19th in the month? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, certainly not; it must have been 23rd Jan.—it is not a pleasant thing to recollect—the Magistrate said that it was a suspicious case—I was discharged, and nothing further passed—before the Magistrate said that, the prisoner said, "I received the bill from my brother at Ramsgate," and then the Magistrate said, "How can that be?"—I did not particularly notice anything in the prisoner's hearing when before the Magistrate—some people can hear at times quicker than others—I cannot say that I ever observed that he was deaf—when I first knew him he was a 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. buss driver—I have been a gentleman, but I lost about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in one year—on 11th or 12th Jan., my heel became nipped with frost—I walked about thirty miles a day during our busy time—that is not why I reside so <hi rend="italic">near</hi> my master—I reside more in the centre of his customers—I have lived in Paddington for the last fifteen years—I have not been in the habit of writing in the prisoner's presence—I saw no woman in the bar when I was there on the 12 th—it must have been on the 12th, because his wife had gone over to a wedding, to give a woman away at Kensington Church—I did not see a charwoman in the bar—there was no one else in the bar during the whole time I was there—I never saw a customer there in my life—there was nobody but the wife there that I saw—I was there perhaps a quarter of an hour—I never made a practice of stopping long—this is my signature to my deposition (<hi rend="italic">this being read, stated</hi>, "I was not in the prisoner's house on 11th, 12th, or 13th Jan.")</p>

Wilkins has been in my service About twenty-one weeks, as traveller—sometimes he has to deliver goods, and occasionally to receive money—he has to make out all bills, and correspond with all parties—he has 200 customers to wait on every week; the prisoner is one—on Saturday, 31st Dec, I received a letter from him, requesting me to send half a gallon of spruce to his brother, at Ramsgate—I cannot see whether this produced is the letter (<hi rend="italic">the witness was partially blind</hi>)—I executed the order on Tuesday, 3rd Jan.—I did not despatch the goods myself; Wilkins has a quarterly salary to discharge those duties—I sent the goods by my porter—I afterwards received the second order, and directed Wilkins to write to Mr. Stupple of Ramsgate, on the 9th, and to send the bill with the note—in consequence of something that was said to me, I went to see the prisoner at Kensington, on Saturday, the 14th, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, but he was not at home—I went again on the following Thursday, the 19th, having made an appointment with Wilkins to meet him there—I saw the prisoner and his wife—he said Wilkins had been there, and attempted to tear the bill—I was going away—I was somewhat disap<lb></lb>pointed at not finding Wilkins stop to see me, and declare his innocence—I said to the prisoner, "When did you pay this bill?"—he said, "On 10th Jan."—I am positive he said the 10th, because of my reply—he showed me the bill on the file, and likewise another which was torn, but my sight is very bad—I said, "When did you pay it to Wilkins? what time in the morning?"—he said, "Between 10 and 11 o'clock"—I said, "Have you received any letter from your brother, at Ramsgate?"—he said, "No"—I said, "It is, very strange; your brother received these goods, and he sent no Answer"—I then said, "I had occasion to send Wilkins this way this morn<lb></lb>ing; surely, he did not betray his trust, and keep this bill out of the letter"—he said, "That's it; we will hang the b—r!"—I said, "He does not lay in your hands; it must be me that must prosecute"—he then produced a bill on a file; he did not take it off—I cannot recognise it—on the follow<lb></lb>ing Sunday the prisoner came to my house, about 11 o'clock; he seemed to manifest great anger—he said Wilkins had told him he had received a great deal of money, or wages; that he, the prisoner, was going to let his house it Kensington, and he should like to take Wilkins's situation—I said, "That requires a great deal of consideration"—I gave Wilkins into custody myself—the prisoner told me he had paid Wilkins 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Wilkins was very lame—he left my house on Tuesday, and generally used to return on Thursday—I did not see him till after the cart started on Friday morning.</p>

I am landlord of the Ship Inn, Ramsgate; the pri<lb></lb>soner is my brother—at the latter end of December, I received half a gallon of ale spice—I did not receive a bill with that—after that I sent am order for two gallons more, which I think I received on the 10th; I do not know the dates exactly—I received a bill by post; similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was in the same name, for the same goods, and the same amount, but I did not notice the date—I think I received it on the morning of the 10th—I think this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I received with the bill—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in my writing, it bears date 10th January—I wrote it to my brother after I had received the goods—I enclosed it with the bill to my brother on the same day, the 10th—I posted it myself between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mariner, residing now at Frederick Place, Limehonse. On 20th Nov. last, I embarked on board the <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi> at Ham<lb></lb>burgh, for London—I had been shipwrecked, and was a Consul passenger returning to London—I went on board About 8 o'clock on Friday night—I did not see the prisoner personally till he was down below, for I could not tell who he was in the dark—I was standing by the gangway a little after 10 o'clock, I think it was, when he came on board—the deceased officer, Thain, came on board by himself—three other gentlemen were behind him, and two porters carrying the luggage—the prisoner came on board after Thain, accompanied by two gentlemen—they all went down to the fore cabin toge<lb></lb>ther—Iafterwards saw the prisoner in the cabin—he then had the handcuffs on his bands—he was sitting without his trousers, and was complaining that the irons were hurting him—that might be about half an hour after seeing him on the gangway, I cannot say exactly—the other men who had accompanied him had not left the vessel; they left after the prisoner had his irons on—we sailed about 5 o'olock the next morning, Saturday—the two gentlemen were standing at the doorway when I saw the prisoner in the private cabin—they were the two gentlemen who accompanied him on board; Thain was in the cabin with the prisoner—I did not see who put on the handcuffs—they were on him at the time I speak of—the officer said if he behaved himself he would treat him as a gentleman—he complained that the irons hurt him, that they were too small for him, and the officer sent for the captain—he said to the prisoner, "I have been warned of you; but I will take them off when we get to England, if you behave yourself"—I heard no more conversation at that time—there were three berths in the cabin—we sailed at 5 o'clock on Saturday morning—on Sunday afternoon, about 4 o'clock, I heard the report of firearms; I was lying down in a berth close to the cabin door, where the prisoner used to stop—on hearing the report I jumped out of the berth; and with my feet I drove in the door of the cabin, in which the prisoner and Thain were—on getting into the cabin it was full of smoke—I saw the prisoner and Thain; the prisoner was sitting on a chest, Thain was standing up, holding on to him with one hand, and with the other on his own breast—he said, "The prisoner has shot me"—I seized hold of the prisoner by his hands and dragged him out of the cabin—Thain came out with him, holding on to one arm, the other he kept on his own breast—I saw blood on his finger ends when he took them out of his breast—on getting outside the cabin door I asked the prisoner where the pistol was—he said it was lying on the chest where he had been sitting—I went back into the cabin and found the pistol where he had said—there was likewise some loose powder scattered on the floor—I asked the prisoner why he had done such a thing—hesaid the officer had broke faith with him; he had not kept his word as a gentleman, and he would shoot him or any other man like a dog who broke faith with him—he said he loaded the pistol alongside of the bed berth where they slept, by holding it up against the side; that he put the powder in by guess; there might have been one charge, or two, or three; but there was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185801040066"></xptr>
               <p>quite enough to kill him—he said nothing further then—he was dragged on deck when that passed—he said he had got the pistol out of the chest he was sitting on; that he bought the pistol in Hamburgh, to shoot a man of the name of Miller who had swindled him out of 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he got the pistol out of the chest by breaking down a brass thing that hung a lamp up—after that he was taken charge of by some of the crew of the vessel, and I had nothing more to do with him—since my return to England I have seen the dead body at Guy's Hospital—it was the body of the same person I saw onboard.</p>

I accompanied Mr. Combe, the Magistrate, on 28th Nov: last, to Guy's Hospital; I there found the officer Thain in bed, wounded; the prisoner was also there—Thain wai sworn; I swore him, in the presence of Mr. Combe—he then made a statement in the presence of the prisoner, which I took down in writing; this is the statement—it was read over in the hearing of the prisoner, and he was asked by the Magistrate if he wished to put my questions to Thain—he said, "No"—Thain signed the statement in my presence and the presence of the Magistrate—(<hi rend="italic">Read;</hi>"Charles Thain saith as follows: I am a City of London detective police officer.

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, residing at Manchester. I was a passenger on board the <hi rend="italic">Caledonia</hi>, from Hamburg to London—I did not see the prisoner and deceased on the Saturday that we sailed—I saw them on the Sunday, they were near the fore cabin—nothing took place between them in my hearing on that occasion—I noticed that the officer was very kind to the prisoner; he inquired if he would take anything, and I thought it was very kind of him—about 4 o'clock that afternoon I saw the officer wounded; about twenty minutes after that I saw the prisoner; he was then on deck, seated upon a cover which covers a portion of the ship in which the cargo is placed—Idid not say anything to him further than apologize for stepping upon him, for it was then dark—I stepped on him and laid, "I beg your pardon, sir."</p>

               <p>and when I heard his voice I knew it was the prisoner—I am not aware that anything more passed then; shortly after he went down into the cabin—I went down immediately after—I asked him if he was aware what he had done—he said he had shot the officer—I said, "Yes you have, you have shot him in the right breast;" he said, "No, it was the left one"—I said, "No, you have shot him in the right one"—he asked me if the balls had gone through and through; I said they had not—he then asked me if I thought the officer would die; I told him I did not think he would—I asked him if there were more balls than one; he said, "Yes, there were two"—I said, "You are guilty of a very rash act; I am very sorry for it"—he said the officer had not kept faith with him; that when he was in Hamburgh he had promised not to iron him, but when he got him on board the ship he put the handcuffs on him; and that he told the officer at that time if he had him one half hour alone what he would do—he said he could not look over it, the officer had broken faith with him, and he would shoot a man like a dog who broke faith with him—he said he had bought the pistol in Hamburgh, to shoot a man who owed him 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he mentioned the gentleman's name, but I cannot remember what it was—he said it was his intention to have taken him in his coach outside the town and to have shot him—he said, "I subsequently suggested that I would take my own life, but the officer came on me rather suddenly, and I told him,'The pistol is as well in your breast as in mine'"—Ibelieve he also said that he was a Deist, a robber, and a murderer; that he had shot the officer, and he supposed he should be tried for it—when I told him that I thought the officer would die, he said he ought to have done, for there was shot sufficient in the pistol.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>, <hi rend="italic">the question had been, whether the attempt to arrest the party at the time of his apprehension was lawful or unlawful, and if unlawful, whether the offence was reduced to man<lb></lb>slaughter; but no case could be found where, after a submission to the taking, the party had recourse to a deadly weapon, from some private motive of com<lb></lb>plaint, and then sought to reduce the offence below murder, by a subsequent objec<lb></lb>tion to the authority under which he was confined; he would suppose the case of a man in gaol on a bad warrant, and that before it was discovered to be bad, a new warrant was forwarded to the gaol; would not that be a new justification to the gaoler for detaining the man? so, supposing the river at Hamburg was not a place within the jurisdiction of the Admiralty, which might be open to some question, yet, as soon as he came on the high seas, the officer would be in an analogous position to the gaoler; in that ease, the prisoner's being a foreigner would make no difference; he was on board a British ship, and therefore subject to British law, and the moment he arrived on the high seas, any person was at liberty to take or detain him, and bring him here to answer to a charge of felony, on the condition that that person, if not an officer duly authorized to act within his jurisdiction, proved the felony to have been in fact committed; it could not be suggested that this was an act done with a view to escape from the detention of the officer, the situation of the parties precluded that; and the inference was thereby strengthened, that the act was one of express malice; the case of Reg. v. Dadson, which had been quoted, went to show, that in any attempt to justify, it must be shown that the parly had a knowledge of his right to resist; now, taking the converse of that, it was a matter to be inquired into, whether the prisoner, at the time he discharged the pistol, possessed any knowledge of the illegality of his detention, for such knowledge must be proved to be present in the mind of the man who sought to avail himself of it. On these grounds he submitted, that the apprehension, if not legal in its inception, became so as soon as the party arrived in the jurisdiction of England; and that, as a private individual, the officer had a right to detain him, and bring him here to answer the charge, having shown the suspicion to be justified, by proof of the felony committed.</hi>

                  </hi>. <hi rend="italic">"I believe we are both agreed upon the course that ought to be pursued in this case; there is very great difficulty about it, because there are two ways of looking at it,—the one, whether the prisoner was in lawful custody at the time the transaction took place; and the other, whether he was in unlawful custody. In my view of the case, considerable difficulty may arise upon that matter; at least, I entertain a doubt about it. My learned brother entertains a stronger opinion on the question than I do; but I believe we are</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">both of opinion that there is a question for the Jury, whether the offence is or is not murder. If the man was in legal custody, any attempt to release himself, which is the most favourable way of putting it, would in itself be an illegal act; and if in the course of that illegal act he killed the officer having him in custody, I apprehend, without reference to what his motives might be, that would be sim<lb></lb>pliciter murder; but assuming that he was not in legal custody, there would be then a question for the Jury whether or not the act which he did in taking away the life of the deceased, was done by him from a motive of revenge and bad feeling towards the man, or from a variety of mixed motives; one of which might be the feeling that he was wrongfully in custody, and that he had been put in irons contrary to the alleged agreement between himself and the officer; whether that state of mind might be induced by a continuous treatment of that kind for forty eight hours. If the Jury believed that the act was committed under feelings and influences of that sort, and they thought that was such a reasonable provo<lb></lb>cation to a man of firm and rational mind as to induce him to do this act, without attributing it to conduct which would be properly considered as indicat<lb></lb>ing malice aforethought, then the offence would be reduced to manslaughter. We were very desirous of having the question of lawful arrest submitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal; but found it impossible so to shape the case as to take the opinion of that Court upon it; therefore, with the concurrence of my learned brother, I propose to deal with the question in the manner in which it was dealt with by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">in his opening, and to take the opinion of the Jury, upon the facts which actually exist, whether this was murder or not; and I am clearly of opinion that there is evidence to go to the Jury, that the prisoner has committed the offence of murder.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I entirely concur thai in the latter view of the case there is evidence upon which the Jury must pronounce whether the prisoner is guilty of murder or only of manslaughter. With reference to the question of lawful custody, considerations of great importance are involved. It appears to me that it must be taken that there is no extradition or treaty with Hamburg; if it existed, it would of course have been produced, because that would have set the matter at rest. The inclination of my mind is to consider that there was a lawful custody, on the ground that an English ship is the same as English land; and if so, the case of S. Scott, 9, Barnewell and Cresswell, goes to show that the custody was lawful, one from which the prisoner had no right to escape, It appears to me that in that view of the case, it was material to prove that the felony had been committed; otherwise it would have been open to</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">to contend that no felony had been proved. It is unnecessary that I should say more on that view of the case, because I entirely concur with my brother</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MARTIN</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">as to the extreme difficulty of bringing this matter properly before the Court of Appeal. It is a question upon which the Jury must pronounce (treating the custody as lawful or unlawful) whether the act was an act of murder or not. The case is now within their province, and I entirely concur in the course proposed to be taken.</hi>

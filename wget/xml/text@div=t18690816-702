                  </hi>. I am a woollen agent, carrying on busi<lb></lb>ness at 9 1/2, Noble Street, City—I am agent, amongst others, for Messrs. Baincs and Hurst, of Leeds—I became acquainted with the defendant, about 1st December, 1868, through a man named Salkeld—Salkeld brought me the first order for goods, and I called on the defendant to ask him for references, at 4, Great Winchester Street—I also saw Joseph Hughes there, and one or two clerks—the defendant gave me references to Mr. Hughes, of Millwall Iron Works, and Owen Ford &amp;Co., of Bishopsgate—he told me he had an order for J. A. Gray &amp;Co., of Canterbury, New Zealand, for these goods—I asked him what his capital was—he said, "3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—this was all in the presence of Joseph Hughes; he was always present at every conversation I had with Webster—I have no doubt he took part in the conversation; in fact, I am sure he did—after that I executed the order for the goods, amounting to 94<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—before executing it I had been to the referees—I</p>

               <p>went to Millwall, but did not see Mr. Hughes; he was stated to be in Russia—I saw his clerk—I also went to Owen Ford &amp; Co., but could not see either Owen or Ford—I left my card, and told them what I wanted, and I had a written reference the next morning—I have not got it here, I sent it down to Yorkshire—I executed that order, and got paid for it—I executed it on the strength of the references, and also that the goods were going to J. A. Gray &amp; Co., who were stated to be very substantial persons; in fact, the order was given as for J. A. Gray &amp; Co.—on 14th December, those goods were sent from Leeds—on 16th December I received a second order, amounting to 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the order—I saw both the prisoner and Hughes on that day—Joseph Hughes wrote the order, in Webster's presence—Hughes did not, on that occasion, say for whom the goods were; he had told me that all fabrics that they ever bought were for Gray &amp; Co., of Canterbury—that order was ultimately executed; the goods left Leeds on 26th January, and were delivered to Smiths', the packers, in Camomile Street—from what I saw in the newspapers, I wrote to Webster about Hughes, of Millwall, and I received this letter in reply—I do not know Webster's writing—(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner stating that the signature to the letter was hit, it was read as follow:</hi> "7th January, 1868. 4, Great Winchester Street, Old Broad Street, London, E.C. Merchants and Shippers. John Webster &amp; Co., London Agents for J. A. Gray &amp; Co., Canterbury, New Zealand. Dear sir, Your favour of this morning we beg to acknowledge, and say, in reply, that the report alluded to by your friends, in the matter of the Millwall Shipbuilding Company, is entirely distinct from the Millwall Rolling Mills, of which Mr. Hughes is the head, and we wish you to convey this to your friends.")—I received this letter, signed "J. B. Hughes" (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I should say the signature is the same handwriting as the orders they gave me—in consequence of that letter, I sent goods to Messrs. Smith, the packers (<hi rend="italic">This was from J. Webster &amp; Co., per pro W. Hughes, dated 22nd January,</hi> 1869, <hi rend="italic">directing the goods ordered to be sent to Smiths', the packers</hi>)—Hughes had told me distinctly, the first time, that they bought no fabrics except what were for Gray &amp; Co.—he did not say so specially with reference to those goods—the goods were sent from Leeds to Smiths'—those goods have not been paid for; they were to have been paid for in a month—I made application for the money, in the first place to Joseph Hughes; Mr. Webster was stated to be away, ill—he afterward wrote to me, and I called on him, I think, some time in March—I did not get my money—I executed a third order—at the time I did so I under-stood the second order had been paid for—the amount of the third order was 158<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Joseph Hughes wrote that order, professedly from a letter he had in his hand from Gray &amp; Co.—he gave me the order person-ally—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; it is dated March 4th, 1869—Hughes distinctly said those goods were for (tray &amp; Co., of Canterbury—they were what we term black union cloths—those goods were sent to Messrs. Smith, the packers—the first order that was given to me was for the same manu<lb></lb>facturer that executed the third order—at the time I executed that order, I was under the belief that the goods were to go to J. A. Gray &amp; Co., of Canterbury—there was a special time named for the delivery of these goods, "To catch a certain ship, and they must be in London on 8th March"—289<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would be about the amount due to me—I did not go to the referees after the first time—I have since been, on one occasion, to Ethel<lb></lb>burga House, where Owen Ford &amp; Co. carried on business; that was the</p>

               <p>day after I heard that Webster had absconded, not later than that—I believe it was the first week in May, and I believe on the Monday after Webster was reported to have absconded on the Saturday—the last time I went to Webster's place was on the Friday previous to his, absconding; I can't give you the date—I did not find him there, the warehouse was locked up—when I went to Owen Ford &amp; Co.'s, on the Monday, I saw the man there representing himself to be Ford.</p>

De Vecchi. Navone &amp; Co.—I did not say I was glad of it, for that Japan was a better market than New Zealand—I will swear that—I said probably it might be a good market—I believed it was, and that it would realize a profit; but they were not sold to be sent to Japan—I should not have trusted Webster if I had thought he had to find a market for his goods—they were not sent on speculation—perhaps parties do send out goods on speculation, but I was not sufficiently satisfied with Webster's amount of capital for that—if they had sold better at Japan than at New Zealand it would have made no difference to me, if I was paid the money; but there was the false pretence, that they were bought to go to Gray &amp; Co.—I said I believed Japan was a good market—I did not say I was glad they were sent there, nothing of the sort—I did not say it was a better market than Canterbury—I am paid by commission—I have no idea what profit these kind of goods would make in a good market—I should say not twenty or thirty per cent, nor twenty—in the ordinary course, goods of this sort, destined for foreign markets, are sent to packers like Smith.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a partner in the firm of Parkington &amp; Co., champagne and claret shippers, of John Street, Crutched Friars—in January last, I received a note from Webster &amp; Co., inquiring prices; in consequence of that I called on 28th January at No. 4, Great Winchester Street—I there saw the prisoner and Hughes—I was introduced to Hughes by the prisoner—I mentioned the fact of my having received the letter—I forget whether I took it with me—a general conversation took place—I told them I had not any wine at the price they wanted, but I could sell them wine at a higher price, which I quoted—they talked together with myself, and said they had orders to send wine to Australia, they did not know that they were limited to price, but they would be glad to see my wines if I would let them have samples—in the course of conversation I asked what business they were carrying on, and they told me they were merchants,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186908160006"></xptr>
               <p>general merchants, I think—I don't know whether the word "genera" was used, but that was what I understood them to say—they said they were not in the wine trade, but they had received orders from some of their friends, or constituents, I forget which word they used, in the Colonies, to send them wine—I asked for references—they gave me Messrs. Owen Ford &amp; Co., of Ethelburga House, Bishopsgate Street—I went there and found that name up—I saw a person, I can't tell you his name, I understood he was one of the partners—I received a very satisfactory reply to my inquiries—in consequence of that reference I furnished the wine—this is the order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is dated February 20th, for seventy-five dozen of 56 champagne, at 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen at Epernay—the "56" probably refers to the year of the vintage—I received this note, dated 9th March, it is simply an inquiry when the champagne will be ready—I think it refers to some subsequent order which we did not execute—it is on one of Webster's lithograph headings—I don't know in whose writing—[<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. INOAMKLLS</hi>. I believe this to be in Hugheb' handwriting]—We ordered the wine from Epernay, and on its arrival in bond we shipped it on board the ship we were directed to do by Webster &amp; Co.—we imported the wine direct from Epernay—the shipping order came in this letter, and we lodged the wine to that order—it was sent to the dock—I don't know it of my own knowledge—I saw the prisoner subsequently on several occasions—I don't recollect any particular conversation about the wine—I have no doubt it was alluded to many times, that it was shipped, because a further order was given—I can swear that I told him the wine was gone, and he said he was glad to know that the thing was on its way—I received these papers.</p>

I am a partner in the firm of Moses, Levy &amp; Co., we are Australian merchants—we received a letter from Webster &amp; Co. asking for a return of prices, in consequence of which our traveller went there—I saw the prisoner after some goods had been supplied—in consequence of what our traveller said, and in consequence of the references and inquiries we made, wo let him have the goods; they were shirts, and a variety of goods; I think the total amount was something like 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the prisoner, I think it was about the end of April—I asked him what had become of the goods; that we were not satisfied; we had heard rumours; we asked him if he had shipped them, and where to, and if so where were the bills of lading—he refused to give us any information; my partner was present—we taxed him with having pawned the bills of lading, or taken money upon them, he refused to give any information; he said, if he had, it was what a great many other houses did—(I had previously seen Hughes)—the prisoner said that Hughes had gone to Paris, I think he said to make purchases—he said Hughes was his clerk, at a salary of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—that was in conse<lb></lb>quence of our having asked him if Hughes was his partner; he said, "Hughes is not my partner, he is my clerk; I pay him 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year"—we asked him if he would show us his cash-book or banker's-book, to give us some evidence of fair dealing in this matter, as it appeared to us he was not acting fairly—he declined to do anything of the sort—we asked him where he lived, and he declined to state—upon that we took out a summons—I went to Ethelburga House the same day we had this conversation; I found some persons there, I don't know who they were, representing Ford &amp; Co., in pos-session of their books—we saw some books, and we saw their ledger account—I went to Mr. Hails, I can't say whether it was before or after I saw the prisoner; I think it was afterwards—I did not sec any of our goods.</p>

John Webster &amp; Co.")—Between the 8th and the 12th I saw the prisoner—I told him I thought it would be advisable for him to pay cash at 5 per cent, as our firm would like that much better—he said that on account of the nature of the business the returns were not coming round so quickly, and they could not pay cash—ho said he could pay by a four months' bill—he said the goods were to be sent to Canterbury, New Zealand, and asked if they were suitable for those markets; I said, "Yes"—he said he wanted them for Canterbury, and likewise for Melbourne, Victoria—I applied to him for references, and he gave me Owen Ford, of Ethel<lb></lb>burga House, and McFarlane, of Langbourn Chambers, Fenchurch Street—Hughes was present at this conversation; Webster gave Hughes a card, and Hughes wrote the names of the referees on the back of their own card; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and this is the order for the 100 dozen striped jean shirts which we executed; we had a written order to deliver them to Smith &amp; Co., the packers, in Wormwood Street, where we sent them—on loth, I think, I again saw Webster and Hughes at their office, they then gave me this order</p>

I am a merchant, in Fenchurch Street—I have known the prisoner for some time—I believe, when I first knew him, his place of business was at Ethelburga House, Bishopsgate—I knew there was such a firm as Owen Ford &amp; Co.; they had offices, I believe, on the same premises—I am not quite sure when I first knew the prisoner in Great Winchester Street; I rather think it is some four or five months since I first heard of their being there—I had done business with him when he was at Ethelburga House—I don't recollect when the last was—in the early part of April, this year, a man named Hughes called upon me—he referred to an intended shipment they were making, of shirts, to Australia, and spoke to us relative to advances—I don't think he told me at that time where the goods came from; I think we knew before we advanced any money—he brought the invoice, it amounted to 148<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and was for three bales of shirts from Moses, Levy &amp;Co.—the entire amount I advanced was 101<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., including charges; the amount in cash was 87<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that ad<lb></lb>vance was made on 125 dozen shirts, to be forwarded by the <hi rend="italic">Swiftsure</hi>—62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of that advance was made by cheque, and 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in cash, not by cheque—I have here a cheque for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 5th April, but I think that refers to another transaction. [<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WALLIS</hi>. The endorsements on these cheques are both in Webster's handwriting.] I rather think both those cheques were given to Hughes—I obtained the bills of lading, and shipped those goods to some person at Melbourne; not in my own name: the bills of lading were made out in our own name, but they were shipped as from Webster &amp; Co.—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill of lading referring to those goods—on 20th April I advanced other moneys on goods—I rather think I saw Hughes on that occasion—I may have seen Webster during the course of the proceeding, but, I think, finally I saw Hughes—those goods were two cases of clothing, and one of shirts—before making the advance we saw an invoice—I am not sure whether it was an original one, this is a copy of it—the amount of it is 161<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; there is no date on it, but the transaction occurred on 28th April—I advanced on that 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I see this was the transac<lb></lb>tion in which 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in cash, and 67<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. was paid by cheque—Hughes came to us and represented that Mr. Webster was away ill, and he was in urgent want of cash.

Solomon &amp; Co., of Melbourne, were the consignees of these goods—Myers &amp; Son were our Sydney agents; they were both our correspondents—Messrs. Frinneby's ten cases of brushes were not included in that advance; I advanced upon those in February last; they were also taken in conjunction with another invoice of goods and com<lb></lb>bined in the same bill of lading; the gross amount advanced in that case was 117<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the other goods were three bales of canvas, the grow amount of the invoices upon which that advance was made was 193<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the advance, exclusive of charges, was 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 174<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. advanced on the 308<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. invoices included charges—it was 147<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; without charges—the charges were amounts paid out for Webster &amp; Co., insurance, and other things, which they would have to pay—we saw the original invoices or copies before advancing the money—I rather think we saw Mr. Frinneby's invoices—the brushes were sent to Melbourne, to Mr. Davis; he is also a correspondent of ours—they were sent from the East India Dock—I believe we advanced money on goods in the same way when Webster was at Ethel<lb></lb>burga House—I have never had an opportunity of rendering him an account sale of the goods, a sufficient time has not elapsed; this last week only we first got definite returns upon one transaction, which was the very first—we have had no account of any of the goods in June—the account we received last week does not refer to any of the goods that have been in question here—I never saw Joseph Hughes at Ethelburga House; I was never there myself, but I saw him during the time they were in business at Ethelburga House—he interfered in some of the transactions upon which I advanced money while Webster was at Ethelburga House.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). An account was opened with the Imperial Bank by John Webster &amp; Co., of 4, Great Winchester Street—I knew nothing of them at Ethelburga House—they opened the account with us on 7th December last—I have it here in the books (<hi rend="italic">refering</hi>)—it opened with go.—their largest balance was 174<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 10th February—on 26th December it was overdrawn 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this acceptance for 124<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 23rd. December (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), is Webster's writing—that was dishonoured, as there were not sufficient assets—it is payable at one month—on 12th March their balance was 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the commencement of the day, at the close it was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there is nothing to their account now—during Marsh, April, and May, documents were presented for payment and not paid—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an acceptance of Webster's for 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that was presented and paid on 2nd February—on 18th March their balance was 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but that was paid away again the same day—after that there was no balance, with the exception of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which has been written off for commission.</p>

I took the prisoner into custody on 15th May, between 9 and 10 in the evening, in Burdett Road, Stepney—he was in a pawnbroker's shop there, tendering a dressing case in pledge—I said, "Is your name Webster?"—he said, "No, my name is Morton"—I said, "No, your name is Webster, and you are wanted on a warrant in the City, for obtaining goods by false pretences, and in that name I shall take you—he said, "No, my name is Morton."</p>

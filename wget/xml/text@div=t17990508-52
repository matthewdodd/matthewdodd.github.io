               <p>Q. Who assisted to get it from the cart to the warehouse? - A. Smith's man and boy, and two men belonging to Kennet's wharf; I went up to the warehouse, and saw it weighed; there was Smith's man and boy, and me and Allen, and just as the last draft was in the scale but one, Mr. Smith came in; Mr. Smith's man put it down with chalk upon the wall, and Mr. Smith reckoned it up, two thousand six hundred weight of it.</p>

No, only about eighteen shillings that I received for this transaction; I told Mr. Smith there was more money coming than that; I said, Mr. Smith, I have called for that trifle that is left standing behind, and Mr. Smith pulled out a half-guinea, a seven-shilling-piece, and a sixpence; Mr. Smith said, Brandall had had a bottle or two of wine, and a ham, and then I took the eighteen shillings and came away; it might be three weeks.</p>

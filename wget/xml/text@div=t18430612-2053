                  </hi>. I am an appraiser, and live in St. Mark's-road, Kenning<lb></lb>ton. In September last year I saw the prisoner—he ascertained my name from me, and delivered this card to me—we had some ale together—nothing particular occurred then—I saw him again on the 10th of October—I met him in the street—he asked if my name was James Callow—I said, "Yes"—he asked if I had a brother abroad—I said yes, and his name was John Callow—he then said there was money in Chancery, left by a John Callow abroad, to James Callow, and he had searched all about, but could not find James Callow till he found me, and he was sure it was right; it was up in Chancery, and by the side of the account of the money it was said, "Foreign"—he said, "You was advertised in Kingsland-road," which was where I had lived—he said he could get it for me—I saw him again, I think, the next night—he then said for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. he would file affidavits in the Court of Chancery, to make applica<lb></lb>tion—I gave him five half-crowns, to the best of my memory, and he gave me this receipt—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw him write it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Received of Mr. Cal<lb></lb>low, Oct. 11, 1842, the sum of 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for filing affidavits on application made to the Lord Chancellor.

Horne—I have thoroughly searched and inquired, with an attorney, at the Chancery courts, and find no account of any proceedings, or any death of my brother advertised, or anything of that sort—I went with the attorney to search—(<hi rend="italic">The paper purporting to be the order was here read; it was addressed by Blake to the prisoner, and informed him that property to the amount of </hi>4000<hi rend="italic">l. was left by John Callow, of Vermont, United States; that the applicant, James Callow, was his rightful heir, and directing him to take out letters of administration, upon which the Court would grant him an injunction.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bricklayer and oven-builder, and live in Harriet-street, Lambeth. I have known the prisoner twenty-five years—I saw him in November last—he was making inquiries for me—he said there was money left for me in the unclaimed dividends; that he had seen my name on the list; that he should have passed it over; as he had done many more; but knowing me so well, and so many years, he thought it must be me, at he knew of no other Robert Bingham, of Lambeth Marsh, but me—on the 24th of Jan. I wrote to him—on the morning of the 25th he came, showed me some pieces of parchment and papers that he was doing business for other people; and he said they were similar to what I was to receive—he said, he was going to the Court of Chancery, where he would file an application, that it would cost him 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and on his return he produced a piece of parch<lb></lb>ment similar to the one he produced in the morning—it had my name and address on it, and some other writing besides—I scarcely looked at it—he said he had paid 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it, for applying to the Court of Chancery—I had told him before that if he brought me the paper I would pay him the money—I gave him a half-sovereign and half-a-crown, believing his statement, that he had paid it for my benefit—I asked him for a receipt, and this is the one he gave—I saw him again a few days after—he said he was going to present my petition, which would cost 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, it was not in my power to pay, it must rest a little while—I had but 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I gave him—he said, "Your business shall not be at a stand-still for the want of 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I will lend you 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for a fortnight"—he said the petition must be signed by some person that knew me for many years—I hesitated, to thiok of some old neighbour, and he said, "I can do it myself, I have known you many years," and he signed it for me—he went away, at I thought, to present this petition—he called again, and said my business was getting on very well; that I had Sir William Home, one of the oldest Masters in Chancery, to do my business for me—because I should not forget the name, I wrote it down on a card which the prisoner had given me of his address—this is it—he likewise informed me, one day when he came, that the property was near Oakingham, near Reading, that it was three times advertised, and was left in the unclaimed dividends—he took me to the Writ-office in Lincoln's Inn-square, to search the books for my name, and I felt surprised it was not there—he said, it was all the better, for if any one had put in a claim against me, my name would have been there—I have since discovered that that office has nothing to do with the Court of Chancery.</p>

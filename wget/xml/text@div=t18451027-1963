                  </hi>. I am a clock maker, in partnership with my brother, and live in Leman-street, Goodman's-fields. On the 28th of Sept. the prisoner came to my shop, with two other men and a woman—they asked the price of some clocks which were hanging in the shop—they were all four together—no clock was bought—they all went out together—I missed a time-piece before they went out—I followed them, and directly they got outside the door, I saw one of the men put the time-piece into the pri<lb></lb>soner's pocket—I seized the prisoner directly, and called for assistance—Mr. Samuels came, and I gave the prisoner to him—we took him into a passage, got a policeman, and gave him in charge.</p>

I hap<lb></lb>pened to be opposite the prosecutor's house on this Saturday, about twelve o'clock—Mr. Berger called me, and I went to his assistance—I saw the prisoner in his custody—he asked me to hold him while he fetched a police-man—the prisoner was resisting, and trying to throw Mr. Berger—I saw him fumbling about his coat pocket, and saw a watch-key hanging from it by a piece of string—I thrust my hand in, and pulled out this time-piece, and said, "You are a nice fellow to do this"—he said, "I know nothing of it, the woman took it; why not take the woman? I was standing at the window, when a man rushed out and thrust it into my pocket"—I held him—he tried to throw me—I pushed him into a passage, closed the door, and held him till the policeman came, when I handed him over, with the time-piece.</p>

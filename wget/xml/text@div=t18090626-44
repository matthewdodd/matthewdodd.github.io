            . I am a shorer at Billingsgate; I work for Mr. Creswell. I was at work in this month, I cannot recollect the day of the month; there was an alarm that there were some lobsters taken out of the boat; I was ordered to stop the prisoner, he was coming from the King of Prussia; I stopped him, and seeing the lobster's claw through the hole of the coat; I told him that he had got something that did not belong to him; he said it was nothing to me, they did belong to him; I told him he should not have the property. I knew there were no other lobsters there but my master's. He made a great deal of altercation, said that he should keep them; he knew a great deal more about it than I did; he got on the ladder; I hove my basket of lobsters on my head and followed him; I laid hold of him at the top of the ladder, told him he should not have the property, otherwise he must go up to Mr. Creswell and explain how he came by them; he said he would do so. I went on with the load on my head, our house is No. 3, and just as I got to No. 4, somebody halloaed out he is run away. I put the basket of lobsters down in the middle of the market and pursued him into the Darkhouse, Darkhouse-lane; I there told him to give me the property and go about his business; he would not. He put the coat with the lobsters in it on the seat and set on it; he told me I should not have it. I took the coat and lobsters from him by force, told him if he followed me it should be the worse for him; however he followed me to Mr. Creswell's house; he was then given into the hands of the constable.</p>
               <p>The coat produced and identified.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel; called six witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

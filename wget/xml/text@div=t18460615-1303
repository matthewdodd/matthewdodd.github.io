                  </hi>. I have one partner—we live at No. 38, Gutter-lane, Cheapside—the prisoner was in our service as a traveller—he was discharged on the 18th of Feb.—I had not missed anything myself when he was dis<lb></lb>charged, but I understood there had been some cambric missed on the 14th of Feb.—I did not know that when I discharged him—I keep a selling-boot:, in which entries are made of the sales of stock—on missing the cambric, the stock was taken all over again—I think that was on the day after the pri<lb></lb>soner left—it was taken by Hayter and Atkinson—a list was given to me of what was missing, amounting to 49<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I afterwards caused George</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184606150082"></xptr>
               <p>Hayter, in consequence of something I heard from him, to purchase some cambric of the prisoner, who I understood had then become a partner with Mr. Murray, as commission agents, in Paternoster-row—the cambric was sent to us by Mr. Hayter, who had been in our employ, but was then in business—on the stock-taking at the end of Dec. we had two pieces of demi'-French cambric, No. 8286, and marked 46 in selling characters—it is the custom in France, I understand, to divide the cambric into demi's before they are sent to this country—sometimes the pieces run longer than two demi's, and then the remnant is torn off, and the piece divided—I examined the cambric brought to me by Hayter, and the remaining cambric in my stock—I compared a piece of cambric I had, No. 8286, with a piece found in possession of the prisoner—in my judgment they had been one piece—I made a com<lb></lb>parison between the remaining stock of our cambric handkerchiefs and some handkerchiefs purchased by Hayter, and brought to me—to the best of my belief, they had once been one—this is the demi'-cambric I had, No. 8286, and this is the cambric I got from the prisoner—they are manufactured in a length of from fifteen to sixteen yards and a half, and after cutting off the odd measure, they are then torn in half and called demi's, and the handkerchiefs the same—I saw the prisoner—I think it was on the 28th of May—ft wu after I had called in the assistance of Forrester—the prisoner came to our counting-house—he said, "This is a very unpleasant affair about the cam<lb></lb>brics"—I said I was ready to hear anything he had to say—he said that be bought them of a man named St. Croix, a little Frenchman, with a tuft on his chin, introduced to him by Mr. Bissori, of Jersey—I requested Mr. Leary to take down in writing what the prisoner said—Mr. Leary was in the counting-house—there was merely a glass between him and the prisoner—the door was open, but whether the prisoner saw Mr. Leary or not, I do not know—I think the prisoner said that the bargain for these goods was made at Kennan's hotel, or the transaction took place there—he said he bad an invoice of them, and he thought he could find it—he said it was made out in pencil, in French—I think he described it about the size of bis hand—he said if I would walk over to his place, he would endeavour to show me the invoice, or a copy of it in a book—I went over with him to his warehouse—I think he looked in his desk first of all for the invoice—he said he could not find it—he opened a book, and showed me the invoice in the book—I looked at it—it did not satisfy my mind—I came out—I went back again in about twenty minutes, with Mr. Leary—I did not find the prisoner there—I came out and met him at the corner of St. Paul's-churchyard—I went back with him to his warehouse—I asked him if he would show me the receipt for the money—he looked for the receipt, and could not lay his hand upon it—he said he had paid Mr. St. Croix 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, less ten per cent.—or whether the ten per cent, left the 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd, I do not know—I cannot identify the other goods Mr. Hayter bought of the prisoner, with the certainty that I can these before me—I never knew a person named St. Croix.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184606150083"></xptr>
               <p>whether he mentioned the sum of 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or only pointed to the book—Mr. James is my partner—I am not aware that he is here—he takes a part in the business—I do not think I ever saw him sell, unless it was to a private friend—we sell different articles to private friends—we should make no difference in selling to them and to another person—we had nine or ten persons in our employ from Jan. to Feb. the 18th, when the prisoner left—they had equal access to our stock—I do not think any of them had been dismissed——the prisoner came in Sept.—he was to have three months' notice previous to leaving—I paid him to the 1st of March—the time would have been up on the 11th of March—when we took stock on the 1st of Jan. we had 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 17,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. stock—we had the prisoner from Mr. Chippendale, at Manchester—when he left us I heard he was looking out for a situation—a card was one day shown to me—I was asked if I knew that firm, and I smiled—I suppose that was shortly after he commenced business, but it was so small a thing I did not notice—my suspicions were excited about three days after the prisoner left, and I had a doubt of his honesty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, at least three or four weeks after ho left you, give him a most excellent character for honesty? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember giving him any character—I wrote a friendly letter to Mr. Bisson—I do not think it was anything about character—I mentioned in it that Sharpe had left us on the most friendly terms—I did not at that time know that he was going to start in business—I think he had not commenced business then—Edward Hayter brought me this particular piece of cambric, by which I am able to identify this other demi'—from the commencement to the conclusion I depended on him—he has been several years in our employ—I never had any suspicion of him in my life—I believe he is a most honest young man—there was another person who helped to take stock—George Hayter is carrying on business on good terms with us—I requested him to purchase these goods, that I might have an opportunity of examining them—I suspected they were stolen, and employed him to get them from the prisoner—I should think it was about the 26th of Feb. I called in the assistance of Forrester—I saw Mr. Bisson, in Jersey, on the Thursday before the prisoner was brought up—I did not tell him that the prisoner had been robbing me—I was very distant in what I said—Mr. Bisson came to London, I think, on the Wednesday following, and on that day I took him to my house in the evening—I said to him, "You had better not be going to Kennan's to be plagued by Sharpe's friends"—I thought Sharpe's friends would endeavour to prevent him from coming for<lb></lb>ward—I believe Mr. Bisson to be a respectable man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you recommend him strongly not to dine with Sharpe, and say he might be poisoned? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said I had heard of such a thing as opium or laudanum being put in drink—he said, "I will take care of that, I will drink nothing but bottled stout"—I believe 1 said if he took that he had better draw it himself, or see it drawn—I thought the prisoner might drug him—I have heard of such things—not poison him, but make him stupid on the day of examination—on the second examination he dined with the prisoner—on the Wednesday of the first examination he went to my house—there has been a difference in the duty on cambric lately—I cannot say on what day it came into operation, but it is since Jan. last—it might make a little difference in the price of cambrics—I believe I had this piece, No. 8286, in my stock since 1844.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the day of examination did Mr. Bisson appear with his head clear, and not muddled? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—he was sober—he was examined—I heard him state that he dined with Mr. Sharpe—Mr. Bisson</p>

               <p>had been a customer of mine since Sept.—I had before this offered him the usual civility due to a customer, and taken him to my house—I went to Jersey, and saw Mr. Bisson there—he said that he offered some cambrics to Mr. Nash at Cooper's—I asked him, first of all, if he introduced any Frenchman to Sharpe the last time he was in town—he said, "No"—I asked if he introduced him to any person named St. Croix—he said, "No"—I asked if he were present when Sharpe bought any cambrics, when he was last in town—he said, "No"—I parted with the prisoner good friends—we shook hands—I made some communication about him after he left—I think that was after my suspicions had been excited.</p>

                  </hi>. I was formerly in the prosecutor's employ, I now carry on business of my own at No. 49, Bow-lane. In consequence of a request made to me by the prosecutor, I became a purchaser of these goods of the prisoner—I saw the prisoner on the subject on the 22nd of May, at his own places—he said these were some samples left for him to sell, by Mr. St. Croix—that they were twenty or thirty per cent, under the regular prices—I said if they were so cheap as that, I thought I could sell them for him if be would allow roe to have samples of them—on looking at them they appeared to me to be cheap, and it was arranged that I was to call the next day for samples—I went next day, and received fourteen pieces of cambric and handkerchief together—he said Mr. Murray had made arrangements with Mr. St. Croix, from whom they expected to get an assignment of French waistcoating—I asked for the invoice—he said his card which he gave me was sufficient—he had given me a card with the memorandum of them—he asked me to whom I should sell—I said to the retail trade—he asked me if I could sell them for cash—I told him all my transactions were cash at the end of a month, at two and a-half per cent.—I took the cambrics to my own warehouse, and left them, and I went to Mr. Lewis—the prisoner came there, and beckoned me out—I found he had a person with him—we all three went to my warehouse, and the person with the prisoner bought one of the pieces—I then told the prisoner I did not think the goods were so cheap as he had represented, and in consequence of that he lowered the price of some of them from 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 48<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and from 55<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 52<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said if I could sell them for cash he would make a further deduction of five per cent.—on the 29th of May the prisoner came to my warehouse—he said it was an unpleasant business we bad got into—I said it was all right as far as I was concerned, I could show where I bought them—He said O yes, he could clear me, and show where he got them—he said he had bought them of a person he met at Kennan's, and previous to buying them, he had samples sent to Mr. Tilly's, in Friday-street—I said it was a different statement to what he had said before—he said it was unfortunate it was different—I believe that was all that passed.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an officer of the Mansion-house. In conse<lb></lb>quence of information I went to the prisoner's warehouse—I found him there, and told him I came about some cambric and cambric handkerchiefs, that had been taken from Mr. Lewis's premises, and I understood he had sold them to Mr. Hayter—I asked if he would be kind enough to tell me where he got them from—he said he would give every information—he then stated that he bought them of Mr. St. Croix, introduced to him by a gentleman of the name of Bisson, living at Jersey—I asked if he had a bill of parcels—he said be bad one, but it was written in pencil, and partly in French—he looked about for the bill but could not find it—he then said he thought he should be able to find it, but Mr. Bisson was present when he bought the articles—he said Mr. St. Croix was a Frenchman, and he thought he was agent to some French bouse—he did not tell me where he purchased these things of the Frenchman—I supposed he bought them in his own place—he said Mr. Bisson and the Frenchman were stopping at Mr. Kennan's in Cheapside—he said, "Had 1 not better see Mr. Lewis?"—I said, "That is as you please," and I believe he went there.</p>

On the 28th of May I accompanied Forrester to the prisoner's warehouse, in Paternoster row—I took a memorandum of what the prisoner said—he said he purchased the things of Mr. St. Croix, who was a friend of, and introduced to him by, Mr. Bisson; that they were stopping at the time at Mr. Kennan's Hotel, in Crown-court, Cheapside—he said it was about the 14th, or the middle of April—that the invoice was made out in French, and pencil, and Mr. St. Croix said he was agent to a French house, and could supply him with that sort of goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at Mr. Lewis's warehouse on the 28th of May, when the prisoner called—I took a note of what passed—the substance of it was, that he bought three or four pieces of Cambric and some handker<lb></lb>chiefs of a man named St. Croix, who had been introduced to him by Mr. Bisson; that he believed them to be sample-pieces showing about town; that he had paid St. Croix 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them; that Bisson was present when he bought them, and he believed it to be a straightforward transaction; that St. Croix cut off" the tickets, and put them into his waistcoat pocket, having first entered them in a book.</p>

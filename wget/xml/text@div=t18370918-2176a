                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and live in Webber-street, West minster-road. The prisoner worked for me as journeyman nearly two years—he rented an apartment in my house—the principal he did was looking-glass work; I took some heavier work to do, and he left of his own accord—about two months afterwards I saw some work of mine at Mr. Helsden's, and knew it—this is it—it is in an unfinished state—I had two pairs of these pillars turned as long ago as November twelve months—this one has been altered since it was stolen, but it corresponds with this other one which I have, and they are badly done—I reprimanded my apprentice for doing this bad work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carver and gilder, and live at Newington Causeway. These frames were found in my possession—the prisoner called with one of them on the 18th of August, and stated that I should have that and three more, and two less, at a price—I agreed to purchase them—he</p>

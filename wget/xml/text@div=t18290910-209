            . I am a Police-officer. On the 25th of July I went to the prisoner's house with a search-warrant; she is a kind of marine-store dealer, in Hackney-road; I found these pails up stairs; she said she bought them - I asked her for her book of the entry; she gave me one book, and I said, "It is not in this;" she said, "I have another, which my brother puts down things in, as I can't write myself:" I took her to the office, and soon after another book was brought, which had them entered; she said she had bought them some time, but she did not say of whom; she did not tell me the price, nor whether she bought them of a man, woman, or child.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I told the officer I bought them in an honourable way, gave 7s. for them, and exposed them at my door; one of the witnesses came and bought them, and gave me a deposit of a shilling, which induced me to take them in.</p>

I went into the prisoner's house to ask if she had any chairs to mend - I cannot tell the month, but it was on a Tuesday; I saw her give 7s. for these pails - she bought them of a tall man, in a drab coat; she gave him two half-crowns and two shillings - she called me to do some chairs, and offered me ninepence a piece to do them; I said I could not do them under a shilling.</p>

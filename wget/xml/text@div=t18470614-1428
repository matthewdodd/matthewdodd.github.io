On Thursday morning, the 27th of May, I saw Whiren against Mr. Fordham's house for about five minutes—Tubbs then came to the house to work, at the usual time, with a bag under his arm—he went in, and in a short time I saw Whiren come again, and look in at the window, then wait at the corner of Hatton-wall till the door was opened—he then went to the step of the door, and took three reams of cartridge paper from Tubs, and walk off—I went and asked him how far he had brought it—he said out of Holborn—I asked where he was going to take it—he said he did not know, he was a stranger in London, some man gave him a penny to carry it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a glass-paper manufacturer, at No. 55, Hatton-garden, and am in partnership with my father, Isaac Fordham, Tubbs has been in our service four or five months—I gave instructions to Greenard to watch him—it was Tubbs' duty to be at our place at half-past eight o'clock in the morning, with the other boys; but he has generally been there before time, and opened the warehouse—on this morning, the 27th of May, I was watching with the policeman in a public-house—we were both sitting together—I had not seen Whiren before that morning—Tubbs came, and brought this bag that the paper is in now, under his arm—this paper was under our warehouse, down a ten paper is in now, under his to fetch it up from there—it weights 3qrs. 12lbs.—Whiren came to the rails of our house, whistled, looked over the rails, saw the blinds were not drawn up, went away for a short time, and then returned—Tubbs went into the warehouse, and began sweeping as usual—he brought the broom out at the door two or three times, to look if any persons were about—he went in again, and then Whiren went to the warehouse, looked in, and walked away again—Tubbs then came, beckoned to him, and gave him the paper—the policeman followed Whires with the paper—I went to Tubbs, but I saw Whiren taken—he was not out of sight—I know this paper—it is mine and my father's—it was safe about a quarter of an hour before Tubbs came—there was paper in the warehouse, but if they had taken that it would have left a gap—my father was on the floor up stairs.</p>

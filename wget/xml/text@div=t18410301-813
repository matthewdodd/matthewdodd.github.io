                  </hi>. I am a labourer, and work for Mr. Ramsay. On the 8th of February I received four half-crowns from my master—I paid some away, and had two half-crowns, sixpence, and some halfpence left—the prisoners were in the Angel public-house, where I went to have a pint of beer—I merely knew them by sight—they sat by me—I went to sleep—I am sure my money was in my side-pocket—I was asleep about a quarter of an hour—when I awoke the prisoners were gone—I found my pocket cut, and the money taken away—next night I saw Purdy at the Britannia public-house, and said, "You are the person I have been looking for; you took some money out of my pocket"—he said, "I am not the only one who was in it, there are others"—he owned to taking one half-crown and 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I gave him in charge—I saw Pearce the same night at the Angel—I charged him with it—he said nothing—I have not got back any of my money.</p>

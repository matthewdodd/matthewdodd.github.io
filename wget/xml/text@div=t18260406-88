            . I am a publican, and live in Hounsdditch. On the 18th of March, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner came in and had a pint of beer - he came again between one and two o'clock and had a glass of gin - he paid me a shilling - I gave him change - we were at dinner - he said "Mistress, save me two hot potatoes against I come back;" Mrs. Percival came in, and said something; I then examined the shilling he had given me - it was the only silver I had in the till - I gave it to my wife, who wrapped it in paper, and I saw her deliver it to Forrester; he was taken into custody at my house half an hour after.</p>
               <p>JOHNSON. I live at Kidderminster, and was at Compton's when the prisoner was secured; I was obliged to assist - he had been sitting by my side when Mrs. Percival came in and said he had passed a bad shilling - she said he had got his hand in his pocket - I snatched at his hand and found a bad half-crown there - he resisted very much - a crown and half-crown dropped from him, and he kicked it aside.</p>

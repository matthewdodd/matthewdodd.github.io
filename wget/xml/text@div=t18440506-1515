                  </hi>. I am a market-gardener, and live at Plumstead.

On Thursday morning, the 18th of April, I went out, at a quarter to eight o'clock, I left the house fastened—the front room window was fastened, and the glass whole—I returned a few minutes before six, and found the glass all broken, the lead out, the window-blind down, the drawers turned out, and the back door open—I missed my nephew's clothes, which I had seen safe in the morning.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner on the 18th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, on the Plumstead-road, coming in a direction from the prosecutor's house, with a bundle under his arm, containing two coats, three waistcoats, two shirts, and some handker<lb></lb>chiefs—he said they were his own, that he brought them from Gravesend, and had bought them a week ago—he afterwards said he had had the coat very near twelve months—I took him to the station, and he confessed he had stolen the property, and told me the house he had taken it from.</p>

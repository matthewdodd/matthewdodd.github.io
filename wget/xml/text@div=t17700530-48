The eldest, Robert, said he would go as far as Mary's and get his breakfast. I did not know who he meant by Mary. He returned back again in about five minutes for half a quartern of gin. I served him with it; but where he carried it, I do not know. I went accidentally for a pot on the Monday morning;

I asked her if she had ever an empty pot? She said, she had never a one. I said, Are you not well? She said, she was not very well, and she was not very bad. I had no more conversation with her at all.</p>
               <p>Wil. Fouch. I am servant to Mr. Knight, a chemist, in Nortonsalgate. The two prisoners came to me on the 29th of April, and asked for a quarter of a pound of aqua fortis and a quarter of a pound of arsenic, and I served them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they give you an account for what they wanted them?</p>
               <p>Fouch. They did not. I asked Robert, what he wanted it for: he told me, he was a farmer. He said, he had broke a bottle of aqua fortis, and came for something to dress his thigh; he was burnt with it. He had some cooling oil which I recommended to him. The bottle was broke within five doors of our shop; I saw it done. I saw him dress his thigh, but I did not see him wash it with the oil. I saw his breeches were all burnt and open. When he spoke for the arsenic, he asked his brother, if that would be enough? he answered, it would. Farriers use arsenic; they cannot carry on their business without it. I asked him, what arsenic he would have? He said, he would have the best. I said, I did not know which was the best; I thought the red was rather the strongest. He said, he would have the white. When I saw his thigh at his first coming into the shop, there was nothing appeared then; but when I saw it at Edmonton, it seemed very much inflamed. I asked him where he lived, when at our shop; he said, in South-street, Edmonton. I believe he does live there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you make it a practice to sell poison to people you do not know?</p>

This looks to be the same in the earthen pan. (He takes that in the paper in his hand.)

            , the prisoner, lives there. On the Monday before he was taken up, he was drinking a pint of beer; he had been ringing a pig; they were talking about a young woman being poisoned. I heard him say, he did not mind being hanged no more than ringing of a pig, if it was not for the old folks.</p>

            . I keep a blacksmith's shop. Robert served his time with me; he behaved very well, and was very honest. He went journey-work for about two years and a half after his time was out, and since that he has worked for me again, till this affair. I live in South-street ward, in the parish of Edmonton.</p>

               <p>Q. from jury. Did you know of his coming to town on the 29th of April?</p>
               <p>Balam. No: he was a weekly servant to me, and on a Sunday I have nothing to do with him.</p>
               <p>Q. from jury. Did he complain to you of being burnt?</p>

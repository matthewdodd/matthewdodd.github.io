On the 1st of Dec, near seven o'clock in the evening, I stopped the prisoner in Old Gravel-lane, St. George's—he was carrying a bundle, I asked what it contained, he said clothes—I took hold of it and said, "By the weight there is something more than clothes here; you must go with roe to the station-house"—on our way there he said it also contained a little sugar and butter, which his captain had given him—he said he was steward of the <hi rend="italic">venus</hi>, lying in Gun-dock, Wapping—I was about searching him at the station-house, and he took from each of his trowsers pockets a bottle of port and I bottle of sherry—I asked where he got that—he said his captain also gave him that—I fetched the captain, who said in the prisoner's presence that be bad given him the butter but not the sugar or wine—and the prisoner said, "I know I have done wrong."</p>

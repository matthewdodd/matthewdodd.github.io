            . I understand she is a widow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any property there - A. Yes, I did; I lost a pocket-book, in which there was a bank post bill. I was in the room, and apprehended the man at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you up or in bed - A. I was in bed; I heard a noise. It was near two o'clock in the morning. In my bed-room the noise was. I listened some time, conceiving it might be in the adjoining room, and after listening some time, I found it was in my room. I got up immediately, and went towards the direction from whence I heard the noise. I seized the prisoner. I had no light in the room when I had seized the prisoner. I heard somebody coming up stairs; I called out for assistance. Several people came in, and a light was brought. Mr. Hewitt came up, whom I understood to be Mrs. Kinnard's nephew. He searched the prisoner in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q. And was anything of your's found upon the prisoner - A. The pocket-book, containing my notes, a knife, a comb, and two tokens.</p>
               <p>Q. The tokens are not in the indictment; where were they found upon him - A. I believe in one of his pockets. I saw them taken from his person.</p>

               <p>Q. What did the pocket-book contain - A. A bank post bill for forty-two pounds fifteen shillings; two five-pound Grantham notes, value ten pounds; one two-pound bank note; two one's, and three one-pound country notes. The prisoner was secured.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom was your pocket-book delivered - A. Mr. Hewitt kept it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tobacconist at Richmond. On Saturday, 8th Dec., the prisoner came for half an ounce of tobacco; he gave me in payment a crown—I gave him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—for a minute he remained there; he lighted his pipe at the gas, and <hi rend="italic">left</hi> the shop—I had put the crown in the till—after he was gone, I looked at it two or three minutes afterwards—when the next customer came in he offered me half a sovereign; I was going to give him the crown which the prisoner gave me, and when I opened the till, I had no other 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece there—I had taken no other, and had no other in the house—when the other party came in I found this 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece was bad—I marked it, and locked it in the shop desk—on the following Tuesday I saw the prisoner again; he came about the same time in the evening for half an ounce of tobacco—he gave me in payment a half crown—I knew him instantly—the half crown he gave me was bad—I told him I suspected it was a bad one—I went to the door of the shop to look for a policeman—I could not see one—I asked a friend of mine to look at the half crown—the prisoner ran away—I ran after him nearly a quarter of a mile—I did not lose sight of him—I gave him into custody with the half crown, which I still had in my hand—I gave the officer the half crown.</p>

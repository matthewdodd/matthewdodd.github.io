               <p>JOSEPH EDWARDS. On the evening of the 9th of February I was in <placeName id="t18300218-165-crimeloc921">Angel-court, Throgmorton-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18300218-165-crimeloc921" type="placeName" value="Angel-court, Throgmorton-street"></interp>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Did not you say it had no mark? A. I told the officer so, but I understood from my mother that it was marked J. C.</p>
               <p>CHARLES THOROGOOD. I am an officer. On the 9th of February I was on duty near the back of the Royal Exchange - I saw the two prisoners come down Sweeting's-alley; Clarke was close behind the prosecutor, and Patten behind him - I followed them down Angel-court, and met Patten turning back: I seized him with this handkerchief in his hand - I called the prosecutor, and asked if he had lost a handkerchief - he said Yes; Clarke was going on, and I said, "Take hold of that one" - he did not; I pulled Patten up, and took Clarke myself.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. Was it dark? A. Yes - I had followed them about three hundred yards; they were out of my sight when they turned into the court - as I turned, Patten had just turned from the gentleman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Where did you first see them? A. In Sweeting's-alley - there were two or three persons passing; Clarke was about five yards from the gentleman - I should not have taken another person who had been passing; Patten did not attempt to go away.</p>
               <p>Clarke's Defence. I was returning from Rosemary-lane, where I deal in wearing-apparel; this prisoner asked me the way to Bell-alley - I told him I was going nearly the same way; I got as far as Copthall-court, and aceidentally came in contact with him again - he asked if he was right; I said Yes, and went on - when I was called back by the officer I declared my innocence, but he said he was positive of me - I am a cripple, and it is not likely I should be guilty of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Patten's Defence. I cannot say what I wish; but had my trial come on on Saturday, I could have produced friends to give me a character.</p>
               <p>Patten received a good character.</p>

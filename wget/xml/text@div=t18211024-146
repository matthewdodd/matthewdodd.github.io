            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, last Saturday morning, I watched the prisoner and two other men; Patrick was with me; I first saw them about eight o'clock, and about nine, I saw the prisoner go down Whitecross-street alone, with a tub on his head; he went into a house in Bullock-alley, I followed him in, and asked what he had brought into the house that morning; he said there was nothing brought in; I asked him if something had not been brought in a wheelbarrow, which he denied. I searched the house, and found this pig, he said he had it of his brother, and afterwards he said he bought it in Smithfield for 28 s. While I was questioning him, another man came in with an iron pot in his hand; I took him into custody, he was one of those I had seen with him that morning; I also took the prisoner - the prosecutor claimed the pig, it was alive. I had heard it was taken in in a wheelbarrow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Do not you know that the prosecutor's son wheeled it in - A. I have heard so; the man brought the pot in to scald the pig.</p>

            . I and Handley saw the men; we watched them into Goswell-street, they turned up Cowheel-alley, across Golden-lane, into French-alley. I then lost sight of them, returned into Whitecross-street, and saw the prisoner with the tub. Handley's account is correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who are they - A. One of them was the prosecutor's son. I have heard he has been tried here - the prisoner said he had the pig from his brother-in-law.</p>

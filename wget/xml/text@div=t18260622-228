The prisoner came to the shop on the 26th of May, about eight o'clock in the evening; I was engaged with some customers - she waited some time, and went to the further end of the shop, where there were some silks on the counter; she took off one piece of lutestring, went into the passage, and put it up her petticoats; I saw her do it - she then took it down again, pulled it off the roller, and put it under her apron; there were six yards of it; she staid some time, and I told a young man in the shop of it; he went and took it from her.</p>

            . I am a printer and stationer, and live in Aldersgate-street. I was acquainted with the deceased, Mr. Wilkinson; he was in the employ of a gentleman in the City. On Tuesday, the 17th of July, I accompanied him on the river; we started at nine o'clock precisely from Bull-stairs, Blackfriars - we were in a funny, and had no waterman, but rowed overselves; when we got near <placeName id="t18320906-16-crimeloc104">Vauxhall-bridge</placeName>

                  <join result="offencePlace" targOrder="Y" targets="t18320906-16-off103 t18320906-16-crimeloc104"></join>, I observed two boats, one a little ahead of us, and the other by the side of us - at the suggestion of Mr. Wilkinson, I made some exertion to prevent the boats getting a-head of us, and we got through the bridge as far as the Spread Eagle - one boat had then got by us, and I saw no more of it; it had shot ahead - when we got to the Spread Eagle we rested on our oars, the other boat being astern of us; we were about fourteen or fifteen yards from the shore on the Middlesex side - I pulled out my watch, and it wanted two minutes to ten o'clock; we remained there, and the boat which was astern shot past us, between us and the shore - I had observed two men in that boat; we remained there till the clock struck - we then went about forty yards further; the boat which had shot ahead between us and the shore ran foul of us - it had turned round and met us; it ran foul of us by rowing the head of their boat against ours - the head of their boat was outside the shore, more from the shore than our boat was; Mr. Wilkinson said, "We are foul of a boat, Smales, lend me a hand to shove off" - I got up in the boat, and at that moment their boat's head had advanced to the centre of ours, side by side, we being nearest to the shore; one of the men in the boat locked the two boats together with his hand, by taking hold of our boat, and holding them together - the other man darted his hand into our boat, and snatched two coats which laid at Mr. Wilkinson's feet; they were mine and Mr. Wilkinson's - he took them out of our boat into his own; I raised the oar out of the water as fast as I could, and endeavoured to strike them - that was the oar nearest to the shore; I was rowing one oar, and Mr. Wilkinson the other - I endeavoured to strike, and at that moment the strange boat was going off; Mr. Wilkinson jumped up in our boat, and endeavoured to jump into the strange boat - the two boats were at that time about six feet apart; I was looking at him when he made the jump, and he jumped into the water - he did not get close to their boat; he caught the gunnel of it with his left hand - he jumped into the water, but his head did not go under water; he caught the gunnel so as to keep his head above water all the time - I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether he did or did not strike his head, or any part of his person against the boat? A. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060022"></xptr>am certain he did not strike any part of his person against the boat when he jumped from ours; he could barely reach it with his left hand - after he had got hold of the boat with his left hand, the men that were in the strange boat began to strike him with their sculls; he was endeavouring to get his coat - he still kept hold of the boat with his left hand only, and was struggling with them with his right hand at the time they were striking him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he then closer to the boat than when he first jumped? A. He was holding on with his left hand; his body was close to the gunnel of the boat then, and his head came just above the gunnel; I saw both the men in the boat strike him on the head - I cannot say how many blows they struck; one seemed to strike, and then the other, as if they struck in turns - several blows were given- they appeared to be given with force; he had no hat on- I did not observe them strike him any where but on the head; the blows I saw struck were given with the sculls - I cannot say that I saw any thing else used to strike with.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the men hold them in one hand, or two? A. I was so much alarmed, I did not notice - he held by the gunnel of the boat for three or four minutes, I suppose; I saw him quit the boat - he appeared to have received a blow, or something then, which sent him back on the water.</p>

               <p>Q. How did he fall from the boat? A. He seemed to leave go his hold, and fall back with his head on the surface of the water; I had seen blows struck the moment before.</p>
               <p>Q. Observing him in this state, what did you do? A. I threw him out a scull or oar from our boat, and called to him to take hold of it; he did not do so, but made again for their boat - he was nearest to their boat then, considerably; he did not quite reach their boat again - he got within about a yard of it; he had gone four or five yards when I called to him to take hold of the oar - he was thrown back on the water, and appeared to recover himself again, and make towards the strange boat; he was swimming in the water - he was considerably out of his depth; when he got within about a yard of their boat again, he was either pushed or struck away from it by some means.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the scull or any thing belonging to the boat used on that occasion? A. I could not see the article; it appeared to me to be something, but I could not tell what it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the effect it produced on Mr. Wilkinson? A. He left the boat immediately, and commenced plunging.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by that? A. Different from swimming - he was going down, and struggling with his legs; he was up and down five or six times, and then finally sunk, and I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You endeavoured to strike the men in the boat when the coats were taken - can you say with certainly whether, in that attempt, you struck Mr. Wilkinson or not? A. Most assuredly I did not; he jumped from the boat after I made the blow at them - he was in the boat at the time; the tide was running down at the time - it was in favour of their boat; their boat then made across the river, in a sloping direction - Wilkinson was between our boat and theirs when he struggled and went down, rather nearer to our boat, I think, as the other was then going across; they began to go across at the moment they pushed him, or struck him, when what I name happened; I called Murder! and brought assistance from the shore - the river was searched, and the body found twenty-eight hours after: I recognize Kennedy as one of the men in the boat - I saw the body next day; it was the body of Mr. Wilkinson - it was the body Mr. Davis examined.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was the tide running down when you rowed from Vauxhall-bridge? A. It was; we were rowing against the tide, in order that we might come down with it - we were not very near the shore before we saw the strange boat; I am not much accustomed to the water - I know how to manage a boat; I am not particularly acquainted with the currents of the river - I know when a man is going against tide; the further he is from shore the greater labour - Mr. Wilkinson was desirous of not being overtaken by the boat which was astern, but it ultimately got by.</p>
               <p>Q. When if afterwards run foul of you, did it not drift on you? A. I cannot tell; it struck us in a moment - it was a very nice night indeed; the moon was rising on the other side - I swear it was a light night; I never said it was dark, that I recollect; I do not know that I ever said so - I told Mr. Wilkinson the time by my watch, two minutes before ten, and if it had been very dark, I could not have done that - I will not swear I have not said it was dark, because in the state I was in after the accident, I possibly might have said many things, for I was obliged to be rowed ashore; I believe I did say that I struck once or twice; I said I did not know whether I hit the prisoners or not; I do not know whether the blow took effect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you might have struck more than once or twice? A. No, I am quite sure of that - to the best of my knowledge I never said I struck more than once or twice; I will swear I never said I struck more than twice; and swear that I did not do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not strike after your friend was out of the boat? A. I will positively, nor did I strike at any body - the light was as nights generally are, at that time of the year; I could see the boats very near half across the river - I swear that: I recollect the moon was rising on the other side - it was just showing itself; their boat was as near as possible six feet from ours when my friend jumped at it - I was about the middle of the boat then, with an oar in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not more than six feet? A. When he took a spring out of our boat, it drove our boat down the stream - he had not told me he was going to jump; he jumped from the head of the boat - I had an oar in my hand, which I had been attempting to strike the prisoners with, and I had been rowing with it; I was standing when Mr. Wilkinson jumped; the prisoners' boat at that moment was somewhere about even with ours, and about six feet from us.</p>
               <p>Q. Might you not, with your oar, have secured the boat, and brought it alongside yours? A. I was thunderstruck at his jumping out of the boat - he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060023"></xptr>jumped towards the side of their boat; his hand caught hold of the rullock, the place where the oars go.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you could distinctly see that his face was not struck with the rullock? A. I could not see between his face and their boat, but his left hand caught hold of the rullock; as far as I could possibly distinguish, his head did not go near the boat till he pulled himself to it - his face was sideways at first, and his left hand caught hold of the boat; I am sure he did not strike himself as he jumped out - I thought you meant, could I say his face did not strike while he held to the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, at the very time he jumped, did you not strike at the prisoners' boat? A. I did not, I had just given a blow - I may have given two blows, but it was while the boat was alongside; I did not give any blow after he jumped - he wished to jump into the boat; he was five feet ten inches high.</p>
               <p>Q. His length would come within two inches of the boat then? A. The boat he was in gave way with his jumping, and he got just near enough to catch hold of the boat with his left hand - his body did not touch the boat at that moment; I do not know whether he could swim - I never saw him swim; when he made the second effort to get to the boat, I was about twenty or thirty yards from it - I saw the prisoners strike him.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, but the second time? A. He was either struck or pushed with something - I was looking at the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. What better means had you of seeing what passed at first, than then? A. Why, I got more frightened, and was screaming Murder! and for help - I cannot say whether he was pushed from the boat, or whether he was struck; if he had been struck with a scull then, I should have seen that - I swear I saw two sculls in their boat when they were striking, sculls or oars; we had both sculls and oars in our boat - I threw my friend out an oar, to catch hold of, when he fell back; thinking he was coming towards my boat - he did not take that, but got towards the prisoners boat again; my oar did not go near him - the boats were twenty or thirty yards distant at that time; I threw the oar as far as I could - I was a good deal agitated and alarmed, but I am sure I did not strike him with it, for he did not come near it; I threw one oar and one scull overboard - I cannot tell which went nearest to him; I do not know which I threw first - I threw them towards him; I cannot tell whether they went to the right or left of him - I know they did not go near him; it would go with the tide - I appeared to have got them out about half way between him and my boat, which was twenty or thirty yards from him at the time - he was nearer their boat; it was a very awkward thing to throw - I threw it into the water as near to him as I could - I did not look at the oar to ascertain if it was bruised any where; I saw the prisoners skiff.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see the mark of your oar on the gunnel of their skiff? A. Decidedly not.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not mean that night? A. I have not examined it, only the general appearance of it - I have not ascertained whether there is a mark or not on it; my friend never went down till he was pushed away from the boat - the prisoners attempted to row across the river, immediately on their shoving or striking him away; he went up and down five or six times - I sat down, and endeavoured to row towards him, but having one scull and one oar, the oar overpowered the scull, and sent it back again; I cannot row with an oar and scull, nor can one man in ten.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. You are not quite clear whether you struck one blow or two? A. No; nor whether they took effect on the persons in the boat; I struck towards the boat - I am quite certain Mr. Wilkinson was in the boat at the time I struck the blow or blows - I struck no blow after he was out; the moment the boats separated, he jumped, seeing them going off - I am certain the oar and scull I threw out, went considerably short of Mr. Wilkinson's person.</p>

            . I am what is called jack-in-the-water, at the Spread Eagle, Millbank. On the night of the 17th of July I was on the causeway till ten minutes before ten o'clock, when the last boat went away; I was then standing at the water edge, about forty yards from the house; I took my stool to the house; and about five minutes past ten I heard cries of Murder! - I got out of a boat's head, in which I was laying, but did not attend to the cry, till I heard it a second time - I heard a guggling; I knew then it was somebody drowning; I ran to the house, and as I ascended the stairs, I heard the guggling a second time - I called the waiter - he came instantly with me to the causeway, got into a gentleman's boat, and before we took twenty strokes, we came alongside of a boat, with Mr. Smales standing up in it - he put his hands together, and said,"My friend is gone!"</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What sort of a night was it? A. A dark night; the moon had not risen.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was there a moon that night. A. There was; it might be rising, but not to throw any light on the river - it was very dark at the time; Mr. Smales pointed the direction the boat had gone in, but I did not see it - the funny was about forty yards from shore, when I heard the guggling noise; I could not discern any boats.</p>

            . I live with my father, who is a picturedealer. On Tuesday night, the 17th of July, about five minutes after ten o'clock, I was at Millbank - about forty yards from the Spread Eagle, I saw two boats; I did not see the funny which the gentlemen were in - when I first saw the two boats, they were about four yards apart; two persons were in each boat - I could see that from the shore; the moon was just coming over the houses; I saw one boat come to the other, and saw one leave the other, and go right over.</p>
               <p>Q. Before it left the other, and went over, did you see what was done? A. I observed a pole go up by the shadow of the moon; I could not see in which boat it went up - I do not know what was done with it; it was not light enough to see - it went down again towards the boat which was going away; there was two men in each boat at that time - I afterwards heard a cry of murder.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it at the same time as you saw the pole go up, that you heard the cry of murder? A.

On the evening of the 17th of July I saw the prisoner Brown; I do not know the time, as I had been asleep - I went to bed between ten and eleven o'clock, and it was after that time; I cannot tell how long I had been asleep - Brown came and knocked at my door; I asked who was there - he said, Me! I got up, and when I opened the door, he asked me if I would be so good as to let him leave his coat there till morning; he said nothing else - I said, "Very well," and he put the coat down; he gave me no reason for leaving it - I knew him before; I did not observe any thing particular about him - he did not appear to have been walking in a hurry; I heard he was taken up next morning, and took the coat to Jane Spicer, my mother.</p>

            . I am a waterman's apprentice. On Tuesday, the 17th of July, I was employed in the barge, Hieron, which was under repair at Lambeth; I know both the prisoners - Kennedy had been sleeping on board that barge for some time before the 17th; on Tuesday, the 17th, about ten o'clock, I think, but cannot tell, as I never looked at the clock, Kennedy came to me for the key - my barge laid about a mile and a quarter from the Spread Eagle; he appeared to me to be in a muck sweat I told him I was going myself directly, but he pressed me to give him the key - I did, and he went towards the barge by himself - I went myself in less than half an hour, and slept on board that night, and a person named Flack; I did not see Kennedy when I went into the cabin, but he must have been there, for he got up with me and Flack in the morning, and he, Flack, and I, went to a beer-shop kept by Bean; I asked Bean's son for a light - he said they had no fire; Kennedy pulled out some papers and a book out of his pocket - he tore some of the papers, saying he wanted to burn them, and I tore some of them, not knowing what they were; the pieces were thrown into the grate of the room we were in - a light was brought in at last - Flack lighted his pipe, and threw the paper which he lighted it with into the grate, and the papers caught fire; I cannot say whether they were partly or entirely burnt - I was going out in about an hour, when the officers came and took Kennedy into custody; they afterwards called me - I went to them, and went before the Magistrate with them, and after we had been before the Magistrate, Kennedy told me, that he and Brown were guilty, but he would turn up me, Lyons, and Flack; we were all in custody under suspicion at the time, but he said we need not fear, for he would turn us up - he told me he had put one of the coats in a barge at the back of a barge-buileder's place, but the barge-builder had moved away; I informed a gentleman at the office of it; Evans, was present, and I described where the barge was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You informed nobody of it till you was taken up? A. No, I did not know of it - I did not know whether he might have picked the papers up; I took one paper in my hand, and said, "Let us read this," and he snatched it out of my hand - I went into the house to have some beer, and knew nothing of the papers till I got in there; I asked for the light, as Kennedy asked me to ask for one - he did not tell me that night that he had stolen the coats; I do not recollect seeing him in the barge - I had been out drinking with some young men that night; I do not think he can read, but cannot swear he cannot - he told me after the examination, that he and Brown were guilty; he did not say of what - we were then in custody at the Thames Police office; he told me where he had put the coat - that is what he was speaking of when he said he was guilty, and he said, "When I get cast I shall pray;" I said, "My good! Bill, if you are guilty, now is the time to pray."</p>

            . I am a surgeon, of Upper Belgrave-place, Pimlico. On the 19th of July I examined the body of the deceased in an out-house at the Spread Eagle; it was afterwards opened, in my presence, at a house in Jewin-street; there was a wound on the bridge of the nose, about an inch long - the bone was bare, and slightly broken; there were marks of a considerable bruise on the forehead - and on nearly the whole forehead there was extravasation of blood under the skin; there was the mark of a bruise behind the right ear to a slight extent, and also behind the left ear; the wounds behind each ear were slight, and about the size of a half-crown; there was a slight bruise on the back of one hand, and I think it was the left hand; I observed no other appearance of external violence - the body was afterwards opened in my presence, and on the surface of the brain there was an extravasation of blood on the upper part, as large as my hand; it was quite at the top of the head, and external to a certain degree backwards - there was no external mark there at all; there was no further appearance of injury within the head - the injury on the forehead did not extend beyond the bone; I observed no appearances in any other part of the body.</p>

               <p>Q. To what do you attribute his death? A. My opinion is, that the blow on the nose or forehead produced stunning, and he was incapable of supporting himself in the water; I attribute the extravasation of blood on the top of the head to the blows on the forehead and nose - those injuries were sufficient to cause death ultimately; I consider the immediate cause of his death to be, that he was stunned by the blow, and being incapable of exerting himself in the water, the drowning completed his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He died by drowning? A. I consider he would not have drowned if it had not been from the blow on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he had reeled from the boat by a blow or shove, and afterwards recovered himself so as to make towards the boat again, should you consider that man stunned? A. There are different sorts of stunning - a blow over the nose might stun him; it is very common for a blow on the nose or forehead to cause blood on the head - the extravasation of blood was on the surface of the brain, not on the top of the head; and that certainly might have been the effect of a blow on the forehead - it very commonly produces extravasation in front of the forehead, and the internal injury on the brain also; if the body had struck against any thing in the water after death there would be external appearances probably, and extravasted blood - I state that as my experience; a dead body receiving a blow would not exhibit a mark of a bruise to the same extent, but there would be the appearance of it something similar to blows inflicted during life; there would be a difference between blood coagulated and not - the appearances depend on the blood under the surface; there would be a slight difference in the colour, and a certain degree of redness - I do not say it is necessarily so - I have known instances of blows after death where there have been no appearances, it depends on the degree of violence, and how long after death - the appearances I found on the brain could not be the effect of a blow after death; this injury would have caused inflammation, which is frequently fatal - I swear the blow on the forehead was a mortal wound, but the cause of death was drowning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could extravasation of blood on the brain be produced by suffocation in drowning? A. I am not aware that drowning ever occasioned such appearances.</p>

            . I am chief clerk at the Thames Police-office, and produce the examination of the prisoners. The first examination was on the 18th of July - I have my book containing the original examination - the examinations returned to the Court are fairly copied from the book, and read over to the witnesses, in the prisoners' presence; this statement is my hand-writing, and is signed by Captain Richbell, the Magistrate - I think it was read over to the prisoners, but am not sure; I took it in my book from their own lips, sentence by sentence, and think I read it over to them - they have not signed it; they were under examination on this charge; nothing was said to induce them to make the statement -I think what they stated on the 18th was not read to them; here is the entry made by me in the book from their months on the 18th of July.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the Magistrate sign that book? A. No - he was present when it was taken; I am quite positive every word that occurred was taken down accurately - I think the subsequent statement was read over to them; the copies which are verified by the Magistrate were not made in their presence.</p>
               <p>COURT. He may use his book to refresh his memory as to what passed.</p>
               <p>Witness. On the 18th Kennedy said "I was at Mr. Bean's beer-shop all day, and went on board the barge just after the clock struck ten - Kitley and Flack went with me; I turned out this morning a few minutes before six o'clock, or after I cannot tell to a minute, and went to Mr. Bean's - I walked afterwards down High-street, and coming back again Kitley said to me "The officer has been here, inquiring after you;" I said, "Which way is he gone? I will go after him;" directly, the officer came and said, 'Kitley, I want you.'" Brown said, "Last night I was standing at the corner of Princes-street, about a quarter to nine o'clock, and some young chaps asked me whether I would go and have some beer at the Feathers - I said' No, I have no money - I mean to take a walk;" a young chap who works in a Dartford barge came up, and asked me to take a walk - we went down Bishop's-walk, round the Westminster-road, and down the Newcut - we went up as far as Blackfriars-bridge and back,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183209060026"></xptr>then we went down Union-street, and round the Borough, along by the Elephant and Castle, and there I left him - then we came down by Bethlem, and along High-street, home; directly I got in doors I went to bed, and as soon as I got to bed the clock struck eleven." - They were remanded for further examination, and brought up again on the 26th of July, and at the close of the examination were asked if they had any thing to say - Kennedy said, "I have nothing more to say than what I said before - that is that I am not guilty of drowning the man; I was in the boat at the time, but neither one nor the other did not strike him - his own friend made a stroke at me, and instead of striking me he struck his friend; that is all I have got to say." - Brown said, "I never touched no coat, nor never got off my seat where I sat on, nor never struck no blow, nor lifted any thing to strike with - I have nothing more to say." Kennedy then said, "Can I speak again - when Mr. Wilkinson struck me he went along the boat with one hand over the other, till he got to the stern of the boat; he made three or four attempts to leave go, and he left go at the stern of the boat; with taking the spring out of his own boat, and leaping over into ours, just as though he was coming head first into our boat - the answer he made, says he, 'Oh, I have hurt myself,' but very lowly spoke; I should suppose he must have come with his face first against the boat, for he only just caught hold with his hands - that is all."</p>
               <p>Kennedy's Defence (written). My Lord, and Gentleman of the Jury, - Placed as I am this day before you, upon so solemn and grave a charge, my feelings, as you must naturally suppose, are most powerfully worked upon; and indeed so overcome am I at this time, that I hardly know how to address you; if, therefore, I should be censured for saying so little upon so serious a charge, I trust that it may not be construed into a supposed indifference as to my truly awful situation. My Lords and Gentlemen, as there have appeared in the daily papers various reports relative to the unfortunate affair which now engrosses your solemn and serious attention, and as many of those reports are erroneous, and have reflected (and severely so too) upon the character and disposition of myself and my unfortunate companion, I do most earnestly entreat that you will at once divest your minds of any undue impression that those reports may have made, and which I am sure you will do. My Lords and Gentlemen, - as regards the evidence which you have this day heard, there is little remark I have to make thereon; but trust you will allow me to assure you (and in this trying and awful moment I would not deceive), that neither I nor my companion went out with a premeditation to do the slightest personal violence. I was distressed to the utmost at the time, as my witnesses will prove to you; but I accompanied my fellow prisoner, and started out on the fatal evening, under different intentions. We went out to obtain a few coals - we saw the deceased's boat - we arranged to approach them, to see who they were; we observed the deceased and his friend had their coats off - we agreed to try and get their coats - we succeeded; to recover them the deceased jumped overboard, towards our boat: he jumped with his face against the boat; he said, "Oh! I have hurt myself." While in the water the deceased's friend, Mr. Smales, struck at me three times with his oar - Mr. Smales' blows fell on deceased's head. After the third blow with Mr. Smales' oar, deceased left go his hold of our boat; my fellowprisoner began to row away - I had no scull, having lost mine overboard at the time I took the two coats out of their boat: we succeeded in getting away; I had no idea that the deceased was in any peril or danger of his life, for he was close to his friend's boat, and made a splashing noise, as if swimming; I was unconscious that harm had ensued; and, Gentlemen, I can assure you that no one more than myself can more deeply lament and deplore the melancholy catastrophe. Depending, Gentlemen, upon your discrimination, intelligence, and impartiality, I trust and repose my unfortunate case to your hands, and look forward to a favourable result.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence (written). My Lords, and Gentlemen of the Jury, - The defence which my unfortunate fellow-prisoner has addressed to you, has embraced every circumstance connected with the melancholy occurrence which now demands your most solemn and serious attention; little, therefore, remains for me to say, but I trust you will pardon me while I intrude a short time upon your patience. The allusions which have been made by my fellow-prisoner, relative to the public prints, will not, I am sure, be unattended to, consequently I have little to apprehend on that head. My Lords and Gentlemen - I was legitimately born, but lost a kind and indulgent father when I was only eleven years of age; I was then sent to a parochial charity-school, at which I made small progress in education, and which, I am sorry to observe, was soon totally forgotten by me: I remained at school three years, and was then removed, since which period I have endeavoured to obtain an honest livelihood. I never was before in custody upon a criminal charge. My Lords and Gentlemen - allow me to say, that in conjuction with my fellow-prisoner, our intentions on that fatal evening were very opposite to personal injury or violence; and with him I deeply lament and deplore the melancholy catastrophe. Gentlemen - trusting to your calm and dispassionate view of the evidence which has been adduced, I submit my fate to your discriminating consideration, looking forward to a favourable result.</p>

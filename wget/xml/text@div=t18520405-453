                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Hoop and Grapes in Broadway, Westminster, and am also a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> proprietor. I have known John Stowell eight or ten years—at the beginning of Jan. 1850, I was in difficulties, and became bankrupt—I was answerable for my brother-in-law and another person, and was called upon to pay a larger sum of money than I was able—at the time of my bankruptcy I was indebted to Mr. John Stowell in the sum of 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for money which had been lent to me—at that time we were on friendly terms—on 28th Jan. 1850, I borrowed 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of John Stowell, for which I gave him this I O U (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is my writing—on 11th Feb. I borrowed a further sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I gave him an I O U for ten guineas—the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be repaid on 28th Feb.—I was to pay him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the use of it, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I repaid him the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., at least my wife paid the money—I was present—it was on 28th Feb.—it was paid in our parlour—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a book produced</hi>) here is an entry in my own handwriting—it was made at the time—my wife was present—it was her hand that paid the money—I paid him 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I made this entry at the time—the prisoner as present when I made it—this book was produced at the County Court—the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid from the public house money—this is the public house book—I returned to him the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I borrowed on 11th Feb.—that was on 18th or 19th March, 1850, at the Elephant and Castle in front of the bar—Mr. Alfred Younger was with me—it was between 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening—I do not know that he saw me pay the money—he was there at the time—Stowell still retains the I O U's and has produced them here to day—when my wife had paid him the 21<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and after I had entered it into the book,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185204050127"></xptr>
               <p>I asked him for the I O U—he put his hand to hit tide pocket, and said he had mislaid his pocket book, and that he would tend it over—at that time I was on friendly terms with him, and had been for about ten years, but we had not been so intimate only for the last three or four years—during that time there had been no breaking of the intimacy—when I paid him the ten guineas at the Elephant and Castle, I said, "Now you have the two documents to give me, John" (I was in the habit of calling him John)—he said, "Oh, it it all right, <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi>, I quite forgot to bring them with me; I will send them over in a <hi rend="italic">poster.</hi>"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Between that and 6th June of the same year, 1850, did you at any other time apply to him for the I O U's <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not remember the date; I did apply to him—he came to our house, I think, once, and I think I saw him once besides, but I cannot tell exactly how many times—oh, I thought you were speaking of between 28th Feb. and 11th March—he came oyer one Sun<lb></lb>day evening, and I said, "You did not send me over the I O U's"—he said, "Well, I quite forgot it; it if all right"—I know that my sister borrowed 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of him—I know nothing of my own knowledge of the payment of that money—on or about 6th June, 1850, I had some words with Stowell—he served my sister with a writ that night, at least he brought some person with him to do so—I had words with him in consequence of that—the money was paid—I never saw the prisoner to speak to him after that 6th June till I saw him at the County Court—the summons was served on me on 25th Sept., 1851—until I received that summons I was never applied to by the prisoner or any other person for the moneys due on these I O U's—W. B. Davit is the name of the attorney in the summons—at that time Thomas Stowell, the prisoner's brother, was acting as clerk to Mr. Davis.</p>

I think—I swear that—that is in writing and on a regular stamp—she lets me pay when it is convenient—she lives sometimes with us and sometimes with various friends—she is living now just by Devizes—when she is with me she only comes on a visit—she does not wait at the bar, that I swear—I did not borrow this money of Stowell to pay my sister, for I had not at that time paid. her anything—I borrowed it to pay the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> duty—I entered the payment of it in the public-house book, because I paid it at the house—if I had paid it at the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-yard I should have entered it in the yard-book—my sister did not pay the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> duty, as she was not then in town—I managed all the business—she did not know Mr. Stowell at that time—I applied to him to lend me 28<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 22nd Feb. 1850, and he refused to let me have it unless he got my sister's name to the I O U—it was not paid at the time it was due—it remained unpaid till June—it ought to have been paid on 22nd March—my sister did not pay it because she had no money; all the money was in the business—she was sued, and she then paid it—I paid the money, at least Mr. Preston paid it—I rather think he got a bill discounted and paid it—I had the money from him—I believe it was got by a bill which he got discounted—I think I accepted the bill—Mr. Preston drew the bill—I accepted it, and left it for him to get discounted—I do not know who cashed the bill—I have paid it—it was paid some time last summer—it was for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that left something over—I think we paid it out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> business—by <hi rend="italic">we</hi> I mean myself—the business belongs to my sister—I do not know exactly how much I got from Mr. Preston for the bill—I think it was a two months' bill, and I think I paid 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I took the bill up and paid him—I cannot tell you how much money I actually received from Mr. Preston, I think all the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within about 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have no entry of that—I do not know that my wife knew anything about it—I believe I paid the bill when it was at maturity—I will swear it—I know I have never been sued in any way, and when I had the money to pay Mr. Preston I paid him—I cannot tell you how I paid it, it must have</p>

I should not have hesitated; as he promised to send it, I took no further heed—my solicitor, Mr. Preston, wrote for them to Mr. Games, after the action was brought on 6th June for the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. against my sister—that was after the action against my sister was settled—Mr. Games wrote to Mr. Preston for the payment of the I O U for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told Mr. Preston it was paid, and that he must apply for it—I swear I instructed Mr. Preston to write for the I O U's—I cannot tell you the date; I think it was about July—I swear it was before Oct., 1851, and before Aug.—I should not like to swear to a particular date, for I am not certain—it was at the end of the settlement of the action with my sister.</p>

I did the work in it—I do not exactly know whose business it was then—I suppose it was my husband's—he had to account for it, what came in, and what was sold—I do not know who he had to account to, the business was carried on in the public house, and we had a man there from the brewery—the license was sever transferred.</p>

I am a clerk to my uncle, who is broker to Messrs, Calvert, the brewers—on 18th March, 1850, about half-past 8 or 9 o'clock, I went with the prosecutor to the Elephant and Castle, where I saw John Stowell in front of the counter—I saw him and the prosecutor talking together—they mutually recognised each other—I heard some money being counted behind me, which I had previously seen Mr. Kennett put into his pocket at the Hoop and Grapes—I cannot tell how much money passed—I supposed Mr. Kennett was paying money to Mr. Stowell—I had received some information from Kennett as to what errand we were going on.</p>

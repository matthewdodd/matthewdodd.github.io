                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, K</hi> 182). On Saturday, 24th Aug., a little after one in the day, I went to Mr. Goodbehere's, in Wellclose-square—I saw the prisoner, Robert, there—I said, from information I had received, I thought he had some things in his house belonging to Mr. Goodbehere—he said, "If there is any thing there I do not know any thing about it"—Mr. Goodbehere asked if he had any objection to my going down to his house with him—he said "No"—I went with him to 12, Joseph-street, Back-road, and one of the men—his mother opened the door—he said, "Mother, here is a policeman come to search the house"—she said her husband was not at home; we had better wait—I said, "We need not wait, if there is nothing here"—I found two stoves behind the door up-stairs, some iron pipe, a tea-kettle, and an ash<lb></lb>pan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked Robert how they came there—he said he did not know anything about them; his father might have bought them in Rosemary-lane—in the cupboard I found eight small cannon, three cruets, and several wooden and tin boxes, locked—the mother gave me some keys—I opened one box and found twelve brass hinges—I also found a boiler and some sail<lb></lb>maker's needles—I took Robert to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Joseph-street, nearly opposite No. 12, where the prisoners live. On 23rd March I went there to visit a poor woman in her confinement—the elder prisoner brought me these three boxes, with brass locks, and other articles, and asked if he could serve roe with anything—I did not purchase any—I have frequently seen shippiog goods, such as boilers, kettles, and hampers of ironmongery, brought there by Robert in a cart—he used to unload and take them in, and afterwards take them away again—the father has been present sometimes.</p>

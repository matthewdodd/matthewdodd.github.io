                  </hi>. I am a widow. On Saturday last I came to London from Maidstone, on business—I took a lodging in Buckeridge-street, St. Giles's—I went to bed between nine and ten o'clock—the prisoner slept in the next bed—she was in bed before me—she spoke to me—I took my pocket off, and put it under my pillow—it contained two half-crowns, and two shillings—I rolled it up in a bit of paper—I was awoke in the night, and felt something like a hand under my head—I was frightened, and moved down in the bed—a little after I found another sensation, which drew my pocket out, and the string broke, which made a great noise—I started up and said to the prisoner, "You have got my pocket"—she made no answer, but walked to the door—I made an alarm in the place, and the</p>

I heard the alarm about four o'clock on Sunday morning, and saw the prisoner runnings—I took her—the prosecutrix came, and gave charge of her—I said, "What money hare you got?"—she said, "Two half-crowns, and two shillings," and it Was in her pocket—I took it from her—she said she would give it me, but I said no, I would take it.</p>

My son gave me four half-crowns on the 6th—I changed one and bought some things, and another I changed soon after—I then had two half-crowns, and two shillings—I got up on this morning to go on a little business—the prosecutrix got up and followed me, and said I had got her pocket—I said, "Go and search your bed"—she did and found them—she then cut the strings, and threw one of her pockets on me—when the policeman took me, she came up with her pocket in her hand.</p>

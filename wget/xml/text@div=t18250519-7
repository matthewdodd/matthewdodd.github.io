On the 3d of May, about twelve or one o'clock, I retired to bed, and after being in bed some time, I was disturbed by hearing the sashes of the parlour window make a noise - I was sleeping on the sofa in the parlour, as my apartment was let, and I was only going to remain in town a few days; I thought it might be the wind, but was disturbed a second time by the same noise; I still thought it might be from some natural cause, and took no further notice, and in about ten minutes I heard it a third time, and in a few seconds the sash flew up with a crash. I got off the sofa, took up the poker, proceeded to the window, and found the sash was thrown up above the space of three inches, and the fastening broken off, and on looking out of window I saw three persons proceeding towards Bury-street; the window shutters had not been put quite to; there was a large crevice, by which means I could see, as the gas light was very strong there - I saw three men turn down towards Bury-street; I determined to watch and afterwards heard a noise of footsteps on the pavement - I looked out and saw a person on the opposite side of the way, and two passing on the same side of the way as myself; I still kept on the watch and shortly afterwards one of them came back, and I saw him with his hand on the window; he threw the sash up rather higher; he then retired and shortly afterwards I saw two others - one of them pushed the venetian blinds back against the shutters, which threw them some distance open; I then saw a very strong light which proceeded from a small lantern, and after a few seconds they retired; they again returned and threw the sash still higher; the light again appeared in the room; they retired - returned a third time, and threw the sash completely up, and the shutters were thrown back with great violence; they are inside shutters; the light was thrown forward so that I saw part of a hand and arm holding the lantern (I was standing in the recess of the other window at the time;) this convinced me that the person must be inside, and I immediately made a blow at the arm with the poker, which fell on the lantern - part of the glass fell inside the room, and the lantern was found in the area, and part of the glass on the pavement; I immediately called out "Stop thieves!" putting my head out of window, and immediately heard a rattle spring in St. James's-street, and a voice calling out, on my left, in Bury-street, "Where?" and almost at the same moment I saw a watchman running round from Bury-street; he was pursuing somebody; I could see to the end of Ryder-street, which does not extend above fifty yards from the house; I got out of the window, and just as I got over the railing I saw a man running back from St. James's-street towards me - one of the watchmen called to him to stop - he stopped for two or three seconds, and the watchman attempted to lay hold of him - he rushed by - I immediately pursued myself, and came up with him in Bury-street, telling him to stop or I would knock him down with the poker; he stopped and said "What is it for? what is the matter?" I said I would explain that hereafter; the watchman came up, took him by the collar, and said "This is he;" it was the prisoner; on returning I picked up a hat close to the railing, also a piece of very thick glass, which I imagine to be part of the bull's eye of the lantern; I went into the house, put on my clothes, and went to the watch-house; he gave his name there as John Tuck; when I returned from the watch-house the dark lantern was found in the area - when he was taken he had a seal-skin cap on.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose arm you saw put in you do not know? A. No, his arm was within the room, the shutters protruded full 22 inches from the sash windows - the lantern was beyond the shutter or I could not have seen it, for I was in the recess of the other window; I saw the hand - part of the arm must also have been in; I advanced two or three steps before I gave the blow.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Who did you take your apartment from? A. Martha Wisdom - her sister lives with her - their father is living but not in the house at this time - my clothes were entirely off - I had been asleep - I had not been drinking that evening; I heard the clock strike three some time after the transaction began; the first noise I heard was about half-past two - the house is on the left hand side going from St. James's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state to the Magistrate that you concealed yourself in the corner to see if any body came in?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182505190008"></xptr>A. No, I said in the recess of the window, which is about two feet from the window where the lantern was put in. Until the shutters were forced in I only saw through the space occasioned by their not being put close too; I could distinguish a person through that crevice quite plain - I know his person but not his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Had that man a hat on? A. I did not take particular notice of that - it was not day-light - there was a strong gas-light, and a light from the moon - the shutters were thrown back with great violence the last time - I felt convinced some person must actually be in the room by the lantern being so far in - the shutters made a great noise - I had come home about twelve at night; I had been in company with some gentlemen - I had been with a friend from the country in Ryder-street - I did not expect him to come to me next morning, for he went off into the country by the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there day-light enough, without the gas or the moon, to discern the face of any body? A. Certainly not - when the shutters were opened I put my body out of window at once, and saw three men, two running towards St. James's-street, and one laying under the window - he had a hat on; I saw one watchman coming from Bury-street; the man under the window jumped up and ran off - I cannot say whether the watchman saw him - I was looking towards St. James's-street, and cannot say how far the watchman was off. I called out Thieves! stop thief! and the prisoner came running back from St. James's-street, towards me; a watchman was pursuing him. I am certain he is the man; he stopped for a second or two, and spoke to Adams, the watchman, who was calling to him to stop - he rushed by him towards me, and passed me - I did not stop him because I could not - I wished to stop him without doing him an injury - I stopped him myself afterwards in Bury-street; I did not see the hat tried on his head at Marlborough-street to my recollection. I am in no business; I have lodged with Miss Wisdom, backward and forward, for four years; I used to farm an estate in Bedfordshire, and have sufficient to live on.</p>
               <p>MARTHA WISDOM. I live at No. 5, Little Ryder-street, and rent the house. Neither my father nor sister have any interest in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there not a lease of it? A. Yes, it is in my name only - I pay the rent to Mr. Humbey - he does not give a receipt in our joint names.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Little Ryder-street is in the parish of St. James's. On the 3d of May, about 3 o'clock, I heard a cry of Thieves! watch! I turned round and ran in a direction of the sound, and saw a gentleman without hat or coat, jump out of this parlour window, and saw a man, with a fur cap on, run towards St. James's-street as fast as he possibly could - I joined in the pursuit, and in St. James's-street, by my calling Stop thief! he was turned back by another watchman; he could not run down St. James's-street as other watchmen were coming up at the springing of the rattle, and he came into Little Ryder-street again - I made a catch at him, just touched his collar - he swore a heavy oath, threw himself aside, and ran towards Bury-street, but being unable to get down there, as the watchmen were coming up, he turned to the left up Bury-street, towards Jermyn-street - I continued to pursue with the gentlemen, who got before him, with the poker in his hand, and told him to stop or he would knock him down; he turned again and I collared him till I got assistance. I had lost sight of him for a minute or a minute and a half, just as he turned out of St. James's-street into Ryder-street. I am certain he is the same person - he never changed his cap - I observed that he had a cap on when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear to the cap or the man? A. To the man; I have got a hat, which was tried on to the prisoner at Marlborough-street; it did not fit him; Enderby might have seen it tried on I dare say; he was at the office; it was not day-light when he was taken - I call it a good moon-light morning, and there was plenty of gas; I have the dark lantern, which was given to me.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. James's. I had began to call three o'clock on this morning, when I heard a person call out "Stop him, stop thief!" I saw a person running out of Little Ryder-street, across St. James's-street, towards Bennett-street, and pursued across towards him; he turned again as I nearly got up to him, and went into Little Ryder-street; I was springing my rattle all the time, and never lost sight of him till he was taken by the gentleman who gave the alarm; I returned from the watch-house and picked up a crow bar on the very spot where he turned out of St. James's-street - the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it day break? A. It was so light that I never lost sight of him, by the light of the moon and gas; I cannot say whether it was day-light - it might appear so; I said at the office that the day was breaking; I never said it was broad day-light.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The witness swore positively that it was day-break.</p>

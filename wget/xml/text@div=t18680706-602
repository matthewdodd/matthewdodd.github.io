I am a merchant, of 45, Aldermanbury—on 25th June, the prisoner came to my warehouse—I had known him previously as clerk to Shipley &amp; Co.—he said, "I come from Shipley &amp; Co., I want some samples of traveling bags, because we have a customer waiting to give an order"—I let him have three bags, worth 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each—he took them away—I also showed him some portmanteaus—I saw Shipley &amp; Co. the next day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman C</hi> 64). On Saturday, 27th June, I was called to Mr. Shipley's, and saw Mr. Max there, who said, in the prisoner's presence, "This man has been obtaining goods from me under the pretence that they were for Shipley &amp; Co."—the prisoner said, "Yes, I had the goods; if you will go with me, I will get you the money for them"—Mr. Max said, "No"—I said that if I went with him Mr. Max must give him in custody—I found the goods pledged at Cox's, and at Attenborough's—he said that he had destroyed the duplicates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I had been to see if I could get some money, and was to be paid next day. I went to Mr. Max, and asked if he had samples of leather bags; but he must have known that I had left Shipley's. I pawned them because I had not sufficient for what I required. I should have gone to him on Monday, and told him I had not got the money, but would pay him as soon as possible.</p>

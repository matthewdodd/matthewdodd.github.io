            . I ran out to see for the woman, and presently I see her, just coming round the corner of Cumberland street, it was just going round the corner of Seymour-street, and then I asked her if she had not three of our pint pots? she answered me no; and then I said she had got three of our pots, and I would have them; and then she set them down.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did she set down? - Three pint pots; she had them under her gown that came over her head, and then I picked up the pots, and took hold of her till my master came, and then I let go of her hand, and master took hold of her and the constable came, and she was taken to my master's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where she took these pots from you don't know yourself? - Yes, she took them from No. 21, because the maid came in and said so.</p>
               <p>Q. What were done with the pots? - They were delivered to my master.</p>

               <p>Q. What do you know about taking these pots? - I heard the pots going off the rails. They were delivered out, I put them on the rails myself; I live at No. 21, Bryanston-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had they been brought to your house from Mr. Anstey's? - Yes, one was brought the over night, the other two that day.</p>
               <p>Q. The boy has told us that he stood at the door for the pots, and could make nobody hear? - I was busy scouring the room, and I put them out afterwards, expecting the boy to come again and take them; I put them on the rails, on the outside of the house, about three o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body take these pots? - I heard the pots go off the rails, and seeing this good woman pass, I looked through the window, and see her pass from the door over the way, I did not see her take the pots.</p>
               <p>Q. But the noise of the pewter made you look out? - Yes. I went over to the public house, and told them that the woman had got the pots.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the public house off? - About five or six doors off. The boy and master pursued her directly, and she put the pots down in sight of me.</p>
               <p>Q. To Prosecutor. We understand that you followed your boy out in consequence of the information by Mrs. Davis? - Yes; when I came to the boy he had got the pots in his hand, and he had stopped the woman; I asked her what she was going to do with these pots, and she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179504160048"></xptr>could not make any answer not directly but presently she begs that I would forgive her; she said she was a very poor woman, and I took the pots and marked them, and took the woman into my own house, and from there to the office, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the pots here? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had them in your possession ever since? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at them, do you know them to be your pots? - These are my pots, I put my mark on them immediately, my name is on one, and the other person's name that I succeeded is on the other two.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been sick a long while, and had not a friend in the world, and I was going through the street, and it was a very cold day, and I missed my way, and a boy came running after me, and said, what are you going to do with these three pint pots? I said, go along boy, I have no pots; and he had three pint pots in his hand; and so they took me away into the house, I have not a friend in the world, I leave it to the good God above and the gentlemen of the court. I never was guilty of it in my life; I am a foreigner, my husband is dead, he served the King many years.</p>

            . I live in the Almonry. On the 20th of December, between eleven and twelve o'clock the prisoner came with a gentleman to my house - she came in and took a candle. I heard the man go up stairs, but did not see him - she came down in about half an hour. I followed her out, and asked where she was going; she said for a pot of beer; I said it was too late to get any - she ran off without answering me. I went up to the room in about five minutes, and found the prosecutor there, very tipsy. Smith went up before me.</p>
               <p>PHOEBE SMITH. I live at this house, and saw the prisoner come in with the prosecutor. I cannot say whether he was in liquor or not - she afterwards went out; I went up to the room, and found Warman there with his coat off; he desired me to go out of the room for a few minutes, which I did; he then called me in; he was still on the bed without his coat; he told me to look on the mantle-piece for his watch, which I did; it was not there - I told him so; he said then he was robbed. He did not appear very sober nor very tipsy.</p>

               <p>"You know you was in liquor when you was with me." I said,</p>

            . I am an officer, and took him in charge. As we went to the office he stated, that he was deficient, but he did not think to more than 2 l. I said his master charged him with the amount of 10 l. - he said, when his master searched his books he had no doubt he would find it was not more than 2 l. I understand he has a wife and six children.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day this was found out I went home to tell my wife that it was found out. I booked my bread and sent the money by my wife - she gave it to Mrs. Tilke. My master came to me soon after, and asked me what was the meaning of it. I said I was very sorry for what I had done - he said he should be sorry to hurt me. I told him I would pay him 5 s. a week - it was paid on the following Saturday, and next week he hired a man unknown to me, and on the following Saturday, when I came home, he said there was a man at the door to take me.</p>
               <p>JOEL TILKE re-examined. The 5 s. which I had of him on the Saturday, after I had charged him with the robbery, was for some other money which he had taken - there were 1 s. due to him when he was taken, which I have not paid him.</p>

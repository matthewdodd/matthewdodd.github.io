                  </hi>. I am a detective officer—on 17th May last, I apprehended two persons, named William Green and William Simpson, on a charge of having in their possession a gold watch and chain, supposed to have been stolen—I searched Simpson's house, and found there certain property—the case was brought before the Lambeth Police Court on Tuesday, 18th May, and remanded till the following Wednesday week—on Saturday night, 22nd May, I received a letter, in consequence of which I went to the Elephant and Castle the next night, where I saw the prisoner Richards—he said, "Well, <hi rend="italic">Jemmy,</hi> how are you?"—he shook hands, and said, "Come along, let us go over the way and have a glass," which we did, at the Rockingham Arms public-house—I did not say anything about the letter, nor did he—he was standing waiting there when I went up—a friend who I met at the Elephant went across with us to the Rockingham—we had a glass and came out—Richards said, "Let us go down below, and have a glass there"—when we came out, he took hold of my arm, and said, "<hi rend="italic">Jemmy,</hi> I will tell you what I want to speak to you about; you aid Ranger have got old Black Miles and <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Green, have not you?"—I says, "Yes"—he says, "I suppose you don't want to get them convicted, do you i"—J sail, "No, not particular"—he said, "And you found a lot of stuff there"—I says</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186908160098"></xptr>
               <p>"Yes"—"Well," he says, "old <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Critchley has been down to me, and wanted me to see Potter; I told him no, that would not do, to leave it to me; now, look here, <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> says you can have twenty <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>, and I can get it for you; no one shall know anything about this, mind, excepting ourselves—we then entered the County Terrace public-house, and as we got to the bar, a man well known to me came from the further end, and shook hands with him—we had some refreshment, which Richards paid for—the other man, turning his eye round to the back of him, says, "It is too hot here, for I think these are two <hi rend="italic">coppers</hi> behind; go down in the Dover Road, there is a nice quiet place there, you know where"—we then came out of the public-house, and Richards said, "Come along, we will go this way, let us go down to the Dover Road"—I says, "No, that is not good enough for me"—"Oh," he says, "it is all right"—I says, "No, I won't go, for he might have witnesses there, I have none"—he pressed me very much to go, and I told him at last I would not go—he then said, "Come along, let's go and see an old friend of mine, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hamilton"—he then took hold of my arm, and walked quietly up the Kent Road—he said, "How are you with Ranger?"—I says, "All right"—"Well," he said, "look here; you need not fear, for there is no one shall know anything about this, excepting us, you and me and Ranger; you may as well have the twenty <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> as not, for they are sure to get off it, for we are going to send some parties to <hi rend="italic">buff</hi> to the stuff—we then entered the American Stores, Walworth Road, which is kept by <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Hamilton—we were in there a short time—we then came out, and he said, "Now, look here, you can easy do it in this way with Ranger; say, 'Now, Ranger, what do you think of this? we are sure not to get no owners for the stuff we have got; let's get the poor devils <hi rend="italic">turned up</hi>, and have them for something better'"—he said, "We are going to send some parties to <hi rend="italic">buff</hi> to the stuff, and you can easy say as this, before the Magistrate, that you have made inquiry about the property, and you believe it belongs to the person who is now in Court; we know what you can do if you like, for the one you have been before (meaning the Magistrate) will do what you ask him, for we don't want them to be remanded over and over again"—after receiving the letters I have alluded to, I communicated with my superior officer—I made a full report of it in writing that night, and I acted under his direction and with his assent—before parting with Richards he said, "Now, look here; meet me here to-morrow night, at 9 o'clock, and I will bring you the stuff"—I promised to do so—on the following night, Monday, the 24th, I met him with Ranger, at the Elephant and Castle—he came up to us, and shook hands with both of us, and invited us across to the Rockingham Arms to have something to drink—he turned to we and said, "Well, Ham, how's things?"—I said, "All right"—he then turned to Ranger, and said, "I assure you, Mr. Ranger, that no one will know anything about this excepting ourselves; it will be all quite right"—I says, "Well, have you brought it?"—he says, "No, I have not; I have not seen <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi>"—and then he said, "Directly you get them <hi rend="italic">turned,</hi> you shall have the money"—"turned up" means "discharged from the Police Court"—I turns to Ranger, and says, "He has not brought it now"—Ranger said, "Oh, that won't do for me"—I says, "No, a promise is a promise"—he then looked up at the clock, and said, "Well, I know where to go and find <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi>; will you wait here five minutes; but-look here, it is 9.30 now, will you wait here till 10?"—I said, "Yes"—he then left the</p>

On 23rd May last I went to Ham's house, and he showed me a letter—on the following night, the 24th, I met Ham in the Walworth Road, about 7.30, or from that to 8 o'clock, and went with him to the Elephant and Castle—I was present when Richards came there—he said to me, "How do you do, Ranger; I suppose Ham has told you of this affair"—I said, "Yes"—we then all three went over to the Rockingham Arms, at the corner of the New Kent Road—Richards then said, "Look here, Ranger, you will never make any money by working honestly"—I said, "Well, I have not got much"—he says, "I am going to see old <hi rend="italic">Billy,</hi> at the William the Fourth"—he left the house—I followed him, but lost sight of him; he went down the New Kent Road, down by the County Terrace public-house—before he went, he said, "I will come back to you at the Rockingham"—I returned to Ham—Richards came back in about half an hour or twenty minutes—he said, "Well, I have seen <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Critchley; I have not got the <hi rend="italic">guides</hi> for you now, but <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> and I will meet you to-morrow morning at 12 o'clock, at the Elephant and Castle parlour, and I can assure you that no one shall know anything of this but our four selves"—we then parted—next day Ham and I went to the place appointed, at 12 o'clock, and saw Richards; I think we were there first—he said, "Have you seen old <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi>?—Ham said, "No"—he said, "I have just seen him get out of a' <hi rend="italic">bus,</hi> he is just gone down the Borough I will go and see whether he is at the <hi rend="italic">Barrister's;</hi> "that is a low coffee-shop, kept by a man of very bad character—he was gone two or three minutes—he came back and said, "Ham, I think there is some mistake about this, as Miles and Green are up at the Court to-day, and the woman that they have sent to <hi rend="italic">buff</hi> to the stuff"—he said, "If you get them <hi rend="italic">turned up,</hi> you can rely upon me for the money," or "the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," I don't know which it was, but I think it was "20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Oh, that won't do for me; I can't waste my time in this way"—he then said, "Oh, there stands Critchley over the way"—he was a little way from the Alfred's Head, a public-house opposite—I walked across with Richards, and Ham behind me, towards Critchley—Critchley said, "Good morning, Mr. Ranger"—I said, "Good morning"—he said, "I don't know so much of you as I do of <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> Ham, but Richards tell me you arc a perfect gentleman. I will tell you the reason why. I am</p>

               <p>to avoid it being noticed—I should think so, by the way he did it—I don't think he was trying to conceal it from me and Ham; but there were several more in the bar, and he had told me previously that nobody knew anything of it but us four—I saw what I believe was gold—I believe I did see some—to the best of my belief it was gold—I know I saw some money, that I swear—I saw it as his hand was passing—I can't tell positively whether it was gold or silver; but I believe it was gold, by the ratting.</p>

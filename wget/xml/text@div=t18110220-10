On the 1st day of February I went after her character, during the time I went for her character, she came for her answer, and was asked down into my kitchen, and while my servant came up to say she had come, she stole a gown from off the basket that had just come from the mangler. On the Monday following, a young woman came to my house to ask me if I had not hired a young woman as servant of the name of

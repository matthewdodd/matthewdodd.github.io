On the 13th of October, a little after four in the morning, I was alarmed by the patrol and watchman ringing of the bell; I went to the window they told me to come down stairs, as my cellar door was broken open. I came down stairs and found my cellar door broken open; the cellar door is underneath the house. I had seen it at eleven o'clock in the evening; the last time, it was perfectly fastened then; I am quite sure of that. I fastened it myself; there is a chain and bolt within side; I unlocked the door in the passage to go into the cellar; I went into the cellar; the patrol and watchman went into the cellar first and

After that we went into the cellar, and examined it; there was no one there. He said, there had been two men, they were both gone; he said, he was coming by there about four o'clock in the morning. a man came out of the cellar with a basket in his hand. I asked him who he had with him; he said he did not know. The watchman told him he had better tell who they where; he said he knew nothing about them. We found seven bottles of wine standing by the cellar door, some on the butt head, and some on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these bottles there when you left the cellar at night - A. No; they were in the wine cellar, and I had the key in my pocket. The wine cellar door was forced open by some sharp instrument or other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else besides - A. Some bottles on the floor that had been broken; they had been taken out of the wine cellar, and taken as far as the cellar door that goes out into the street. I missed nothing but the wine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any wine taken away - A. There were to the amount of two dozen taken away from the bin. I found seven bottles, there were four broken; I missed two dozen entirely; how many more were taken away, I cannot say. The watchman told him in his way to Queen-square, he had better tell who was with him; he said, he knew nothing about them, he was going by promiscuously; the man told him going by if he would help him up with the basket, and go in for two or three bottles that were handy, he would give him one for his trouble. That is all he would say. When he went down for the bottles, the watchman closed the door upon him that is the way he was detained.</p>

When I came to Mr. Bloomfield's door, I found his trap door open; I waited a moment or so; I heard the noise of a foot among the broken bottles; I called to the watchman, and bid him pull the bell. I pulled out my pistol; I put the trap door too, and stood there untill we disturbed the Landlord. I told the Landlord to come down, there were robbers in the cellar; I went down with the pistol in my hand; I saw the prisoner,

The next day I searched his lodgings again. I found in the cupboard this empty pistol.</p>

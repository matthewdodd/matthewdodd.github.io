On the 28th of November she came for a gown, which she had paid something on - she bought a shawl, and as she went out, I thought something projected nacer her arm; she crossed the street - I called her back; she said she could not come- I went and caught her about twenty yards off, and found she had this waistcoat; I let her go, but on returning, missed the stays from the counter; I followed her, and found she had them - she said she was going to bring them back; she was very much intoxicated, and might have taken them by mistake - part of them hung, out not concealed; she said she did not know she had them.</p>

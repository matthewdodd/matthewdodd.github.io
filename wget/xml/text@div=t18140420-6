               <p>Q. Do you recollect anything happening on the 7th of March - A. A person of the name of Chinnery was brought into our shop by a person of the name of Pickelt. The person that was brought in was the prisoner at the bar; he was brought in about a quarter before nine at night. It was not a very dark night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any proper remains of day-light - A. That I cannot say. When Pickett brought the prisoner in, he produced a china cup to me, and asked me if it was mine. He said he saw the prisoner take the cup out of the window. I looked at the window, and missed the cup. I then took the prisoner to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing the matter with the window - A. It had been cracked, and had been puttied for some time.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the hole that was broken in large enough to admit a hand to take out your china ware - A. Yes; the cup stood almost to the pane of glass that was broken; the saucer belonging to the cup might touch the pane, it was so near the window as that. I had observed the cup in the window in the afternoon. The pane of glass was whole, out the puttied part. Between five and six o'clock I took the things in; there was nothing missing then; the glass was whole then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to look for the cup, that was the first time that you missed it, was it - A. Yes. I did not know any thing was broken until then.</p>

            . I live in the City-road. On the evening of the 7th of March, I was in Pitfield-street between eight and nine o'clock; I was opposite of Mrs. Brittle's; I observed a suspicious character whistling. I looked round; I observed the prisoner at Mrs. Brittle's shop window; the person that whistled before, whistled again. The prisoner went to the window; I observed him draw his hand from the window, and put his hand into his pocket. He left the window. I followed him, and collared him; I asked him what he had been doing at the window. He denied doing any thing but looking in at the window. I desired him to come into the house with me. I kept my hand round his wrist, with the cup in his own hand. When I got him into Mrs. Brittle's, I took the cup from him and asked her if she knew the cup; she said, yes. I gave it her. I observed the window had been cracked; a piece had been forced out at the bottom of the pane of glass.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181404200009"></xptr>We took the prisoner to the watchhouse. I have had the cup in my possession ever since. This is the cup.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The cup is the same sort that I had in my window; I had the complete set in my window; one is missing.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence; called two witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Sampson Low, a bookseller, in Lamb's Conduit-street. On the 12th of November, 1839, the prisoner came into the shop and gave me a note, which was fictitious, from a person in Ely-place, and asked for a prospectus—I went to ask my father what answer I should give, and was not absent half a minute, I returned and caught sight of the prisoner's coat going out of the door—I missed four volumes which had been under my eye while speaking to him—we have never recovered them—I had not seen him before, but about three months ago he brought in a note in the same handwriting as before—I did not serve him, but just caught sight of him as he was going out of the door—I went out, but was too late to catch him—he came again on the 10th of November with another note in the same handwriting—lean swear that he is the person who came in November last year.</p>

After we had miss'd the Goods, one Mr. Andrews , a Carman, came upon the Keys with his Cart, and brought with him the Firkin and the Prisoner. We always land our Butter from on board the Hoys before Day-light; and as soon as I had landed them, I told thirty-one Firkins . In half and Hour afterward, I miss'd one, mark'd D.D. No.4. My Father marks his Goods with D.D. because he has a Brother named Joseph, and if our Goods were mark'd I.D. we should not know them from his.</p>

             . On the 22d of October, about Five in the Morning, I met the Prisoner with a Firkin of Butter on his Back, by the Postern on Tower-Hill. Hey, says I, where are you going with that Firkin so soon this Morning? He told, me, he was going to Iron-Gate with it, in order to carry it by Water to one Jones's at Deptford . I ask'd him from whence he brought it; he said he had it from Butolph-Wharf , from a Waterman. Aye, says I, but I am afraid you stole it yourself, and I bid my Man (who was with my Cart) get me a Candle, and when I saw the Marks, I knew it to be Mr. Delafield's ; so I threw it up in my Cart, and took hold of the Prisoner's Shoulder to bring him back. As we came along, he endeavour'd to stip from me. Nay, now, says I, I find you are a Rogue, and I gave him a Polt with my Whip. When I came to Dice-Key, I found them searching for the Butter. Here, here, says I, here's your Butter, and here's the Thief. When he was carry'd before Sir

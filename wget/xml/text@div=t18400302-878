                  </hi>. I am a widow, living in Collingwood-street, Bethnal-green. On the 7th of February I missed four shirts, two petticoats, two frocks, one pair of trowsers, a fustian jacket, a shift, a night-gown, a pair of socks, and various things of the child's; also two coarse aprons, a neck-handkerchief, and several other handkerchiefs, from a dirty clothes-bag—there are some children living in my house—I called them to me—a child named Grove, whose father and mother lived in a room of mine, in the same house, told me something, in consequence of which, I and my brother-in-law, and Grove, went to the shop of a man named Rakley, a</p>

               <p>marine-store dealer in Old Cock-lane—I saw the prisoner there, standing at the counter—he appeared as a servant—I asked him if he knew the boy Grove—he said he did not—I told him that the boy said he was the per<lb></lb>son who bought the things of him—he said I must look in in the morning, when Mr. Rakley would be in the way, he knew nothing about it—I do not know that the boy made any answer—the next morning Mr. Rakley came and fetched me to his shop—we did not find any thing of mine—we went into another shop—a man turned up two bundles of things, and there was nothing of mine—by that time Mr. Rakley was in the shop, and in coming out of the other shop; a man brought me this handkerchief—I do not know the name of the man—I knew the handkerchief—it was mine—in the course of that day I got three boy's shirts from Mr. Rakley—they were mine—they were dirty when they were taken from me, but clean when they were brought back—this was on the Saturday morning—there is a young woman named Uestie living with me—I went on Monday to Rakley's shop again with Grove, and saw the prisoner there—the pri<lb></lb>soner said he had no knowledge of Grove, he might have been there, and he asked the boy if he had sold the frock there—he said he had, that he was the man he had sold it to, and he had given him 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—the pri<lb></lb>soner said he knew nothing about it—these are some of the articles I missed—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—I have not found the others.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single, and live with Mrs. Tillett. On the 2nd of February I recollect changing my gown in the prosecutrix's back room—it was a light-blue colour, with green and red flowers—I put it into a box, or a bag, in the prosecutrix's room—I missed it—I saw the boy Grove—in consequence of something he told me I went with him to Rakley's, and saw the prisoner there, standing behind the counter—Grove said he had sold the frock there, and that the prisoner gave him a penny for it—the prisoner said he had no knowledge of the boy; the frock was not there; and if I would call in the morning, if it was there, he would return it to me; but he was quite certain it was not—I then got a policeman, and went with him—Grove then said to the prisoner that he was the man—he was then taken into custody—he asked me what my frock was worth, and said,</p>

I am ten years old—I live with my father and mother, in the prosecutrix's house—I used to play with her children sometimes—we used to go up stairs into her room—two or three days before I was taken by a policeman I took some things—the first time I took the shirts from the room, and the second time Uestie's gown, from the bag—I took them to Mr. Rakley's rag-shop twice—I took the shirts the first time—I saw the prisoner, and he told me to put them in the scale—he gave me 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them, and threw them into a large basket—he did not say any thing else to me—I did not say any thing about these things—I was afterwards spoken to by Mrs. Tillett—I told her something—I went to Mr. Rakley's with her, and saw him and the prisoner there—MRS. Tillett asked him if he knew me, and he said, no, he had no knowledge of me—I said that was the man that bought them of me, and I showed the basket where he had <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> them into—he said he would rather pay it out of hit own pocket than have any <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> about it.</p>

Tillett asked me about these things—I do not know why I did not tell the truth then—I stole an apron three months ago—I cannot remember the first thing I stole—I do not know what it was—I be<lb></lb>gan to take things a good bit ago—I have lived with Mrs. Tillett almost a year—I had stolen nothing before I went there—I began there—my mother is a shoe-binder, and my father a weaver—I had been at a charity school, but not long—when I went into the rag-shop I saw the prisoner there—MRS. Tillett asked me if that was the man, and I said, "Yes"—I cannot say the Lord's Prayer—I only saw one man in the rag-shop.</p>

On the morning of 25th May, about 12.30, I was in Westbourne Park—Rowe had made a communication to me about 12.15 that night, and I went with him to 23, Newton Road—I was met at the kitchen door by Mr. Phillips, senior, who said something to me, and I followed him up stairs into the dining-room, where I saw the deceased lying near the fire-place; a round table, with several bottles on it, was in the room; a bowl of bloody water was on the floor by the body; there were two chairs at the table, as if people had been sitting there; no white cloth was on the table, and I am not sure there was any cloth—the drawing-room is on the same floor, just opposite, separated by a small hall—I found the prisoner sitting on the sofa behind the door, in the act of pulling off her jacket, the inside of which was lined with white, and was saturated with blood—the upper part of her clothing under the jacket was saturated with blood, and her hair was very much disarranged—Mr. Phillips, jun., was in the room with her—I said to her "You must consider yourself in my custody; you will have to go to the police-station"—she made no reply, but Mr. Phillips, jun., said "Policeman, you had better leave the room"—I said "I must see that the room is secure before I leave"—Mr. Phillips said "I will be answerable for her"—she sat on a sofa behind the door during that conversation—I went outside the door, and it was closed after me—Mr. Phillips, sen., was standing in the hall—I went with him into the dining-room again, and found this knife in the fender, with a small trifle of blood on the side of the blade—I took charge of it—shortly afterwards a person came to the house, who gave the name of Captain Davey—Sergeant Woonton afterwards came—the fender was oval, rather enclosing the grate, and the knife was in it, but I could not see it till I got close to the fire-place—no fire was in the grate—there was a basket on the table with some knives in it—they were all in the basket except this one—I noticed it on the table when I first went into the room.</p>

I was parlour maid to the prisoner sixteen months, at 23, Newton Road—I knew her as Mrs. Davey—I knew the deceased gentleman, Mr. Moon; he was in the habit of coming there two or three times a week, and used to dine there—on Wednesday, 24th May, he came about 5 o'clock—I let him in, the prisoner was then in the billiard room—he went either into the drawing or dining room—he afterwards went into the billiard room, and I took a bottle of champagne there, by Mrs. Davey's order—they dined about 7 o'clock, and I waited at table, very little of the champagne was drank in the billiard room, and I took the bottle into the dining room—Mr. Moon walked round the garden before dinner—besides the champagne, this pint decanter of sherry was on the dinner table—very little of it has been taken out—there was also this claret bottle, I do not know whether it was full—the claret bottle was in the side board drawer—I do not know anything about how it came on the table—I was the only attendant who waited on them—I placed the brandy bottle on the table after the dinner was cleared, it was not on the table at dinner time at all—Mrs. Davey drank a small quantity of ale at dinner—I brought up no other drink after dinner, but I placed the sherry bottle and the champagne on the table after dinner, and Miss Pook brought up a bottle of Burgundy—dinner was over about 8.30, and I cleared away the things; the knife basket was then on the shelf, which is a raised part of the sideboard—I do not mean a drawer, but the part upon which things go—the sideboard consists of two pedestals, and there is a shelf under the top of the sideboard, which is visible, open to the eye—there was a plate basket by the side of the knife basket, I had put them there, they were always kept there—the poultry carver was in the basket, it had not been used during dinner—after the things had been cleared, Miss Dulin and Miss Pook were sent for from the billiard room—they were on a visit to Mrs. Davey—they were sent for to dessert, or to wine after dinner—I brought up this bottle of olives (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) while the ladies were there—about 9.30 o'clock, Mr. George Phillips, jun., came, I opened the door and showed him into the drawing-room—I went into the dining-room to announce him, Mr. Moon was then sitting in the same place he occupied at dinner, on a chair with hte back to the door, facing the window—the prisoner was sitting in an easy chair between the fire place act the window—I thought she looked as if she had been crying; she told me to show Mr. Phillips into the drawing-room, and then went into the drawing room to see him—she was only there a few minutes, and then he went away—a little more than half an hour after, I heard the dining-room bell ring very loud, and then the call bell at the top of the house, in the servant's bedroom—it is a very small house, only two storeys—I then heard Mrs. Davey scream "Run for a doctor"—I rushed out of the house with</p>

During the sixteen months I have been in the prisoner's service I knew Mr. Moon as coming to visit her two or three times a week, but not so often at first as lately—during her illness he came oftener than before—she had been seriously ill, and only got out of bed, I think, on the Sunday week before—Mr. Phillips says it was the Sunday before; whether I am right or not, I am not positive—she had been ill altogether about seven weeks—she was in bed about four weeks before the Sunday when she got up, but she had been up a time or two—she was so ill as to require rest for so long a time—they used to dine much in the same fashion, having their wine and champagne—they always treated each other affectionately; she was kind and affectionate to him, and he to her—the young ladies had been visiting there about a week—Mr. Moon enjoyed their society—they used to play on the piano to him—the prisoner used to sing before her illness—their society was pleasant to Mr. Moon—they were lively and agreeable—the prisoner had been out riding that day, and she left a message with Mrs. Toynbee for Mr. Moon if he called—Mr. Moon called the prisoner Flo, she called him Fred, and they always seemed very much attached to each other—when Mr. Moon was in the garden on this day, I noticed he appeared despondent and depressed—he was only there a short time, looking at the flowers—I did not go into the room when the prisoner re<lb></lb>turned from seeing Mr. Phillips—they dined alone—I do not think Mr. Moon was expected to dinner that day—there was an arrangement for the prisoner and the two young ladies and Mrs. Toynbee to dine together, but when Mr. Moon came, that waft altered, and extra dinner ordered—there was some broiled fowl for dinner, but the poultry knife was not used for that—I am certain of that, because I always take the dirty knives down stairs when I clear the dinner—I have a separate basket for the purpose, and if it had been used I should have taken it away—I remember the young ladies going in after dinner—I believe that was done for the purpose of amusing Mr. Moon, and keeping up his spirits—I noticed he was gloomy, but when the young ladies went in he appeared in better spirits, and laughed and joked with them—I do not know of his throwing a bottle into the lap of one of them as a joke, but he was joking when I took the olive bottle into the room—that was a little before 9 o'clock, I left the young ladies in the room, they remained there some little time, but they were playing the piano in the drawing-room when Mr. Phillips came—the drawing and dining-rooms are on the same floor—there is a passage between them—the prisoner seemed to have been crying when I announced Mr. Phillips, her eyes looked very red, but I do not know whether she had sent for him—I showed him into the drawing-room where the ladies were—I do not know whether they then left the drawing room, and went to the billiard-room—I went to announce him to the prisoner—Mr. Moon remained in the dining-room when the young ladies went into the drawing-room—the drawing-room door was open, but the dining-room door was shut—they might have been playing to amuse themselves then—after I heard the cry, she was crying out to send for a doctor, and wringing her hands—she appeared in a state of very great distress—almost everybody in the house was sent for a doctor, and three or</p>

               <p>between the time I left the sitting-room with Miss Pook, and my hearing the scream, I am not certain—I did not hear a fall when I was up stairs—I was talking to Mrs. Toynbee, and attending to her—I don't think I should have heard anybody walking about in the sitting-room, or persons talking—when I went into the dining-room I stopped a very short time, but the prisoner appeared very much overwhelmed with grief—I did not know for certain what was the matter with Mr. Moon, but I saw blood on his trowsers—she appeared almost mad with grief, and was screaming and sobbing in the most dreadful manner—she said several times "Fetch a doctor," and I went for one—she was in the same excited state when I returned, and appeared almost mad with grief—I was very excited and frightened—when she said "I fear I did it" she did not use the word "struggle"—I have said that she was madly excited—she was continuing to sigh and sob when I came back—it was in the intervals of her screaming that she said "I fear I did it"—it did not appear to me that she was apparently unconscious of how it had occurred, from what she said to me.</p>

I fear I did it!" she repeated that twice; she was in a state of considerable agitation—I did not notice the knife basket on the table or the sideboard when I left the dining-room, but it was kept on the sideboard—when I returned, after the scream, I saw it was on the table.</p>

I live at 37, Princes Square, Bays<lb></lb>water—I have known the prisoner some time—she was originally my father's patient—he is also a medical man—I attended her at his request—I saw her on the morning of 24th May, and had some conversation with her—I saw her again at 9.30 at night—she came into the drawing-room to me, and said "Oh, doctor, can you call again in an hour; <hi rend="italic">Fred,</hi> is going on so" I knew who <hi rend="italic">Fred,</hi> was; I had seen Mr. Moon—I always thought he was her step-brother—after seeing her for a few minutes, I left her—I went back again, in consequence of a message, about 10.20—I think I saw Mrs. Toynbee—I went into the dining-room—the prisoner was there—she said nothing—Mr. Moon was lying on his back, rather inclined towards the left side, and in a dying condition—the prisoner was lying on the ground, with half her body on the deceased, trying to open his neck-tie and shirt—I was under the impression that he was in a fit, in consequence of the message I had—I ultimately found a wound—I asked for some brandy, and this brandy bottle was produced—he was not quite dead when I arrived, but in a dying condition—he lived, I should say, about six minutes—I passed ray finger into the wound soon after his death, and was able to feel that the heart had been penetrated—I found out before he died that it was not a fit—I searched the room after his death, and found this poultry carver in the fender—Dr. Royston came before he actually died—he was perfectly insensible from the first—some time after his death, I went into the drawing-room, and saw the prisoner—as far as I remember, I said "Good God! how did this happen?"—her answer was, "I don't know how it was; I fear I must have done it in the scuffle"—she said they had had some words about her daughter—the wound must have been inflicted a very few minutes before I arrived—I put my finger in its whole length; I got down to the opening between the ribs, which was at the end of my finger, and I knew then that the heart must have been penetrated—life could not have been existing after that—on Friday morning, the 26th, about thirty-five hours after death, I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, in the presence of Dr. Savory, Dr. Westmacott, Dr. Royston, and my father—I made notes of the result of the examination—nothing appeared on the external part of the body, but a wound on the left side, under the arm, commencing a little bit forward to the side, I should think an inch forward—it was situated 71/2 inches from the middle line of the chest bone; that would bring you to one extremity of the wound; and 91/2 inches from the middle bone of the spine would bring you to the other—I did not take the measure of the body at that part—the direction of the wound was downwards, inwards, and forwards—the entire length of it was about 6 inches—it eventually passed between the ribs, but first of all, it passed between the flesh and the ribs, parallel with the ribs, one might almost say, and then dipped in between the sixth and seventh ribs—it had passed through the anterior border of the upper lobe of the left lung, through the pericardium, into the left ventricle of the heart—the end of the wound was in the apex of the heart, the ventricle—that was what I ascertained on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—the other organs of the body were healthy—there was not the least doubt of the cause of death—death must have been instantaneous, or nearly so.</p>

               <p>examined before the Magistrate, I had not made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I had traced the wound by putting my finger in, and from what I then observed I gave my evidence—I said before the Magistrate, "I examined him, and found a wound on the left side, about an inch and a half in diameter, it took rather an upward direction, and inwards"—when I found the body in the position in which it then was, the direction was upwards first of all, it then took a turn down—the wound in the skin I am speaking of, the first part of the wound, not the last part where it reached the apex of the heart—it did take an upward direction in the position in which the arm was—it was upwards, under the skin first—I did not think that the blade of the knife had gone upwards—I don't think it extraordinary that I should have made that observation, because by changing the position of the arm, you change the position of the flesh and the direction of the wound—the arm coming down would bring the outer flesh over the inward part of the wound—if had not made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination I should have always been convinced that the wound had had an upward direction, the first part of it; the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> rectified that opinion—of course keeping the arm back it would not be in the same lobe—I did pass my finger upwards, I should think perhaps an inch or half an inch, between half an inch and one inch—I put my finger between the ribs, and found that the heart had been pene<lb></lb>trated, but that was the external part of the wound—in order to reach it, I had to pass my finger up—the whole of a wound is internal when it breaks the skin—I put my finger between the ribs, and convinced myself from that, and also from the great hemorrhage, that the heart had been penetrated—did all that, and yet seemed of opinion that the wound took an upward direction from the opening—I was not of opinion that it took an upward direction of two or three inches, only about an inch—I would not under<lb></lb>take to say positively that the wound could not have been inflicted in a scuffle—the body, falling on the blade of the knife, might give the same sort of wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I saw the wound at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem,</hi> and could trace it from its entrance into the body till it reached the apex of the heart—it was bared for the express purpose of the examination, and from the result of that examination, I say that the wound was downwards, inwards, and forwards—there was a decided turn inwards, at the latter part of it, towards the centre of the body I saw no upward tendency—there would be a difference if the wound was inflicted with the arm up, or the arm down, a difference in the situation of the muscles between the ribs at the moment of puncturing—I should think, from that, that it is more probable that the arm was up at the time the blow was inflicted—I say that, from what I observed at first, and afterwards; I mean, of course, the left arm—a person standing in front, and inflicting a blow of that description, the direction of the wound would not be the same; the wound would not have taken the forward direction; I account for the forward direction, from the wound being given from the side, and somewhat at the back; whether it was inflicted by any person or by accident—supposing him to have fallen on the knife, such a wound could only have happened if it struck some article of furniture, or some resisting body—the handle of the knife must have been fixed against some point—there must have been a certain power of resistance, whatever given by—if the knife were placed over the wound, in the direction that the wound took, and he fell backwards and struck an article of furniture or the wall, so as to offer resistance to the handle of the knife, the wound might have been pro<lb></lb>duced</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100067"></xptr>
               <p>—the backward action of the man would develope the forward action of the knife—any impetus given to the knife, from whatever cause, might produce the wound—a fall against any body sufficient to resist it, would be enough to produce the wound.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Can you say what amount of force would be necessary to produce a wound of that length? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I could not tell the amount of pounds or hundredweights; a fall must have been a very violent one to have done it—I could not tell the amount of pounds' pressure that would be necessary to project the knife into the body—I think it is possible that the appearance of the wound on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, might have been caused by the deceased falling on the knife, supposing a struggle to have existed, and the deceased to have taken the knife from the hands of the prisoner, and fallen backward, and the handle of the knife to have rested against some solid substance, such as the sofa or the floor, I quite think that possible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and am surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of Mr. Moon—I found an external wound on the left side of the chest, between the sixth and seventh ribs—the wound passed in an oblique direction, forwards, in wards, and downwards, so that the end of the wound in front was 2 inches lower than the end of the wound behind; that represents the dip; the angle was 2 inches, in a little over 5—the wound was perfectly straight in direction from end to end—such an instrument as this knife would produce it—I can give no accurate estimate of the force required to produce the wound—it must have been considerable—I can't use a more exact term than that—I saw the clothes through which it had penetrated; a coat, waistcoat, and shirt—the wound was above the band of the trowsers—the lower end of the wound reached the apex of the heart—there was not the slightest tendency of an upward character in the wound, that I could make out—there is not the slightest difficulty, that I can see, in a weapon going in between the sixth and seventh ribs, taking a downward direction, and reaching the apex of the heart—the ribs are very obliquely placed, so that what would be between the sixth and seventh ribs, at the spot where this wound occurred, still digging downwards, would appear between the fifth and sixth, or behind the sixth rib, where the point of the heart beats—the ribs are all inclined downwards—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a photograph from a male subject, the only one at my command, taken in the dissecting room of St. Bartholomew's—this white rod, or arrow, shows the direction of the wound, and how it would go between the sixth and seventh ribs—it was suggested that there might be some difficulty in understanding</p>

               <p>the anatomy of the parts, and that this might assist—I am as certain as I can be of anything, because I saw it, that this wound was downwards through its whole course—this arrow shows the wound pretty accurately—the weapon must have gone between the ribs very obliquely, and then through a portion of the left lung, then through the sac of the heart, and then through the heart itself—looking at the situation of the wound, and the direction it took, my opinion is that it must have been inflicted by a stab from another person, and by one single blow—I am not able to suggest any theory by which a fall could, to my mind, satisfactorily account for it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I was requested by Mr. Moon's brother to attend the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I have been acquainted with the family for a long time, I hope I may say on friendly and intimate terms—I knew the deceased—I have known the family upwards of twenty years—the nature of the intimacy has been chiefly professional; not purely so; mostly—the deceased I had not seen for many years, except professionally—my intimacy with the family has been both that of friendship and pro<lb></lb>fessional—I believe it began professionally—I intended by this photograph to represent, as nearly as I could, the course of the wound in question—this represents where the knife entered, between the sixth and seventh ribs; you will see a little pin there, showing the situation of the external wound through the skin—the skin is removed there, of course, to show the ribs—the external wound would be as near as possible at the lower border of the sixth rib—I did not take this photograph—I tried the experiments myself, and in company also with Mr. Baker—he was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—he is a gentleman attached to our hospital as one of the surgical staff, and lecturer on physiology and anatomy—Mr. Phillips was not present—the suggestion came to me, from someone or other, that it would be as well to have it done—it was done al out a week ago—I can't say that I had heard at that time that medical evidence was likely to be called on behalf of the prisoner—I think the attorney for the prosecution mentioned to me in conversation, that someone had suggested to him it would be as well to have a photograph of the parts involved, the ribs—he suggested that I should get as accurate a representation as I could of the direction the wound took—he did not tell me that surgical witnesses were likely to be called on the prisoner's behalf—I had not heard of it—I hope you will not cross-examine me upon Mr. Phillips' evidence; I have not the slightest objection to be cross-examined on my own—I heard Mr. Phillips state that the wound took a downward direction for 3 inches, and afterwards an inward course—this photograph does not represent such a course, because the wound was straight—I differ from Mr. Phillips' description of it to-ay materially—I did not request that this diagram should not be shown to Mr. Phillips when he appeared here, or that he should not be asked about it—I gave no sort of opinion at all—I do not speak at all in a disparaging tone of Mr. Phillips; on the contrary, I say I have expressed no opinion about it at all; anyone might see it—he has not seen it, nor was he consulted—his was the hand that made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; I and Mr. Baker were looking on—it is right to say that when I wished to verify an observation, I did it with my own hand—I took the direction of the wound and measured it—the evidence given by Mr. Phillips to-day does not convey a fair impression of the wound; I mean not a correct one—it was not because I had no confidence in his judgment that I did not consult him—I should have done this quite alone, if Mr. Baker had not been in the hospital—he lives there—I had not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100069"></xptr>
               <p>the slightest reason for not showing this to Mr. Phillips—when I made it, I did not know that I differed from him—from the description he has given to-day, I do—I understand him to describe the direction of the wound as changing in its course; that it went first in one direction and then in another—I gathered that from his description of the wound—I refer to that part of his evidence in which he implied that the direction of the wound changed—I say there was no upward tendency at all—I suppose it is possible that in a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of this kind, two gentlemen of equal professional eminence may honestly come to a different conclusion as to the course which such a wound took—it is what you look at, and see; it is a matter of fact—I was present before the Coroner, and heard Mr. Phillips examined—I beg pardon, I did not hear him examined, nor at the Police Court; I was present at both examinations, but my evidence was taken as soon as I got there, and I was allowed to go as soon as it was over; stop, let me correct myself; I may have been in the place at the time he gave evidence before the Coroner, but I did not hear it given; I was there waiting to be examined—I don't know that he was examined in my presence—I have read his evidence—I did not read it before I had this photograph done; that had no sort of reference to his evidence—I had read the news<lb></lb>papers; I had not read the deposition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If the blade of the knife had entered lower down than the sixth and seventh ribs than you have placed it, would that have rendered it difficult for the apex of the left venticle of the heart to be reached, except by an upward movement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; not at all, because the point of the heart moves, it is not a fixed thing; the point of the heart is usually found after death behind the cartilage of the sixth rib, and at the end of a very deep inspiration the point beats below the cartilage of the sixth rib; the whole of the ribs rise and the heart sinks—it is my judgment that the wound was a single uninterrupted wound, delivered by some one making a stab—I cannot account for it by the deceased falling on the knife, I believe it to be impossible—I have not stated that I did not think it impossible—I will not swear, neither do I, that it is impossible, but I believe it to be impossible—I will not swear it is impossible, because my judgment may err—I said before the Coroner, "If the knife were fixed, a man by falling on it might have produced such a wound," that was with reference to his weight—assuming that the whole weight of the body could have been brought to bear upon the knife, it might have produced such a wound, but I don't see how that could have happened—I will not swear that even that is absolutely impossible—the heart is not represented in this photograph—the ribs were painted white, that they might catch the light—this shows directly the direction the wound took when it went in—I should like to add that I am sorry if in any way I implied indirectly the least reflection on Mr. Phillips.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I did not intend to disparage him—I do not agree with him in the description he has given of the wound—when I said before the Coroner that, if the knife was fixed a man by falling upon it might have produced such a wound, I was then being examined as to how much force it would take to inflict a wound of that sort—if the knife were fixed and the man's whole weight came upon it, it would go to that extent, only a man's weight could not come upon it—to the best of my judgment it is impossible that such a wound could be produced by a fall—I really can have no shadow of doubt as to what was the direction of the wound, or whether it was one straight course; I saw it, it was a matter of visual observation—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100070"></xptr>
               <p>I think the force must have been from without, inward, from behind forwards, and from above, downwards; in other words, in the direction of the knife—the difficulty of reconciling it with any fall is, that the wound should be from above downwards—if the body was falling, it must have been from below upwards—the weight of the body would give force enough to cause such a wound, if it could be applied—that would presume that the body must be in an inverted position—it could not be standing in a natural position.</p>

                  </hi>. I had attended Mrs. Davey for some months pre<lb></lb>vious to this—it was through me that my son was introduced to her, and also attended her—on the night of 24th May, I was sent for by my son to 23, Newton Street—I went there and found the doors all open, so that I was able to walk in—I found Mr. Moon lying on the rug in front of the fire-place, dead—I afterwards went into the drawing-room, and there found Mrs. Davey—her first words were "Oh, doctor, how is he?"—I said "He is dead, Mrs. Davey"—she said "Dead! dead! impossible!"—I said "Yes, it is really so, Mrs. Davey"—she then fell into a swoon in the chair, and when she recovered she said "Oh, doctor, I am afraid it is I that have done it! oh, doctor, I am afraid it is I that have done it!"—I said "Impossible, Mrs. Davey, you could not have done it"—she said "I really think it was so"—I had examined the wound before I said that—her words were "I really think it must be so, but I don't know how it happened"—I said "For God's sake, explain yourself, Mrs. Davey"—she then said "We were both sitting after dinner, <hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi> said something which annoyed me excessively"—I don't remember that she said of whom he was speaking; that she then said to him "Don't repeat it, I can't bear it;" that he said "I will repeat it, and if you are not silent, I will fling a bottle at your head"—she then said "I jumped up with the knife in my hand, we struggled and fell, I saw the blood pouring out, and I did not know how"—I said "Then I must send for your husband; where is he?"—she said "I believe he is at his club, my servant shall go for him directly"—that was the whole of the conversation—she asked me to go and see the deceased again, and begged to be allowed to go and kiss his face—I told her she must keep still till her husband came home—I then went out and made a communication to the police—when I first entered the room I noticed that the knife basket was lying on the table opposite the window.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. She was in great grief and distress at the time she made this statement to me—I understood from her statement that she was unconscious of the exact way in which this had occurred; that was my impression from her description—I was present in the room at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—I could not possibly say that the wound might not have happened accidentally in the scuffle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My impression is that the blow was received whilst the deceased's arm was being uplifted—I should like to give my reasons for that—I think I was the first that explored the wound; I tried to pass my finger in the direction that the wound appeared to me externally—I failed to do so, my finger would not go through—I then attempted to pass my finger downwards, it would not go in that direction—I then passed it upwards, and I found that it would go in that direction, and then the finger passed between the ribs directly under the heart—that leads me to the conclusion that the arm was up, because when the arm is uplifted the skin is lifted, therefore, what appeared a direct wound at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem,</hi> may still have</p>

               <p>appeared an indirect wound immediately after it occurred—coupling the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> appearances with what I observed at the time, I should say the direction of the wound was very fairly described by Mr. Savory—he had not the opportunity of examining the wound at the time I had—at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> the whole course of the wound was laid bare from point to point—I have no doubt Mr. Savory's description of the direction of the wound was correct, as he saw it; but the direction varied from the time I saw it in the way I have described, the muscle being raised by the arm being raised.</p>

I am assistant surgeon, and lecturer on physiology, at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—I was present at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination of Mr. Moon—I heard Mr. Savory give the description of the result of that examination, and I entirely agree with him—the wound was downwards, forwards, and inwards—I believe it to have gone in a uniform direction—I was present at the arrangement of the cheat of a patient at the hospital for the purpose of showing that a weapon might go through the ribs in a slanting direction, and yet reach the apex of the heart—there is no difficulty in a weapon going between the sixth and seventh ribs, and reaching the apex of the heart—that arises from what Mr. Savory describes as the obliquity of the ribs.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. The wound went downwards, forwards, and inwards, those three words express the same direction—I mean that neither of them is incompatible with the other—each of those terries means something different, but they are all perfectly consistent, and exclude the opinion of an upward direction—the orifice of the wound was about an inch and a half—supposing it was a stab, the orifice would be larger than the width of the instrument stabbing—I see no difficulty in that—you have a knife, one side of which is a cutting one, it would be in the highest degree probable if you stick it into a body, that the edge would divide the integuments through which it passes—it would be im<lb></lb>possible that the line taken by the knife, should be mathematically straight—the wound is nearly twice the width of the instrument that makes it, because if you pass a knife through the skin, one end of which is a cutting one, the chances are you will make a wound larger than the diameter of the knife—I cannot tell, from the appearance of the wound, which part was nearer to the shoulder—those three definitions exclude the notion that the wound may have taken an oblique direction upwards—with those three-elements in the course of the wound, it still may be direct—the orifice of the wound being somewhat larger than the width of the knife that made it, would depend upon whether the sharp part was upwards or down wards. (<hi rend="italic">The witness here made a sketch of the position of the wound.</hi>) I did not take notice at the time of the width of the wound, but Dr. Westmacott took notes in writing—Mr. Savory is a coadjutor of mine at the hospital—I approve of this diagram (<hi rend="italic">the photograph</hi>) except that the entrance was a little larger than this—the knife went between the sixth and seventh ribs—I did not make any drawing of the course of the wound at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. PHILLIPS</hi> (<hi rend="italic">re-examined</hi>). These are the rough notes I made—no drawing was made—and I believe no other minute was made but this rough note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">W. W. BAKER</hi> (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>) I did this rough drawing of the course of the wound according to the best of my judgment and belief of what I saw at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>—it is not physically impossible that the wound arose from an accident—I have examined wounds from stabs in the course of my practice, but I have no special experience—my experience is founded on my general knowledge of anatomy and surgery—I don't know an instance of a struggle for a knife with an innocent intention, and a party falling on it and being wounded to death; but I think such a case far from impossible—the weight of Mr. Moon's body falling on a knife, would be quite sufficient to produce such a wound, if the knife was fixed—it is not physically impossible that if Mr. Moon, in a struggle, had seized hold of this knife, or of the arm which held it, and in the struggle had fallen on the prisoner, or the prisoner on him, that it might have produced such a wound: or if the prisoner caught hold of his arm, or he of hers—I use the word physically in con<lb></lb>tradiction to what is called morally impossible; I mean that it is not contrary to natural laws—I do not wish to qualify the words "physically, impossible" in any way—in my judgment it would not probably happen by an accident—though I say that it is not physically impossible, I have not formed the opinion that it occurred in that way—I have formed the opinion that Mr. Savory has formed, that it was produced by a stab—I consider it in the highest degree impossible that the wound was caused accidentally—I should hardly think it likely that gentlemen in my pro<lb></lb>fession, of equal position with myself, might, with the same facts before them, form a totally different opinion, but I am not prepared to say—I attended the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem,</hi> and was introduced into this case at Mr. Savory's instance—I attended with him on behalf of the family—I was not ac<lb></lb>quainted with the family at all—I have been two years lecturer on physic<lb></lb>ology at St. Bartholomew's and six or seven years at the college.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I think everybody would be able to form a very good judgment as to the wound going downwards, forwards, and inwards; common sense might dictate part, but a medical man might form an opinion better—by downwards I mean, from the head towards the feet; by inwards, in a direction from the side of the body to the middle line—I don't think I could give a diagram inwards on a piece of flat paper, I could give the direction alone—I could represent a breast-bone, and the upper surface, but by a mere line without shading, I could not represent it on a flat surface.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked what you mean by physically impossible, and you say, not contrary to any natural law, if you find a man with a hole on the top of his head, it would not be physically impossible that he should have turned a somersault and done it, and that is what you mean by not physically impossible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I agree perfectly with Mr. Savory, that the angular direction of the wound was 2 inches in 5 inches—when I speak of the wound being produced by Mr. Moon's weight, I speak of the amount of penetration into the body, irrespective of other circumstances—it is far from impossible for a person to fall on a knife and produce a wound which would cause death—that answer does not assume any particular position of the wound, or any particular position of the body—in forming a judg<lb></lb>ment in this case, I have viewed all the circumstances, the situation, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100073"></xptr>
               <p>direction of the wound, and so forth, and I believe it not to have been accidental.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Taking the view of the knife entering, we will not suggest any cause, but the elements involved mere direction and force? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a mathematical diagram would represent it—the diagonal of a cube would undoubtedly be downwards, forwards, and inwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say you can discover no ground for supposing this was an accidental wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—a blow from another person might be accidental or wilful, but an accidental puncturing would hardly be a blow—a person falling in a fit of delirium, or intoxication, would not be likely to produce such a wound, but it could not be impossible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a knife struck into the body enters the skin and punctures the flesh, would not the orifice be enlarged by withdrawing the knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very likely, indeed that would be a good way of accounting for the difference between the width of the orifice and the width of the blade—it is very likely that the act of withdrawing might enlarge the wound without reference to the direction the knife took when in the body—if the man fell on the knife, it would remain in the wound, unless someone else withdrew it, to do which the body must be turned over.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The apex of the heart had been punctured? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that would produce very speedy death—I believe it is in the highest degree im<lb></lb>probable that the deceased could have withdrawn the knife himself—I can-not say that death would be so speedy as to make that certain, but I have the firmest belief that that could not have been done.</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am a licentiate of the College of Physicians, and have two other appointments—I was sent for on the night of 24th May, and arrived about 10.20, as near as I can remember—Mr. George Phillips was there when I arrived, and the deceased was alive, but he lived a very short time—he gasped two or three times after my arrival—I have heard Mr. Baker, Mr. Savory, and Mr. Phillips, sen., examined—I concur in the testimony Mr. Savory and Mr. Baker have given—I was simply there through the courtesy of Mr. Phillips—I swear to the wound being for<lb></lb>wards, downwards, and inwards, and I say that it is possible it might have been done by an accident, but at the same time it is highly improbable.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I was examined before the Magistrate, but not before the Coroner—I was there, but it was not neces<lb></lb>sary, as he was satisfied with the medical evidence—I said before the Magis<lb></lb>trate that it was not absolutely impossible to have been accidental—I said "I think it possible that the wound might have been inflicted, supposing the knife had been fixed in her hand, and he had fallen against her, pro<lb></lb>vided the knife had been fixed"—I agree in substance with Mr. Baker.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. I have had cases of stabbing, but I never saw one of the same severity—I stated before the Coroner that an idea occurred to me that it might possibly have occurred in a struggle, and I thought over it, but I could not come to that conclusion, as I did not think it would take that direction—I meant that the other party seizing hold of the knife, and the deceased seizing hold of the arm at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100074"></xptr>
               <p>the same time, I thought it might possibly occur in that way by a fall, but I changed my mind afterwards, and before I had finished my evidence, I forgot what I said exactly—I volunteered that suggestion to the Coroner—nobody was on their trial—I tried to see if it might happen in that way, and I positively stated, on my oath, that it might have—I did not describe the struggle—the knife never touched the ribs, it went into the inter<lb></lb>costal space—I said, both before the Magistrate and the Coroner, that if the two persons were struggling together, and he fell on her, or she on him, it might have happened in that way—I picked up a piece of a comb, which Inspector Horsley, of the <hi rend="italic">X</hi> division trod on, and gave it to him, and the broken tooth with it—that has not been mentioned before—I was never asked about it—the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> was held in the parlour, and the piece of comb was under the table.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. It was an entire comb, except the piece which I found, which made it complete—I found both, and gave them to the inspector—Mr. Phillips will recollect the circumstance, because he kicked it, and trod upon it—I do not know whether it was a back or a side comb; it was such as ladies wear in their hair—I found it at the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—Mr. Phillips trod on it—I was present at the time, and took notes—I made a diagram of the course of the wound, and I made rough notes—I made a more perfect one afterwards—this is merely a pencil sketch I took of a portion of the lungs and the heart—I put them on a piece of a paper, one piece lapping over the other, to show the true position—it is a drawing I copied some years ago from Gray's Anatomy—I put as near as possible the entrance of the knife in through the integuments, and close to the apex of the heart—I have represented the wound entering between the sixth and seventh ribs, going in a diagonal direction, and never<lb></lb>theless entering the apex of the heart—I made a more finished diagram than that, showing the lungs lying over the heart—this shows the one lying on the other—the lung there is separated from the heart, but in this I fixed the lung on the heart, so as to show the two wounds together—the wood engraving represents the work as it was prepared before—it represents the anatomy of the parts, and I put in the pencil-marks.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then it struck the apex of the heart just on the border of the lower part of the sixth rib? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, not the lower part—it passed between the sixth and seventh ribs, and struck it near the upper part of the sixth rib—that was done by a direct wound, an inch and a half across—these are very rough notes, I did not intend them as evidence.</p>

I am a medical man, and knew the deceased very intimately—he was the greatest friend I had—I have known him about twenty years—I have also known the prisoner for some time—about a month before this I was present at a quarrel at 23, Newton Road—it was in the middle of dinner—Mr. Moon asked her if she had paid certain bills, she said "Yes"—a threat was used in the course of the quarrel—she said "By heavens! I will have your life some day!"—I knew the prisoner first about twelve years ago, but I only renewed the acquaintance fifteen months ago—about six weeks previous to this, one day after luncheon, at St. James's Street, I heard her say "By Jove! I will stab you some day i"—on the day after the catastrophe, about 1.50 in the afternoon, I went to her house in consequence of this telegram which I received—(I found that it had been sent by Mrs. Toynbee)—she said "Have not you heard the news?"—I said "No, what news?"—she said "What, have not you heard yet?"—I said "No, what is it?"—she said "Not about poor <hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi> Moon?"—I said "No"—she said "<hi rend="italic">Fred.</hi> Moon is dead"—I said "Good God! when did he die?"—she said "Last night"—I said "Where, in Portman Squaret" that id his father's house—she said "No, here"—I asked "What did he die of?"—she said "He got into one of his violent fits of passion, burst a blood vessel, and dropped down dead"—I wanted to see the body; she said "You can't go in, the door is locked"—I said "What a fool you were to send for the police, <hi rend="italic">Flo.</hi>"—there was a policeman in the hall when I went in—she said "There is going to be an inquest, you will see it in the papers"—she told me she expected his brother John and his brother-in-law there directly—I said I had rather not see them, and would not wait, and I left.</p>

Mr. Moon became acquainted with the prisoner about twelve years ago—there were occasional interruptions in their acquaintance; twice, I think—I first knew her under very different circumstances, and when I renewed my acquaintance, I was aware that she was living with Mr. Moon—I am assistant-surgeon in the Guards, and have been so thirteen and a half years—during the whole of that time I have known Mr. Moon—I have been in the habit of visiting constantly at 23, Newton Road, during the last twelve months, and sometimes meeting Mr. Moon, and sometimes not—I was not more than five or six minutes in her presence when she made the statement about his having burst a blood vesssel—I was on very friendly terms with her—I used to call her "<hi rend="italic">Flo</hi>"—I frequently dined there—sometimes there were young ladies there—Miss</p>

               <p>Dulin used to be there—I do not know her intimately, on my oath—I say "on my oath," because you used the word "intimately," and it was my impression that you meant criminally—if I am asked if I know a lady intimately, I consider that it means criminally, in some cases—I travelled with Mr. Moon on several occasions—I went as his guest; he paid my hotel bills—someone else travelled with us, whom he paid for also—a companion; not my companion—we travelled abroad—he used to pay my railway fare; I went as his guest entirely—he paid all my expenses—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a letter I wrote to the prisoner the day before the occurrence—I was constantly at the house, playing and singing, and joining in the entertainment, both when Mr. Mooon was there and when he was not—not almost every day, but very frequently, and taking my meals there—I was in the habit of writing to her as "My dear River"—I have written to her frequently in that way.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am surgeon to Charing Cross Hospital, and have been twenty-five years a lecturer on anatomy and surgery—I have heard the whole of the medical evidence, and the whole of the material evidence in this case, and I have read the evidence before the Coroner—I have seen the photographic diagram Mr. Savory produced—this drawing produced by Mr. Westmacott does not differ materially from Mr. Savory's—I believe that the wound on the deceased penetrating through the left side to the heart, might have been done accidentally, from the evidence I have heard—I did not attend the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem,</hi> and never examined the deceased—my evidence is founded on what I have heard in Court during the last two days, and what would happen under the circumstances—I have heard Mr. Savory's evidence, and assuming it is correct, I believe the wound might have been purely accidental—it is equally probable that it was caused by a stab or accidentally, and I think it is more probable, from the evidence, that it took place by pure accident than from an intentional stab—assuming it to have occurred as I believe it to have been done, purely as a matter of accident, the knife being held by Mrs. Davey dagger<lb></lb>ways, if she held it in her right hand so as to have a firm hold of it, and at the same moment her hand was instinctively upraised, it would be momentarily done under the aggravation of it being said that something would be thrown at her: Mr. Moon, I suppose, passed from where he was to her, and suddenly approached her with a view of wresting the instrument from her hand, he would come quickly to her with his left side, raise his left hand and arm, and grasp her hand or wrist, or the handle of the in<lb></lb>strument; her hand with the instrument would be suddenly drawn down by a natural instinct, and with his body close to it, it would go down into his chest; he would then have fallen, I believe, to the position in which he was found—if the wound had been inflicted that way, I believe it would have taken the course it did, which Mr. Savory explains—it went downwards, forwards, and inwards, between the skin and muscle, and through the space between the sixth and seventh ribs, injuring the front edge of the left lung, entering the back of the heart, and piercing its apex—I assume that Mr. Moon, either had his hand on the wrist or the handle of the knife, or grasping the hand; or if he first seized the wrist, that would make no matter; if I were to seize this knife, and take if from the table, I should assume an attitude of defence; a per<lb></lb>son coming to me from this side would have his left side towards me; he raises his hand, and as a matter of course exposes the left side of his body, and in trying to take the knife away, he draws down the hand, and also lessens the power of the muscles, which are in an upraised position, and obliquely downwards, forwards, and inwards, it passes into his body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">BY THE COURT</hi>. I have adopted this view from very deep consideration of all the circumstances, and among them is one I have not alluded to, as showing that Mr. Moon did upraise his hand beyond a distinctive move<lb></lb>ment, the arm must have been upraised and the wound inflicted; when the</p>

               <p>arm falls the muscles fall, and so it was that Mr. Phillips felt it to go a little upward—I assume the hand to be upraised with the knife in its grasp; how it came to be upraised, whether by the owner or not I cannot say, but I suppose it may have been the instinct to grasp the instrument—the view I entertain is, that Mr. Moon in seizing the hand, or the wrist, or the handle, drew it down—I do not suppose he raised it up first, I think he pushed it downwards from the beginning, and as his body was so near, it had just gone in; he drew it down suddenly, and the knife was made to enter his body.</p>

SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How would the wrist be drawn down I <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By the movement that he would make; if I were about to take a knife from the hand of a person, I should certainly and instinctively draw the hand down, because the higher the arm is raised the greater my danger—I think the prisoner's arm must have been raised some distance, fully this (<hi rend="italic">imitating</hi>), so as to give it the necessary impetus to drive it into the chest, which would require a great deal of force, and if I went to seize a knife in that way I should draw it downwards with all my force—I have never said the prisoner's arm was raised, I have said that it was depressed by Mr. Moon's left arm—I do not think a person could pull it down with the left hand with such force that it should be forwards, inwards, and downwards, there was no back action—this gentleman (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Phillips</hi>) represents Mrs. Davey, he takes the knife and he raises his arm, I as Mr. Moon, with my coat buttoned, come from this side and draw the arm, and I take this hand and draw it right down into my chest; if the coat had not been buttoned, some little irregularity would occur, but being buttoned, the knife goes instantly down, I may or may not use my right hand, but I draw it down with force enough to draw it into my chest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not impute to you anything but what is right and con<lb></lb>scientions, but you supposed the shoulder raised upwards before, now you have given a theory that her hand was raised up and he pulls it down? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I most fully intended to say that from the first, I mean that he raised his hand to that of Mrs. Davey—I believe the knife if kept at a distance would have far less chance of being withdrawn from the grasp than if it was drawn near.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Might this in any way be accomplished in a fall, in a struggle between two parties? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it might; if an effort were made by Mr. Moon to obtain the knife, he might have fallen on it; there is double resistance, the resistance of the hand that held it on one side and the weight of his body on the other—there must be some resistance; if I grasp a hand of another person there is force, there is power of resistance, and if I fall, the two together would do what has occurred, but I believe my view to be the case, though I cannot deny the possibility of the other—an accidental wound would tally in every way with the supposition I have made.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I understand the wound to be 61/2 inches from the breast bone here—supposing the wound to be between the sixth and seventh ribs, and taking the middle line, and one inch forward, that would be a good deal under the left arm, but quite consistent with my theory—when I was giving the illustration on Mr. Phillips, I made the knife come down at no particular point, I merely wanted to show the way the accident occurred—I was not present at any of the examinations—I was first applied to, to be a witness, a fortnight or three weeks ago—in the illus<lb></lb>tration</p>

               <p>I gave, my mind was not applied to the wound being more forward or backward—I don't know whether I used both hands to bring the assailant down—I stated, in connection with that, that the left hand certainly was used, but whether the right was used I cannot say—if I approach a person with a dagger, I raise my left hand, and expose this side of my body, the very part that has been penetrated—I use my hand thus, and draw the hand downwards, and drawing it to me, it enters my body—I don't see where I strike my own body—I assume that the dagger is in the hand of a woman, in an upraised condition—I can say no more than that I believe the attitude was just that which would immediately and instinctively follow on taking up a knife, held dagger ways—I believe the higher the hand is raised the greater would be the force necessary to draw it down—I don't know why I should make use of the phrase that the knife was raised in a striking or threatening attitude—I suppose her to have held the knife in an attitude of self-defence, judging from the collateral circumstances, by which I mean, the great fondness that was shown by the two to one another, and the sum of money that had been given—I am referring not to the medical question, or to the appearance of the wound, but to the effect of the evidence—I think the prisoner's attitude was just as much one of protection as of threatening—if any person were to tell me he was about to throw a bottle at my head, and I seized this, I should place myself in an attitude of pro<lb></lb>tection—I do not believe it follows that she was about to use the dagger—if a person were intending to make a blow, they would certainly use the attitude she assumed; that is the attitude I believe that Mrs. Davey was in—from the position of the wound, I think there is no doubt that Mr. Moon approached her with his left side towards her; I mean that she was to the right of him—the table was close here, which prevented him coming full face to her—I consider he approached her with his front partly towards her, but more inclined to the left—I do not think there is anything to favour the view that she approached him from the right—I have said it was more probable that he approached her, while she kept her position, but it is possible she approached him—I might just as well have said one way as the other.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have said "From the evidence I have heard in the case, my judg<lb></lb>ment is that it is more probable that it was the result of an accident than intentional; "I ask you to justify that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I justify it by saying that I take my data from the surroundings of the case, and upon those I have my views—judging from the medical facts above, there is certainly nothing which renders it more likely that it was an accident than an intentional blow—I assume the weapon to be grasped by the prisoner in my hypothesis—I don't think it necessary that it should be still grasped by her at the moment it entered the deceased's body, but my hypothesis is, that it was so—I think the fact of the body being found on its back, inclining to one side, favours that hypothesis, that being the position in which he is, he receives the wound, and falls powerless—I see the arm-chair marked in this plan, and a chair with its back towards the wall in which the door is, not the one to the fire-place—if Mrs. Davey went from the arm chair to the sideboard, and then approached Mr. Moon, sitting in this chair with its back towards the wall, she would be approaching him from his left—pre<lb></lb>suming she had the instrument in her right hand, his left would be just from that.</p>

               <p>in which he was sitting with its back to the door of the couch wall, she approaches in a threatening attitude, and he raises up his left arm, would a blow administered suddenly, give the direction in which the wound was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Whatever their relative positions were, it would do so; that is the way in which I believe it happened—that would be almost instantaneous, and in<lb></lb>volve no struggle and disturbance at all—I am speaking of this chair (<hi rend="italic">Point<lb></lb>ing it out in the plan</hi>), and if that was the relative position of the two persons meeting, the same result would ensue as I have stated—if the chair was moved out of the way, and he was nearer the fire-place, so that the fatal blow had taken place there, that would make no difference, provided she came from the sideboard—I do not think that upon my hypothesis the wound would have commenced more in front, and gone more backwards, nor laterally—I think the forward movement of the right arm is always more in an inclination forwards, or the left arm—my hypothesis assumed the left arm, and it is not altered; taking the left arm to be seizing the wrist, or handle of the knife, or arm, the wound would be far more likely to be from back to front than in an opposite direction—I have heard the wound de<lb></lb>scribed—it does not point out a wound coming somewhat more from behind than from the front.</p>

I am surgeon to St. Mary's Hospital, and was late teacher of anatomy at St. Mary's Medical School—I have been in Court during the two days of this trial, and have listened attentively to the evidence of the surgeons called on the part of the prosecution—I have heard from them the position of the wound, and have carefully listened to the evidence of the last witness, and, in my opinion, it is not at all necessary to establish that the wound must have been inflicted by the blow of a second person; it may have been inflicted in the way Mr. Canton describes; he suggests that Mr. Moon went to her, but she may have gone to him—he puts either alternative, and I put both; he might have approached her; I rather gathered that he concluded that she approached him—if either party came in contact with the other, the same result would follow; if he walked to her and she to him, it might have occurred in the way mentioned—no two witnesses have agreed about the position of the wound; but taking it at 701/2 inches from the middle of the breast, and 91/2 from the middle of the spine, and entering between the sixth and seventh ribs, there is nothing inconsistent with it happening in the way Mr. Canton has represented—it might have been occasioned in that manner by accident—I agree in Mr. Canton's</p>

               <p>opinion that the hand might be brought down in the struggle—it might have occurred by two parties struggling for the knife, and the deceased falling on the knife—a parallel case occurred to me at St. Mary's Hospital—a party falling on the knife would not be a blow, it would be the reception of a wound—I can suggest another mode, the deceased and Mrs. Davey might be struggling for the knife and they might have fallen—the knife might be in a fixed position, and she might have fallen upon him, or he upon her, but the knife must have been fixed, or held, so as to cause resistance—there would be resistance enough in the hand—I have had practical expe<lb></lb>rience upon which I base that opinion, in the Spring of 1844, at St. Mary's Hospital, in the accident ward—I am prepared, if Mr. Giffard asks me, to give the details of that case <hi rend="italic">in to to</hi>—if there is a knife which presents resis<lb></lb>tance, anybody falling on it might receive such a wound—I express that opinion as to the power to enter between the sixth and seventh ribs into the heart and cause death, that is the result of my practical observation.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Must the degree of force with which the knife pene<lb></lb>trated have been considerable? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> According to the experiments I made, it requires enormous force—I am certain that the blow must have been inflicted with considerable force—according to Mr. Savory's diagram, it did not touch either of the ribs, it passed between them—a little bit of rib is chipped out in this diagram. (<hi rend="italic">This was not the photograph taken from Mr. Moon.</hi>) I have assumed the account of the wound as given to be correct—I did not see it—if I take this diagram, I must come to a conclusion that the knife did not go clean between the ribs, as a portion is chipped out—it was not I who suggested the difficulty about touching the apex of the heart, and yet going downwards, but we have had several conversations—we have evidence in the examinations before us that the knife entered between the sixth and seventh rib, and yet touched the apex of the heart—I did not come here to prove that it could not, because the heart was wounded—I never questioned that for a moment—I accept Mr. Savory's evidence—I say that no two witnesses are agreed—the wound went down<lb></lb>wards, forwards, and inwards—I did not bear it given in evidence, that inasmuch as the wound passed between the sixth and seventh ribs, the direction of it must have been upwards—I always assumed the direction of the wound to be downwards, because the upper part was above the internal aperture—it always had preserved one uniform line—my impression was that it had turned more, but that might be the position of the heart in inspiration—that had occurred to me before Mr. Savory said it—the con<lb></lb>clusion I came to was, that it was forwards and downwards—Mr. Savory's suggestion about the descent of the heart during inspiration, was not a new fact to me—my chief reason for receiving what Mr. Savory has said, is because there was not that difference between the external and the internal wound as was stated—if I had received what Mr. Phillips, jun., stated, that the knife traversed between the ribs and the skin nearly 3 inches, and then went in, that would have been different, but it went obliquely in—I must have accepted the fact of it rising a little, but Mr. Savory said that that was all wrong—I adopt Mr. Savory's statement, and reject the other.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am surgeon to the Great Northern Hospital, and hold other appointments—I have heard and read the evidence in this case—I heard Mr. Savory's, Mr. Phillips', and Mr. Canton's evidence here, and the last witness—I am aware of the situation where the body was found—I agree with Mr. Canton's demonstration of how the wound might have been inflicted—it might so have occurred by accident through a fall—to give my explanation of how it might have occurred, it is necessary for me to assume a struggle, and on that assumption of a struggle it surpasses human ingenuity to devise how it might not have occurred—it is not necessary for me to assume a struggle that must have been caused by accident—assuming the knife encountered some sufficiently opposing medium, in my judgment the accident would have happened by a fall, independent of a struggle—such a wound as that inflicted would be caused, if there had been sufficient resisting force to the knife by the fall, by the weight of the body falling—in my judgment, if the prisoner, as it is suggested by the prosecution, had delivered this blow with all her force, lie would have fallen backwards by the force of the blow; if it was delivered with sufficient momentum; but it would depend upon the position of the parties whether he would fall back or not—I think the body struck would have fallen away from the body striking.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I mean that the body must fall from the force of the blow backwards, if delivered with sufficient force; you could not stick a knife in a leg of mutton without moving it on the table—it is a question of degree—I have not seen the cut—having seen Mr. Canton's demonstration, I think it is reasonably probable that that wound could be made in the way suggested, under the arm—the cut in this coat is fully 3 inches below the left armpit—it is in conformity with the direct stab—I do not believe it possible to construct a theory to explain it outside the struggle—you may have people engaged in a struggle moving in fifty different directions in that number of seconds, and it is only sufficient to show that the knife would encounter a sufficient force to account for that theory—after considering Dr. Canton's theory, I say that it is reasonably probable—in my own mind I have discarded all theory of how this sort of thing could have been done—it is not reasonable that it was done by a stab—the appearances presented by a stab would be such as those that have been described by Mr. Savory in his report—the appearance described are equally consistent with the theory suggested by the knife drawn down by the man's own hand and stabbing himself—Mr. Canton has assumed that a person was advancing towards him with a knife and the arm uplifted—I account for the knife getting to that place by his seizing with his left hand the uplifted arm of the other person—everything is in such obscurity, I cannot suggest any theory by which that wound could have happened—I was first consulted three weeks ago—we consulted this morning—I have declined to entertain any theory up to this time—I mean to say I formed no decided opinion as to the reasons that led me to those conclusions—I am quite certain I never said I could not support Dr. Canton's theory—it is as consistent that she stabbed the deceased as that she did not—there is nothing unreasonable or improbable, so far as the medical evidence goes, that the prisoner stabbed him.</p>

                  </hi>, F.R.C.S. I am chief surgeon at the Great Northern Hospital, and a Member of the College of Surgeons—about three weeks ago I directed my attention to this case—I think this wound was more probably the result of accident, and more easily explainable as such than an intended stab—I speak from the medical evidence only—I think there is great diffi<lb></lb>culty in accounting for the kind of wound, if it had been produced by a stab—if produced in that way, I think you must assume the person stabbed must have been in a fixed position—it would have been exceedingly difficult, in my opinion, the person being a free agent, to have driven a knife of that kind through the integuments beneath the sixth rib into the heart, and made such a wound as has been described—I assume that the deceased was in a fixed position, and that as far as any voluntary movement is concerned, he must have been fixed—there was no jagging or notching of the edges of the wound where it penetrated the chest, and that must have been, I believe, necessarily the case, had a person been in the condition to have been a voluntary agent—in puncturing the chest of a patient, it is essential that he should be kept most quiet and still in order to drive the instrument into the chest—the slightest movement would almost frustrate the act—I think these diagrams are very at indeed to mislead persons with regard to the facility with which an instrument could be driven into the chest—they are manifestly wrong here, the ribs are represented separated from each other, much larger than they usually are—in almost every man the space between the ribs is the same—I have no intention of imputing anything to Mr. Baker or Mr. Savory, but these photographs do not represent the state of things in a human being when alive—I agree with Dr. Canton's theory, that it was caused by the deceased falling.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. I have not had much experience of wounds to the heart—I think it possible that the deceased raised his left arm to protect himself, and that she stabbed him with one clear blow—I have considered that hypothesis—it has not been discussed, but I have turned it over in my mind—there is a surgical fact which renders it un<lb></lb>reasonable or improbable that the prisoner stabbed the deceased with one clean stab, in one continuous direction, and withdrew the weapon; the moment the wound was felt he would have shrunk or moved, and under those circumstances there would have been great difficulty in carrying the thrust on so as to make a clean thrust—as far as volition is concerned, it must have been a fixed position—the difficulty of getting an instrument through such a small space is impossible—if a person was taken off his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100086"></xptr>
               <p>guard, you might stab him in the way described—the walls of the chest of a thin person are easier penetrated than a powerful person's, because you would not have so much tissue to go through—a good deal would depend upon the thinness or thickness of the weapon—I think if I wanted to stab a man between the sixth and seventh ribs, there would be a difficulty—the man would move involuntarily, and that would get rid of the blow—it would be oblique to pass between those ribs—the difficulty of hitting the <hi rend="italic">inter-costal</hi> space is very great—from the commencement of the orifice of the wound, to the apex of the heart, is one uniform line; that leads my mind to the conclusion as to the probability of the fall having completed what Mr. Canton's theory suggests in a struggle begun—in falling against some fixed body, it might have been done; by giving some impetus to the knife in the fall against some fixed body—supposing the knife had gone through the first two inches of its course, it would have been very difficult to have altered its direction; the ribs would have confined the blade—that would not have made the wound jagged, if it had been forced against some other body in falling—the wound is from 2 in. to 3 in. under the arm pit, and that has been the mistake throughout the inquiry—the perforation of the clothes would not give the precise point of the wound—the evidence of the wound does not correspond with the clothing—how the knife entered is difficult to say; I would leave that to Mr. Canton's theory—I think it possible the knife might be in the hands of two persons, and that they might have accidentally fallen.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. It is purely conjecture how the knife entered—it is the most difficult question I ever had to deal with—the size of the wound, between the ribs, would be enlarged as a matter of course; not by the cut itself, but by the muscular structures—the wound is quite smooth—if it had been inflicted by the man falling upon the knife, it would have been as it is.</p>

I left my husband for him. Mr. Moon knew me when I was in society, and in my own family. Upon my husband leaving me, he wished me to get a divorce. I returned to my husband at Boulogne to save him from a divorce. I returned turned to this country again, and my husband followed and broke up every<lb></lb>thing in the house, saying that all I wanted was a divorce, and that he would not have it. Mr. Turquand wrote letters to my husband at the dictation of Mr. Moon. After that his family persuaded him to leave me. He did leave me. I went to John Moon and asked him to give Frederick Moon a letter for me, and I would never see him again. He said 'No,' and that Sir Francis had determined that no letters should be sent. In the meantime Frederick Moon returned, and it was agreed that I should belong to him; not to live together, but to belong to him; and I have all these years belonged to him. This last year or eighteen months he was always unhappy. He thought he did not see enough of me. He then proposed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187107100087"></xptr>
               <p>that I should live with him altogether. He was very unhappy. He then settled that he would be with me. We have been most happy. He was most kind. His whole consideration was my happiness, and I could not have done him an injury. He tried to take the knife from me. I am not sure whether he got it or not. We struggled and fell. I thought at first that I must be the one injured. I found blood on me; warm blood. I said "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Fred., Fred.,</hi> what have you done?"Then I found, of course, that it was him, and not myself. I tried all I could to do something to stop it. First of all I applied cold water. Then I remembered that cold water produced blood instead of stopping it. Then I sent for ice and tried that, and then the doctors came. Then, my Lord, you spoke to the Jury that the servants heard a scream, and that there were only so many steps dividing the kitchen from the dining-room. There are two nights of steps; I should think the first one about twelve, the other one about six. Mr. Eccles can answer that. You spoke of the scream. The fact is, the bell rung violently, and the servant, Mary Hale, rang the call-bell. That has been in dispute; as to Mr. Pickford's evidence, you must know I could not say he had broken a blood-vessel. I have nothing more to say, my Lord."</p>

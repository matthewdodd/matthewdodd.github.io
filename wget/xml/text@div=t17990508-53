             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am one of the turnkeys of Newgate, under Mr. Kirby.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner? - A. She was every day in the prison, backwards and forwards, to a man that she called her husband: On the 25th of March I let her in; she had been there some little time, about half an hour, and went out to get some refreshment for the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it when she came out? - A. As nigh as I can recollect, about one or two o'clock, and then she went out; she returned again in about twenty minutes; I was walking backwards and forwards in the passage, and I said to her, what have you been after; I thought she might have been out for spirits, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179905080106"></xptr>Q. Was she within side the door of the prison at that time? - A. She was next the main yard, close to the main gate; I asked her what she had got; says I, give me the bottle that you have got.</p>
               <p>Q. Spirits are not allowed to capital convicts? - A. Nor to any other if we know it; she said she had none, and I put my hand down her side, and felt something in her pocket; then I took her into the tap-room and searched her, and in her pocket I found these things,(produces three spring saws, and four gimblets); then I said, you have got more things about you; I then felt her breast, and found something concealed down her bosom; then I sent for Mr. Kirby, and I saw these two chissels, and handles, taken from her bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Could these things assist a prisoner in making his escape? - A. The spring saws would cut any iron in the world, the setters, or the bars of the prison; and the chissels would break the walls for them to get out.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you at all consent, or give any approbation at all, for bringing such things in? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. It was perfectly without your consent or approbation? - A. Yes; when we found these things, we sent for Mrs. Sells, a woman in the place, to search her, and we withdrew.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the use of gimblets? - A. They would make holes in the door, one after another, round, and would take any panel out of a door, with a saw; the chissels are to force away the stone.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I am keeper of his Majesty's jail of Newgate: Pitt called me into the jail, when I got into the jail he had found the saws and the gimblets, and he said there was something in her stays; we searched her, and pulled out the chissels, and the two handles; she said, she was sent out by a man with a bushy head; I knew by that she meant Harper, a man who is under sentence of death, and has a very bushy head; and she told me he had given her a paper, which she gave to me, (produces the paper, and is read); "three spring saws, four spike gimblets, two strong chissels, the saws with frames," and then there is a sketch of the saws. I can swear that it is Harper's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that Harper who is under sentence of death for personating a seaman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon the oath you have taken, had she your approbation at all in doing this act? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she further searched by any body while you were out of the room? - A. She was further searched by Mrs. Sells.</p>
               <p>Q. These things are proper to facilitate the escape of a prisoner? - A. Certainly they are. (Produces a keyhole saw).</p>
               <p>Q. How many turnkeys have you? - A. Pitt and Alport, no other to these doors.</p>

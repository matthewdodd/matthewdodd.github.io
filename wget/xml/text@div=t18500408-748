On Tuesday, 19th March, I saw Ellis go to a marine store shop, in Suffolk-street, Pentonville—he said to Mrs. Smith, in the shop, "Do you buy lead?"—she said, "Yes"—he then un<lb></lb>wrapped this lead, which had a cloth round it, and was going to put it in the scale—I laid my hand on his shoulder, and said, "You have stolen that"—he said, "No, my mate has sent me in with it"—I took him to the door, and a man was opposite, who I believe was Cooper—I had seen him before—</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carpenter and builder, at Highbury. I was at work at Mr. Vorley's yard, in Sermon-lane, Islington—there is a shed in the yard, and there is a pomp in that shed—the prisoners were in my employ shere for about a week, as labourers—on the 18th and 19th they were digging up a post close to the pump—they could not do the work I set than to do without exposing the pipe—this is the lead pipe—I have brought a piece from the pump that will match it—Ellis was discharged, and Cooper left work that evening, but be came to work next morning—I thought there was something wrong, and I desired Cooper to dig up the ground—he came and dug readily on the spot where the pipe had been, and he said the pipe waa gone; and it was gone—it had been divided with a saw—I got an officer, and gave Cooper into custody—he said he knew nothing about it, but Ellis might have taken it away without his knowledge, as he began work before him—this pipe is worth 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

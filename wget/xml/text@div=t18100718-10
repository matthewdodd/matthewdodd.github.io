On the 17th of May last, I was at home, and my husband was absent. I had a little boy between twelve and thirteen years old, a bed and a sleep. Between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house, I thought it was my husband; I said, Dick, is that you; he said, do not speak. He said nothing else coming in nor going out; I said nothing more to him. He took two waistcoats, and a pair of nankeen trowsers off the line in the room; there were two shirts and a pair of cotton stockings, wrapped up in an old table cloth at the end of the table; he took them to the door, whether there was any body at the door I do not know. He came back again and took down my clock, after that he took down my husband's leather breeches from a nail, and then he took a bason with a saucer at the top, that contained a bit of victuals. On the next morning I found the bason broke, and the saucer whole, in a field at the end of the house. He took all these things away with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to interrupt him - A. No, I was afraid if I spoke he would kill me. About that day fortnight he came within a little distance of the gate, he said, mother, what is it o'clock; I said, I did not know, I had not seen a clock that day; and through the window I thought I knew the man. He then asked me to tell him the way to Halsden-green; I said, I did not know; I said to myself, that is the man that robbed me; I knew the man again, and knew his voice. I followed him into the village, and made enquiries after him, I did not find him. I have never seen any of the articles since.</p>

             and I found the prisoner at Cowling, he was sitting at a public house door; I went up to him, and said, Dick, how do you do; he said, I do not know you; I said, you did a job for me on the 17th of May last, that we have not settled for; he was a little restive about it. His foreman said, if it is so, perhaps you may make it up, a guinea shall be no object; the prisoner said, I did not know him, I could not hurt him; he never acknowledged that he committed the fact. I was at Wilsdon, on the 17th of May, when the robbery was done, I staid out late that night. Wilsdon is about half a mile from Church-end.</p>

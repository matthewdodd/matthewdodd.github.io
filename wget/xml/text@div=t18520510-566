                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the younger</hi>). I am single. My father has been dead two years and a half—when he died, he gave me two feather-beds, and all the household furniture—they were left in the house he died in—a short time after my father's death, my mother went to live with the prisoner, who lived next-door, and lived with him twenty months—my brothers and I continued to live together, and carried on the business—when my mother left, the beds still remained with me—on 24th Feb. last my mother came to me, and in consequence of what she said I let her have the two beds, and received them back from her on the Wednesday in Easter week, in the Plumstead-road, where my mother was living—I put them into the possession of Mrs. Salter until it was convenient for me to take them away—on 24th April I received information, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner, but could not find him—I then went to where I had left the beds, and found they were gone—I afterwards saw the prisoner, and told him I had heard he had gone and claimed those beds of mine from Mrs. Salter's, and had disposed of them for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he said he knew he had, but that they were his own—I have since seen them in Mr. Taylor's possession.</p>

George, what do you think—will say to that when he comes home"—I said she might have left him alone, it was only aggravating him—she said, "I have got all his <hi rend="italic">tin</hi>, and the sooner I get rid of him the better; I have nearly all his <hi rend="italic">tin</hi>"—after that she said, "I have <hi rend="italic">cooked</hi> his <hi rend="italic">goose</hi>; I think I have got some <hi rend="italic">tin</hi> which will send him away for seven years."

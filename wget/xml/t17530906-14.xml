               <p>Newhouse. It was open, I felt and found I had lost two handkerchiefs; I searched the prisoner and found one of my handkerchiefs on the ground just by him. I took him the back way into the George yard to ask him where my other handkerchief was; in leading him out of the yard he took out a handkerchief from out of his breeches, and part of an another hung out, but they were neither of them mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Newhouse. He desired us to forgive him, but did not confess any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you your handkerchief last before you missed it?</p>
               <p>Newhouse. I had it in my hand about 4 minutes before.</p>

            . I was standing just by the prosecutor at the time his pocket was picked, as soon as he said his pocket was picked, I saw the handkerchief fall, and I believe from the prisoner's hand, it fell just by his foot. The prisoner desired we'd let him go.</p>

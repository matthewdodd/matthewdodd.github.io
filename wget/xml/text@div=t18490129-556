On 30th Jan., about half-past ten o'clock, I was concealed at the pit entrance of the Queen's Theatre—Smith was the money-taker—Bryer was posted in the check-taker's box—I heard Smith say, "Bryer, it is all right now"—Bryer hesitated a minute, and Smith said, "It is all right now, you fool; I tell you it is all right," on which Bryer took a key from his pocket, unlocked the padlock on the check-box, took it off, and said, "How many?"—Smith said, "Oh, twenty will do"—Bryer counted out a number of checks and gave them to Smith, who put them into his coat-pocket—I rushed out, and took Smith, searched him, and found twenty checks in his right coat pocket—he was two or three yards from Bryer, not in his box, but in the passage—I searched Bryer, and found upon him a bunch of six keys, and two loose ones, one of which fitted the check-box, and another another check-box in the house—they were taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am lessee of the Queen's Theatre—the pri<lb></lb>soners were in my service. On 30th Jan. my son acted at money-taker; but at half-past ten o'clock, by my direction, Bryer acted as check-taker, and Smith as money-taker—I gave Smith 342 checks—neither of them had a right to have a key of the check-taker's box, or to take anything out—it was Smith's duty to account to me for all cash he received—I should ascertain the amount by the number of checks in the check-taker's box—the admission to the pit is 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is no half-price to the pit—if twenty checks were taken out of the box I should have 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. less returned to me—the checks cost 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—it is not the check-taker's duty to return checks from the box.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would the money-taker return you the checks he did not use? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, the same evening—I suppose he intended to cheat me, by giving me the twenty checks back with those he had left—I very seldom count the number in the box and the number he has, to see if they agree with the number I gave him—I have the box brought to me in the last scene</p>

               <p>or two, I open it and count out the checks, and see the account made out of the cash received and the number of checks sold—the free list is not used for the pit—no one has a right to pans without my sanction, but I have no doubt they sometimes do—I received 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the box about nine o'clock—that was less than the checks came to.</p>

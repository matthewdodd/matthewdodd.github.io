               <p>watch to a watchmaker, and I could not find him—that is the account I should be sure to give—I have no recollection of what the prisoner said about that—I should think it was a month or two after that, that M'Gill called on me—I went with M'Gill, and found the prisoner in a public house near some market—the house was kept by a person of the name of Brookman, to the best of my recollection—I saw the prisoner, and I think I told him that the lady's gold watch he had left with me was a stolen one—that was the police officer that was with me—the prisoner denied having left one with me—I cannot recollect what I said to that—I should be sure to say something to that, but I cannot recollect what it was—he was then taken into custody—I had in my possession then the first watch that I had bought of the pri<lb></lb>soner, and I have it now—I attended as a witness at this Court when it was expected the prisoner would be tried—I went before the Grand Jury—the first watch I had of him has never been claimed by anybody.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a pawnbroker in 1841; I lived at No. 51, Prince's-street, Leicester-square. I remember a person pawning a watch with me—I could not swear it was this watch, but a watch in every respect resembling this—I have no doubt about the watch, but I will not swear to it—the per<lb></lb>son's name who pawned it was John Fletcher; I think he lived in War<lb></lb>wick-street—he lived in Warwick-street a long time—I knew him in that neighbourhood for years—he pawned it for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it must have been the latter end of 1840, or the beginning of 1841—it was about Dec. or Jan.—it was just before I left the business—I have been out of business fifteen years—I think it was redeemed something like two or three months, afterwards—I do not know the person who redeemed it—I gave a duplicate to Fletcher.</p>

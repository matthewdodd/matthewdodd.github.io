On the 8th June I was standing in the shop behind the counter, the prisoner was coming along, he passed and stopped short, looked in at the window, then came in, and asked me to let him look at a key, I asked if he wanted a fine gold, or a common key; he said a fine gold one; I shewed him a tray with seals and keys - he said he wanted one with a stone in it. I took out two or three sets of keys with stones - he said,</p>
               <p>"There is a key with a square stone in the window:" I said I would shew it to him if he would point it out to me. I went to the step of the door, and looked; he did not follow me - he had his right hand glove off, and had it in his left hand, on the counter - he did not follow me to the window, but came to me immediately after I had left, and said,</p>
               <p>"I see you have not got such a thing - it is a mistake:" I said,</p>
               <p>"No, Sir, I don't think I have." He bid me good day, and went away. I came into the shop immediately, and missed a fine gold stirrup-shaped seal, with a blood stone; it was chased. I immediately went to the door; I did not see him, and ran a little way down Oxford-street, but having left nobody in the shop, I ran back immediately, and then missed a brooch - some brooches laid on the counter when he came in; I heard nothing more of him till my husband brought me up the Times newspaper - in consequence of which I attended the second examination of the prisoner; I think it was on the Wednesday week following - I knew him immediately. I have not found either the brooch or seal.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of day did it happen - A. Between two and four o'clock; I think about three: he was dressed in white trowsers, and a kind of frock coat, which I should call a bronze or brown colour. I should think he was in my sight six or seven minutes: my back was towards him part of that time - I was about four minutes before him. The tray of seals and keys were cleaned the day before: I had placed them in the tray myself - it was filled, and none had been sold. I am sure the seal was in the tray when he came in; there were three fixed on a card, different from the others - it was marked 35 s.; the brooch was in a tray, full, which had been cleaned that morning, and laid on the counter ready to be placed on a card. Nobody but him had been in the shop after they were cleaned. I do not recollect that I ever saw him before: I particularly noticed him before he came in, by his stopping so suddenly, and am positive he is the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What is the number of your shop - A. No. 350: there is an cating-house next door but one.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner in Cleveland-street, on Tuesday evening the 8th of June, about half-past eight o'clock - he was dressed in a blue coat, white trowsers, and striped waistcoat.</p>

            . My husband keeps an eating-house three doors from Marchant's shop. The prisoner dined at our house nearly every day - if he missed a day we wondered at it; he generally came about three o'clock. I never saw him in a bronze or brown frock coat.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you happen to recollect whether he dined at your house early in June - A. The last time he dined at our house was on the 8th of June; that was at three o'clock in the afternoon; he staid there till past four, and next day we missed him - he wore a blue coat, and white trowsers on that day.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's fellow clerk, and have seen him every day from January, 1823; he wore a frock coat when he first came to the office; (it was a black one,) in consequence of his mother's death. I never saw him wear a bronze coat. He left off mourning at Christmas, and has not worn black since.</p>
               <p>SUMMERS CLARK. I have been in the habit of seeing Mr. Robinson since Christmas: I never saw him in a bronze frock coat, or any frock coat whatever.</p>
               <p>MRS. HUDSON. The prisoner has lodged with me since Christmas. I never saw him wear a bronze coloured frock coat; he was not in the habit of changing his dress after he went out in the morning. I was with the officers when his boxes were examined - there was no frock coat there.</p>
               <p>MR. ABRAHAMS. I never saw him in a bronze frock coat; he never came in the evening in a different dress to what he wore in the morning.</p>

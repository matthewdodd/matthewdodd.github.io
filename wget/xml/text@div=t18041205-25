               <p>Q. Then it was an execution? - A. I believe it was.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a writ to levy 16 l. on your goods? - A. It was, I looked at the warrant and copied it.</p>
               <p>Q. You were satisfied about the fidelity of it? - A. I was: I took my pocket-book out of my pocket and offered him the money; I took out 19 l. there were one 10 l. note, four 2 l. notes, and a 1 l. note; I counted out to him the 16 l. which he refused to take, saying it was not his duty so to do; he persisted, and I told him, if he persisted, I should send for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. He persisted in staying in the house and levying the goods? - A. I suppose that was his intention; I laid the money on the table, where I was standing with him; I went up stairs to call a servant to be witness to my tendering it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect positively that you left the money on the table? - A. I can, I went up stairs for a witness of the tender, and when I returned the money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring the witness with you? - A. I did, my servant maid; I expressed my surprize to him, and he said he saw me put the money into my pocket; I searched my pockets, and I even went up stairs; being loth to accuse a man under this circumstance, I suggested to Mrs. Waters that I would go to a place where I had dined; I then searched there, and made every possible inquiry; this was between seven and eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. What way of life are you in? - A. An insurance-broker.</p>
               <p>Q. On your return from the place where you had dined, what then? - A. My suspicions were immediately increased by a report that Mrs. Waters made to me, and I immediately sent for an officer; I gave him in custody to this officer; he was searched before me, at my house, by the officer, with the assistance of another man whom I sent for, his name is

               <p>Q. Did you find any thing upon him? - A. Four 2 l. Bank of England notes and a 1 l. Bank of England note.</p>
               <p>Q. You had taken the numbers of your notes yourself? - A. No, I happened to receive them that day at a banking-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards discover what the numbers were? - A. Not the numbers, the bankers' clerks do not keep the numbers of small notes, but they write the names of such persons as they receive them from.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the clerk here? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing on these five notes, which were then produced by which you can positively swear they are your's? - A. Not sufficiently to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly clear of the 19 l. which you produced? - A. Yes, there were four 2 l. notes and one 1 l. note found on the prisoner in a pocketbook in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he discover any reluctance in being searched? - A. So much so that I was obliged to send for another person to assist.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean by that, that he refused to be searched? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you found these five notes what did he observe upon them? - A. He said they were his own, that he had been saving them three years and a half; I told him I was sufficiently satisfied by his conduct he had taken them; I desired him to go down stairs with the officer; as he was going down stairs with the officer, he begged to say a few words to me; I told him that whatever he had to say to me, I should be very willing to hear in the presence of the officer; upon which he observed, that the notes were mine, but that I had made him a present of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure of his saying those words? - A. I am, it was in the presence of the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. I think I need not ask you whether you had made him a present of them? - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the five notes they were secured? - A. They are in my pocket now; the officer took them to the Office, and gave them to me at the Office afterwards; they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce them, and give me the dates of them when they were issued from the Bank? - A.(Produces them;) One 2 l. note, dated 30th November, 1801; another 2 l. 15th October, 1804; another 2 l. 29th September, 1804; another 2 l. 19th September, 1804; and another 1 l. note dated 24th September, 1804.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. You have told us that upon looking at these notes there is nothing upon the face of them by which you know them to be your's? - A. Certainly I cannot swear to them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180412050028"></xptr>Q. You conceived yourself very ill used; you were rather angry? - A. I was very angry.</p>
               <p>Q. You offered them to him, and he refused to take them, saying he was not authorized? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After you laid them on the table you went up stairs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If you had been certain that you laid them on the table, how came you to go up stairs to look for them? - A. Certainly it was necessary to take every precaution before I accused the man; I was perfectly satisfied in my own mind, I only did it by way of precaution.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you were certain that you left these notes on the table, after going to other places to look after them? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You will not swear to these notes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The other you never found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it within your knowledge that the prisoner's senses, by means of an apoplectic fit, are at times affected? - A. The whole of his conduct looked more like that of a madman than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. His conduct surprized you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. With regard to the conversation you had with him, his answers were sensible? - A. In some sense they were not, for after the notes were given back he even abused me.</p>
               <p>Q. It did not strike you as a man quite out of his mind? - A. Not entirely so; I can mention one thing that struck me so; on my expressing myself angrily to him, he got up and went to strike me; this was in the kitchen, and when my friend and the constable were there.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever known him before in your life? - A. Never before.</p>
               <p>Q. Except that circumstance of rudeness, his conversation was rational; he told you what he came for, and that he was not authorized to take the money? - A. Yes, he did so.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you remember being sent for by Mr. Waters? - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that day, the 17th of November, when he gave the prisoner in custody to you? - A. The prisoner was in Mr. Waters's house when I went in, and Mr. Waters informed me what I was sent for; I took the prisoner into my custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him? - A. First of all he said it was a scheme to get him from the premises, so that the goods might be removed; he told me that he was an officer as well as me; then I told him to lay aside every suspicion of that kind, he was in the possession of the goods, and he was under my care, and I would not leave him till there was another put in possession; I then went to search him; he resisted with a great deal of resolution that we should not search him, and Mr. Waters sent for the other witness; then we insisted upon searching him, and he took his shoes and stockings off, and began to take his small clothes off; then the prisoner said search my pockets; I told him that would not do; I saw he had his pocket-book in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search his pockets? - A. We had no need; when he wanted me to search his pockets he had taken his pocket-book out and had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he cover it completely? - A. No, I could see it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it when he told you to search his pockets? - A. Yes, I took the pocket-book from him and opened it, and took out five Bank notes; four twos and one one; he said they were his own property, and he had been three years and a half in saving them; I asked him if he knew the number of the notes, as he had had them so long by him; he said he did not; I told him I thought it was very odd, as he had had them so long as three years and a half, that he did not know the numbers of them; he desired me to seal them up; in a little time after he said they were the gentleman's, but the gentleman made him a present of them.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he say that they were the gentleman's, and he made him a present of them? - A. In about a quarter of an hour after he had said they were his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when he said that? - A. He was going down stairs; after they were sealed up, they were in my care till we went down to the Office on Saturday morning, where they were produced and broke open; I delivered them to the Magistrate, and then they were returned to Mr. Waters, and I put my name on the back of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Magistrate give them to Mr. Waters? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Waters) I suppose they have your name on them too? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Clifton. Q. He first said they were his own? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. In about a quarter of an hour after that he said they were his master's - A. He said they were, but the gentleman had made him a present of them?</p>
               <p>Q. He was a little outrageous in his conduct then? - A. No, he was not; I was with him all night in Mr. Waters's kitchen; he did not seem to be a person out of his mind at all that night, not in the least; he offered to strike Mr. Waters at one time, and I really believe he would have struck him, had I not shewn him my staff.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Waters was in a great passion? - A. I cannot pretend to say; he had a right to be in a passion.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Do you remember Mr. Waters sending to you on the 17th of November? - A. Yes, I went into the parlour where the prisoner and my master were.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner was searched? - A. I was, I saw the notes taken out of his pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any difficulty to be searched? - A. He said he did not like to be stripped before a parcel of people; I said, my friend, you must be searched; he began to undress himself, and after he had all his things searched, and his pockets, and nothing found on him, then they came to his pocket-book; I saw five notes taken out; he kept it in his hand till every pocket and every thing had been searched; he then said he did not wish Mr. Waters to see the notes, so the officer and he went to the other side of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. He would not give you the pocket-book then? - A. No; the officer looked the notes over, and after he called the notes over, my master said there wanted a ten-pound note. After the notes were sealed up, before they came out of the parlour, the prisoner said he should be glad to speak to Mr. Waters, if he would hear him; he then said, they were your property, but you made them a present to me; this was at the parlour door, as he was going down into the kitchen; in the course of the night he seemed very well; I sat with him all the night with the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man converse rationally? - A. I cannot say he did at one time; he said one part of the night, I would sooner have gone to Botany-bay than have come into this house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass in conversing with the man, that led you to suppose that he was not possessed of his right mind? - A. I cannot recollect any thing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went to Mr. Waters's house; he desired to look at my warrant, I gave it him, and he copied it off on a bit of paper; he then put the notes in my hand, and took them away; he gave me the warrant back again, and then went down stairs; he came up stairs after me, and asked me if he had given me any notes; I looked in my pocket-book, I told him, no; I did not look in my warrant; he called a constable, and he found the notes in my warrant, in my pocket-book; in going down stairs I found they were there, I did not know they were there.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his having had an apoplectic fit? - A. Yes, he has had two, I think; the first was about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have they been in any degree of violence? - A. Yes, they certainly affected his mind, for at the time his mental faculties were very much deranged, and also at a subsequent time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When was the last time you perceived that effect? - A. I cannot recollect exactly the time, but he seemed to be in a state of idiotism; I have met him in the street, and asked him how he was; he seemed to be in a state of stupor, and I then thought his intellects were not as they were formerly.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time that you saw him, so as to mark any thing particular? - A. About six months ago I met him in the street, and I perceived these effects even then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifton. Q. Do you know any thing of his character? - A. I cannot say any thing particular, I never heard any thing that was bad of him.</p>

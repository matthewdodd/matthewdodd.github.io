            . I am inspector of skins in the Port of London. On the 23d of November I met a person on St. Dunstan's-hill, who appeared to have something heavy about him in a blue apron; I went towards the surveyor's office at the <placeName id="t18261207-10-crimeloc56">Custom-house</placeName>

            . I live in the Commercial-road - I am an officer, and attend at the Custom-house. On the morning of the 23d of November, in consequence of information, I went up St. Dunstan's-hill, and saw the prisoner with an ingot of lead concealed under his apron; he was putting it on his shoulder; I asked where he was taking it - he said to Mr. Piper, of Tower-street, but he was going in a contrary direction: I said he must return with me to the Custom-house - he at first refused, but at last consented; I took him back, and asked where he got it; he said a man gave it to him in the street; Mr. Piper's people were at work at the Custom-house, and said in his presence, that they had not sent him with it; I took him to the Compter. I found the door of a room on the first floor in the Custom-house, broken open, where there were eighty-seven ingots of lead, correspond with this, in size and make - it is marked W. T. Mr. Taylor saw it at the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming out, and found this lead under a plank; seeing it marked W. T. I thought it meant William and Thomas Piper; I thought it belonged to them, as I never saw any thing like it in the Custom-house; I was unable to lift it up, having met with an accident, and was trying to carry it in my apron. I declare I did not know where it was kept.</p>

            . Q. I believe you have the management of the business of Mr. Wirgman in St. James' street - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 9th of August did either of the prisoners at the bar come to you at Mr. Wirgman's - A. Coddington, the prisoner at the bar, came to me soon after nine o'clock in the morning, at the house of Mr. Wirgman, and enquired for Mr. Butler; I told him my name was Butter; he said that Sayers was waiting for me in St. James' place.</p>
               <p>Q. That is close to Mr. Wirgman's - A. Adjoining; Mr. Wirgman's is the corner house; that he wanted to see me on the business that occurred the preceding evening; I went into St. James' place, leading to Cleveland place, my residence; I there found Cannon, and not to talk in the street I took him to my apartment in Cleveland court; the prisoner Cannon stated that he had been discovered absent from his duty in the park the night before, that he was obliged to account to the other officers on duty, and who claimed a share of the ten pounds that he had received from me, and that he was also obliged to state to the other prisoner Coddington, his absence.</p>
               <p>Q. By what name did he describe the other man - A. Wilkinson; stating that the other man, Coddington, (calling him Wilkinson) was an assistant clerk to the police office, Bow street, and that they required ten pounds more of me, or that they must prefer the charge which Cannon the night before had threatened me with.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of the conversation was it at all stated what that charge was - A. No, I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I must ask you what was the charge which Cannon had made on you the night before - A. The charge the night before that Cannon made was, that he should charge me with having committed an unnatural crime. Not having ten pounds, I told them they must give me time to procure it.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to give any compliance to their demand - A. The apprehension of the threat which Cannon had made the night before of making that criminal charge against me.</p>
               <p>Q. You told him that you had not ten pounds then - A. Yes, but I would procure it by the next morning. I made an appointment with them for the next morning, to meet them in St. James's square at nine o'clock. The prisoner Cannon asked for some liquor, which I gave them some at my own apartment; they then went away.</p>

               <p>Q. That night did either of them, or both of them, come to Mr. Wirgman's - A. At a few minutes after nine that night they came to me at Mr. Wirgman's, at the moment I had secured the door of the shop; I was left in care and possession of Mr. Wirgman's property in his absence, having that morning left town for Brighton, to spend a month or six weeks there. The prisoner, when the door was opened to him, came into the house passage, and said they were come to me again.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them spoke - A. I cannot take upon me to say, they were both together, they were come for the money I had promised them, they could not wait till the morning, as I had appointed. I had not been out in the day to my friend where I expected; I told them that I had not been out to my friend, that I had no money. They then said that they were come from Bow street, and would take me in custody; I agreed to accompany them. One of the prisoners called a coach from the stand at the corner of St. James's place; I am not sure which. I got into the coach, the prisoners followed me. One of the prisoners said to the coachman -</p>
               <p>Q. Without knowing which still - A. I think Cannon said to the coachman, you know us, drive to Bow street; the coachman proceeded to drive a few paces, when one of the prisoners, I do not know which, directed the coachman to stop; he said to me, if you will behave like a gentleman and procure the money, we will not prefer the charge against you. I promised to try my friend Mr. Smith, the silversmith, in Bruton street; the coach was directed to stop in Bond street, near the corner of Bruton street; we got there and got out. One of the prisoners paid the coach fare.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass about your paying it - A. I was asked to pay it, but I had not got any silver about me. The prisoners accompanied me to the house door of Mr. Smith, and said they would wait my coming out. I went into Mr. Smith's house, I found him at home.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of your request of him, did you receive any thing from him - A I did, a ten pound bank note.</p>
               <p>COURT. I suppose you did not tell him what it was for - A. I did not. I staid a few minutes in Mr. Smith's house, and on my return into Bruton street the prisoners were waiting for me on the opposite side of the way. I went up to them, they asked me if I had succeeded in procuring the ten pounds, which I informed them I had, and which I gave to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know to which - A. I cannot say; I gave it to one of them, both being together.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Why did you give it them - A. Because of the fear and dread of being placed in the situation of a criminal of that nature, and they persisted in the polg their charge against me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you think they would have done to you - A. That they would have taken me in custody and lodged me in the watchhouse. They then told me that I might make myself happy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Before you go to that, did you believe them to be Bow street officers - A. I did not conceive them to be Bow street officers, though they held out that threat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. In what state of mind were you in - A. Extremely agitated.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180811300026"></xptr>Q. When you said you apprehended that they would take you to the watchhouse; by what means did you conceive they would have taken you to the watchhouse if you did not consent - A. By force.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it then under the terror of that charge, of being taken by force, and charged with that crime, that you parted with that bank note - A. It was.</p>
               <p>COURT. I would much rather the gentleman would express himself - A. My motive was, under the apprehension of being taken by the prisoner, and placed in custody on suspicion of an intention of committing the crime alledged. It was under that idea I acted at the of the moment and gave the money. The prisoners took their leave of me after giving them the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you at that moment under the impulse of any bodily danger to your person - A. Not exactly, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. That, I take you right, at the time you were not under the impression of any danger to your person - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You then say they took their leave of you - did they say any thing at parting - A. Nothing more than I might make myself happy, that I should hear no more of them.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you see either of them again - A. It was on the 13th of October that I saw Cannon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he come to you - A. At Mr. Wirgman's house of business.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect - I am asking about your own residence - A. They came to my residence in Cleveland court (I am speaking of the prisoner Cannon) while I was at dinner; he asked for two guineas, as he was going to Portsmouth, that was to delray his expences, that he had been discharged from his situation as an officer of police, in consequences of his absence from duty in St. James's park on the 8th of August; I told him I would not give him a shilling, and desired him to leave my house; I took him by the arm and pushed him to the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you immediately after this apply to the office in Bow street for advice - A. Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he come to you next - A. The next time he came to me was the 31st of October, the same month.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of advice you then sent for Mr. Anthony - A. Yes, he came to me at Mr. Wirgman's. I sent for a police officer and detained him; Mr. Anthony came and apprehended him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. It was Coddington that came to your house in St. James's street, he called you out - A. Yes; they were both in company.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannon was the spokesman, and said if you did not give the ten pound he would make the charge that he had the night before - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. In the presence of Coddington - A. In the presence of Coddington.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he borrow of you a ten pound bank note - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not know whether you made any observation on his appearance - A. He seemed distressed in his mind; he said that he had an immediate call for ten pound, and he had not so much money by him.</p>
               <p>Q. You let him have a ten pound bank note, and he quitted your house - A. He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the other prisoner Coddington - was he an assistant clerk, or in any ways concerned in that office - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not apprehend Coddington - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Butter. On the 3d of November last, did you meet with the prisoner Coddington - A. I did; I passed him in George court, Brewer street, it leads into Prince's street.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it - A. It was soon after ten in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q.After you had passed him did you turn round and recollect his face - A. I recognized that I had some knowledge of him; I paused to recollect myself, and likewise also the prisoner looked back at the moment; he stopped and looked at me and ran off; I pursued him and took him in Berwick street, and lodged him at the public office in Marlborough street.</p>
               <p>Coddington's Defence. The things that the prosecutor institutes against, I am innocent of it. In the morning I was going out to get myself shaved when he stopped me upon the charge; I went with him to Marlborough street willingly, without any officer at all. I have been seven years in his Majesty's service; I was disabled in the service of major Abercrombie.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. He made no resistance, there were so many people around me. A respectable man who was nigh me, I said to him, if I require your assistance I trust you will afford it me. I had no apprehension of his getting from me. A man went for a constable for me; he was not at home; I was advised to take him to Marlborough street office. As we passed through Poland street, he said, you had better be quiet, you will only expose yourself.</p>
               <p>Cannon's Defence. My lord, I have several people who knew me years ago, that knew my character. Since I have left the India house, I have carried lottery books, and before that I had got my discharge. I was recommended to the East India company by his royal highness himself.</p>
               <p>Cannon called four witnesses to his character.</p>
               <p>Coddington called no witnesses to his character.</p>

On the 16th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, two men, named Joyce and Emmett, were employed to take 500 cases of soap in the Castlereagh lighter - the prisoner had the care of the lighter while they were taking it in; he had brought up a barge of tallow to Hawes's wharf before I left. I left him in charge of the soap; they were to get it from the wharf that day if the tide would serve, but it would not. I saw the prisoner again between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, in my counting-house, in Clink-street, Bankside. I then paid him his wages, and gave him a document. I told him to take charge of the lighter, and go the next day to the West India Docks. I told him Emmett and Callaghan would assist him. I ordered the prisoner to go into the Docks, and not quit the lighter, day or night, to make the delivery good, and bring the receipt to me. Callaghan was to keep charge until Monday morning, the 18th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the 500 cases put on board the barge - A. No, I saw twenty-nine put on board - they were all brought there; each parcel was made up in boxes, and tape tied round them, and sealed with the Excise seal. Each case contained 56 lbs,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The prisoner was to conduct the lighter from where she received her cargo, till he delivered the goods - A. Yes, he took charge of her at two o'clock in the morning; till that time Mr. Hawes's watchman had the care of her. He was to deliver the cargo on board the New Felix, at the West India Docks.</p>

Foot had promised to come at twelve o'clock to take her into the Docks - he did not, and I conveyed her into the Docks, made her fast, and stopped there till Monday morning, then locked the cabin, and went home. I left nobody with her. I took the key of the hatches to Mr. Raymond's clerk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. No harm could come to the soap in her passage - A. No, it was under lock and key; the prisoner had not the key, he left it with me when he went on shore. There was no soap in the cabin. I did not see them take any soap.</p>

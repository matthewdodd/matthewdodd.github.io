                  </hi>. I am barmaid, at the Dover Castle, in Weymouth Mews. On 16th Feb. the prisoner came thefe with a bottle, about half-past 7 o'clock in the evening—she asked for a quartern of rum—I put the rum in the bottle—she tendered a half crown in payment—she threw it on the counter—I saw it was bad—I took it up and threw it on a table by the side of me—I returned the rum back from the bottle into the measure—the prisoner taid she did not know the half crown was bad; and she said, "Perhaps you will say this is bad?"—she took another half crown from her pocket, and put it down—I saw that that was bad—I took it up and put it with the other—there was a man near to the prisoner—he had come in just before her, and asked for half a pint of porter, for which he paid a penny—he was afterwards taken into custody—when I found the two half crowns were bad, I sent for an officer, and the prisoner was taken into custody—I gave the half crowns to the officer—I made the prisoner empty her pockets in the parlour—I did not put my hand in her pockets—she produced a good half crown, and 1 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper—I allowed the prisoner to go—the man was waiting outside—I told the policeman to take him, which he did, and brought him in the house—a half sovereign, two half crowns, and seven shillings were found on him, all bad—some rather angry words passed between him and the prisoner—he swore he did not know her—I had seen the man in the house before with another party who had passed bad money, and I knew him again.</p>

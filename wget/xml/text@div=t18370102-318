We took that house a week before Christmas—on Tuesday night, 20th of December, I went to bed a little before twelve o'clock—my two sons were in the house at the time—we all went to bed at the same time—they did stay up after me—I fastened the doors myself—there are two doors leading to the street, I bolted them both—there are windows which open into the street, I looked round, and they were fast for any thing I know—I believe, they were—I was alarmed about half-Past four o'clock—I got up, and came down stairs—I found several policemen and people in the place—I went to the bar, it was very much confused by the people being in it, and I was confused and could hardly answer—I did not examine the outer doors at that time—the policeman looked at them—I missed a work-box of my daughter', which I had seen in the bar-parlour the night before—it had only been brought that night from our other house—some spoons were put into my hand by one of my children, who is not here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was on duty on the morn<lb></lb>ing of the 21st of December, in Swan-street, Bethnal-green, about half past four o'clock—I saw a light through the top of the door of the Swan public-house—I crossed over, followed by the watchman, and entered the house—I turned on my light, and found the prisoner in the house with another man—I took hold of him by the collar, and the watchman took hold of the other—I struggled with the prisoner—he got the door open—he pulled the lock of the door back, and we both fell out into the street—the other man made his escape from the watchman, and ran round and began to kick me—I was prevented from springing my rattle by their very tight hold of me—I was on the ground, and they got tight hold of my rattle, and kicked me—I cannot say which it was kicked me—the watchman came running out of the house and came to my assistance—the man who escaped, ran three or four doors when I was on my legs—the prisoner called to him, "Tom, come back, stick to him, kill the b——, I shall get free"—by that time Maguire came up—I kept hold of the pri<lb></lb>soner the whole time—I never lost him till I got him to the station-house—he was secured—we took him into the house, and I saw some lucifer matches found in his pocket—Maguire searched him, and found 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on him—I saw the watchman pick up a hat and glass, which the other man had left behind.</p>

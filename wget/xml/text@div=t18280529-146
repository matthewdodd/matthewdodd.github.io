            . I am a watchman. I saw the prisoner at half-past twelve o'clock at night in Grafton-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182805290076"></xptr>street, Tottenham-court-road, with this lead on his right shoulder; I asked where he got it - he said from St. Paul's Church-yard; I said he had a very heavy load; he said Yes, and he was going to Mr. Redpaths; I said he must go to the watch-house - he stopped a minute, and there was another watchman coming up; he threw the lead against my legs and ran away; I pursued him - he knocked a man down in Tottenham-court-road; I pursued him close and took him; I found where the lead came from; it had been left in the New Inn, Tottenhamcourt-road.</p>

            . I keep the New Inn. The prosecutor left some lead with me on the Tuesday afternoon; I saw it safe on the Wednesday - there were 81 lbs. weight of it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was drinking the whole of the afternoon at the New Inn, and became quite intoxicated, and was obliged to lie down upon one of the benches, where I feel asleep; I did not leave the house till I was put out by the landlord at half-past eleven o'clock - I was proceeding along Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-spuare, when a stranger asked me to help him up with a load which he had; he said that he had carried it all the way from St. Pauls, and if I would carry it the remainder of the way he would give me sixpence - as the person to whom he said he was going lived near, and was well-known to me, I consented, and had but just taken it up, when a watchman came up to us, and the stranger immediately ran away; seeing him run I suspected something wrong, and, ran away too, when I was pursued by the watchman, and taken into custody.</p>


               <p>WILLIAM GRUBB. He had been at my house all the afternoon. The lead was in a small yard which parts the kitchen from a room; I knew him before; he was there almost every day; I cannot say whether I turned him out that night or no - If I had turned him out with the lead on his shoulder I must have seen it; I have frequently turned him out at the closing hour at night: the lead was in my custody to take care of; I shut up at half-past eleven o'clock precisely - there might be thirty or forty turned out that night.</p>
               <p>COURT to ROBERT RAWNSLEY. Q. Are you sure it was half-past twelve when you saw him? A. Yes; I was calling the half-hour; it was about two hundred yards from the New Inn.</p>

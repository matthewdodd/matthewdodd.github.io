                  </hi>I keep the King's Arms public-house, Kent<lb></lb>street, in the Borough. On the 25th of December the prisoner came to my house between eight and nine o'clock—there was another woman in the house, but I do not know her name—the prisoner was quarrelling with a man named Reuben Walker, about a quarter of an hour after she came in—I went into the tap-room, and desired her to be peaceable, or I would put her out of the house—I put her back from Walker for a few minutes—I had only put her back to another part of the tap-room—I re<lb></lb>turned to the bar—she began quarrelling again with the same person—I went into the tap-room, and desired her to be quiet—she would not—she was quarrelling and abusing the people—I said I would not have anybody in the place interrupted, and told her to be quiet—she was rather abusive</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184001060117"></xptr>
               <p>then—I did not particularly hear what she was saying—I then put her out of the house—I went in behind her, put my arms round her, lifted her off the ground, and carried her out at the door, and when she got out<lb></lb>side she stabbed me on the arm—I was just that instant letting go of her—I cannot say what she struck me with—I did not see any thing in her hand—I felt a blow, but could not feel that I was cut at the time—when I held my arm down I felt something running very warm down my hand, and saw it was blood—I had not struck her at all before she struck me—when I saw the blood I said, "Stop her, she has cut me, " and gave her in charge of the policeman, who was just coming towards the house on his duty—I do not know whether she said any thing, for I went to a chemist's shop close by—my arm was bleeding very fast—it was cut about an inch in length, just above the wrist—I saw her afterwards at the station-house.</p>

                  </hi>I am a cow-keeper, and live in Griffin-yard, Church-street, Borough. On the 25th of December I went into Kings<lb></lb>bury's public-house between eight and nine o'clock—the prisoner followed me in—I did not know her before—I was lighting my pipe at the gas over my head, and she threw an old bonnet at it, which caused the pipe to break, and the lighted paper to fall on my head—she began to swear and quarrel—I had done nothing to her—she immediately struck me two or three times—I told her to be quiet and to sit down, or to go out of the house—she would not—the landlord came and caught hold of her, and put her out of the house—immediately after he got into the bar, she re<lb></lb>turned, and struck me as many as half-a-dozen times—she stood before me, and said she had not had a fair cut at me yet—she stood with her right hand in her bosom—the landlord tame and caught hold of her round the waist—his catching hold of her drew her hand out, and I saw a small penknife open—I could see no handle at all, only the blade—she had it between her thumb and finger—I did not see any more—I did not follow them out of the tap-room—I had not struck her at all, nor held up my arm to strike her, nor did any other person in my presence.</p>

                  </hi>I am a policeman. I was on duty in Kent-street on the 25th of December—I saw Mr. Kingsbury outside his house, with his arm bleed<lb></lb>ing—the prisoner was just coming out of the house after him—I did not see him have hold of her at all—his arm was bleeding when I first saw him—I took the prisoner into custody—I did not find any thing on her—I saw nothing in her hand, and saw nothing of a knife afterwards—I took her to the station-house—I have Mr. Kingsbury's coat here—there is a cut in the right sleeve, and a corresponding cut on the shirt—the shirt was given to me on the Monday morning, but I saw it at the time—the blood was all wet then, as if fresh, and I saw the cut on the arm—it was then bleeding—I saw no blood on the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>I am a student at Guy's Hospital. On the 25th of December I was assistant to Mr. Odling, of High-street, Borough—I saw Kingsbury about nine o'clock that day in Mr. Odling's shop—I examined his right arm—he had a wound about an inch long on the back part of the fore-arm—I did not probe it—it appeared deep, and to have been inflicted with a small instrument, not very sharp—it might have been inflicted by a small penknife—it was not bleeding at that time—it appeared to have been inflicted a few minutes before—he appeared very faint.</p>

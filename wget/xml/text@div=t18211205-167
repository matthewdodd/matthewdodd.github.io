In the beginning of October, the prisoner called at my house, saying he was a watchmaker; and asked me if I had any thing to repair; he was a stranger. I gave him a clock to repair; he said he lived in Great James's-street, Lisson-green; he brought the clock back the same day. I gave him a time-piece, he brought that home the same day, or the day after, and I then gave him two watches; I do not think he asked for them, they were both silver, old, and worth 50 s.; he never returned them; I did not go to Lisson-green; I made inquiry after him, but could not find him. I saw one of my watches in pawn, about six weeks after, the other was produced by a pawnbroker at the office. I never gave him authority to pawn them. When I saw him in custody, I said, "I am sorry to see you in this situation;" he said, "He was very sorry too, and that great distress caused him to be there." His wife appeared at the office with a family.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What is the value of the two time pieces - A.1 l., the clock was worth 4 l., they were both returned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say he pawned them to relieve his necessity, but never intended to steal them - A. He said something of the kind; I paid him for the clock; we made an agreement for the watches and time-pieces together.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 15th of November, at No. 27, Molyneux-street, Bryanston-street, he was in bed on the second floor; his wife gave me the duplicate of the watches out of a box. I enquired at Great James's-street, he did once lodge there.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK contended that it was clear that the prisoner had a special possession of the property, and that a subsequent taking could not be a felony, and cited 2 d. vol. East's Reports, chap. 16, sec. 109, p. 682 and 683; also, 1st. vol. Hawkins's Reports, chap. 33, sec. 2.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was out of employ, and called on him, he gave me them to repair; I took them home, and on the 6th of October, I had a letter to inform me a bill was unpaid, which I was arrested on; I pawned the property to take it up, but intended to redeem it.</p>

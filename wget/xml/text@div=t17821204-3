               <p>Court. How far is the coach-house from the house? - About 150 yards from the house, at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>Court. In a mews? - Yes, the stable is adjoining to it: I know nothing of the prisoners, only the property. About half past seven in the evening of the 24th of October I left the stable, I fastened the door, the great coat was upon the box in the coach-house, and the man's saddle and bridle, and the fustian waistcoat, and a man's hat bound with silver, a linen frock, a pair of leather boots, a pair of leather shoes, and two odd base metal buckles plated with silver.</p>
               <p>Whose property were the last? - They were mine.</p>
               <p>Describe the communication between the stable and the coach-house. - It is by a little door within the stable; I locked the door over night, in the morning about seven, I came there, and the door was just pulled to, it appeared to have been opened with a key without violence.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am watch-house keeper of St. Pancras parish; the two prisoners were brought to the watch-house in Glanville-street near Rathbone place with these things, they were brought by the watchman and patrol; and I found the property which has been before mentioned upon them, some on one and some on the other.</p>
               <p>Court. What, did you find the saddle and bridle, and great coat, and fustian waistcoat, and linen frock, boots, shoes, and base metal buckles? - The prisoner Hunt had on the smock frock, the great coat, saddle and bridle over his shoulders, and a hat in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Can you swear to him? - Yes my Lord, I think it is the same, I believe the prisoners both to be the parties that were in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court. Can you swear to them positively? - I can swear to them both that they were brought to our watch-house.</p>
               <p>Had Hunt any thing besides? - I took a key out of his pocket, that is all that was on him: on Hinsell there was one pair of boots, one pair of shoes, two brushes, two odd buckles, and five picklock keys, and one pair of irons, or instruments like toupee irons.</p>
               <p>What were they charged with? - On suspicion of robbery; of robbing no particular person; it was between three and four in the morning; they said they were coachmen to one Mr. Cole in Bond-street; Hunt said so, the other said he was a coachman, but did not mention to whom as I remember; in the morning afterwards, I and the watchman, and the patrol went and searched the prisoners lodgings, they told us where they lodged; in Hinsell's lodging we found nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178212040006"></xptr> but a file; while we was gone we heard that Alderman Kitchin's coachman had found that the thief was in our watch-house, we went to the Alderman's stables, and tried these keys, and this is the key that opened the stable-door and the coach-house door as easy as the key that belonged to the door.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the property in court? - Yes, they have been mostly in my custody, but the Alderman desired his man might have the great coat; I marked it.</p>
               <p>Court. What has been in your custody and what not? - The great coat and boots, and waistcoat were delivered to the coachman; the rest of the things have been locked up in a room in Rathbone-place, in the custody of Mr. Purvis, one of our collectors, who is not here.</p>

               <p>I am the patrol; it was a very light moon-shine night; I was in Charlotte-street, and I saw the prisoners turn into Percy-street, into Tottenham-court Road, we charged them; Hunt said he came from Bond-street, one Mr. Cole, and that he drove a hackney-coach; he said he had lost himself; I said then you cannot be a hackney-coachman; he said he was no thief; we brought him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Court to Kane. What is the value of these things that are lost? - I valued them, my Lord, at 4 l. 9 s. 9 d.</p>

               <p>I had got a furlough to go into the country to see my friends, and I have an acquaintance or two that came from the same place, and they desired me to call on them, and we were drinking rather late on the road, and coming between Newman-street and Tottenham-court Road there were two or three men standing, and when we came up they took to their heels and ran away, and this property was found lying in the street; we stood some time, and nobody came, and we took it up, and we thought to take it home, that it would be enquired after, and if it was not enquired after to advertise it: we had not got above two hundred yards before the watchman and patrol stopped us with it.</p>

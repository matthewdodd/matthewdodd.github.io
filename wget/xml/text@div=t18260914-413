On the morning of 27th of August we were alarmed, by a knocking at the street door; I looked out at the window, and saw the watchman with the prisoner; he asked if I knew the man - I said No; he said he found him coming out of my house; I said, "Secure him" - he ran, and secured him, and brought him to the side door; I afterwards went into the kitchen, and found a bag, a cloth, a centre-bit, a phosphorus-box, and a bit of wax-candle; some of them in the kitchen, and some in the area; there was a square of glass broken, and part of it removed - a hand could have been put in at that part of the window - the window itself does not open. I do not know that any part of the premises were broken open.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Is not this window in a door? A. No, it is over the sink, and does not open; no one could have got in there without taking the frame out, and that was not moved; there was no part broken.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I received information on the night of the 27th of August, between half-past twelve and one o'clock, and went to Mr. Samwell's house - I found the area gate open, pulled it to, and knocked at the door; I returned again to the area, and saw the prisoner half in and half out of the gate; I seized him - there are no steps to the area - it is a small place, where they put the shutters down; the private door is in Little Turnstile, and the area in Holborn; he said"Watchman, it is all right - make no alarm;" I asked him if he lodged in the house, or was he the master of it, and, to the best of my knowledge, he said Yes, slowly - I said,"You must see the master of the house;" I went to the private door, and knocked twice - and Mr. Samwell looked out - he said "Secure him;" and I went to take hold of the prisoner, but he flew from me, and went up Holborn; I sprang my rattle, and ran - I took him myself, and brought him back - he was not out of my sight half a second - I then went down into the kitchen, and saw these implements in the sink, which is about an arm's length from the window, in which a square of glass was broken; the articles might have been deposited there, without a person getting into the house - there was no part broken; the articles might have been thrown there from the broken window.</p>

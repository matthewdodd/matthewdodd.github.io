Mr. Wemyss Jobson has written at least forty or fifty pages in all, and he has explained to the editor, Dr. Macauley, that he had been too grossly plundered by the late vile, legacy-hunting whig peer the Earl of Camperdown, and the present miscreant representative of Ayrshire, Sir James Ferguson of Kilkerran, the former of whom by marrying Mr. Wemyss Jobson's niece to the uncle of the latter succeeded in stripping Mr. Wemyss Jobson and his family of their inheritance, to be able to give the usual credit. In consequence of nonpayment he has been subjected to pri<lb></lb>vations and humiliations which it might delight these wretches to learn, but which he shall not stoop to describe; as he is unwilling to believe a religious society desires to promote their views, and while aiming at the conversion of heathen in the South Seas attempt to deprive an Englishman of bread."</p>

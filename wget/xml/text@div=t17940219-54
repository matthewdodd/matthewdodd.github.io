            , Covent Garden, I went there and asked the prisoner where he lived? he said, No. 6, Barley Court, Coal-yard, Drury lane, at the one pair of stairs; I went there, there was no such person lodged in the one pair, the woman that belonged to the house said, there was a widow woman lived in the parlour, but no man that she knowed of, while I was talking with this woman of the house, the woman, the prisoner at the bar, was coming up the court, she said, she lived in the parlour, I desired her to open the door, and after I got into the parlour, I searched her, and on her I found this half handkerchief and some pieces of a gown, the pieces of the gown are here, and four duplicates of articles that were pawned, and two shillings, that was all I took from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go any where in consequence of these duplicates? - Yes, I did, and the pawnbrokers, Elisha Ray and Thomas Lamb produced, before the magistrate, the things that they had taken in pledge, answerable to these duplicates.</p>

            . This is my cloth apron, this is the one that I lost, I know it by the darnings, I darned them at the corners, I know them both. This is a gown that I was making, this is a piece that was with it, near a yard; this is the made gown, I washed it out in the rough for the purpose of using it. I know the table cloth, there is no mark but several stains about it, that I know it by. I know the apron (produced by Lamb) by the small joining that is at the top, and a little bit set in very near the bottom; I know the handkerchief also by the scratch in the part that pins behind.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Wright. This is my table cloth, I know it by the pattern.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What is the christian name of your husband? - John.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Beecrost. Do you know any thing of that half shawl produced by Muslin? - Yes, I do, when taken it was clean.</p>
               <p>Court to Berrisford. You said that you found on the prisoner, Mahony, when you searched him, a skain of thread; have you got that skain of thread here? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there more than one skain? - No, there was no more, and it was this colour.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it cut? - Yes, the thread was lapped up altogether in the gown. There are the pieces that I cut off the gown that were lapped up with the gown.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mahony. I don't know any thing of the matter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harrington. Honoured gentlemen, I have lived a widow in credit and honour these seven years in one street, which can be testified by all the neighbours who can appear for my character; and I had my husband sick some time before he died. This man, on whose account I was taken up, has been on terms of marriage some time past; he told me that he had been married before, and that the clothes he brought me were his first wife's. I pawned these things in my own name, and gave him the money, not thinking of the trouble that was to follow. If I had thought they were got by any way dishonest I would not have pawned them with the pawnbrokers, whom I have dealt with for these number of years. Neither would I have allowed them to be brought into my place, as it is well known I work for my living in hard and honest labour. Therefore I hope you will take my case into consideration, as it would be hard for me and my children to suffer innocently. I never was in prison before, and trust, if ever I get out again, I never shall be in again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Mabony. I can produce witnesses that I was never married before, I never was married in my life.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Harrington called four witnesses, who gave her a very good character.</p>

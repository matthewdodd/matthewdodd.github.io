                  </hi>. I am a coal-whipper, and live in New-court, St. George's-in-the-East. I have known the prisoner five months, while I have been living in the court—I never lived in the same house with her—she abused me once or twice, about six weeks before this happened, and she threatened me several times before that she would give me a mark—I had done nothing to offend her. On Wednesday evening, the 15th of July, I was in the court between seven and eight o'clock—I went into the house where I live, and was asked by my next door neighbour to go and have some beer—I went and saw the prisoner there—I came out of the house directly, and she followed me out—I had said nothing to her—when she came out she caught me by the jacket, and tore it, and said I should go in and have some beer with her—I told her I would have nothing to say to her, and to keep away from me, for she was no good—I got from her and went to my own place—she followed me into my place—I told her far God's sake to keep away, I wanted to have nothing to say to her—I was afterwards standing in the court, with my back against the wall, and my hands in my pocket—she came up, and had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with another woman in the court, and then turned round and hit me on the forehead with a quart pot, which she had in her hand—it cut me, and bled all the way to the London Hospital, where I went to get it dressed—I was in the hospital twelve days altogether—I had come away a day or two and gone again—I had done nothing whatever to her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital. I saw the prosecutor that evening—he had an incised wound over the left eye, about an inch in length—a small artery was divided, and he bled pro<lb></lb>fusely—it was about half an inch deep, and an inch long, or rather more—he would not remain in the hospital that night—he came next morning, and was very ill indeed—he was obliged to come into the hospital—he would have been in danger if he had continued out, but coming in averted the danger—if inflammation had followed it would have been very dangerous—he was twelve or thirteen days in the hospital.</p>

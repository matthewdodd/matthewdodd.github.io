               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I had drank a pint of wine and no more. We went into a house and had a pint of porter together, from the public house called the prisoners bars, we walked to the door of my house then I parted with him. After I had been in the house a few minutes I missed my pocket book, it was in my left hand inner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181001100027"></xptr>pocket of my coat. On the next day my pocket book was brought to me by a woman, I was not at home; she said, she would deliver it to nobody but me, the next day the husband brought the pocket book to me, I went to Hatton-garden, and had a warrant for the prisoner; on Friday morning, I saw him at a public-house in Somer's-town, he then said, he did not know me nor my family.</p>

             ABBOTT. I am a plaisterer. On Wednesday week, the prisoner gave me a pocket book, which he said, he found between Goswell-street, and the City-road; I searched the book, I found there were bills in it to a great amount; he said, when he found it there were two one pound notes in it, there were no notes in it when he gave it me; I took the book to Mr. Gray.</p>

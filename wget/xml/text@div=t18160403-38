            . On the evening of the 13th of March, I was sitting in my parlour behind my shop and I heard something, as if the door opened for somebody to come in. The door had been on the latch to the best of my knowledge. I immediately went into the shop, and immediately I saw a person handing the till over the counter. He ran off, and I ran after him. I cried out after him. I pursued him near twenty yards; in consequence of which he dropped the till, and I picked it up and carried it home. I heard the constable, whose voice I knew, say, Mr. 
               <persName id="t18160403-38-person387">Stewart</persName>
             I have got him. He was then taken to the watch-house together with the till. I saw him throw the money and the till into the street, at the same time. The door opens with a spring latch, and it was fast, or I should not have left it.</p>

               <p>JOHN READ. I am a constable. At about nine o'clock in the evening of the 13th of March, I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030032"></xptr>the prisoner with something under his arm running, aad Mr. Stewart after him. At that time I thought it was a box; I saw him drop it, and I immediately laid hold of him; I took him to Mr. Stewart's shop, and afterwards to the watch-house. Mr. Stewart picked up the till, and I picked up some of the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Gilbert-street, Clare-market. I know Burrows, and I have seen the other two prisoners in his shop and house—between the 5th and 17th of February last I reckoned something up for them, and they said it was steel—I gave them the estimate, and they were satisfied—I cannot tell how much I made it—it was so much a hundred-weight or a pound.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">re-examined.</hi> Parker and Parmee had been in my service about two years—they were working for me the latter end of last year—their employ would bring them in contact with this steel—I never sold any but to Sir James Anderson—I sent him the long parallel pieces unwrought—I cannot say what pieces were sold to Mr. Cohen—whether the pieces produced have been cut since they were in my warehouse I can<lb></lb>not say—some of the plates, in the first instance, previous to getting the proper size for the railway springs, were forced to be cut, and there was a certain quantity of waste steel made, but it is so long ago that I should say this cannot form any part of it—what I now have is three or four feet long, and there would be no cuttings but edge cuttings—it is generally known in the trade that this kind of steel is mine—nobody else in London has ever had any manufactured—I am not aware that steel of this sort is used for any other purpose than for making these springs.</p>

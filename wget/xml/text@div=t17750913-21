I let the prisoner a lodging in February last; she took it as for a widow: I would not suffer her to continue any longer, as that widow did not behave well, that was the beginning of last March; then she took it for herself; then her husband came; he lodged there divers times with her; she continued there till the latter end of July. A person advised me to examine my furniture, to see if there was any missing. I got a woman to examine the furniture, but she would not admit her to look at the things. I found the door half locked; I got in, and missed a pair of sheets, one of the sheets was near new: I missed a silver tea-spoon and a table-cloth, the sheets and table-cloth were let in the lodging; upon the Friday following I took the prisoner.</p>

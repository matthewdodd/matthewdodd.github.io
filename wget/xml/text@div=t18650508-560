I live at Bishop's-court, Clerkenwell, and work for Mr. Day, a carman—I was in Pope's service last autumn—I know Ivermee; he is a grocer in Caledonian-road—I have gone to Brewers'-quay on a great many occasions for sugar, which I have taken to Ivermee and other persons—I have seen Phillips and others at Brewers'-quay—I have seen Green—I have taken a sort of envelope from my master to Cole—I have never got any from Ivermee—the envelopes were directed to Phillips' warehouse; I delivered them there, and told Phillips that I had come for sugar for Mr. Ivermee—he told me to go out and wait my turn, and I waited, and drew up my cart, and took in the sugar—I had no delivery-order to take into the counting-house to be counter-signed; I had on some occasions, but I cannot say the dates—I used to go between 8 and 4; I have sometimes been kept waiting all day—I used to have similar notes to these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Mr. Ivermee signed them when I delivered the sugar to him—I delivered a barrel to Mr. Bryant, and got it signed for—printed cart-notes similar to these, used to be put under the string of the last loaf of sugar that used to come down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a grocer of Kentish-town; I know Ivermee—I was in the habit of buying sugar of him in 1863—on 30th December, 1863, I bought a hundred loaves of sugar, weighing 16 cwt. 2 qrs.—my wife signed this note—I received this cart-note with it—when I received sugar from Brewers'-quay, Ivermee sent for it afterwards, and I have given him up some of the printed cart-notes which I received with it—I kept this one by mis<lb></lb>take—when I had goods not through Ivermee the notes were left with me—I have bought sugar of Ivermee for about three years and a half—I have had a good deal of sugar from Brewers'-quay which I bought of him.</p>

                  </hi>. In this delivery-book of 12th August, 1863, there is no entry of 11 cwt of refined, to Ivermee—there were eight deliveries of sugar that day—Phillips was at the warehouse on the 11th, 12th, and 13th—I have looked in the counterfoils of the cart-book, and there is no record of the transaction, nor is there in this book of 30th December any notice what<lb></lb>ever of the delivery to Ivermee or Bryant; there were six deliveries on that day—there is no notice of the transaction in the counterfoil of the cart-book—Phillips was there that day—the cart-note of 30th December is on one of our forms; it is signed by Green; it is rather different from his usual</p>

               <p>signature, but it is his writing—it was Phillips' duty to superintend the delivery of the sugar, and if he noticed a blank counterfoil to inquire what had become of the other part—he came at 8 in the morning, and stayed till 4, 5, 6, or 7, according to when the work was done—he had his breakfast before he came, and his dinner was brought in to him, so that he was always there to superintend—Green kept the book, and Phillips walked about and attended to the delivery; if an owner sent an order, he was to take care that the delivery was made from that owner's stock, and he or Green would point out the stock.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouse superintendent at Brewers'-quay—these five invoices are, to the best of my belief, in Green's writing except the receipts—in Phillips' absence it would be the deputy-foreman's duty to attend to the delivery of sugar; it is not my duty—the most floors occupied with sugar were three, but only two, to the best of my belief, before last year—they would examine the delivery-order book to see that the order and the book agreed, but if there was no delivery-order we should not know that any sugar had been taken away—its absence made everything else futile.</p>

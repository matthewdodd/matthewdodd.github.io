               <p>I was returning in the evening about eight o'clock or a little after, in company with a young lady to see her home; at the end of the new road leading towards the <placeName id="t17800510-10-crimeloc58">Duke of Bedford's private road</placeName>

I rather put my head on one side and lifted up my cane, the other, that stood close to him, got hold of my wrist, turned me round, and wrenched the cane out of my hand.</p>
               <p>What are you? - A surgeon in his majesty's service; the young lady who was in my company gave a sort of a scream. I apprehend he might imagine I was going to make an attempt to seise him, upon which he clapped his hand up my shoulder and said, Sir, your life or your money this moment! One had hold of my collar. I saw them pull the young lady about. I said do not use she young lady ill; I will give you what I have, I knew I had both gold and silver in my pocket; I thought I had given it him all, but the next day I discovered that I had given him only a shilling.</p>
               <p>You have said nothing to the prisoner, was he one of those people? - I cannot say whether he was or not; he was stopped about fourteen or fifteen yards from me by a person in court. I was asked whether he was one of them? I believe, I might then say he was. I might then say more than a man would wish to speak, if he was cool; but as for his being one I cannot say I know it. I desired the young lady to give them what she had. She said, she had done so; then the men ran off; there was a single horse chaise came by; the man whom I gave my money to ran off, and at that very instant I heard some other people come up the same road I was going. I called out</p>
               <p>"take care of yourselves, here are some footpads;" upon which one of the witnesses stopped the prisoner and said, Sir, is this one of them? I told him he might be one.</p>

               <p>I was coming home from Paddington last Sunday was month, which was the 9th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100015"></xptr>April, at about nine o'clock at night, between Tottenham Court Road turnpike and the Duke of Bedford's private road, with Mr. Williams, we heard a noise of a woman crying, seemingly as if she was in distress. I went a little forward, rather faster upon hearing the cry; when we came within eight or ten yards of them, I saw three or four men round Mr. Creamer and a young lady; upon my approach three man ran from me, and one walked softly towards me. I looked at him as he passed me; as soon as he came by me, a gentleman came up and said, gentlemen they are all footpads; they have robbed me.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner was one of them? - Yes; I saw him come from the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Did he attempt to run away? - No, not the least in the world, he walked softly; as he had passed me four or five yards, the gentleman came up and said, Stop gentlemen, they are all footpads, and they have robbed me. I went immediately after the prisoner, and stopped him. I said to the gentlewoman is this of one them? She said, the man who held me has an handkerchief tied round his neck.</p>
               <p>Court. Is the young lady here? -</p>
               <p>Creamer. She says she was so much frightened that it is not in her power to swear to the men; she is not here.</p>
               <p>Avis. Mr. Creamer said he believed him to be the man; the prisoner had a blue handkerchief with white spots tied in a bow under his chin when I laid hold of him; he made some resistance; when he made resistance Mr. Williams came up and took the stick out of his hand (producing a very large stick) which he was going to make resistance with.</p>
               <p>What was it o'clock? - About eight.</p>
               <p>What sort of a night was it? - Moonlight, but at times rather cloudy. I took him by the gentleman's desire to the first publick-house; there Mr. Grubb was sent for. I saw him come from the gentleman, and he never quitted my sight till I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing upon him? - Nothing but a cord with a slip noose to it, and a knife.</p>
               <p>What distance was you from Mr. Creamer when you saw four people about him? - Very near, I suppose not more than nine or ten yards.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I had an information that there were some footpads out; I was fetched from my house; just as I came to Tottenham Court they said they had one in at a publick-house who had robbed a gentleman. I went there and took the prisoner into custody; the people there said he had thrown something away in the field where he was apprehended. I get a link and looked among the grass but could see nothing. The next morning we went there, and there were some people who had found a cane, but we did not find it ourselves.</p>

               <p>I had gone a good way from the gentleman before they took hold of me.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Did the other three run away? - Yes, three ran one way and one the other. This witness says he saw two or three run away from me. When I was at the office where the men were examined, I was attacked for want of candour and honesty; a man in the office had even the insolence to tell me, because I was doubtful within my own breast, he finding the man was not likely to be convicted, told me I was as bad as a thief myself, because I would not convict him. I said I should be glad to know whether in an office like that people were to be insulted in that manner? He said, if the cap fitted me I might wear it. I said a very little altering of it would make it sit himself. My Lord, what I do here is by mere compulsion; the morning following<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100016"></xptr>when I went to the office some evasions were made, the lad could not be brought to be examined. I said when I came out of the publick-house, let that man go, the effect it has had upon me is such that, should that man's life be affected, I should never be happy nor the young lady, for she was very unhappy at what she said in her hurry; those two men who robbed me parted from me some moments before the other parted away, when I saw him I could not recollect him, though I stood so very near him.</p>
               <p>Court. Who at the office found fault with you for not being more positive, it was a very scandalous conduct? - He was a stout man, I do not know his name.</p>

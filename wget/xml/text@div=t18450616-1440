                  </hi>. I am a boot-maker, and live in Belvidere-road, Lambeth. At twenty minutes past one o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of June, I was coming home, a little the worse for liquor, but was perfectly aware of what I was doing—I met the prisoner at the corner of Westminster-bridge road—she asked me to go with her—I walked a little way down the Belvidere-road, to the corner on a court, and waited about five minutes—I saw her give my watch to a man who ran off—I ran and called "Police"—the policeman came—I came back and gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable L</hi> 98.) I saw the prosecutor—he was not sober nor drunk—he was quite sensible on giving the charge—he stated the prisoner had robbed him of his watch, and gave it to a man who had ran off—the prisoner said, "O, because he would not give me money enough he has given me in charge."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> He very nearly knocked me over the bridge; he dragged me down the Belvidere-road; there we stood a bit; he said he had lost his watch, and called the policeman; I had no man with me, and how was it possible 1 cuuld take hib watch and guard?</p>

               <p>Q. What age is she?</p>
               <p>Sibley. She is at least thirteen or fourteen.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took them?</p>
               <p>Sibley. Because some of them were found upon her, and she owned the taking them; and she charged some to her mother in the country, that she was a partaker with her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Sibley . Her going away 10, and not returning, gave me a suspicion of her; and I sent to the vestry-clark of Cheshunt, where I had her from; and he took her up and put her into the workhouse, and then sent for me; I sent a warrant down to bring her up, and she was carried before Justice Hole, and she said that she fell asleep under a hedge, with the things under her head, and they were taken away from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of these things again?</p>
               <p>Sibley. Only a cap and a handkerchief.</p>

             . I went down to serve a warrant, to fetch the girl from Cheshunt , where she was put out apprentice to my mother; and she was taken up and detained there in the workhouse, by the vestry-clark: I brought her up the same day I went down, and carried her before justice Hole, and she confessed the taking the things; and declared that her mother was in a field hard by, and took the things from her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this field?</p>
               <p>Broom. A little beyond Wood's Close, as you go to Islington; and the prisoner wanted to take her mother up, and I took her and carried her before Justice Hole, and she cleared herself before the Justice of what her daughter accused her of.</p>

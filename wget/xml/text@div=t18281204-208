On the 1st of November, I went to take a pie to Cattle's shop - Smith came in just as I was coming out: in the course of the time, Smith sent me out for some gin - Cattle poured out about half a glass; I took a little of it, and in the course of conversation, I said I was going to Hoxton, in the evening; both the prisoners were present when I said that; about twenty minutes before six o'clock, I went out from mistress to go to Mr. Hunter's, Britannia-gardens, Hoxton, to receive 5l.; I had a receipt for it in my hand; mistress desired me to go a public way: I passed Cattle's shop in my way - I owed him 1d. for a tart - I went in and paid for it; Smith came in directly I got into the shop - I do not know whether I then mentioned where I was going; the prisoners went out of the shop; I remained there five or ten minutes talking to Mrs. Cattle, and then went out; Cattle overtook me when I got to the Goldsmiths' alms-houses, in Hackney-road, and said he was going my way; I said "Are you?" I saw Smith, in a few minutes he came up; they were talking together - I could not hear what they said; after going on a little while, I heard Cattle tell Smith, what a pretty sweetheart he was, for he had never spoken to me all the way; I went on, and got at last to Pitfield-street, and at the corner of that street, I asked Cattle if he would be so kind as to come down Britannia-gardens, as it was such a lonesome place; he said he was in a hurry to get his yeast, but if I would go as far as St. Luke's church with him, he would see me to Britannia-gardens; I went with him - Smith went also; and when we got a little distance, they both asked me to go into a public-house to have something to drink; I went in, and Smith gave me a glass of gin, which I drank - I stopped by St. Luke's church, while he got his yeast - we were all three together.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, after that you set off to Britannia-gardens? A. Yes; I went to Mr. Hunter's, and received five sovereigns - the prisoners waited for me by agreement, till I came out- I wrapped the five sovereigns in a piece of paper, and put them in my bosom - my gown was pinned over it, and my apron tied over that - I found them waiting for me; Cattle said, had I got what I went for; I said Yes - I had the receipt in my hand in his shop; it had a stamp on it; I kept it in my hand all along the road; after going a little way, Cattle said if I had got any paper, or any thing to take care of, he would take care of it for me; I said I was capable of taking care of it myself; they asked me to go to a house, No. 9, opposite Britannia-gardens - I refused; Smith said it would not hurt me - he took me by the hand, and pulled me in: I do not remember whether Cattle said any thing - we all three went in; some gin was called for; Smith brought me a glass to the window, which I drank - I do not know who paid for it; I was standing by the window, and had not sat down; the prisoners were at the bar; I came out with them; we turned down a court by the side of the public-house - it was dark; I said I did not know where I was; Cattle said I was going right; about five or ten minutes after this, I felt very sick and giddy; Cattle repeated two or three times that he would take care of what I had, if I would give it to him; I refused - I do not remember going to any other house, except one, where I had a glass of liquor thrown over me, and I believe that was the Red Cow public-house, at Dalston; Smith threw it over me, because I would not drink it - I have no recollection whatever of what happened after I got out of this public-house, till I remember the patrol taking me up off the ground - I am seventeen years old, and single - I have lived at Mrs. Smith's four years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.How far from Cattle's shop does your mistress live? A. A very short distance - about as far as from here to Newgate; I knew him perfectly well - mistress never went to his shop; he was known in the neighbourhood; I was at this house twice that day, but did not say what I was going to Hoxton for - the recipt was folded up in my hand - nobody could see what it was - I do not recollect telling either of them I was going for money; I had only known Smith about three weeks - I had seen him at Cattle's,</p>
               <p>Q. As you were insensible from the time you left the public-house till the patrol came up, can you venture to say you did not give Cattle the money to take care of? A. I cannot swear whether I gave it him - whether I dropped it, or whether it was taken from me; I have not the least recollection of giving it to him, and think if I had done so I must recollect it; I wore a close dress, pinned up at the bosom; I put the money down near the pit of my stomach, then put up my dress, and tied my apron over it; the gin thrown over me went down my neck; I did not open my bosom to wipe it.</p>
               <p>Q. After you got out, was there no romping or toying between Smith and you? A. Not that I recollect; Cattle's brother came to our house on Sunday morning, while I was at chapel, and I went to where cattle was, but did not see him; I spoke to him throught the rails.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say to him, "I won't hurt you - I am sure you did not intend to rob me"? A. No, I did not; he said "If you say I took the money from you, it will transport me for life," and I said "I cannot say whether I gave it you or not;" that is all I said.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why did you go to the watch-house? A. By the persuasion of his brother, or somebody who came.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Hackney. On the 1st of November, I was on duty in Pigwell-field - there is a passage leading from there to a place called London-field, at the back of Grange's nursery - it is enclosed by a wall on one side, and a bank on the other - It is two hundred and sixty-four yards long; I heard a female voice screaming for assistance in that place, about half-past nine o'clock at night - I went to the spot, and when I got there I got on the bank, and saw the prisoner Smith with this young woman on the ground apparently attempting they were nearer to the wall than the bank; I got over the bank, collared him, and pulled him up, and told him he was ill-using the young woman - he made no answer at that time; I got the prosecutrix on her feet - she seemed very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182812040097"></xptr>much fatigued, and was in liquor; she put her hand into her bosom, and said "I have not got it;" I asked her what it was - she said she had lost 5l.; I asked Smith if he had got it; he said No, Cattle had got it - and then she said Cattle had got it; the bosom of her gown was open, and her shawl laid on the ground; the pins were out of her gown, and her breast quite exposed - the gown appeared to me to have been torn open; Smith was very much intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up, did you hear any thing? A.After I got over the bank, I spoke, and the young woman said she was robbed; she said she had lost her money; I thought I heard footsteps in the road; I went a few yards from Smith, in the direction of the steps; I met another patrol, and asked if he had met a man; he said Yes - I said "Well, bring him back, he has robbed a woman of 5l."- I spoke loud - I did not see the man; I then returned to Smith, and told him I should take him to the watch-house; he said I should not, or he would not go; I however took him there, and the prosecutrix went; I did not myself take Smith there, as another patrol came up at the spring of the rattle; he took him, and I took the prosecutrix there; two patrols overtook us on the road with Cattle - when I had been in the watch-house about ten minutes, I saw Cattle give Cowley a piece of brown paper with five sovereigns in it; he said the girl had given him the money to take care of: I did not hear any thing said before that, but my attention was particularly directed to the girl, who was in a fainting state - Smith gave me the name of

            . I am a patrol of Hackney. On the evening of the 1st of November I was on duty in the lane, and saw Cattle - I met him walking; I said "Patrol," and bade him good night; and after that I saw Watson fifteen or twenty yards behind me - I cannot say whether Cattle could hear what he said, as the wind blew away from him; he said something to me, and in consequence of that I went after Cattle, who continued walking till I got very near to him, and then took to running; I had said nothing to him then, but when he ran, I said, "You had better stop, young man," and sprang my rattle - he continued running: I ran, but could not overtake him - there are three paths on that spot; he did not take the path towards Margaret-street - he was a mile or two out of his way from Hoxton to Margaret-street; I sprang my rattle, and after that went back to Smith, Watson, and the prosecutrix, as I could not overtake him - on the way to the watch-house the prosecutrix began crying, as her petticoats fell off; Smith said,"Don't cry" - I said, "Have you got this young woman's money?" he said," No, I have not, Cattle has it - I asked her for it, and if she had given it to me I would have put it where no b-r alive could have found it;" two patrols overtook us with Cattle in custody - I said to Smith,"Then this is the man who has got her money;" he said"Yes, that is Cattle, he has got her money" - I do not think he was near enough to hear that said; I said nothing to him about the money in Cattle's presence - when we got to the watch-house I gave charge of them; Cowley asked me the charge - I said, "We have brought in these two young men, on suspicion of robbing this young woman of 5l.; Cattle immediately said "It is no robbery at all - here are the five sovereigns which she gave me to take care of," and gave them up directly to Cowley, the constable of the night, (who is since dead;) they were then locked up.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Hackney. I was on duty on the 1st of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night - I heard a rattle spring, and saw Cattle coming towards me at a regular walking pace; I went up to him, and called him - he said at first," I am not the man, it is a young man and a young woman over in the field;" I said," I must detain you" - he said I had no right to detain him, and as he spoke I perceived he caught his breath;" I said, "You are out of breath, and I shall detain you" - he said I was doing him an injury in detaining him, and keeping him from his business; I said I did not wish to injure him - if he would go with me to the party, I would not detain him, if they said he was not the person; we proceeded across the fields - I do not remember his saying any thing more; he did not say a word about having any money - I took him across the fields, and met Gregory, the patrol, and left him in his custody; I went on and called Pilton, who came to me - the place is a narrow passage; I went back to where Cattle was, and heard Pilton say to him, "Cattle, you are the man who robbed the girl" - I do not remember his answer, but think he said,"How do you know?" Pilton said, "If I had not known you, how should I have picked you out from the rest;" a gentleman hearing this, said, "Now you secure him - secure his hands;" I proceeded towards Hackney watch-house with him in custody, and overtook Smith in custody near the Cock public-house - up to that time Cattle had not said a word about the money, but then something was mentioned that he had the money; the impression on my mind is, that he owned having it then - we went to the watch-house where Smith gave another name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When Cattle said he was not the man, you had not charged him with any thing; whether it was for stealing money, or for assaulting a woman with intent to ravish her, he could not tell? A. No - I did not know myself; he said he had the money before he got to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am a patrol. Trewbridge gave Cattle to me - he was in my charge for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and did not say a word about having any money: I did not go to the watch-house with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did he say he had done nothing wrong? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I had Cattle in custody, and said, "You are the man who robbed the woman of the 5l." - he made no answer then; I took him down to the watch-house - when he saw the other prisoner he said he had got the money in his pocket, on his left-hand side; that was nearly a quarter of an hour after I had made the charge against him.</p>

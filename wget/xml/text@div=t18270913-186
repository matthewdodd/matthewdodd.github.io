On Thursday, the 9th of August, I was with Webster, at the top of Lisson-street, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning; we saw the prisoner with a hamper; the ostler of the Red Lion came and took the hamper from him; I followed, and saw them go down a mews, and pitch the hamper; I went and took it, and found in it three ducks and two geese, which had just been killed - they were quite warm; they were both taken, but the ostler was discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I lost a watch and stand from the bed-room on the first floor of my house—I made the stand myself—on the 20th of Oct., in con<lb></lb>sequence of information, I went to No. 1, Bridge-place, Stoke Newington, and found the property on the mantel-piece—I found the prisoner there—she seemed quite strange to the knowledge of it—I said, "This is my pro<lb></lb>perty," and called the policeman immediately—she said she did not take it at all, and knew nothing at all about it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single. I was staying with Mr. and Mrs. Myers last Feb., at their house, in the Kingsland-road—they let apartments—on the 23rd of Feb. I went to open the door to a knock, and the prisoner was there—she asked me whether there were apartments to let—I said, "Yes, the first floor"—I showed her into the front-parlour—the prosecutor and his wife lived there sometimes—I left her in that room—I went up and gave information to Mrs. Myers—I returned to the prisoner, took her up stairs, and left her with Mrs. Myers—I saw the watch and stand were on the mantel-piece—the prisoner came again in the evening, went up stairs, looked at the apartments, and agreed to take them—I heard her say she had a piano<lb></lb>forte she would send in—she then said she had dropped her glove—Mrs. Myers told her to go back and pick it up—she went back, and then they went down into the parlour—I took in a pen and ink—I left the parlour, leaving her and Mrs. Myers there—she left the house shortly after, and the watch and stand were missed—in consequence of suspicions, I went with Mrs. Myers on the following Thursday to Stoke Newington—I saw the pri<lb></lb>soner—she said she had not been after any apartments—Mrs. Myers asked if her sister, Mrs. Andrews, was at borne—the prisoner said no—Mrs. Myers said there was an unfortunate likeness between Miss Miller and her sister—the prisoner's name was Miller at the time of the robbery.</p>

Q.</hi> Did not Mrs. Myers ask if she was not Mrs. Andrews's sister? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, and asked if her name was not Nicholson—she said it was—Mrs. Myers made minute inquiries about Mrs. Andrews—the woman who came for the lodging, said her husband was a captain, and gave an address in the Commercial-road—the prisoner offered to communicate with her sister about this watchstand.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's wife. Miss Wicks was staying with me—I had apartments to let—on Wednesday, the 3rd of Feb. Miss Wicks brought the prisoner up stairs to me—she looked at the apartments—this watch and stand were on the mantel-piece in the bed-room—I can swear to this stand—here is a mark on it—my husband made it—the prisoner came in the evening, and I went into the parlour with her—she said her husband was chief officer in a vessel, and gave her address, "No. 2, York-place, Commer<lb></lb>cial-road"—she took the apartments, and was to come on the Monday—as she came out of the bed-room along the landing, she said she had dropped her glove, and must go back—I told her to go—she went into the bed-room where the watch was—she joined me again, and we both went down into the parlour—I called for a light and a pen and ink—she wrote her address with one hand, and held her other hand under her shawl, as if there was something in it—she kept pushing something up—she gave her address, "No. 2, York-place, Commercial-road"—I took my bill down for my apartments—I went to inquire next morning, and could find no such person—I went from there to Salmon-lane, Stepney, and there I found a person lived, who answered the description, and whose husband was a chief officer—on the following Monday I went to dust the room, and missed the watch and stand—I went again to Salmon-lane—I there found that the person who lived there had a sister of the name of Miller, living at Stoke Newington—I went there, and saw the prisoner there—she had exactly the same dross, bonnet, and shawl on—I</p>

I went with my husband to where the prisoner lives—I saw this stand there—it is the same watch-stand that was in my bed<lb></lb>room—I gave her into custody—I found the watch at the pawnbroker's, pledged in her own name.</p>

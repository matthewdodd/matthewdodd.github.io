                  </hi>. I live in Cock-lane, St. Sepulchre's. I only rent a room there—the owner lives in the house. On Saturday, the 29th of March, about seven o'clock in the evening, I left the room with my wife, and locked the door—I had above 100 pairs of socks in a bag, marked S, and a cross over it, in the room—the prisoner Elizabeth was employed to knit socks for me—I returned a little before ten, and found the door half-way open open—I missed the bag and socks—on the Sunday following I went with an officer to No. 12, Henrietta-street, Vinegar-ground, and saw the prisoner Elizabeth come out of the house—I called the officer's atten<lb></lb>tion to her—we found the other prisoner in the house—she lived there—the officer told Susannah I had lost this property, and had she objec<lb></lb>tion to his looking for it—I left to fetch another officer, and on my return, Cale, the officer had the bag in his possession, and part of the socks in it, and a table-cloth of mine—Elizabeth had worked for me some time—I had a very good opinion of her.</p>

I saw a female standing on the top step of Smith's street-door on Saturday evening, between seven and eight o'clock—I know the prisoner Elizabeth—I had given her a key for Mrs. Smith, on the Wednesday, and by her appearance it was the prisoner Elizabeth, but I did not see her face—she turned her head as I came to the door—it was a person of her size—I have frequently seen her waiting for Mrs. Smith, and considered at the time that it was her.</p>

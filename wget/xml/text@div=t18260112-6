            . I live at No. 10, Marchmont-street, Russell-square. On the 28th of December, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I was returning to my office in Symond's-inn - it was quite dark - there is a coffee-house at the corner of Symond's-inn gateway - the front door opens into Chancery-lane, and the back into the inn - and there is a window looking into the inn; I observed two men, whom I suspected, looking about the inn; I was proceeding to my office at the back of the coffee-house and observed one of the ground-floor windows of the coffee-house open - it was not the coffee-room; the room was not lighted, but I could see, by the light of a gas lamp, a man in the room, with something white in his hand - I waited in the yard three or four minutes, then knocked at another window and called Watch! - the two men ran off - the man put his hand on the window ledge and jumped out, with a bundle under his arm - I ran towards him and attempted to seize him - he slipped by me, dropped the property, and ran about forty yards before I overtook him towards the courts which lead into Fetter-lane; I dragged him back to the place where he dropped the property; my cries brought assistance round - I desired the persons to surround the property - it was delivered to the beadle of the liberty in my presence; I am certain it is the same as he dropped - I took an inventory of it at the watch-house - I am certain he is the man - I never lost sight of him.</p>

When the alarm was given I found that the brass curtain rod was bent.</p>

               <p>On Saturday the 25th of October, about half after ten, or near eleven, I was in the next room, and I thought I heard a footstep, I immediately went into the passage, and as I was going down to the front parlour, I missed the glass, I saw the prisoner going about three doors from mine with the glass on his right arm, I said stop that fellow, and he set down the glass, he put it down very carefully against the wall of Mr. Braley's house, he went towards the Mansion-house, I took the glass and went towards my own door; and the prisoner was taken in Lothbury, I did not see him taken.</p>
               <p>How do you know it is the same man? - I am confident it is the same man I saw with the glass, and that passed me when I returned with the glass; I had a full view of him, and I am very sure it is the same person.</p>

               <p>I was standing at my door the 25th of October, I live next door but one to the prosecutrix, she came out of their house and said, stop that man, he has stole my looking-glass: I saw him then with the glass under his arm, I did not notice him before, I followed him and he was taken in Lothbury; I never lost sight of him, I am sure this is the same man.</p>

               <p>I was going to Mr. Jones's, an attorney in Castle-yard, Holborn, No. 16, about some money, and going past that place, I am not acquainted much in London, I came from the West Indies, and a woman asked me to carry this glass: soon after the woman came and said, young man the glass belongs to me. I have no witnesses, but there are several gentlemen that know me, and they may be in this Court now, or they would come to my character tomorrow.</p>

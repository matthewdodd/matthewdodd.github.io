One of the Evidence deposed, that the Prisoner being his Lodger, he saw him make 5 Shillings; that the Prisoner gave him mony to buy Flasks, which he did; that he did also send him for some Sand, and some Tin-Glass from a Pewterers shop, but for what design he knew not; that at other times saw him make 24 false Shillings more, and afterwards gild a silver Guinea: That the Prisoner told him he designed in a day or two to go into the Country; that what mony he had made would serve to pass there. And Evidence deposed, he had seen him gild a Counterfeit Guinea, and cast a Counterfeit Shilling, and make several false Stamps for Counterfeiting the Stamps on Paper. The rest of the Evidence deposed, they had seized several pieces of Counterfeit Mony in a Chest, owned by the Prisoner, all which was produced in Court, as were many Tools for Coining at Chester, where he was committed, but made his escape.

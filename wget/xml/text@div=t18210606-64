             shall assist you, in case any thing shall have escaped your memory.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLIAMS (in continuation). I afterwards received a letter from Mr. Clark, complaining of not having received an acknowlegment of the money, and that was the first I knew of it. I read the letter to the prisoner, and remonstrated with him, and said, I should be ruined; he said, He should make it all right, I should lose nothing by him; he lived on the premises with his family, and had the charge of all the property there - I live at Greenwich.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he remain with you after this - A. I scarcely got sight of him after but once, he went out before I arrived, and returned at night after I was gone, and he absented himself entirely on the 5th of May - his family remained there. Messrs. Sunters, my other clerks, principally kept the books, with the prisoner's assistance, when the prisoner left, the book that passed through his hands, for the cash account was missing - I never consented to his taking this bill out of the letter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You had two modes of keeping your accounts, one private and the other public - A. No, I occasionally wanted other assistance than I could procure myself, but the prisoner did not supply my wants - he procured assistance from my own friends.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, has he not in numerous instances, procured assistance from his own friends - A. I consider them my friends.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not procured for you, bills and acceptances from persons you never knew, to the amount of thousands - A. I most positively deny receiving from him anything but what he effected to bring from a Mr. Harris, and between me and Mr. Harris, I cannot account. I did not know but all the paper he brought, came from Mr. Harris, till lately. He brought me some bills accepted by one Walby, said to be a friend of his - it was some time in March. I never recollect telling him he must get me assistance elsewhere, when Mr. Harris could not accommodate me. If I had Eddington's book, I could tell better what I have received, but without it I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is a book, look at it - A. There are two others. I have no secrets. I had no private transactions with him that I do not wish to be known.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a private account kept of money, he accommodated you with - A. Not to my knowledge; he had the care of the books; he did in some instances procure accommodation for me, that is, he exchanged acceptance with a friend, on my responsibility and not his.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he not procured 1800 l. from his own mother, out of which you have paid 500 l. - A. His mother holds my acceptance for that amount, but I never had the money. I gave her the bills about a month or six weeks ago, they are to the amount of 1300 l. I have no doubt but the first money that came into his hands, he paid himself with; he did not say he took the 62 l. to settle the balance - he never made any claim on me. Mr. Carter called on me, and said, If I gave an undertaking for the safety of the prisoner's person, he would attend and make up the books; he offered to settle it by reference - this was a fortnight after his absence.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not desired him to keep an account of what money he procured for you, by his own means, on a separate slip of paper - A. No, he kept account on paper, (looks at a paper) this has my mark on it - No. 8.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, looking at that, I ask you, was not 751 l. procured as stated on that paper - A. Yes, but allow me to explain, the prisoner furnished 38 l. 15 s. of it, but I never asked him, the paper is his writing, I put the mark on it when it is sent me to examine, (looks at another paper) it appears by this, that 21 l. was advanced by him; he paid forty guineas for a horse for me, but I will answer for it, he paid himself, so much money went through his hands, that unless I have his books, I cannot answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not since you ordered him not to open your letters, frequently told him to open them as heretofore - A. By no means, he procured me assistance from Mr. Wallis, who is a friend of his; I first heard of Wallis at the end of March last.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this bill for 259 l. dated May the 22d, 1820, accepted by Wallis, is not your endorsement on it - A. Yes, it is, but I did not know him in this transaction; Eddington brought it to me as from Harris.</p>
               <p>Q. When these slips of paper were brought with others to your counting-house, were they not by your direction put under a stone to conceal them - A. No, they were generally filed; I never burned any accounts, he appeared at the Mansion-House, and Mr. Harmer gave me notice he was ready to meet the charge.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Would you have been glad to have had a settlement from him at any time - A. It was my most anxious wish; he brought all money to me as from Harris, I had a general guarantee for all paper that came from Harris; I am not distressed for money, but able to meet every thing, and have many thousands over; I had an unexpected demand for 1800 l. and Mr. Eddington said, he thought he could get some money from a private friend, and I understand since that he got it from his mother, he had my acceptances, but I never had half the money, the slips of paper are merely accounts sent to me to shew the current entry of the day; the bill received from Mr. Clark was not entered any where, he kept it an entire secret.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When Mr. Clark wrote for you to acknowledge the receipt of this sum, did you examine the books - A. I did, and asked the prisoner what had become of it, he said, he should account for it, this was on the 25th of April.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he did not absent himself - A. His family were in the house, he came home at night; he was in my counting-house on the 27th of April, about four o'clock in the afternoon, but that was merely a look-in, I told him I would not be put off, I did threaten to prosecute him, or to send for a constable.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182106060043"></xptr>MR. ALLEY. Q. When did you go before the Lord Mayor - A. On the 5th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner breakfast with you that morning - A. Yes, he did; I did not take him up; a sheriff's officer arrested him, and said we could not take him out of the sheriff's hands.</p>

            . My husband and I were removing to No. 37, Peter-street, on the 19th of September; one of my lodgers told me the prisoner would carry my trunk and other things for me; I employed him to take them - he carried them on his shoulder, and was to take them to the room: I gave him a clock and white hair trunk to carry, and 6d. for it; it contained the articles stated - he went twice; he never returned the second time, and I never saw him till he was taken on Monday, the 19th of November, when he passed by our house; I have not seen my property since.</p>

I live at No. 37, Peter-street. - The prisoner brought a trunk to the house, and put it down before the counter in my shop; I told him to take it up stairs to the room Mrs. Goulden had taken; he said he could not take it up, for he was in a hurry to get some more things; he then went away, and returned in ten minutes, with a man in a green coat, and pointing to the trunk, he said, "There is the trunk;" the other man said it had come to the wrong place - I said he should not take it away, if any one took it it should be the prisoner; the prisoner said, "Well mistress, rather than have any words I will take it;" he took it, and I saw it no more.</p>

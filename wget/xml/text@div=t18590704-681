                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Twyford Abbey. On Saturday night, 26th June, I was near a public-house, relieving myself—at that time James Sanders came and took hold of me by the throat—I had seen him in the street before—I did not see him with any one—I saw him about an hour or two hours before—Hodges then came up and picked my pockets—I had not seen her before—they then left me—I kept in sight of the woman till she was given in custody—the male prisoner went another way—I pursued the woman because I thought she had the money—I saw her searched—she had not got it.</p>

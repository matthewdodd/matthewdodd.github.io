                  </hi>. I am a beer-retailer, of Prescot-street, Whitechapel—on the night of 2d January the prisoner came for a pint of half-and-half—he tendered a florin—I gave him change, and he left—he came back in a quarter of an hour, for a pint of sixpenny ale, which came to 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he ten<lb></lb>dered another florin—I put it in the machine, and found it was bad—I then tried the other, which I had put at the back of the till, where there was nothing but a half-crown, and found that was bad also—I kept them in my hand, ran round the counter, took him in custody, and afterwards gave them to the inspector.</p>

You are the same man—I said to you that you had been there not a quarter of an hour before—I said you have been here twice—you hummed and had, and said you had not, and held your head down and never spoke any more—you came in your coat the first time, and the second time in your shirt-sleeves—I have the pot here which you brought with you—it is new, and has never been washed.</p>

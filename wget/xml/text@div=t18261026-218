            . I had seen Martha Byatt on the 25th of September, and agreed to meet her on the 27th, at a person's house, near North-row; she promised she would have some little ones - I went to the place, but she was not there; the prisoner came in the evening, and sent for me; I went out, found her in Green-street, and said, "Have you got any little ones?" she said, No, but she had got six big ones, meaning counterfeit shillings, which I took of her, and gave her two goods shillings, which Limbrick had given to me, on the Tuesday before - I kept the bad shillings till I saw Limbrick, and gave them to him.</p>

               <p>Hughes's defence. I went in to purchase half a yard of calico, there was some in the window marked eleven-pence a yard; when I went in they said they had none under fourteen-pence a yard, and I came out again; I stopped to look at the window as any body else might, and then I went away; I know nothing about the cotton.</p>

               <p>Clarke's defence. I know nothing of it; I picked up the cotton upon the kisb-stone, and went away about my business, I did not know who it belonged to; this girl is as innocent as the child unborn, I never saw-her before.</p>

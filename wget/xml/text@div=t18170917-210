            . I am a plaisterer. The prisoner came to me and said he was very much in debt, and had several executions against him, and wanted two of my rooms to put his property in; I fetched the things from his lodgings to my house-the tools were taken away; the day before they were taken, the prisoner came to me and said the officers were coming to take me up, for the things that were found at my house, and desired me to get them off my premises or I should get into trouble. I took them to Worship-street. I told Gleed where to find them.</p>

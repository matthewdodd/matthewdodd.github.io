             came into the coffee room and called for a bason of broth, which I gave him, he paid for it the instant he had it. I went to the further end of the coffee room, he got up out of the box, he ate none of the broth: I looked at the bason and saw the spoon gone. I followed him close to the end of Flower-de-luce-court; I put my hand on his shoulder; he asked me what I wanted; I told him the spoon was gone which I gave him with the soup; he said he knew nothing of it; I told him it was an unpleasant circumstance, he had better come back into the box, there was nobody there but him. He took the spoon out of his pocket, I grasped his hand with the spoon in it, and brought him back to the coffee-room. He declared it was his first offence; I was convinced it was not, he had stolen one a fortnight before, from the same box.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 5th of June, 1771, I obtained a commission in the forty-seventh regiment by purchase; in 1774 I was in two actions with that regiment. On Bunker's-hill I was in the fortieth regiment, as a lieutenant. I have been wounded at four different times in my body. I have two sons serving my king and country. In consequence of a melancholy family loss which I sustained, my affairs became deranged; I was obliged to have refuge at Saint Martin's workhouse; from thence I was discharged much about the time that man mentions of the capture of the spoon. I was pennyless and friendless; unfortunately for me I did take this spoon; I was starving in every sense of the word. I now submit myself to the mercy<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181009190029"></xptr>of the court, not doubting but that mercy will be blended wish justice. It is the first time I ever was before a court of justice.</p>

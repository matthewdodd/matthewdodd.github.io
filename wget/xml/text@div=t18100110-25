               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner. - A. I do, by sight. On Thursday the 5th of August, I saw him come in the yard, and go to the exsise-box, he took out a handful of request papers and he selected one of them, the chest was kept in the yard; he went to look for a chest of that number, to match the request note. I went up to him, and said, what do you want, if you want any thing, why do not you speak. My place was to see that every one had his own; I took the paper out of his hand, and looked about to see for the chest; I pointed out, and said, that is the chest that you want.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the paper that you took of his hand - A. It is the paper, the number was 7m100. I returned him the paper after I found the chest for him to go to the Permit office, to get a permit.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him whose porter he was. - A. No; he went to the Permit office, he brought the permit into the yard, he was going to take the chest up; I said, my friend, I have not done with you yet: I took the permit out of his hand, and said, whose porter are you, I understood Mr. Roton's; I entered it in my book Roton, I asked him again, did you say you are Roton's porter, no; he said, Noton. I run my pen through Roton, and interlined it Noton.</p>

               <p>Q. Then the person who carries it to you, if the note is not a forgery, is the person who has a right to take the tea. - A. Of course.</p>

On the 9th of July, between one and two o'clock in the morning, as I was going to my barge, I heard somebody in the corn loft; I called my fellow servant, he came and stood with me; we stood by the loft stairs; we saw a man come out of the loft, he took the sack on his back, he came down towards us and pushed the door open; I took hold of him, I said Tharby is it you, it is too bad; he then said he was going to take it in his stable for his horses; I left him and went into the loft; I saw another sack full standing by the loft door. Peechey came with a light, he told me the prisoner had put that sack in the privy close by; Peechey went and brought the sack up and laid it alongside of the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look into the sack at that time - A We did not; they were tied at the top. Peachey locked the loft door and gave me the bunch of keys; at eight o'clock I delivered them up to Mr. Champion.</p>

            . Q. On this night were you along with Lightfoot - A. Yes; I observed a man come out of the loft, he came down the stairs with a sack on his back to where Lightfoot and I were standing. I heard the conversation that passed between him and Lightfoot. I knew the prisoner seven or eight years; I am sure he is the man; I told the prisoner to put it down; he put it into a little house where the men put their things in; I saw no more of him that night. I got a light, took it to Lightfoot; then I carried the sack of corn into the loft.</p>

            . I manage the business for Mr. Rosher, he is a lime merchant. In this corn was thirty quarters of oats; they had been landed that evening; I saw the corn in the sack after it was opened at the office, they were oats and of the same sample. The carmen are never suffered to go into the loft under any pretence whatever; it is delivered to the carmen by me.</p>
               <p>Q. He came back the next day - A. He did, in the morning early; as soon as I heard it I had him apprehended. When I returned from the magistrate, after hearing him say he wanted it for his horses, I looked, and there was near a bushel and a half in the bin.</p>

            . Q. Are you in the service of Mr. Rosher - A. I am a labourer. On the next morning, when the prisoner came to work, he said he saw me lay the keys in the little house; I had been landing corn that day; I locked the door and put the keys there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got up about half past one, I did not know it was so early; I put the key of the stable on the ledge of the little house, where the key of the loft was; I put up that corn one day before the time; I was going to the stable with it. I have worked for my master eight years; I had three pounds fourteen shillings of my master's in my pocket; if I had been a rogue I should have taken that.</p>

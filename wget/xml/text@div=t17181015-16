It appear'd by the Evidence, that the Prisoner being suspected to have been deliver'd of a Child, was search'd by a Midwife, to whom she own'd it, and told what she had done with it; and it was found in a Vault as she had directed. But nothing could be seen on it whether it had been hurt or not, nor whether it came at its fulltime, it having lay'n there 5 or 6 Weeks. The Prisoner in her Defence pleaded that she having been very much affrighted at the extraordinary Thunder and Lightning, fell very Ill of a Feaver and Measles, and that her Fright and Illness she did believe occasion'd the Death of the Child within her; for she did not feel it stir for some considerable time before its Birth, and that she came 6 Weeks before her time, it being Still-born, and in the time of her Illness; she brought Evidences to prove her Illness, and also that she had made Provision for the Child; upon which the Jury <rs id="t17181015-16-verdict82" type="verdictDescription">

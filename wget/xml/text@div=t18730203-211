                  </hi> I am a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons, and live at 39, Sydenham Park—about ten minutes' or a quarter-past 4 o'clock on the afternoon of 14th January I was passing the end of Mint Street, on my way home—there were several boys there; one of them ran at me suddenly and snatched my albert chain, Which was attached to the button hole by a bar—I seized my watch and the swivel broke from it—the man escaped up Mint Street and through a narrow passage with the chain and its appendages—I followed him very closely up various bye-streets—I gave an alarm—sometimes I was within 20 yards of him—on his turning a corner suddenly I lost sight of him; he must have gone into a house—he could not have run the length of the street that he turned into—I gave information to the police, and next morning I was shown seven or eight, or it might be, nine persons standing together at the police</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187302030094"></xptr>
               <p>station—I was not prepared, from the suddenness of it, to swear to the identity of the person, and I declined doing so—I believe the prisoner is the man, though I can't swear positively to it—he was standing the third from the top, and my opinion is that he is the man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I should think there were six or seven drawn up in a row—it may be eight or nine—there was a constable with one, and I said I was not prepared to swear to the man—I told the Magistrate so, and I say so now—I saw the constable at the corner of the street where I lost sight of you—I was about 30 yards behind the man when he turned the corner of the street—I went round the same corner—I lost sight of the man, and I walked up the street and met the policeman—I told him what had happened—he said "I saw you running after a man; you had better go back to the station"—some women came up—I don't know what they said—they did not seem to know anything about it—there was no one with me when I was robbed—a woman went into the police-station with me and the constable—she said she saw it, or something—I did not know that woman—she came and volun<lb></lb>teered a statement, and they took her address at the station—she said she saw the boy snatch the chain—I did not ask for her to come up as a witness—I left it in the hands of the police.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman M</hi> 98). About 4.30, on 14th January, I was in Mint Street—I saw the prosecutor running after the prisoner—I knew him before perfectly well—I was at the bottom of the street, near the workhouse, and he came from the top—I was not near enough to run after him—I lost sight of him—there were three or four turnings he could turn—I had seen him ten minutes before the robbery, at the corner of Mint Street, with three or four others—I saw him the same night at the police-station—I am sure he is the man—I sent the prosecutor with a constable to the station, and I met a detective and told him who it was, and he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I lost sight of you at the corner of Duke Street—whether you went into Red Cross Street or Duke Street I can't say—I did not see you when I got to the top of the street—I saw the girl that lived with you, and she said you went into Orange Street—the prosecutor was going towards Southwark Bridge Road—I told him to go to the station, and I would see after you—he ran by me—I saw you going into the red house—the prosecutor ran by me—I did not see him at the top of the street.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector</hi>). I apprehended the prisoner in the Westminster Bridge Road, about 11 o'clock, on the evening of the 14th—I told him I should take him into custody for stealing a chain and a seal from a gentleman that evening—he said "All right; I will go with you."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I have been here three or four weeks, innocent, and if I get imprisonment it is through having no one to speak for me. I hope you will look it over, and say the case is not clear against me. No one saw me do it; and the man can't swear to me. If he was in the woman's com<lb></lb>pany he lost it there, I have no doubt.</p>

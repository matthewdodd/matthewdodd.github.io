On Friday evening, the 19th of Dec. last, the prisoner Hawkins came to my father's shop, in company of another person, and looked at some jewellery—they wished to see some more, which I had not at that time forthcoming, and they agreed to come next day—my brother Henry was present on that occasion—they came next day, between one and three o'clock in the afternoon—Hawkins was spokesman on the occa<lb></lb>sion—he asked to look at a tray of rings—there were diamond rings among them—he looked at some, and ordered some, but purchased none—he left a little ring with me, and said he wished a diamond put into it, but would speak</p>

               <p>about it on the Monday morning—soon after, they left suddenly—he said they were going to Richmond, and they would call on Monday morning and com<lb></lb>plete the order—he also said that he would bring a gentleman with him on the Monday who knew more about diamonds than he did—he took out his watch, and then hurried away—the ring he left with me is not worth more than 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the outside—between two and three hours after they were gone I missed from the tray four rings—I showed that tray to one other person after they left, before I missed the rings—it was a person whom I knew perfectly well—he certainly had the opportunity of taking them, but he is a highly re<lb></lb>pectable person, a Captain Blankley, of the Royal Navy—I showed them to no other person—neither Hawkins or his friend came on the Monday—I saw nothing more of him till he was taken into custody.</p>

I was at home when Rothschild came to my father's house, about these diamonds—there was no other person there with my father at the time—I was not in the room when my father dealt for the diamonds—I was in the passage—no one else was in the house except Mr. Acock—Hawkins is not that man—Acock lived up at Islington—he professed to be a working-jeweller—I have not seen him lately—I do not know what has become of him—I can take my oath that Hawkins is not the person who was there on that occasion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and lodge at Mr. Sullivan's, in Orange-court, Drury-lane. The prisoner lived in the two-pair front—I had a large chest, in which I kept my clothes and money, which I got permission from the prisoner to put into his room—I always kept it locked, and kept the key myself—the prisoner knew I kept my money in that chest—I showed it to him—on Sunday morning, the 8th of November, about half-past ten o'clock, I went and put 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. into a purse along with the rest of the money in the chest—the money was safe then—I felt two sovereigns, about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of silver, and three 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—I did not look at them then, but I felt them—I had seen them about a week before—I put the purse back into the chest, and locked it as I thought, but I am not sure—I put the key into my pocket—the prisoner was sitting in the room at that time—on Tuesday morning, the 10th, I went again into the room and opened my chest—it was then unlocked—my purse had been opened, and lay at the top of the clothes—I had placed it at the bottom—one 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver was gone—the rest was there—the prisoner was not there then—I went down to the landlady, and said my money was gone, and the prisoner was taken into custody about half-past two that day.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Matthew Sullivan, the owner of the house; it is in the parish of St. Giles's-in-the-Fields. On the 10th of November, the prosecutrix came to me, took me to the prisoner's room, and showed me her chest—in consequence of what she said, I went to look after the prisoner, but could not find him then—he returned at two o'clock, not sober—I saw him go up stairs—I went to tell the prosecutrix and when I returned he was gone—I went to Mr. Wilson's at the corner of Drury-lane, and saw him there—I told him he had done a pretty thing for himself that morning, he had broken open Mrs. Duggan's box and taken her money—he said, "No, who can swear I have done it?"—he left the public-house, I followed him into Long-acre, and gave him into cus<lb></lb>tody—when he was in the policeman's custody I saw his hand in his trow<lb></lb>sers' pocket, and saw three sovereigns come, as far as I could see, from his hand on to the pavement—the policeman picked them up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutors housekeeper. I went out for milk that morning, and as I came back I saw the prisoner outside, with a clothes-brush, which I knew was my master's—she was rubbing the hairs of it down, she presented it to a man, who put it inside his jacket—I then went in, and inquired—the man was gone before Hurley came out—the prisoner was running towards the bridge—he went, and brought her back—she was in liquor.</p>

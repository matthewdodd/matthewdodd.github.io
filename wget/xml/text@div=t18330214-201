The prisoner came on Monday the 11th of February, about two o'clock, and asked for an ounce of shag tobacco; he applied to my sister - I saw him served; he offered a crown-piece, which I rang and weighed; it appeared good, and when I was going to give him the change, he said "I think I have enough halfpence" - he took 2 1/2d. out of his pocket (it came to 3d.); he took up the crown-piece which I had laid down; he then said "I will have half an ounce," he said "No, I won't, I will change, and have an ounce," and laid down a crown piece, which I did not take up, thinking it to be the one he had given me before - I had not sufficient change in the till, and sent my sister into the parlour for the cash-box; I gave him 4s. 9d. change - the crown-piece was still on the counter; he was scarcely out of the shop, when I took the crown-piece, and found it was bad - I, my sister, and a young person ran after him; a crowd brought him back to the shop - I sent for the constable, and gave him the crown; I am sure it was the same as he had given me the second time - he was searched in the shop; he said I must have mistaken him, that he had not been in the shop, it must have been some other man; I had no other crown-piece in the house whatever; 3s. 11 1/2d. was found on him - he then said if I would take that 3s. 11 1/2d., he would go back and fetch another shilling, if I would not give him in charge; I have not seen the first crown-piece again - he was brought back to the shop within two minutes; there were two women and another man outside the shop, and a man came in while I was giving him change, for a 1d. worth of shag, and they went out together - they appeared to know each other.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not put the crown-piece into your cash-box? A. No; I never took it off the counter till you were gone.</p>

            . I live nearly opposite Mrs. Hall. I was at the window about two o'clock on Monday, and heard two women and a man say to another man, "Go in and baulk them, for he is there" - the man went in, and the prisoner and him came out together; I went into the shop, suspecting them - Mrs. Hall was just giving him the change; I said, "It is bad money you have taken" - she looked at it, and said, "Yes, it is," and we ran after them directly; the cash-box was on the counter - she gave him the change out of that - I saw her give him the change; I did not look at the crown-piece myself, till the prisoner was brought back - he said he would give the 3s. 11 1/2d. and bring a shilling, if Mrs. Hall would not give him to the officers, but she would not take it; I saw the crown given to Brown, the officer, and saw him mark it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner in the shop - Mrs. Hall gave me a crown-piece, and charged him with uttering it; I put a mark on it, in Mrs. Hall's presence, and have had it ever since - the prisoner said he was not the man, that it was the other man in the shop that gave it her; I searched him, and found 3s. 6d. and 5 1/2d. in copper on him - he said he would give up the money rather than be taken into custody, and bring or send another shilling to make up the money; Mrs. Hall would not agree to that - I asked him where the tobacco was, he said he had given it to his wife to take home for him.</p>

            . I keep the Crown public-house, West-street, Smithfield. I know the prisoner - about the 12th or 13th of September last, he came in company with Clark, who has been tried; they gave my wife a bad crown-piece - I saw it given to her; they ran out before I could get hold of them - Kent, the officer, has the crown-piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I wish to have the Mint Act read over to me - I never tendered that crown-piece at the tobacco-shop - what could I have done with the good one and the tobacco? I could not eat them.</p>
               <p>MRS. HALL. I did not lose sight of him - he and the other man appeared walking together; I cannot say what he did after he was taken, as I went in doors.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you swear that to be your master's property? - A. Yes; it was lying upon the counter loose, she was near enough to reach it; we had shewn it to a person in the course of the day, and left it there; it was the only bit we had at a shilling a yard in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any private mark upon it by which you know it? - A. Yes; S. D. T. I don't know whose writing it is.</p>

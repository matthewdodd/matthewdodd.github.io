                  </hi>. I am a carrier, and reside at Richmond—the prisoner was in my employ for some months previous to, 10th February, as a carter—I sent him to London, on 9th February, as my carman—I said, "You call at The Lodge, at the Marquis of Lansdowne's house, and you will find there a small parcel, containing money for the gardeners ', take care of it"—he came home with the cart that night, but did not deliver any parcel from the Marquis of Lansdowne's lodge—the cart was locked up in way cart-house with the things in it—he did not return to his work the following morning—it was his business to come about half past 7 o'clock, first to look after the horse, and then to come in to me to book the work that was done on the previous day, and deliver up money and bills and receipts, and so on—he did not come—I did not see him fur a fortnight afterwards—I have never received the parcel for which I desired him to call at the Marquis of Lansdowne's.</p>

               <p>JAMES WILSON. I go to a charity school, and live with my parents. I lost a pair of shoes, on the 17th of July, from behind a row of houses in <placeName id="t18280911-384-crimeloc2000">Church-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18280911-384-crimeloc2000" type="placeName" value="Church-street"></interp>

               <p>Q. You have been examined before, and if you do not speak the truth it will be worse for you - you were behind some houses, where were they? A. Near New-cut-street, Lisson-grove; Wear was there - I gave my shoes to Fox to hold.</p>

            . I saw Wilson by Lisson-grove, and saw him give his shoes to Fox; I saw the prisoner go up to Fox, snatch the shoes out of his hand, put them under his coat, and run away - I told Wilson of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not run after him? A. The other boys said they would jump on me if I did: Fox is about seven years old.</p>

               <p>Clement. No, she did not; I asked her how long she had been with the ladies, she said about 4 months; I said, I do not remember seeing you there; (I go there twice a week constantly;) I having other customers in the shop, do not remember the answer she made; I asked her what kind of gauze, she said flowered gauze; I opened<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176610220035"></xptr> a drawer of gauzes; she fixed upon a pattern and said, this is the gauze; I asked her if the ladies did not say what quantity of yards; she said it was to be half a piece; I said, that is 12 yards; I cut a 24 yard piece in two: during the time of serving her I asked her several questions about the family; I asked her when Miss Scott would be in town, as I knew she was then at Southampton; I do not know what reply she made to that; I asked her if Miss Newman was with them still, that is a young lady who is an apprentice there; she said, yes, but she believed she would not be there long; when I had entered the goods in the day-book, I made a bill of parcels of them, and put the gauze in one paper and the ribbons in another; the bill of parcels was in the name of Miss Scott and Britain; I helped to put them in the prisoner's pocket. I having an opportunity of being very near her, I found her breath smelt as if she had been drinking; as soon as she was gone out of the warehouse, I said I don't like this girl, I don't believe she came from the people; I bid a servant take his hat and follow her; then Edward Ewer said, if I pleased he would go, and he went, and is here to give an account of what passed.</p>

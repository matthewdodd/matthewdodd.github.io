I am a mariner—the name of my ship is <hi rend="italic">The Jane Isabella</hi>—on Thursday night,21st June, I went into a public-house at Woolwich; into the tap-room—about 8 o'clock in the evening or it might have been a few minutes after, I began eating some bread and cheese—the prisoner came in and asked me if I would give him a little bit of cheese—I cut him off a bit of cheese, and gave him a drink of ale—he stopped with me, as near as I can recollect, about two hours after that—when I went into this public-house I had a silver watch with me; when I came out I had lost it—I turned quite stupid in the head and became insensible—I went to sleep after the two hours—I never saw the prisoner any more—I awoke about eleven o'clock at night, and found everything gone; my watch, a knife, and a handkerchief, 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and a <hi rend="italic">baccy</hi> fob—I am sure that I had my watch safe when I gave the man the bread and cheese—I gave no one authority to take my pocket handkerchief away—I did not give information to the police.</p>

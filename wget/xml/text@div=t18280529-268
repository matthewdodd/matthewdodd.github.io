I said Yes; he said,"Come out of the market, I have a gentleman here who wishes to see it;" I went with him to St. John's-street, where I saw the prisoner - I rode the poney up and down three times; the prisoner said, "That will do," and asked me the price; I said, "I must have fourteen guineas:" he said, "Will not 12l. do?" I said No; he then said he would give me 13l., and 10s. for myself; I said he should have it, and he asked me to take it to his house in <placeName id="t18280529-268-crimeloc1475">Baltic-street, Old-street</placeName>

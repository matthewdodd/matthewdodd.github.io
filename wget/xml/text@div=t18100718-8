On the 11th of June the prisoner came into my shop, I was in the furthermost room, I saw the prisoner and two ladies in the shop, they were all in the shop before I saw them, I went up to the ladies, I served them with gloves.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these two ladies in the shop a part of her company - A. Oh, no, they had a servant at the door. When the ladies went out of the shop, the prisoner asked me the price of some lace in the window.</p>
               <p>Q. What lace was there in the window - A. A white laced veil, with a border round the bottom, and there were several veils hanging up in the window, but she pointed to that; I told the prisoner to go out of the shop, I was certain she did not want to buy any lace, according to the appearance of her, she immediately went away.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was she to the lace when you first observed her - A. I suppose about two or three yards from the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the lace in the window - A. No, I had a box of lace on the counter, it was from there I lost the property; the moment she was gone, a carriage drove up to the door, two ladies came out and wanted some lace, I immediately went to the lace box which was upon the other counter, I took the lace box and found all the laced veils and handkerchiefs in the box were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Were was this lace box placed - A. At the bottom of the shop, on the counter, near the parlour door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you at any time seen the prisoner near that lace box - A. No</p>
               <p>Q. Must she come past it to come into the shop - A. No, she must have gone the whole length of the shop to have gone up to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge from any circumstance how long she had been in the shop - A. She might have been in the shop about five minutes without my observing her.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the shop before you went in - A. Nobody, nor any body in the lower part of the house, I was in by myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the parlour that might have observed her - A. No, nobody but myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you left the shop door open - A. Always; winter and summer.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you enumerate the particulars of what was gone from the lace box - A. A number of veils and laced handkerchiefs, and a pair of sleeves.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you mention them in particular - A. Yes, about a dozen black laced veils.</p>
               <p>Q. How many laced handkerchiefs - A. There might be eight or nine to a dozen, and white laced veils as well as black, a dozen of white and a dozen of black, I dare say, and a pair of laced sleeves. It was on Whit-monday they were missed.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see any of this property that was missing - A. Not till the Friday following. After I had missed them that afternoon, I went to Marlborough-street<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181007180007"></xptr>office and gave information; on the Friday following, two officers and a pawnbroker brought some of them to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them when you saw them again - A. Yes, they shewed me a long veil which I was robbed of, I can speak to it in particular. I went with the officer to where the prisoner was at a public house in Marlborough-street; she then told us there were some of the other laced things at her lodgings, where we went immediately to.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any found upon her - A. Yes, upon her head. She told me that she had seen me in the shop, and she had robbed me just before the two ladies came in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make her any promise or any threats - A. No, she fell a crying, and told us where some of the things were; she said she had sold some at Wandsworth; we went the next morning, on Saturday, and took her to Wandsworth, the officer and myself; she went out of the coach and walked to the shop where she had sold them, we found three veils there which we brought away with us; she likewise told us that she sold one in Cold Bath-fields, and some she sold to a young girl that was gone in the country, which was the reason she wanted to know the price of the lace, on account of her selling them to this young girl. We got the veil that she had sold at Cold Bath-fields, from a house just by the prison; she went with us and took us to the place.</p>

I detained her, sent for an officer, and had her taken to Marlborough-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember the prisoner being brought to the office - A Yes: she said she lodged in Homer-street, Marylebone. I went to her lodgings, and in a box, of which I had the key of her, I found three black laced veils, one white one, and a pair of white laced sleeves, two white laced handkerchiefs, and a remnant of lace, and the duplicate of two veils, pledged on the 13th of June for ten shillings, at Mr. Brooks, of Paddington-street, who is master of the last witness.

These three I found at Wandsworth; I took her there with me in a coach, she pointed out the shop; a black veil, a white laced veil, and a laced handkerchief.

This one was stated to me at the office to be taken off her head, which she wore as a cap, I did not see it taken off her head, it was given to me, and she admitted it.</p>

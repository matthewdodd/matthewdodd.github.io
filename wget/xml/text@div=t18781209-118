I am an unfortunate woman, and live at 20, Marshall Street, London Road—I knew the deceased Mary Ann Gard by the name of Mary Ann Young; she and the prisoner lived together as man and wife—she was an unfortunate—they had been living together for some months at Dale Street—on Saturday night, the 16th November, I was at the Railway Bar public-house about half-past 9, and saw the deceased there with another female; she was drinking rum hot—I left there about a quarter to 10; at hat time she was sober—about half-past 11 I saw the prisoner and the deceased together outside the Railway Bar; they both seemed to be slightly a drink, but nothing to speak of—I heard her call him a very foul name, and he called her a "cow" and something before that which I did not hear—I walked on and left them there; he was then standing on the kerb, and she was in the road.</p>

Jane your knife"—he did so, and she said "Jane, that is what he stabbed me in the back with"—I said "Oh, Harry, that was cruel of you; don't use a knife; if you want to do anything, use your hand, don't use a knife"—he looked at me and laughed—he used his pocket knife for his dinner.</p>

On Sunday morning, 17th November, I examined the prisoner's clothing at the station about noon, and found a quantity of what appeared to be blood on the lower part of his trousers and boots, a spot of blood on the right cuff of his coat, and blood about his fingers and the nails of his right hand—he said that he supposed it was done while he was helping the <hi rend="italic">missus</hi>, and that when coming home from Walworth Road with her she had a few words with some man about his change; that she was drunk and rather quarrelsome, and when they got to the top of Dale Street she would go no further, and he left her standing at the corner of Dale Street, where two or three men were standing on the opposite side of the Rodney Road, and went to the door of her lodging, but did not go in; he went back for her, and found her standing where he had left her, and as soon as he reached her she cried out "Oh!" and fell; that he thought it was her courses which caused the blood, and tried to get her indoors, and while doing so a policeman came up, and he had no idea how she was hurt—those were not his words exactly, but the effect of what he said when we were examining his clothes—that was said in nearly one connected statement—I asked him if he had any witness whom I should call for him—he said "No"—that was the same morning that he was in custody and before the knife was found—Mrs. Johns pointed out his room to me at 14, Dale Street; I searched it the same morning thoroughly, and much more carefully a day or two after<lb></lb>wards, and in Mrs. Johns's presence found a pocket knife—there were two or three very common table knives in a drawer, I think three—a knife was handed to me at the station by Inspector McKenzie—the prisoner was quite sober.</p>

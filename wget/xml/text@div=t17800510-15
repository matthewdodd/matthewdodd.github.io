               <p>On the 22d of April about nine o'clock, I saw the prisoner take the cannister of tea out of Messrs. Sealy and Hudson's shop; he stooped down and dragged it out of the shop; it stood on the floor just within the door; he handed it to another man, who put it on his shoulder; I pursued the man who had the cannister, and cried out stop thief! upon which he dropped it. I got hold of him, but he escaped from me. The prisoner was close to him; I seised the prisoner.</p>
               <p>What did the prisoner do after he gave the cannister to the other man? - He walked close behind him; I was presently surrounded with people who came to my assistance; the prisoner delared he was not concerned in it. We took him to Mr. Sealy's shop and charged a constable with him.</p>

               <p>How far had these men gone from the shop before you cried stop thief, and stopped the prisoner? - About a dozen or twenty yards.</p>
               <p>How far was the other man from the prisoner when he took the cannister out of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178005100024"></xptr>shop? - About five or six yards; he carried it to him.</p>
               <p>Had you observed these two men lurking about the door before? - Yes, two or three minutes; I never lost sight of the prisoner, after I saw him take the cannister, till I secured him.</p>

               <p>I am servant to Messrs. Sealy and Hudson. On Saturday evening, the 22d of April, about nine o'clock, I was in the shop with another servant; a man came in and acquainted us that a man had stolen the cannister of tea; it was on the ground close to the door; it has stood in a corner within reach of the door for many years. I went down the street and saw the cannister standing on the ground; the top was lost. I brought it and the prisoner back to the shop.</p>
               <p>(The cannister was produced in court and deposed to by Wilson.)</p>

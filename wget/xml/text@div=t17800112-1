            . On the 15th of December I was sitting in the parlour; we were going to have some hashed meat for dinner; I called my servant up to get some vinegar; the servant came up and went out for the vinegar, and left the door open; she came back with the vinegar; she took the meat down. She had not been long gone down before she called Ma'am, ma'am, here is a woman in the kitchen! I went down and saw the prisoner with a loaf under her arm; I lifted up her hat to see if I knew her. She said she wanted a pint of purl.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am servant to Mr. Elwell. I was down in the kitchen; my mistress called me up and sent me for some vinegar; I went for the vinegar. I found the door open and I left it open. The door generally stands open at that hour of the day; it was between two and three o'clock. When I came back I left the vinegar in the parlour and took the meat down stairs; when I came down into the kitchen I saw somebody lying down; I asked who the devil was there to frighten me!</p>
               <p>Who was the person that was lying down? - The prisoner. I went round the great table which stood in the middle of the kitchen, and said, you may get up now you won't frighten me; she crawled up; I asked her what she had got; she had a loaf in her apron, and the linen was rolled up under her, she had taken it off the table.</p>
               <p>What linen was it? - Five pair of sheets and three tablecloths.</p>
               <p>Did you leave the linen on the table? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure it did not fall off the table? - Yes: it is a large ironing table; I had set it in the middle of the kitchen. Seeing the linen on the ground, I asked her what that linen was; she said she had nothing but her own loaf.</p>
               <p>The linen was not in her apron? - No, it was on the ground; when she got up I saw the linen; I went round the table to meet her at the door, and asked her what she wanted; she said a pint of purl, and if she could not get it there, she desired I would let her go where she could get it; I said she should not go till my master or mistress came down stairs; I called out to my mistress who came down and lifted up her hat and looked at her; the prisoner told her she wanted a pint of purl; we asked her if that looked like a public-house; she said she did not know.</p>
               <p>What part of the table were they lying upon? - Upon the middle of the table.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I was very much in liquor. I went in and called for a pint of purl; I could make no body hear; I laid me down and was almost asleep. I never stole a halfpenny worth of any thing in my life.</p>
               <p>Jones. She did not seem much in liquor; she said we were in liquor.</p>
               <p>Did you make any noise when you went down? - No,</p>
               <p>Was she asleep? - No, I had not been out of the kitchen long enough.</p>
               <p>She was not lying in a place concealed was she? - She was between the table and dresser; it was dark in that part of the kitchen.</p>

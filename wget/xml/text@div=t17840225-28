               <p>Court. You speak very fairly; are you sure of the person of the man? - I am certain of his person, it struck me with horror, I am sure I felt as much in seeing him as he could in seeing me; I hope, for the man's consideration to me and my family, the Court will have mercy on him; as he considered me as a poor man, and recommended me to the mercy of his companion, who had death in his hand; and I consider his as a conduct not very common; as soon as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178402250084"></xptr> as he saw the guinea, then they went away immediately and desired me not to follow them; I have enquired of the prisoner who he was, and where he came from; I have wrote to Ireland to know his character there, I have not had an answer,* I cannot say any thing at all in that matter.</p>
               <p>* This Prosecutor, three days afterwards, informed the Court, he had received an answer from Ireland in favour of the Prisoner's character.</p>
               <p>Court. You have shewn a great deal of humanity in your conduct.</p>
               <p>Court to Bowyer. The other three witnesses can say no more than you on the former indictment? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen of the Jury, this prosecution rests on the evidence of the prosecutor, and his feeling disposition leaves no room to doubt that he is satisfied the prisoner is the man; it is for you to judge whether, under the circumstances, he had sufficient certainty; if you think he had, the charge is proved against the prisoner.</p>

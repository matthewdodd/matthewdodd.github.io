I returned about seven o'clock, and in consequence of what she said I went up to my bed-room, which I had left locked, and found it forced open - there were no marks of violence; it could not have been opened without some force. I went to my chest, and found it had been opened by a picklock-key, which was left in it. I missed two 5 l. and seven 1 l. bank notes, and 6 l. in silver; also six cornelian buttons, with gold shanks, and gold-mounted. There was a benefit society-box in my room, which had three locks to it, it was forced open. In consequence of suspicion, I and Stirling went after the prisoner, and apprehended him next morning, about nine o'clock, at a public-house in Essex-street, Whitechapel - the buttons were found on him, which I can swear to. I asked him what he had done with my money? he said, if I would go to Jack O'Donnel and George Green, they knew more of my money than he did. He used to come to my house some times.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Walsh. He went out and left me in the house. The prisoner and another man were in the tap-room - O'Donnel and Green came in about a quarter of an hour after - I did not know them, but they were called by those names; the prisoner talked to them. I asked the prisoner what they were? he said one was O'Donnel, the fighting-man. The prisoner was sometimes in the skittle-ground and sometimes in the tap-room. I believe the prisoner left about half an hour after O'Donnel and Green did. When my master came home, he sent me up for a candle; I took the key, and found the bedroom door open. I had not been there while he was out.</p>

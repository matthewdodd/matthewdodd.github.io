               <p>PETER CHESTER CHADWICK. I live in Jewin-street. On the morning of the 23rd of May, I was in <placeName id="t18340703-16-crimeloc96">Aldersgate-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18340703-16-crimeloc96" type="placeName" value="Aldersgate-street"></interp>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you swear I took it from your person? A. No; I felt a push, and found it in his pocket, not half a yard from me - I was coming through a little alley - they were both pressing on me, as close as they could.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody - I have the handkerchief.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About ten o'clock in the morning I was going to Hoxton to transact business for a friend, and in passing through the passage I picked up the handkerchief in question - the first impression of my mind was, that it belonged to one of two persons who had passed through the passage rapidly, into Aldersgate-street - the prosecutor asked me if I had got it - I said no, believing the owner to be one of the two who had gone on.</p>
               <p>MR. CHADWICK. When I took him, he said, so help him God, he had not got it, and resisted my taking it from him; but when I got it, he said, he did not take it from my pocket - I had felt one hand at my pocket, and another shoving me, and saw him shoving it into his pocket - if he did not take it, he must have seen it taken, he was so close to me.</p>

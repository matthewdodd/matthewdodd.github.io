               <p>Court. Did you see her concealing it? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Then how do you know that she was concealing it? - When I went to get the change I missed the bundle off the stool, I did not see her in the act of concealing it, Smith stood by Clarke, so that I could not see her: I immediately jumped over the compter and charged the prisoner Clarke with it; they were neither of them then out of the house: It was neither on the stool nor on the ground, when I charged her with it, but she immediately dropped it somewhere from her person; I sent for a constable and took them up.</p>
               <p>(The muslin produced and deposed to; the value 15 l. at least.)</p>
               <p>Where was the bundle when you jumped over the compter? - It was concealed upon her.</p>
               <p>The bundle is large, how could she conceal it? - She did conceal it, I cannot tell how, she had a long cloak on, I took particular notice, having a suspicion of her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. How did the stool stand? - On the outside of the compter, there is a partition on each side, it stands in a place which just holds it.</p>
               <p>Were these women standing near the stool all the time they were employed in the shop, or did they move from one compter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100119"></xptr> to the other? - They moved from one place to another, there were two compters in the shop.</p>
               <p>Were they first at the compter where the stool was at first? - Yes, and then I took them to another part of the shop, till I had an opportunity to count the bundles, and see what they were.</p>
               <p>Did you see the bundle when they came into the shop on the stool? - Yes.</p>

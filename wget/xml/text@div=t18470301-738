On the morning of the 17th of Feb., between four and five o'clock, I was on duty in Harley-street—my attention was attracted by a noise in the area of No. 15—I asked if anybody was there—I got not answer—I went over the area gate, and went down the steps—I found the prisoner there, and the cellar or vault was full of smoke—I asked the prisoner if he was servant there—he said he was—I said, "Do you live here now?"—he said, 'No"—I rang the kitchen bell—Mr. Bau<lb></lb>mann and two servants and a gentleman came down—the smoke was con<lb></lb>siderable—it did not blaze much—another constable threw some water into the vault—I searched the prisoner, and found on him this spoon, this buckle, some duplicates, and a box of matches—he said he picked the buckle up—the spoon he acknowledged to taking—I enquired why the straw in the vault was set on fire—he said he was could—it smoked so that we could not enter the place—we were obliged to get three or four pails of water—it was a quantity of straw and hay burning.</p>

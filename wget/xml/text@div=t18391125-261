                  </hi>. I live at Battersea. On the 20th of November I was near the prisoner's house about eight o'clock in the evening—I saw the prosecutrix in conversation with the prisoner's husband—I did not hear what they said—while they were talking the prisoner was round the comer with a poker in her hand—she had the poker before they began to talk—she went and hit Mrs. Watson three different times, once on each side of her head—she hit her very hard—it was a small iron poker—when she hit her on the arm, it hit her husband's basin and plate—she then threw the poker into the road—her husband picked it up and took it in doors—the prisoner then hugged Mrs. Watson up as tight as she could, and kept smacking her in the face—I could not see whether it was with her net or open hand—she threw her on her knees and she fell against the wall—she said she would murder her before she had done with her—Mrs. Watson did not struggle at all, nor strike her—my sister and a man went and parted them, and took Mrs. Watson in-doors.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the prisoner say any thing to Mrs. Watson before she struck her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not that I heard, I was not near enough to hear—I know it was a poker—it sounded against the wall—when they were up against the wall they were struggling—it lasted a very short time altogether—after they were parted, Mrs. Watson walked into her own house—they led her in—I am not related to her—I live three or four doors from her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sixteen years old, and live at Childer-street, Rother<lb></lb>hithe—I work at the Surrey saw-mills—I knew Alexander Hanghey; he vas bigger than me—on 3d May I saw prisoner at the window of a shop No. 2, Plough-road, Kotherhi the—I do not know what he was doing—I saw Hanghey come out of the shop and tell him to go away from the window, and shoved him away—the prisoner then picked up a stone and threw at him; it struck him on the side of the bead—Hanghey then went into the shop, and the prisoner picked up another stone—Hanghey hallooed out to me to stop him, which I did, and held him—he struggled, and I took the stone from him—Hanghey came up, and I saw a short white-handled knife in the prisoner's hand—they struggled some time together, not fighting, but they fell down together as he was struggling to get the stone away—he did get it—some gentleman said, "Serve him right"—I turned away for a little while, and then saw Hanghey coming away bleeding from his leg—the prisoner ran away with young Cooper.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was not Cooper with him from the first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he was three or four yards from him when he was looking in at the window—there were pictures in the window—the deceased told the prisoner to go away first, and then pushed him—I did not see a corkscrew or a piece of wood in his hand, or a knife with a corkscrew and a blade—I was on the opposite side of the street—Cooper remained till there was an end. of the matter, and he and the prisoner ran away together—I should think the boy who is dead was six or seven inches taller than me; he was not as tall as you—it was not Cooper who took up the stone—I stopped the prisoner; I did not hit him, I only held him—I did not push or throw him down—I did not see the deceased strike him or kick him, or push him down; nothing of the sort; they fell by struggling together to get the stone, and the prisoner</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, London-street, Deptford—about the be ginning of May, in the afternoon, I was at play in the Plough-road with two other boys, M'Donnell and Simmonds—McDonnell was close to the shop where Hanghey lived, looking in at the window at the pictures, and playing with a corkscrew, opening it—I saw William Scotter in the shop; they call him Hanghey—he came out and told M'Donnell to go away, and then went in again—M'Donnell stood there and Hanghey came out again, put his foot behind M'Donnell and threw him down—M'Donnell ran away, picked up a stone, and heaved it at Hanghey; it struck him on the shoulder—M'Donnell ran away, Hanghey ran and stopped him, got him by the throat, threw him down, fell on him, and they struggled together—when M'Donnell got up he went indoors holding his leg, and I saw blood on the stones—the prisoner had nothing in his hand, that I saw, while he was running away, but when he stopped I saw an open knife in his hand; that was after Hanghey went in—I saw him shut it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was that the same knife that has the corkscrew in it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the corkscrew is at the back—he had a little piece of wood in his hand, which he was cutting as he was looking at the pictures—he was cutting it round, and making a hole through it with the corkscrew, resting it on the window-ledge—M'Donnell got away, and Osborne stopped him—he then got him by the throat and pulled him down, and was kicking him and punching him while he was down ten or eleven times—when M'Donnell got up he seemed to be hurt; his face was cut and bruised, and he seemed to be confused—Scotter kicked him on the bead as he was lying down, and on the side and shoulder and back.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at 2, Plough-court, Rother<lb></lb>hithe—the deceased Alexander Hanghey, was my nephew; he would have been seventeen next September—he was very tall for his age, between five and six feet; his corpse was the full length—on Tuesday evening, 3d May, I called him out of my back kitchen, and asked him to mind the shop while I conversed with a lady in my back parlour—he left the shop for three minutes, and when he returned he was in a fainting condition, and two little girls came and told me something—I examined him, and he was in a frightful condition; the blood spirted out like a fountain from his thigh; he lost two quarts of blood, and never stood up again—he died on 16th May—he never had a day's ill health before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Dr. Tregene, and am a student at St. Thomas's Hospital—on 3d May I was called to the last wit<lb></lb>ness's house, and found the boy Alexander Hanghey in a very low condition from loss of blood, and suffering from a punctured wound in his right thigh, about three inches above the knee—I should think nothing but a knife would do it—there was a cut in his trouser? Corresponding with the wound</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186407110089"></xptr>
               <p>—it was a dangerous wound from the loss of blood—I found on the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination that the wound was an inch or an inch and a half deep—he lost a very large quantity of blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you make a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was present at it—the death was due to another cause entirely; something like a cherry-stone escaping from the intestines into the cavity of the abdomen, and that had caused inflammation of the intestines—the effect of this large flow of blood might reduce the inflammation, but I should not like to say one way or other—the wound on the thigh was healing.</p>

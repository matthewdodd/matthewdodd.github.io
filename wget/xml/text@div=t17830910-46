               <p>Did you lose sight of the prisoner from the time he left your house till you apprehended him?-Yes, once, I followed him from Ludgate-street, and he went into Newgate, but at the top of the Old Bailey he stopped to speak to a gentleman, after he was gone, I asked the gentleman if he knew that gentleman in scarlet, he said, no; I waited till he came out of Newgate, when he came out, I desired to speak with him, I asked the turnkey if we might go into the lodge, I went into the lodge, and the prisoner immediately followed me, and the turnkey immediately followed him; as soon as I got into the lodge, the prisoner had a pair of stone knee buckles in his hand which he presented to me, rather thrusting them into my hand that I might secret them, his hand was open with them, I saw them in his hand, I knew immediately that they were my property; I told him, that I knew he had been doing something that he ought not to do, that I was convinced he had robbed me, but not sufficient to challenge him before, he said, that was too true; the turnkey followed him, observing him put his hand into his pocket as he was going into the lodge, and take something out: I told <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100072"></xptr>him though he was rascal enough to rob me, I was not fool enough to compound felony; I took the buckles as my property; some of the people belonging to Newgate and me, took the prisoner immediately before Alderman Sanderson.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. I do not understand what you mean by compounding a felony?-I understand by it, if you take goods back after they have been found upon a thief, you compound felony.</p>
               <p>You have not quite a right idea of it Mr. Lewis.</p>
               <p>Court. It is not necessary he should be a lawyer.</p>
               <p>Your Lordships know very well, that compounding a felony, is not taking goods back again, but taking money not to prosecute.-He meant privately to thrust the things into my hand and not openly.</p>
               <p>He came in the appearance of a gentleman?-Yes.</p>
               <p>And he is a man of good family, is not he?-Yes, I believe he is.</p>
               <p>Was any thing said by him, when he gave you the buckles, that he had taken the things in a mistake and meant to return them?-No.</p>
               <p>Did he speak in a low voice?-He spoke in a low voice.</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing go into his pocket?-I saw his hand thrust and that gave me a suspicion.</p>
               <p>He did not say any thing to you, when he gave his hand and wanted you to take them back?-He only held them to me loose in his hand without any paper, which is generally the case when they do not buy, they carry them without paper; nothing was said till I told him, he then said it was too true.</p>
               <p>Did he not say it was not true?-I know this is a capital offence, I did not wish to make it so, I am sorry to find it is laid so, but yet I am under the necessity of speaking facts; it hurt me a good deal when I found it was capital.</p>
               <p>Court. Are these the buckles you took from the prisoner?-I know them by a ticket tied to one, which is in my own hand writing, and the other has a little  bit of one of the tongues broke which was previous to this accident.</p>

               <p>I am head turnkey of Newgate, I know the prisoner very well.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when he came into Newgate in company with Mr. Lewis?-I think it was the 8th of August, it was of a Friday; he came and asked me if one Esquire Atkins was not there, under sentence of death, I told him he was, but he was rather too late to see him that day; Mr. Lewis came up and asked me, if there was not a gentleman came in, dressed in scarlet, I said, there was, says I, stop a bit and you will see him come out; and when the gentleman came out Mr. Lewis spoke to him, and told him, that he suspected he had some of his property, and he directly put his hand in his breeched pocket and said, here it is, I own it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. Them were the words?-The very words.</p>
               <p>Those were all the words he said?-Yes, any thing relating to the business.</p>
               <p>Court. What did Mr. Lewis say on the occasion?-I believe Mr. Lewis made an answer to him, I do not suppose you intend to fetch the things you have paid earnest for, and gave him the shilling back again.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Do you recollect giving him the shilling back again?-I do, for I knew he had no opportunity of coming again in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council to Prisoner. Mr. Macnamara, I cannot say anything for you, though I have your story here in brief.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner. Mr. Macnamara, it is now your time to make your defence, would you leave it totally to your council, he cannot make a defence, he can only examine witnesses and observe upon points of law.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to leave it to my council only, I would beg, my Lord, to ask one question of my prosecutor, which is, whether I did not agree with him for the buckles he has in his possession?-Not those <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178309100073"></xptr> buckles I had from the prisoner in Newgate, but another pair which I have in possession at home, he never asked me the price of these buckles.</p>
               <p>Court to Prisoner's Council. Have you any witnesses on the part of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. My Lord, I understand Mr. Macnamara has not been three months in England.</p>

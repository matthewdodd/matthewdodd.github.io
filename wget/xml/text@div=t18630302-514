                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Hennessey, of Bexley Heath—on Saturday afternoon, 14th February, about 5 o'clock, I was coming to Woolwich, and met the prisoner—he caught roughly hold of me by the shoulder, and said, "What have you got?"—I said, "Pray, do not hurt me; all I have is two shillings, I will give you one"—he said, "I will have it all"—he threw me into the hedge, turned my pocket out, and took the money and a new farthing—he said, "What have you got in your bag?"—I said, "My husband's work; pray, do not take that; you will ruin me"—he turned my clothes up over my head, used a dreadful expression with his hands up my clothes, and said, "Hush! if you make a noise I will kill you"—he then ran away—I saw Woods coming up the hill, and told him—a man they call Biswell was with him—they went in pursuit—I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a painter, employed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich—on Saturday afternoon, 14th February, I was on Bexley Heath, where I live, and at the top of the hill met Mrs. Hennessey, who made a complaint, and described a man—I looked about, and saw a man running down the road—I told my friend to follow him, and I ran in a different direction—I called at the Foresters' Arms and gave information, and then went down the hill, and saw a man going through the shrubs, stooping, who answered the description—I went back to see if it was my friend, then came back and saw the same man who I had seen in the wood, a hundred yards before me—the landlord of the Foresters' Arms took him, and gave him in custody—the prisoner is the man I saw in the wood.</p>

I keep the Foresters' Arms, Wickham-lane—I was working in the garden, received information, and saw the prisoner in the brushwood, 150 yards off; he seemed to be hiding—I watched him two or three minutes—he came out of the wood and ran down the road—after he had run about fifty yards I overtook him, and told him I wanted him—he stopped directly I spoke to him—I took him by the collar, and said, "I want you to go back with me"—I took him, and met the other man, who said that he answered the description, and handed him over to him—I asked the prisoner what he had to say for himself—he said, "Nothing."</p>

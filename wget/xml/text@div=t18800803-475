                  </hi>. I am the principal at the Mitre Tavern, Whitehorse Lace, Stepney—on the 30th June, about 11.30, the prisoner came to the bar for a pint of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale and put down a two-shilling piece—I gave him the change and put the coin on one side; next day I examined it and found it was bad; I cut it in two and threw it in the fire—on the 6th July the prisoner came again about 12 o'clock for half a pint of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. ale and gave me another 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece; I looked at it and he said to me "If you do not like the look of it I will give you another"—I looked at him pointedly and put it into the tester and found it was bad—I said "You are the man who gave me one last week; I shall punish you if I can find a constable," and he flew out of the bar and ran up Whitehorse Lane as fast as ha could—I have not the slightest doubt as to his being the same person.</p>

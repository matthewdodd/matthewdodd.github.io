The prisoner was in my employ rather more than two months; for three or four weeks before I gave him in charge. I observed a particular pattern silk waistcoat which he had, and I asked him if he had been helping himself to it, from my stock; he said No, Mr.

             and he had one a piece off the same silk - this was on Sunday; and the following day I looked over my stock, and missed one of these waistcoats: I kept a sharp look on him, but detected nothing else, till the night previous to my giving him into custody, when he and the apprentice got tipsy in my absence: the following day I got a friend to come, and ask for a similar waistcoat - I said to him, "Wood it is the same as you have, let the gentleman look at that:" he brought it down after some time, and in consequence of what I had heard, I gave him into custody - the officer then searched his box, and found these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183004150121"></xptr>other things, which are like what I had in the shop; but they are of that general character I could not identify them.</p>

            . I was sent for, and searched the prisoner's box; I found these articles, which the prosecutor said he had no doubt were his - here is a pair of stockings and a pair of gaiters; these braces are quite new - this waistcoat was brought to me by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Mr. PLANT. I believe this waistcoat to be mine, and these braces he says he paid the apprentice for, who says he did not receive it; I have no such black stockings as these now, but I had such, and this handkerchief and drawers.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many pieces of silk are there of this pattern? A. I cannot tell. These stockings I have more hesitation about than the other property; I sent the person to buy goods - the prisoner did not give me a true account of that, but I ultimately got the money.</p>

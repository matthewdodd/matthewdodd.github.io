             depos'd, That he lodg'd within a Door or two of the Prosecutor, Mr.Saunderson, and Richard Whiteing came running in to him, to the Room where he was at work, telling him, That he should be hang'd, for he had been out all Night. That he replied, What need of that? there were more Masters than Parish Churches. That the next Time he saw him he asked him, How he came off? To which he answer'd him, very well. And he reply'd again, He was glad of it. That afterwards standing at a Cobler's Door, the Prisoner Whiteing ask'd him to go with him to buy some Leather to mend his Shoes; that he went with him, and they went in to Drink, and that he told him, he could get 500 l. if he and another, meaning Mackey, would assist him in the Affair. That he then ask'd him, how he could get to much Money? That he told him it might be done very easily; and that afterwards they all being drinking together in a private Room in an Alehouse, they consulted about the Matter. That Whiting told them, young Mr. Saunderson was coming out of the Country with 200 l. and there was two or 300 Pounds in Place, and the Method proposed by Whiteing for doing it, was this. Mackey being a <rs id="t17231016-59-deflabel312" type="occupation">Butcher</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t17231016-59-defend267 t17231016-59-deflabel312"></join>, was to bring a Bottle of Blood on the Night appointed, and he and this Evidence being let in, they went to blind and gag Mr. Saunderson, his Lady, and the vest of the Family, except Whiteing, in whose room this Blood was to be thrown and trampled about, to make a Show as if he had been murthered and carried off, then some of the Windows were to have been broken, as if they had come in that way; but Mackey would not be concerned in binding and gagging them. That they asked Whiteing, if they got this Booty. How they must dispose of themselves and it; and Whiteing said, they would go to New England, he knew the way thither; that they would go down to Portsmouth, and thence into the Isle of Wight, and would melt down the Plate, which he knew how to do. That after two or three Consultations, the Matter was resolved upon, and Whiteing appointed them to come about twelve a Clock at Night, and that they might not mistake the Door, mark'd it with Chalk. That thereupon he, this Evidence, and Mackey, did about twelve a Clock go to the Prosecutor's House, but Mackey refus'd to go in as he supposed, for fear of being taken. That he himself went to the Door, and Mackey stood at a distance off in the Fields. That Whiteing the Footman opened the Door, and brought out to him the Plate bundled up in a Coat, that appear'd in Court to be Mr. Saunderson's. That then he gave him also a pair of pistols, bidding him take care of them, for he should have Occasion for them. That then he went away into Lincoln's Inn Fields, and not seeing Mackey at the place, thought he had been gone, but after calling him two or three Times he came, and he told him he had got something, asking him to go along with him; and they did go out into the Fields, and stay'd there till Break of Day, where they opened them, and having seen whit there was, made the best of their Way to Portsmouth, where they were apprehended.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lake, a Goldsmith at Portsmouth, depos'd That Mackey brought to him part of the Gripe of a Silver Hilted Sword, which he bought of him; and the-next Day came again; and talked, to him about buying Silver, asking him, What he would give an Ounce? And, whether he would give most for it in Form, or melted down? That he asking several impertinent Questions; and he, this Evidence, having been that Morning at the Coffee-House, and seen the Advertisement of Mr. Saunderson's Robbery, had some Suspicion of the Prisoner; and endeavouring to get what he could out of him, enquired how he came by it. To which he answered, he came home in that Ship which had brought home the resolutions, and that was part of his Plunder. He told the Prisoner Mackey, That there was a Neighbour over the Way who had lost some Plate, and he must him to stay till he had sent for his Neighbour, and sent for Mr. Harman, who was a Justice of the Peace, who examining him, finding his Account was inconsistant, and that he could not tell the Name of the Captain, Lieutenant, or any of the Officers of the Ship he said, he belong'd to, committed him to Prison. And having taken Notice of some Expression, of having another Person who was concern'd in the Silver, he talk'd to him about buying of, and some Hints whereabout, he lodg'd, they went, and found him out, and being inform'd by the Landlady. That they  always kept their Chamber Door lock'd, and would not permit any Body to go into it, it strengthened their Suspicion; and having apprehended him, demanded Entrance into his Room to search, whereupon he was showing them into another Room. of the same Floor; the Landlady told them, that was not his Room, but the next they searched all about but could find nothing, till examining an old Chest of Drawers, in the bottom Drawer, which being so heavy with the Plate, that without Difficulty they could not get it out; but having at last done it, they found the Plates. That thereupon they were committed to Winchester Goal, and Notice was sent to the Prosecutor, The Plate was produc'd in Court, and the Pistols, and other Goods, and sworn to by the Prosecutor.</p>

Mackey pleaded, That he was not consenting nor assisting in the Robbery, only having been drinking and walking with Wilkinson, he desir'd him to stay in Lincoln's Inn fields, while he stepp'd a little Way to speak with one, and knew not that he went to commit the Robbery, nor when he came back what he had; but along him to go along with him, he carried him out into the Fields two or three Miles off. Whiting's Confession was read in Court; and what both had confess'd after them Apprehending was depos'd in Court. The Fact being fully prov'd upon them both, the Jury found them <rs id="t17231016-59-verdict314" type="verdictDescription">

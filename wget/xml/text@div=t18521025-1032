                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Robert Turner, silk mercer, of Ludgate-hill. On 15th Oct., about 5 o'clock, the prisoners came to the shop, and Looney purchased goods to the amount of 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and paid for them—I served them—they left together, and in about three minutes I missed eighty-eight yards of black silk from the counter where I had served them—I had seen the silk within four minutes of the time when they left the shop—I went out and found the prisoners in the Broadway, which is about 200 yards from the shop—they were in the act of turning down a street that leads into Bridge-street—I went to them and requested they would return with me—they held out their hands and said that their change was perfectly correct—they asked me if I would allow them to go and take a glass of wine pre<lb></lb>vious to returning—I objected, and requested them again to come with me, which they did—as they walked before me, to the beat of my belief they <hi rend="italic">mixed</hi> in with two men, and then went on without them—when they got to the shop I left them in charge of a young man, and went for a policeman—I did not tell them why I wanted them to come back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Mr. Turner. I saw the prisoners at the shop on 15th Oct.—about five minutes before they came, I had folded the piece of silk, which was afterwards missed, and laid it by the side of the pile of others on the counter—I saw it there during the time the prisoners were being served—it was about a yard off them—there were no other cus<lb></lb>tomers in the shop—I was not the first to miss the silk, but when it was observed I missed it directly—that was two or three minutes after they had left.</p>

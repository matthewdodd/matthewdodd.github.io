            . I am a constable. I went to the house with the prosecutor, - the prisoner brought down the watch, and said, "You have come about your watch: I picked it up in the road, and meant to bring it home in the morning" - he then said she had robbed him of it, and I attempted to take her, but she flew up stairs, and her father mother, brother, and sister, said they would lose their lives before I should take her - I left the house, and took her in the morning - it is a dreadful neighbourhood - I had several sticks thrown at me while I was at the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the prosecutor very drunk? A. He was a little fresh, but he told me the particulars.</p>

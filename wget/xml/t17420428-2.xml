            , Pigg and I took two Sheep out of a Fold; I can't say whose Fold it was, but we saw a young Man sitting by it over Night, to the best of my Knowledge it was this Man ( Tillier ) I can't tell when this was, but I remember it was the Night before they came to search Pigg's House. I gave Pigg a Shilling to fetch some Bread and Beer, and he went to an Alehouse, but came back again without it, and told his Wife they were coming to search. I was then cutting out one of the Sheep in a little Closet, and his Wife desired me to stay and not leave her alone. She gave me some Carpenter's Tools to carry out, and I dropp'd them at the Door, and met a great many People coming to search for the Sheep. I walk'd pretty leisurely 'till I got past the People; and when I got out of Sight I ran, and made the best of my way for Staines, and as I was going across the Moor, I met with Pigg, and we went together to one Clements's, at Grubb's Hill in Surrey, and Carpenter the Prisoner came there to us. I can't say that I remember any particular Discourse between us, but Pigg went on the Sunday following to see his Wife and was apprehended for this Fact.</p>

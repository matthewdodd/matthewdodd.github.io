            . I am a hackney-coachman, and live in Whitechapel. On the 14th of August I and William Simmonds were standing talking together on the pavement in <placeName id="t18300916-154-crimeloc803">Aldgate High-street</placeName>

            . I mind the carts in the butcher's market. Simmonds was letting a job into a coach; a man came with a wheelbarrow, and told Simmonds to get out of the way - I cannot swear to the man; Simmonds said he would get out of the way as soon as the coach went on, and when it went the man put down his barrow, shoved him, and said, "You ought to be dead years ago;" he fell on his left hip, and said, "Oh! my hip is broken;" the man did not shove him with any violence - he did no more than was necessary to enable him to drive his barrow along - I did not see him after Simmonds was thrown down.</p>

            . I am a pupil at the London-hospital. Simmonds was brought in between seven and eight o'clock on Saturday evening; I found a fracture high up in the thigh - he lived ten days - I did not consider him in danger till about nine o'clock on the Monday night before he died, which was on Tuesday morning, between twelve and one; I opened his body, but not the head, not thinking that would at all assist me in judging the cause of his death - I found him in a very unhealthy state; if no accident had happened I do not think he could have lived long: in my judgment, his death was caused by dysentry - I cannot tell what caused that - it appears he was labouring under it previous to this accident; I have reason to suppose so; I think it had very likely been aggravated by the accident - his death might possibly have been accelerated by the accident.</p>
               <p>Q. In your judgment, was it? A. Dysentry being an inflammatory disease, I think it likely to increase it; I should say his death was accelerated by the accident; more than one person of greater experience than myself inspected the body - none of them are here; I have been a pupil there twelve months next October - I have seen some few cases of dysentry, and some have recovered; I do not recollect any that have died; I am twenty-four years old - he never expressed to me any apprehension of danger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever examined the body of a person who died of dysentry? A. I have been present at the examination of more than one, and noticed the appearances, which corresponded with those in this case - the appearances were sufficient to account for his death, independent of any external violence he might have received; I should think his death was accelerated by the accident - he was a man of full habit, and drank a great deal; he was attended in the hospital for dysentry - I have been articled to a gentleman in the country for five years, but did not see many subjects there.</p>
               <p>Q. Your belief of death being accelerated rests solely in the knowledge that an accident would increase inflammatory action in the stomach generally? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. In forming your judgment do you take into consideration that death did not ensue till ten days; if the accident contributed to his death, should you not expect it to have been earlier? A. No.</p>

            . I am the widow of the deceased. I saw him in the hospital on the Sunday morning; he said he thought he should never come out of the hospital alive- he continued of that opinion till he died; he told me on the Sunday morning that he was letting a job into a coach about half-past eight o'clock, and a man came on the pavement with a barrow, gave him a shove, shoved him into the road, and used very bad words; I asked who it was - he said the cat's meat man - that he knew the man by his wife coming by the Butcher-row, and then he said"That is the woman's husband that has done my death;" he said, so help him God, no other man touched him but him - I had seen the prisoner's wife come by the Butcher-row, and he had often seen her there before the accident; we had both seen the husband and wife go by together - he said he had no words with the man, but the man made use of bad words, and told him he ought to have laid there many years ago; he did not know the man's name - I have known him twenty or thirty years, but did not learn his name till after this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you he met with the accident from the husband of a woman in the habit of coming down Butcher-row? A. Yes, the cat's meat man; I recollected the woman and the man also - there are several people in the neigh bourhood who go about with cat's meat - some of them are married; my husband drank at times - I cannot say whether he had been drinking at the time of the accident; he was sober when he left me at half-past six o'clock.</p>

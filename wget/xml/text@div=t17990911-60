             sworn. - I have been in the public line, but am now in no employ; I lost my watch between eleven and twelve at night, on the 14th of July; I had been at one Mr. Meane's, in Bedfordbury, and was going home to Sommerstown alone; I did not see any body, nor enter into conversation with any body at all; the prisoner stopped me at the top of Drury-lane, and asked me if I would give her any thing to drink; I went with her to a public-house, and gave her a pint of beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What public-house was it? - A. I do not know; I never was in it before or since; it was very near Drury-lane; I do not know that I staid there one minute scarce, no longer than to pay for the beer and come away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go with her then? - A. It was very imprudent in me so to do; when I left the public-house, and was going home, she followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your watch when you went into the public-house? - A. Yes, that I am sure of, because I had occasion to look just before what it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179909110096"></xptr>o'clock; she followed me from the public-house into <placeName id="t17990911-60-crimeloc315">Short's Gardens</placeName>

               <p>Q. How old are you? - A. I am in the 57th year of my age.</p>
               <p>PATRICK M'CARTY sworn. - I am a watchman; I apprehended the prisoner on the 14th of July; I heard somebody cry stop thief; I stopped her, I searched her. and found the watch upon her; Dalton and I always help one another; he came up just after I had found the watch. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is my watch.</p>
               <p>- DALTON sworn. - I am a watchman, I watch on one side of the street, and M'Carty on the other, I came up just as M'Carty had taken the prisoner; he had taken the watch from her.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Carty.) - Upon what part of her person did you find the watch? - A. Folded up in her gown tail, under her apron, and she gave me two or three pinches, I suppose to try whether I could keep a secret.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. Between nine and ten I met this man, and he insisted upon my going with him to the public-house; he gave me his watch till he got change for a guinea; and, when he had had satisfaction with me, he wanted the watch back again, and I was not going to prostitute my carcase for nothing.</p>
               <p>Q.(To M'Carty). What did she say when you took her? - A. She denied having the watch at the Justice's, and before the constable of the night, she said, he had given her the watch to get a bed for herself, and he pulled out either a seven shilling piece or a half guinea, I cannot tell which, and said, I should sooner have given you this than my watch.</p>

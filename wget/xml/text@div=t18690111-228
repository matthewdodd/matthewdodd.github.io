                  </hi>. I live at 6, Bream's Buildings, Beech Street, Barbican, and am a tailor—on Saturday morning, 9th January, about 12.45, I fastened up my house all safe, and went to bed—about 1 o'clock I was aroused with a slight noise—I lifted my head up and listened, and all was quiet for about ten minutes, and then I heard the noise again—I jumped out of bed rather quick, and saw a person in the front room—the gas was alight—he jumped on the chair and table, and through the window, and I jumped after him—I should have caught him there and then, but I fell back—I ran after him and caught him—I am sure he is the same that was in the room—I did not loose sight of him at all—I saw another man, he was two or three steps behind him—I did not follow the other one, because I took so much notice of this one; and I took no notice of the other—I had to do all I could to catch him—I had a desk in my room—there were two penny pieces on the desk—there were two medals, three pieces of paper, a box, a pair of gloves, and a ring in the desk—I missed those articles—I saw them safe when I went to bed.</p>

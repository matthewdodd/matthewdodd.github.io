On the 14th of February the prisoner came and asked for some pillow-lace, for children's caps: she looked at that, and then asked for some handkerchiefs - I watched her, and told her I had suspicion of her; I opened her cloak, and found eight handkerchiefs under her arm - this piece of lace dropped from her lap; she said she had nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was she not sitting down? A. Yes; she might have gone away - I was serving a customer; the prisoner was sitting on the lefthand side of the shop, and I was serving on the right, my face was towards her - she had asked Mrs. Stubbs for the lace, and then for the handkerchiefs, but Mrs. Stubbs had just then asked some ladies to take a seat; she was about half a yard from the door.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did this child make the least attempt to go away? A. No, she was waiting to look at some silk shawls.</p>

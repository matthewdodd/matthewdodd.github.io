                  </hi>. I live near Bideford—in November last I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Western Times</hi> newspaper. (<hi rend="italic">Head:</hi> "Money! Money! Money! A private capitalist of long standing is desirious of making advances to gentlemen, farmers, tradesmen, and all respectable persons, male or female, in sums of not less than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and not more than 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for any term up to ten years, on security of the borrower's own note of hand only, at 6 per cent. Mortgages negotiated at less interest. Strict secrecy in all cases. Applicants should at once state the amount required, for how long, and how they propose to repay; enclosing stamped envelope to Mr. Samuel Burcham, 7, Bath Street, City Road, E.C.") I wrote a letter on 11th November, addressed. to "Samuel Burcham, Esq., 7, Bath Street, City Road"—I made a copy of it, it was "Sir,—Having seen an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Western Times</hi> I beg to apply to you for the sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to be paid in two instalments of. 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in November, 1876, and November, 1877; I can give you good references and answer every career in my life." (<hi rend="italic">Notice to produce certain letters was proved to be served on the prisoner in Newgate.</hi>) I sent the letter by post, enclosing an envelope addressed to myself, and nest day but one I received this letter, dated 13th November, purporting to come from Samuel Burcham, and asking for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in postage stamps—I wrote back the same day, enclosing 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in stamps and posted it myself—on 16th November I received another letter signed "S.

               <p>was given and not Bath Street—I took a copy of the note and sent it back on the 16th to 6, Nile Street, enclosing a P.O. order for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the first year's interest—I registered the letter and posted it—I have the receipt of the registration signed by the post-master at Bideford, and this is the P.O. order I sent—the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was promised on the Friday; it did not come—I waited till the next day—I was then suspicious—I spoke to Mr. Major, and on the 20th I wrote again to S. Burcham at 6, Nile Street, telling him that I was disappointed at not receiving the loan as promised and wanting to know the reason—on the 22nd I received a letter dated the 20th signed S. Burcham, telling me he had been defrauded by a borrower at Wrexham, who had disputed his signature and that his agent would wait on me to witness my signature and requesting me to forward two guineas for his ex<lb></lb>penses—I wrote again, pressing for the money, but not sending the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> guineas—I received an answer dated the 24th, pressing me again to send the two guineas or the matter would be closed—I did not reply to that—I then got a letter dated 27th November, telling me that there had been an explosion of gas at 6, Nile Street, and that letter was addressed from Oakley Street, his private residence—all the letters but one were in the same handwriting—I communicated with the police in London for I saw that I was done—I was directed by the police to address a letter to Oakley Street and a duplicate to Nile Street—this is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—at the time I sent the postage stamps and the post-office order for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. I believed there was an office in Bath Street—I believed that the contents of. the letters were true, or else I should not have sent the money—I was induced to part with my stamps and the order to borrow the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should not have parted with them if I had not believed the contents of the letters.</p>

On 30th November, about 8.30 a.m.—I went to Oakley Street, Westminster Bridge Road, and watched there—I was in plain clothes—No. 15 is a newspaper shop, kept by Mrs. Brown—I saw the prisoner go to that shop—he spoke to the landlady and left—she made a sign to me and I followed him—I said "Mr. Burcham;" he took no notice, but continued to walk along—I again addressed him, "Mr. Burcham;" he said "That is not my name"—I said "I am a police officer and wish to speak to you about the letters you have been in the habit of receiving at the house you have just left, 15, Oakley Street, in that name"—he said "Stand out of my way, will you?" and struck me—I took him into custody—on the way to the station he said "What are you going to do with me"—I said "I am not at all sure that you will not have to go to Ireland; you are making a pretty good thing out of the poor dupes in different parts of the country"—he said "What do you mean?"—I said. "You know as well as I do, about pretending to lend them money"—he said "It is no use denying it"—I asked him his name and address—he said "John Reed"—after I had written that down he said "No; not John, Samuel"—that he lived at 51, Duke Street, Waterloo Road, and that he was a walking-stick maker—I have been there—it is a private-house—I found a Mr. Liddamore living there, a walking-stick maker—I got these three unopened letters after the prisoner was in custody, one from Oakley Street and two from Nile Street—they were delivered a few minutes after I took him.

I am the wife of James Brown, living at 15, Oakley, Street, Lambeth, and keep a news shop—I know the prisoner and recollect his coming to my shop, about the 15th November, for a pennyworth of note paper—he also asked if letters might be addressed to him there—I said "Yes," and asked in what name—he said Burcham—I do not know whether he said "S" at the time, but the letters were addressed to "S. Burcham"—a day or two afterwards a letter came addressed to S. Burcham, Esq.—the prisoner called and I gave it to him—he put a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. down and said he always gave a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for a letter—he called everyday for about a week or ten days—he had about a dozen letters altogether—I recollect his being taken into custody—until then I received letters for him—one letter was from Bideford, I noticed a second from Exeter, and a third from the country, but I do not know what place—on the 30th November, the day he was taken into custody, he came before the postman who brought one letter afterwards, which I gave to Butcher, and it was marked "W"—the prisoner never said who he was, nor where he lived—he gave no address—he said nothing more than he had three years good character and did not want to throw it away for nothing; I thought he was advertising for a situation—post cards that came were in reference to advertisements.</p>

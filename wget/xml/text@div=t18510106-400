                  </hi>. I am a ship-broker, at 5, Trinity-square, Tower-hill; I have more than one partner—the prisoner came into our service about the beginning of March, 1849, as head book-keeper and cashier—when money, which he had received from the clerks or other people, had accumulated a little, it was his duty to pay it into the bankers', Messrs. Rogers, Olding, and Co.—a book was kept, called the rough cash-book, in which it was the prisoner's duty to add up the various sums paid to him, or which he had received, and to carry it out into the first column—when the other clerks received money, it would be their duty to do the same, and when the payments had accumulated it would be the prisoner's duty to add them up, bring the total into the second column, and pay the amount into the bankers', having first received from the other clerks the sums they had entered—there was a book called the fair</p>

               <p>cash-book, containing a debit and credit side; the debit side would be made up from the counterfoils of the check-book, and from the bill-book and the credit side from the rough cash-book—memorandums are made on the counterfoils of the check-book of the amount and object of each check—bills payable to the firm are paid at the bankers', and a balance ought to be made once a month, but I am sorry to say it was not made up to the end of the year: I found it was added up in pencil, and spoke to him about it, and said it was not the proper way—it is in ink now—I cannot say that I had told him that that was his duty, but the previous clerk had done it so—this is the rough cash-book—I find here, under a line which refers to Aug. 1849, a sum of 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. carried out into the second column—the total is composed of six items; the first is "<hi rend="italic">King William,</hi> Felto and Co., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—it is in the writing of a clerk named Simmons—"<hi rend="italic">King William</hi>" is the name of a ship; Felto and Co. are parties who have paid freight on goods brought by it—this next item, "Traveller, J. Carves, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." is also in Simmons' writing; and also this "duty, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—the next entry, '"Barnes, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18," is in Watmore's writing—this "Achitre de Ambolo-Returned Customs, light out, 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.," on the 9th, is in the prisoner's writing—that is the way in which he should enter the receipt of <hi rend="italic">money</hi> if he had received it from the party—this "Bills receivable, No. 149. 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>." on 10th Aug., is the prisoner's writing—these six items added together make 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which is carried out into the second column in the prisoner's writing—it was his duty to see it paid into the bankers, to give it to a clerk to pay in—this is the bankers' book (produced)—the amount really paid in on 10th Aug. was 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it was the prisoner's duty to see the book when it came back from the bankers'—he has never accounted to me for 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the difference—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the fair cash-book; it was kept by the prisoner—on 21st Nov. here is an entry on the debit side of a "Bill payable, No. 248, 191<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—it is written on an erasure in the prisoner's writing—248 indicates the number in the bill-book where I find the entry in the prisoner's writing, "No. 248, Thomas C. Horford, Cadiz, Sept. 19, payable at sixty days' date, accepted, 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—that makes an entry in the cash-book of 109<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more than was paid on the bill—on 9th May, 1850, I find an entry of the prisoner's in the fair cash-book of 190<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., at No. 270—the corresponding entry in the bill-book is 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the alteration has been made in the fair cash-book by putting a tail to the 0., and the figures have been gone over again—they are darker than the rest—the two bills (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) for 82<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., are those to which the entries in the bill-book refer.</p>

               <p>his being sent for—it might have been Mr. Obert or Mr. Powell who sent for him—I have not interfered in that part of the business—Mr. Obert is here, in the gallery—Mr. Obert had been looking over the books himself, and was going over them afterwards with me—between the prisoner's coming in March, and his leaving, somewhere about 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 70,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has passed through his hands—the aggregate amount to be paid into the bankers', appears in the outer column of the rough cash-book—sometimes one of the boys paid it in, and I have known the prisoner to take it—I am not aware how frequently we had the pass-book from the bankers; it was trusted implicitly to the prisoner—he used to sit in the counting-house, with five or six other clerks—I chiefly managed the money part of the business, but I thoroughly trusted the prisoner with the pass-book—I did not even question him; the only thing I demanded of him was the amount at my bankers', of an evening—my private account was sometimes over-drawn, with the sanction of my partners—I have not been in the habit of asking the prisoner for sums of money out of his Tough cash; when I wanted money of him, and he had gold in his hands, I would say, "Mr. Gardner, give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and I should give him a check on my bankers for it; I should draw it in the name of the firm, And mark, "J. H. T." in the check-book—that was a common custom, if one of the partners wanted money, instead of sending each check to be changed—I might do so once a month, not once a week—that was not because my private account at the bankers' was over-drawn, nor have I told the prisoner so—on my solemn oath, I never drew money of him that be ought to have paid into the bankers', nor did I tell him so—I believe it was over-drawn about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it did not remain so; I think it was altered in Nov., I paid in 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we only have a business account at my bankers'—it was my private account between myself and my partners which was over-drawn—that was with their sanction—I had mentioned to them that I should require to over-draw it—at one time it was only 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over-drawn—after I had paid the 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was still 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over-drawn—a bill was drawn by me, and discounted by the bankers, for my accommodation—that is not in the bill-book; it was my own private bill—it appears as cash to my credit in the pass-book; it is, "Partridge and Co., 5th Nov., 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I am debited with the discount—the entry is, "Discount, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I forget whether I drew a check for the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I certainly did not draw a check for it in the name "discount;" if I drew it at all, it would be in the name of "J. H. T."—it was to make up a deficiency in my private account—it was a private matter between me and my bankers, who were personal friends of mine, and said, "Yes, we will do that for you"—I was a member of the firm of Partridge and Co., in Liverpool; they are ship-brokers, in Crutched Friars—Mr. Obert is another of that firm, and Mr. Partridge; Mr. Powell was not a member at that time—Mr. Obert and I have not been on friendly terms all the time; we were when the prisoner came—we only had one check-book; we both bad the control of it; I took it into my possession for two days in Nov., during a quarrel; that was while the prisoner was in our service—I never but once gave the prisoner a signed check blank for him to fill up; that was when I was called out of town by the illness of a sick child—the prisoner had nothing to do with the disbursements—Simmons kept the petty cash; the amount of it was generally under 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—the first date when a balance of</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And at that time was it not stated, in your presence, that you proposed that Mr. Hobler should have them for ten minutes, and that three hours was preposterous? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had nothing at all to do with it; I was in my solicitor's hands; he acted, and not me—it was not stated in my presence—I remember Mr. Humphreys saying, in Mr. Ballantine's presence, that he would turn to any account in the books which the prisoner might request to look at; I cannot recollect the exact words; and Mr. Hobler required the books for three or four hours by himself, to which Mr. Humphreys said, "Nonsense; a quarter of an hour will do"—our book-keeper, Mr. Waddell, had the examination of the books daring the three months, and Mr. Obert, Mr. Powell, and myself—I do not know whether, during the difference between me and Mr. Obert, he got a sepa<lb></lb>rate check-book from the bankers; I think he went for one.</p>

               <p>the bankers' with the money—on the slip of paper which the prisoner used to bring me, was what he had paid, what he had drawn out, and the balance left at the bankers'—I had no means of knowing whether the papers were right at night—I never asked for the pass-book—the prisoner used to draw the body of the checks, and I signed them; and in no other way would the check be honoured, unless drawn by myself or partners—it might be filled up by anybody—I had an arrangement with my partners how much each I was to draw—it was with the sanction of both my partners that I overdrew my account—it was known to Mr. Obert well that we had both done so—that would be known to the prisoner, as clerk; he kept my account, and in that way he learned what has been asked me—we have banked with Messrs. Rogers since 1847; they are friends of my family—the blank check which I signed, was in the latter end of July or the beginning of Aug., 1849—I gave it into the prisoner's hands—I do not know whether it was used; if it was, it would go to whatever account he paid the money for, and the check would appear in the ordinary way.</p>

CLARKSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you the keeper of the petty cash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was Mr. Thompson's custom to borrow the balance of the petty cash, probably once a week—I kept a memorandum of the sums borrowed from week to week till the end of the month—he very seldom borrowed more than 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it would amount to above 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the end of the month—I charged it to his debit in the petty cash—I have not known him borrow of the prisoner—I have heard him ask for checks out of the book—I do not know what for—I never was present when that was for moneys advanced by the prisoner to Mr. Thompson-pilots and persons of that description were in the habit of coming into the office at all times of the day—Mr. Thompson was very little in the office after twelve o'clock—I have never known the prisoner pay a check to persons who came, unless one of the partners were there to sign it—if a pilot came when none of the partners were there, he would be told to come again, and a check would be drawn and laid on one side—pilots some<lb></lb>times come who have to go back by the return tide, but if none of the partners were in, they would be told to come again—they have been paid out of the petty cash—I know of no instance in which the prisoner has advanced money out of the rough cash; I did not know that he was about to leave, till within a very few days of his leaving—I cannot recollect whether I heard it from himself or from another party; it was not from Mr. Thomp<lb></lb>son—I never knew that Mr. Thompson had given him notice as long as 23rd May before—I heard the prisoner say that he had not exactly given notice, but he was about doing so—it was not generally known in the office that he had given notice—I have not heard him say that Mr. Thompson had said that if he would stay he would advance his salary.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLAKTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you receive the money you bad to disburse in petty cash? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By check; no money was paid out of the rough cash to my knowledge—it would be very irregular for the prisoner to pay a pilot who was in a hurry to go back—a person named Wood was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185101060081"></xptr>
               <p>in the habit of collecting pilotage, but not for the river pilots; sometimes they would get a friend to come, but they never employed an agent; they are men who are rather urgent for the money, and are not at all pleased to have to call again.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Jacob's Well public-house, it Charlotte-street, Manchester-square—I have one partner—the prisoner lodged at our house. On the 25th of December, I had in the till in the bar, about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and some halfpence—I was absent for ten minutes, about three o'clock in the morning—just as I left the bar, I shut the till up—I went into the parlour, and left nobody in the bar—I went back again, and found the till half open, and the money gone—I missed it directly—I do not know who had been into the bar—there were seven or eight people in the house, and one or two policemen came in—the prisoner was there—he was searched in my presence—24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and some halfpence were found on him—I cannot say that it was my money—when I saw the till safe there was a crown-piece, some half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences in it, and the same was found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an Inspector of the D division of the Police. At a quarter before three o'clock on this morning I was standing outside the prosecutor's door—there was a noise inside—Sergeant Harrison was with me—he pointed out a round hole in the door, through which I could see the back parlour—I saw the prosecutor go from the bar into the back parlour, apparently to quiet the people, and I saw the prisoner go into the bar, and immediately I heard some money rattle-whether it was the prisoner rattling it, or any other person in the bar, I cannot say.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-sergeant D</hi> 14.) I was at this house—I went away with the Inspector, and when I came back, a man came out of the door, and called the policeman—the landlord said his till had been rob<lb></lb>bed—I went to the parlour—there were seven or eight persons sitting there—he wished them all searched—I searched one, and then I asked if he suspected any person—he said, yes, the prisoner, who was stand<lb></lb>ing without his coat, and a person had seen him come from the bar—I asked the prisoner what he had got—he said, 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I search him, and found this crown-piece—the prosecutor said "That is a crown-piece which my partner gave change for, and pot into the till"—there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. found on him—he was drunk—the prosecutor said, "This is 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. which you tool out of my till"—and he said, "No, I did not"—the prosecutor's partner then came in and pulled off the coat which the prisoner has got on now, and gave it to him.</p>

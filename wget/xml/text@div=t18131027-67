            . I live in Union-street, in the Minories. On the evening of the 17th of September, I had been to the Red Cow in Long-lane, Aldersgate. I had been there to take home a hat to the landlord of the house. I went there about eight o'clock, and staid there till near twelve. When I go out of an evening it is always my rule to put my chain in. I came out to make water, and I know the chain was in. On my going up Houndsditch, in my way home, I met the prisoner; she asked me to go with her. I told her to go about her business. She took hold of my arm; I shoved her away. She kept walking by my side. I thought I had out walked her, and when I came to the corner of <placeName id="t18131027-67-crimeloc382">Aldgate church</placeName>

I called stop thief; she was stopped. I have never seen my watch since. After she was taken to the watchhouse they found a watch paper. The watch paper I out myself; I knew it belonged to my watch. It was a silver watch. It was worth between thirty and forty shillings.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the night of the 17th of September, I was standing near my box, about half after one; I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor walking together; the prisoner had hold of his arm; they were in conversation together. In about two minutes after, I heard the cry of stop thief. I stopped the prisoner; she was running. I took her to the watchhouse. The prosecutor charged her with robbing him, and at the watchhouse he said she had robbed him of his watch. The officer went out and found a watch paper.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was delivered into my charge. I was officer of the night. I searched the prisoner; I found nothing upon her. I went out and looked about the road; I found a watch paper. I found no watch, chain, or seal. I shewed the watch paper to Mr. Rice, in the watchhouse. He said he could not rightly tell then whether it was his; he could tell better in the morning. In the morning he swore to it before the Lord Mayor. This is the watch paper; there is not a soil upon it; it was a dry night. At the watchhouse the prisoner denied her robbing of him.</p>

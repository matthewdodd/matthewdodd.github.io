               <p>Q. Do you remember passing through Broad-street, Ratcliffe, on the 5th of August - A.On the 5th of August my business led me in Rag-fair. I was passing along. I heard one say to the other, it is my man, and the other said, it is my man. It being dusk, it made me stop. I thought it was a press gang. I saw two or three men leave the man who had lost his money.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw them go away from him - A. Yes. I heard the man say, you have got my pocket-book. I saw one depart across the road. I only said, if you have lost your pocket-book this man has got it; and then this man ran off. I called out, stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard a bustle, and you were attentive - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw two or three men leave the man who had lost the pocket-book: he said, you have got my pocket-book - A. Yes. I saw one go away. I cried, stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. You said, stop thief. That man you say crossed the way, and ran, that is all you know - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether that man that was stopped afterwards, and secured, was the prisoner - A. I do not know who it may be. It was about half after eight o'clock. I cannot say whether the prisoner was the man or not. I have no recollection of the person of the prisoner, no farther than seeing him at the justices. I did not say that I know him then.</p>

            . Q. I believe you keep a school in this lane - A. I do. On suspicion that somebody had throwed something over the wall, I searched the yard and garden. I had a little girl, who was inside of the wall, who was walking backwards and forwards. She told me, that she heard something jink like money. The child found the pocket-book. She pointed out the place to me where she stood when something came over her head. I saw her pick up the pocket-book in the garden. The child delivered it to me, and I delivered it to Hope, the officer, and the child picked up three three-shilling: pieces. They were given to the officer.</p>

I saw the prisoner walk up and down the wall of the saltpetre warehouse, with two or three others. Before they made the end of the wall they were met by three sailors. The middle sailor stopped. He was pushed against the wall by the party. In the space of five minutes his pocket-book was drawn. They released him.

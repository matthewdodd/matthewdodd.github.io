On 26th Feb. the prisoner came to my shop for a pint of porter—he tendered me a bad sixpence—I told him it was not good—I laid it on the counter—be said it was a good one—I took it up and bit it, and it bent—he then took it up—he drank three parts of the beer and went out as quick as he could—I went and took him in the street—Mr. Davey came, and assisted me to hold him till the policeman came—while I was struggling with him, five sixpences were shown to me; among them was one that was bent as I bent the one tendered to me—this is it.</p>

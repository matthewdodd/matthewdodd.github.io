            . I am a constable of Bow-street. -On the 16th of March I was told what had passed, and watched till the following Saturday morning; I saw Erridge in the constant habit of lurking about the premises, while Mr. Bellringer was at market - I can swear to his being there every morning but the Tuesday. On the Saturday morning I placed myself in a hackney-coach, and between six and seven o'clock I saw a little nephew of the prosecutor's go out with a jug, for some coffee - directly afterwards I saw Oakely come out and beckon for some one to go to the shop; I directly saw Erridge go to the shop: I distinctly saw he had nothing in his hand when he went in - he was in the shop from three to five minutes, and then came out with a basket, which appeared to be loaded; I followed down Holywell-street, and asked what he had got there - he said some meat, which was his own; I asked where he got it from - he then said it was his master's - I asked who his master was; he said that was his business: I told him I was a Bow-street officer, and my business was to inquire where he got it from; he then said a butcher who was going to Newgate-market, asked him to carry it for him; I told him I suspected he had stolen it, and put him into St. Clement's watch-house - the basket contained two legs of mutton and a piece of beef: he was near Temple-bar when I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could you see the shop when Erridge went in? A. I could not; I was between fifty and sixty yards off, but it was impossible for any one to go in or come out without my seeing them - I did not see Oakley in the shop at the time Erridge went in; I did not go in till after Oakley was taken.</p>

            . I was informed there was something going on wrong, and was set to watch. On the 21st of March I was in the church, and saw Oakley come out of the shop, just after the little boy came out with the jug; he looked towards Holywell-street - I saw him beckon, and in about a minute I saw Erridge walk up to the shop and go in; Oakley then took down a leg of mutton from the door, and walked into the shop - I afterwards saw Erridge come out with a basket, very heavily loaded; I went out, and followed him with the meat, but seeing the other officer I went back, and took Oakley; I said I wanted him concerning robbing his master of the meat - he said he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Oakley tell you he went down stairs to look for his cap, and what happened while he was down he could not tell? A. I do not recollect it- to my best belief he did not; the church is not above eight yards from the shop: I found no money on Oakley, but there was 1l. 7s. found in his box.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear he might not have come part of the way down? A. No; he might have come down without my seeing him, but I think it impossible - I was not above half a dozen yards from the stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE BROWN</hi>. I live at 15, Chandler's Road, New Cross, and am Surveyor to the Admiralty—on Thursday, 2nd October, I had been to Deptford Victualling Yard, and was going through Albert Street to New Cross—I was alone—the prisoner came up from behind me and inquired if I could direct him to London Bridge—I pointed and told him he could go along Evelyn Street, or by the entrance to the Commercial Docks—he then said that he wanted to go to the Victoria Docks—I said "Then you should walk to Greenwich, and cross to Blackwall Pier by the boat, and you will be close on the spot, it is only a short walk to Victoria Docks"—at that moment a friend approached—I asked him, and he agreed that that was the proper way—the prisoner stood there five or eight minutes, immovable, and having a few words to exchange with my friend, I moved off, leaving him in the same position—I walked eight or nine yards with my friend, and then halted and completed the conversation—we stopped for seven or eight minutes, and then I left my friend, and moved on—I had to pass the prisoner again, and he had not moved a stride, as far as I could guess—I passed him twelve or fourteen yards, and then heard footsteps, and then two fearful explosions just behind me in quick succession—I looked round immediately, and saw the prisoner holding in his hand what appeared to be a revolver—he was three or three and a half yards from me, holding the revolver in a wavering way, uncertain how to treat it, or what to do with it—he held it downwards at an angle of about forty-five, and glared at me with a very wild expression—at that moment a policeman and my friend hurried to the spot—the policeman seized the prisoner, my friend closed with him, and we all proceeded to the station—on the way the prisoner seized me with the hand which the policeman had not hold of and called upon him to take me in charge for trying to murder him, asking me at the same time who I was—I said that I refused to answer any question to him—on the way to the station I saw these holes in the sleeve of my coat under my arm, which were not in it before, and in my shirt sleeve also—the bullets appear to have gone between my body and my arm, perforating my sleeve—the prisoner called upon the police at the station to take charge of me—he said that I had haunted him all the previous night, and the whole place was filled with the smell of blood—he also said that I had smashed the window of his house when he was in Liverpool, and had robbed him—I afterwards saw a woman who was injured.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had had no previous acquaintance with the prisoner, and had never seen him to my knowledge—when he accosted me his manner seemed exceedingly earnest beyond what the occasion required—I passed him several times—he asked me everything twice in order to get a perfect answer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of a chocolate manufactory at 452, New Cross, Deptford—on 2nd October I was near the Victualling Yard, and saw Mr. Brown and the prisoner in conversation—they referred to me as to the most direct way to go to the Victoria Docks—I said that I thought to walk to Greenwich and take the boat to Blackwall was the best way—Mr. Brown and I then moved on fifteen yards in com<lb></lb>pany</p>

               <p>towards the Royal Victoria Yard, and after we had stood a short time talking, Mr. Brown left me—the prisoner was then standing in the same place, and that appearing suspicious to me, I stood and watched him, to see what he would do, and when Mr. Brown passed him ten or twelve yards, I saw the prisoner turn in the same direction and run after him, and when within four or five yards of him, he pulled something from the side pocket of his coat and immediately I heard two explosions in succession, and saw smoke and a revolver—I ran to Mr. Brown's assistance, with a policeman—on the road to the station the prisoner endeavoured to impress upon the policeman the necessity of taking Mr. Brown for an attempt to murder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> He repeated that twice at least, and at the station he said that Mr. Brown had been haunting him all night—I heard him say that the whole place smelt of blood, and that Mr. Brown had made some attack upon him at Liverpool, and robbed him of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was examined on the second remand—I noticed that the prisoner's demeanour was peculiar—he seemed in no degree to appreciate the peril of his position or the seriousness of the charge—he said to the Magistrate in a flippant tone, "Can't I have bail?—there was at that time a second accusation of injuring the woman who had been taken to the hospital.</p>

On 2nd October, I was going oh duty about 1.30, and heard two reports of a pistol—I went up and arrested the prisoner—I saw him put something in his pocket—I searched him at the station, and found this six-chamber revolver, loaded in four chambers—two chambers had been recently discharged, I could tell that by the heat and by the blackening of the powder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had charge of him on his remand—his conduct was not only strange and inconsistent at the—time, but on the remands it was equally so, and quite inconsistent with a sound mind—his general conduct and expressions led me to the opinion that he was not of sound mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner's Statement before the Magistrate</hi>: "On the 2nd October, about 12 o'clock in the night time, I heard a noise outsioje the house where I am stopping, at 21, Dean Street, Shad well; I jumped out of bed and looked through the window. The night was quite dark, so I was not able to see anyone. I got in bed again and hearkened to see could I hear anyone a second time. I fancied I heard someone in the street. I took my revolver and fired it in the centre of the street three times, and I heard five or six men running as hard as their legs could carry them. At the same time I heard someone in the next house, and they had, I believe, some kind of chemical stuff and I felt my senses almost gone. I looked out of the window again to Bee was it the man outside, but I could not see anyone, the night was so dark. I got into bed again and put the revolver under my head for fear of anyone coming near me, and I fell asleep with the revolver under my head, for fear of being murdered. The following day I took a walk round the East India Dock, in search of employment; I left the East India Dock and came on the other side of the water; I got in company of two men as I fancied to be secretaries of the Ship Building Society, and I left them near Mr. Penn's, the engineers, as they were going forward to Woolwich. I went forward to the Victoria ship breaking yard, and after waiting there about half an hour I came in contact with this man here (Mr. Brown) I asked him the way to London Bridge, and at the same time if there was any ship building yard on the way. He turned up his nose and said 'You had better go back again to the Victoria ship building</p>

               <p>yard. 'With him speaking so dirty to me, I took him to be the man who was attempting to rob or murder me, and then we parted. I heard the man say as lie was going 'I'll give it you when I've got a chance, 'and hearing this I followed him, fired a near shot to him to frighten him, and at the same time to call a policeman for attempting to rob and murder me the night before. The man came to the police-office and I was took up for firing the revolver. I was searched and put in gaol."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN KOWLAND GIBSON</hi>. I am surgeon of Newgate Gaol, and have been so eighteen or nineteen years—I have had considerable experience of persons of unsound mind—the prisoner was admitted to Newgate on, I think, 17th October, and I examined him on the 18th, and from that time he has been daily under my observation and care—I examined him the first day I saw him and formed a very decided opinion of the state of his mind—I see everyone who comes in—I think he is insane—he suffers under distinct delusions and hallucinations—the opinion I formed on the 17th is completely confirmed by subsequent examinations, and in my judgment he is decidedly of unsound mind.</p>

The prisoner was under my observation after iris apprehension—when he first came into my custody he was like a person insane, as if he was not capable of knowing under what circumstances he was there—on visiting him in the cell a short time after his apprehension he wanted to know whether the man was in custody, meaning Mr. Brown—I told him he was not—he said "What, have I made a mistake?"—I said "I am under the impression that you have"—he said "Is not he the man who has been attempting to murder me and have my 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said that I did not think he was—he said "Well, if that is the case, of course, we shall both get off"—when I searched him I looked for any marks to distinguish him by under the impression that he was a lunatic—he was exceedingly earnest in pointing out all the marks, which a sane person would not do—from his coming into my custody till his committal, I am of opinion that he was of unsound mind.</p>

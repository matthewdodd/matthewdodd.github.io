I was on duty in the Old Kent-road—about 7 o'clock in the evening I saw the three prisoners, but Williams and Simpson were together first—they walked along looking into different shops, and Reynolds was on the other side of the way—I fol<lb></lb>lowed Williams and Simpson from twenty minutes to half an hour to the Bricklayers' Arms station—they stopped a minute, and then walked on very fast towards New Cross—about 150 yards from the Green Man public-house Reynolds joined them, and they walked about 250 yards towards New Cross—I still followed them—Williams went in front about thirty or forty yards—she then walked behind them—I went on as far as the Kentish Drovers, when I met two constables in uniform (I was in plain clothes)—I then stopped Reynolds, and asked him what he had about him—he said, "Nothing"—Simpson was stopped by a constable in uniform—their pockets were searched at the place where they were taken, but nothing was found—just as I had done searching Reynolds's pockets, Williams came along on the same side of the way—when she got within about two yards of us she crossed the road—I followed, and took her by both her wrists—I asked her what she had got—she said, "Nothing"—she tried to put her left hand behind her—I took it, opened it, and found something wrapped up—I said, "I thought you said you had got nothing?"—she said, "You have got it now"—I opened the parcel at the station, and found it contained these eleven shillings and four sixpences—I searched Reynolds again, and found two good shillings on him and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on Simpson.</p>

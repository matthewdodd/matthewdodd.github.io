                  </hi>. I am a builder, and live in White-conduit-street. This wood was taken from a yard adjoining some cottages—the prisoner was doing some zinc work for me—he did not work on the wood—he worked part of it on my premises, and part at home—I had some suspisions on Friday morning I wanted Lee—I saw him at a distance, working with the prisoner, and on going across I saw the prisoner with this wood which I had lost about six weeks ago—I was thunderstruck, and said to the prisoner, "Where did you buy this?"—he said, "Of Mr. Solomon, up in Shoreditch"—I put my rule on it, and saw it was exactly the length of some battens I bought of Mr. Wilkinson, in Old-street—I then called <hi rend="italic">Tom Lee</hi> on one side, and said I thought it was stolen, and took him with me up to Solomon's—I saw no stuff like mine there—I came back to Islington to seek Brown, a constable—we went to the prisoner, and I gave him into cus<lb></lb>tody—I found twenty battens altogether, ten feet long, 7 by 2—the value of the whole is about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is my property.</p>

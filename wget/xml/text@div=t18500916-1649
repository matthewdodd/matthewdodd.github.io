                  </hi>. I have a shop in New-street, Vincent-square, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster. I left it on Monday, 19th Aug., at half-past six o'clock—I fastened it with a padlock outside—I had left my tools in the shop—on the following morning I went soon after six to the shop—the door was open, and the padlock broken—I missed my planes, chisels, gouges, squares, gimlets, and other things; all that were loose in the shop—they were worth about 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw them afterwards in Whitechapel—these are them—they are all mine.</p>

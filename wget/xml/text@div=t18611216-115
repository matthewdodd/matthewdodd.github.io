I am a collector, living at 52, Marlborough-road, Peckham—on 9th December, about half-past 7 in the evening, I was in King William-street—I had a watch with me—I was very ill indeed, and was walking with some difficulty by Mr. Deane's shop—I felt for my watch and missed it—I cannot say who took it.</p>

I am assistant to a grocer of 4, Crown-row, Walworth-road—on the evening of 9th December I was near Mr. Deane's shop in King William-street, going home, and saw the old gentleman, Mr. Bristow, going towards London-bridge—he was very feeble, and was supporting him<lb></lb>self</p>

               <p>by the sash of Mr. Dane's window—a crowd gathered round him, and the prisoner and another man passed as it were over the bridge, and came back—the man who it not in custody spoke to the old gentleman, who was leaning back—he leaned over him, but I did not hear whatpassed—while he was speaking to the old gentleman, the prisoner was close to his side; he had a cape on—he had his hand raised, and his cape over it—I did not see a watch, but I saw the prisoner's hand move and then he let it down and went away as quick as he could towards Arthur-street—I told a policeman what had occurred, and saw the prisoner go round King William-street; he was going between two wagons in Pudding-lane with his cape on his arm—he looked back, and the policeman caught him by the collar and said something to him—he was taken back to the old gentleman in my presence, who said that he could not say whether he was the man or not.</p>

Deane'a shop—I saw the prisoner there—thought the old man was run over—he was leaning against the wall—and as I was going up my attention was drawn to the prisoner by something glittering in his hand—I saw that it was a watch, and he was trying to get out of the crowd—I kept sight of him, and a policeman came up and took him—I followed to the station.</p>

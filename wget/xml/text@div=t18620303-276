I live at 30, South-street, Marylebone—I was an assistant in the employ of Mr. Wincott the deceased, at 30, South-street—about 4 o'clock on Saturday afternoon, 3d February, I was in the shop—we have a customer of the name of Viall, who takes away the bones from our place—Viall was there with his cart removing bones from our place that afternoon—whilst the cart was at the door laden with bones, I saw the prisoner come up with three other men, named Walsh, Cox, and Poulton; they came up and commenced taking the bones from the boneman's cart—I can't say which began, they all began, they took the bones and threw at Viall the boneman—some of them got up on his cart and took bonesa nd began throw<lb></lb>ing</p>

I am a member of the College of Surgeons, of Thayer-street, Marylebone—on the afternoon of 3d February, I was passing the end of South-street, and saw a disturbance—some person said I was wauted, that Mr. Wincott had been stabbed—I went and found Mr. Wincott sitting in his parlour at the back of the shop, with his hand on his right side—he said, "Oh, sir, I am stabbed"—I undressed him and examined him—I found a slanting wound, an inch and a half long and very deep; I could not reach the bottom of it with my finger—it was about an inch below the right border of the rib, on the right side—I applied a bandage and attended him till his death, the next evening at 7 o'clock—I thought so seriously of it that I thought it necessary to communicate with the police, to have his deposition taken that evening—it was taken—I afterwards made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I found that the wound had penetrated the right side of the abdomen, passing through the walls and penetrating the right lobe of the liver, producing extensive internal hemorrhage, which was the cause of death—there was no wound to the intestines—it was such a wound as would be made by such a knife as this—I was present when the deposition of the deceased was taken by Mr. Yardley—the prisoner was also present, at the foot of the bed, and had the opportunity of cross-examining him—I saw the Magistrate sign the deposition—this is his signature—(<hi rend="italic">Read;</hi> "I was in my own shop, at No. 30, South-street, Manchester-square, at 4 this afternoon, when I heard a disturbance outside; and going out I saw four or five men trying to pull out of a cart a man engaged in taking away the bones from my shop; I went out to protect him, when they rushed at me and tried to get into the shop; I got back into the shop; one of them took a knife from outside the board, made a rush at me inside the shop, and stabbed me with the knife in the side. I can't say positively it was the prisoner, but I am almost certain it was him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 4, North-street—I know Mr. Wincott's shop—I lodged directly opposite it—on 3d February, about twenty minutes past 4, I was coming out of my door and saw the bone cart there—I saw the prisoner and three men against the cart—the bone man hit Cox, one of the men, with the whip—I did not see him hit the prisoner—I saw the bone<lb></lb>man go into Mr. Wincott's shop—the prisoner was then against the door—I did not see him go into the shop—Mr. Wincott was standing against the door—I do not know whether he had anything in his hand or not—I saw him strike at Quail three times—that was while he was standing at the door—he then turned back into the shop—I do not know what Quail did then—I did not see what he did; he was against the door—I did not see whether he went into the shop or not—I heard a minute or so afterwards that</p>

               <p>Mr. Wincott was stabbed—he struck Quail before he was stabbed—I could not say to a minute or two, how shortly it was before; I was so frightened—it was perhaps a minute or so after that he went into the shop; and it was directly afterwards that I heard he was stabbed, before I came to the end of the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was Quail outside the shop at this time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; they were all outside—they might have gone away—if there had been a little more quietness and patience with Mr. Wincott and the rest, it might not have happened—I saw a young girl pull Quail away—I did not see anything taken from his hand—I saw nothing more than I have stated—I saw them all when they went away, for about twenty minutes after this had occurred—I was asked to come here by Mrs. Quail—they have been to me ever so many times, day after day, to come—they have not talked this matter over with me; nothing of the sort—I have known Quail in the street as a hawker in fish, but I have known nothing more of him, except as being civil and quiet.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> From what you have known of him, has he been a quiet well-conducted man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; in the street, with that exception he was quite a stranger to me, and so was Mr. Wincott likewise—at the time I saw the blow struck by Mr. Wincott, there was scuffling and struggling going on against the door.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 357, Oxford-street—I am in service there—I was not in service on the day this occurred—on the day in question I was coming down South-street—I did not know the prisoner or Mr. Wincott previously; all the parties were strangers to me—I was coming along with another young person, and saw a man or the cart with a large bone in his hand—I stood by the butcher's door, not thinking that the butcher had any<lb></lb>thing to do with the fight, and he laughed and jeered, and encouraged the man in the cart to hit these boys—I saw Mr. Wincott in the shop—I was in the shop when he was stabbed—when the man in the cart leaped on to the pavement, and ran into the shop I ran into the shop too, for safety—I did not see the prisoner try to get in to the shop—they never came opposite the butcher's door—I saw the prisoner outside, at the door, and I heard Mr. Wincott tell the prisoner to go out of his place—I did not see the prisoner come in—I saw Mr. Wincott get a bone and hit him on the shoulder with it—I cannot tell whether it was a heavy or a light blow—I saw Mr. Wincott afterwards stabbed—I cannot say how many minutes that was after I had seen him strike the prisoner; it was afterwards—I did not go before the police Magistrate—I was living then next door but one to the butcher's, in a situation, and my mistress thought to keep me from it, if she could—I am here to-day because they brought a summons, and of course I was obliged to appear to it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> I thought you said at the time this happened you were out of a situation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but they did not come after me till last Wednesday—I was in a situation then—I did not hear of the prisoner being at the police-station—I did not follow the crowd to the station—I went in to where I was lodging; that was about five doors from the shop—I left there on 13th, I think—this took place on the 3d—this was talked of in the neighbourhood; but I thought I should not have to appear—I heard of the prisoner's being at the police-court—I did not go there to give evidence—I first mentioned what I had seen to my cousin, where I was stopping—that was in the afternoon of 3d February—I was with Mary Buckley when this happened—she was outside the door, when I was in the shop—I saw the</p>

               <p>blow struck by Mr. Wincott, it hit the prisoner on the shoulder, not on the had—I am quite sure it was on the shoulder—the prisoner's wife came to me on Saturday night—I talked this matter over with my cousin the after<lb></lb>noon it happened—I saw her again last Sunday week—she did not tell me she was coming here—we did not talk over this matter—I thought nothing of it till last Wednesday, when they came after me—I was then at my situation in Oxford-street—my cousin is not in a situation, she is in business for herself as a greengrocer in South-street—I did not see any knife—I could not swear as to who took the knife; but I heard Mr. Wincott come in and say he was stabbed—I saw no knife used—I saw that Mr. Wincott en<lb></lb>couraged the man with the bone, and that aggravated the prisoner's being a little intoxicated—I saw they meant to do no harm, but the butcher stood in the doorway jeering, and that of course aggravated the boys—I had never seen any of them before—I saw the prisoner standing against the jamb of the door—I did not see anyone pull him away, but I heard one of the butcher's men say to Mr. Wincott, "Governor, let him have it"—the butcher stood in front of me—I was behind him, in the shop.</p>

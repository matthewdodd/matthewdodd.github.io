               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How many more sons have you? A. Five. He is my second son; I have five daughters also - the eldest went out to a situation a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100109"></xptr>month or two before the prisoner absconded; the others are mere children - I did not pay the prisoner wages; I provided him with food and clothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that you allowed him and your daughter one shilling a day for their support? A. It is not true; they fared with me - I maintained the prisoner; at the time he absconded I missed property to a large amount and a cheque for 34l., in fact, property of every description: they robbed me of every thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say "they," as if others were concerned? A. I only say that from a letter written to me by my son - I had no reason to suspect he was going to leave me till he went.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you not a large stock of such articles? A. Yes - my porter has been convicted of stealing articles of this description; I have not sold rugs of exactly this pattern.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you any recollection of seeing that property about, shortly before May? A. Yes: it is a particular pattern, which I do not suppose could be got.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Do you manufacture them? A. No- it is an old pattern, which has been out of work many years; it was made expressly for me - I have not sold any of this pattern for years, and had but this one; these rugs had a shop-ticket on them.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner up on the 9th of July; he said he was very sorry, and that the porter and his wife had brought him into this trouble; this was on his being charged with stealing carpet and rugs.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was his father present? A. He was; I made him no promise or threat; the father had no private interview with him to my knowledge - he told me this at No. 50, Baldwin's-gardens: he was in a wretched plight when I took him - I do not know of his being married.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was forced to do it, for my father kept me short on Saturday, during his absence.</p>

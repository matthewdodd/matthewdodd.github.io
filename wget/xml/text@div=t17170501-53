That upon this she cried out for Help, and the Prisoner whistled, and a Man came up to her who said he would assist her, saying he was a Constable; but he rather justifying the Prisoner than assisting her, she suspected him for one of his Gang, and that when Help came he walked off. She deposed that he took from her Handkerchief and Mony. The young Woman deposed much the same, adding, that upon her crying out the Prisoner call'd her Bitch, saying he would stop her mouth presently. Mr. Gemings depos'd, That he being with his Wife not far off, heard the Outcry , and bid his Wife go to the Town to call one smith to their assistance, while he went to aid the Prosecutor. Mr. Smith deposed that he came and than they secured the Prisoner. The Prisoner gave this Account of the Matter: That there were some Friends of his that were going into the Country, by whom he sent a Letter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="171705010006"></xptr> to his Father; that after having drank together in Town they agreed to bear them company part of the Way, and went about dozen or 14 in all as far as Highgate, drinking very freely at several places, and at the Horns at Highgate, where he was sworn; That leaving their friends at Highgate they were returning to London; That there being a Woman in company that could not walk so fast as the Men, they had got before them, and a little before he met the Prosecutor he, enquiring of some Persons he met, was inform'd that his Company was but a little before, had a mind to overtake them to get them to stav while the Woman came up, and as he had her Ridinghood upon his Arm, put it on purpose to make some sport, and that being elevated with Drinking did attempt to have a little Game with the Prosecutor,&amp;c. whereupon there arose a little Scuffle, and he was seiz'd and dragg'd back to the Town, sent to New Prison and prosecutor, but took nothing from her. And as it appear'd, by those that search'd him at his Apprehention, had but Two pence Half-penny about him. The Woman that was with him testified the same as to the Circumstances of his having her Riding-hood. A great many Persons of credit appeared, who gave him a good Character of a very honest industrious Fellow: And upon the whole, it appeared to be but a dangerous drunken Frolick, and look'd as if the Prosecution was levelled at 40 l, so the Jury <rs id="t17170501-53-verdict254" type="verdictDescription">

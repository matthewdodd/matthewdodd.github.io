                  </hi>. I live at No. 75, Ann-street, Kent-street, St. George the Martyr, Southwark. The prisoner, his wife, and two children, lodged in my second-floor front room. On the 7th of Dec. be came home a short time before eight o'clock in the evening—I heard him, as I thought, breaking some wood up stairs, in his own room—I was in the room under<lb></lb>neath him—his wife and children were out—a little before nine o'clock I heard a cry of "Fire I"—he had been in the house an hour then—I and my wife got up, and ran to the street door, and there saw a mob collected—I returned into the house, ran up stairs, and saw the prisoner on the bottom stair, coming down stairs, to go out of the house—I called him an old villain, and asked him what he set my house on tire for—he made no answer—I dragged him through the passage into the street—I then held him a few minutes—one person went up stairs, endeavouring to put out the fire, called out for water, and I let go the prisoner, to carry the water up, and went into his room—the flames had been put out, and the fire was all smouldering in the room—I did not see the flames at all—I saw no fire—the stuff which had been burning there was the stuff which had formed his bed, it was all scattered about his room—it was a parcel of cleanings from hemp-dressings—three separate parts of the floor were burnt—one part of the floor was burnt half-way through—the other two places were burnt black, but not through—the face of the boards were burnt off—his bed had been cut open, and the contents strewed about the room, and burnt very much—one chair had the wooden bottom pulled off it, which was found in another part of the room—there was another chair, which he had used to work on, with leather straps across it to make a seat, as it had no bottom to it, and the leather straps were burnt off—I went in search of him afterwards, and gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a costermonger, and live in Henry-street, Kent-street. On the 7th of Dec, about ten minutes to nine o'clock at night, I heard an alarm of fire, ran out, and saw flames at the up-stairs window of the front room of Cole's house—there is only one front room—I went up stairs into the room—I saw the prisoner and Cole struggling in the passage—I passed them, and went up to the room, opened the door, and saw flames—there were five heaps of fire, one in each corner of the room, and one in the middle—there were flames from all the heaps of fire—they were all alight—there were two chairs and a round table in the middle heap of fire—one chair had the bottom out—they were placed in the stuff that was alight, and they were in a flame—I saw some hemp-dressings thrown about the room—the bed was all cut to pieces—it had been on fire as well—there was some stuffing in it—I put all the fire out, dragged it out, and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> the things down stairs—it had burnt three or four places in the boards—the two chairs and the table were burnt.</p>

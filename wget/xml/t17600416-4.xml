               <p>Q. Could you not resist her?</p>
               <p>Syms. No, I could not stir, nor loosen my arms; after that, the prisoner and the man ran away, and I never saw the man afterwards; the prisoner ran forwards, and I pursued her; I struck her several blows on the head, she ran into a watchman's arms, and he secured her in the round-house.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did she run before she was stop'd?</p>
               <p>Syms. I believe she ran about fifty yards; the next morning she was taken before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she searched in the round-house?</p>
               <p>Syms. Yes, but no money was found upon her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find your money again?</p>
               <p>Syms. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say for herself?</p>
               <p>Syms. She denied it both at the watch-house and before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your money at the time they stop'd you?</p>
               <p>Syms. I had, and am very sure the prisoner took it out.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before had you seen your money?</p>
               <p>Syms. It was not ten minutes before, that I felt it there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been in any house after you felt it there?</p>
               <p>Syms. No, I had not, neither was there anybody near me in the street, besides the prisoner and the man that held me.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person who took your money?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160005"></xptr>Syms. I am, I pursued her that very moment, and she was never out of my sight till taken.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Whether I am the girl that was taken out of a bawdy house, that was with the prosecutor?</p>
               <p>Syms. She was taken in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner in any house?</p>
               <p>Syms Yes, in that house where we had a pint of negus made; she told me it was her lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you been that day?</p>
               <p>Syms. I had been at Knightsbridge, with some graers that sell cattle in Smithfield, and I met her in Piccadily.</p>
               <p>Q. What house was it you went into with the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Syms. She said it was an acquaintance of hers, where I should be well used.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you meet with her?</p>
               <p>Syms. I met with her about half an hour after eleven at night.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you in that house with her?</p>
               <p>Syms. I believe I was with her about a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation past between you?</p>
               <p>Syms. She wanted me to go to the place where she lived, and I went along with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened when you were together?</p>
               <p>Syms. We had a pint of wine made into a negus.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in any other company besides hers?</p>
               <p>Syms. No, only the woman that brought the wine; whether she was the woman of the house, or a servant, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any man in the house?</p>
               <p>Syms. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other woman drink with you?</p>
               <p>Syms. No, she did not. I paid her for the wine and she wanted me to give her some more money.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did she give for that?</p>
               <p>Syms. She did not give me any reason for it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you together in that house?</p>
               <p>Syms. I believe not ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whose house it is?</p>
               <p>Syms. It is an officer's house.</p>
               <p>Q. In what street?</p>
               <p>Syms. In Princes-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What sign?</p>
               <p>Syms. There is nothing but a Bunch of Grapes at the door, I never saw the house before nor since.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you drunk or sober?</p>
               <p>Syms. I was sober enough to know what I was about; I can't say I was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know every thing that happened?</p>
               <p>Syms. I do; I quitted the place, being afraid to say there, and left the prisoner in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect what conversation you and the prisoner had there?</p>
               <p>Syms. We had no conversation at all, only to drink the wine together.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she know that you had money about you?</p>
               <p>Syms. She saw me take my money out of my breeches pocket, and put it into the breast pocket of my coat</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the night was it?</p>
               <p>Harper. I had just called the hour of twelve. The woman cried out, "Murder, murder, watch. murder." I went out to see what was the matter, and there was the prisoner all over gore blood bleeeing. and the man about ten yards behind her, who call'd out, "Stop thief, stop thief, she has rob'd</p>

We drank together some time, when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176004160006"></xptr> we parted, I do not know what o'clock it was. As I was making my way home, this man was behind me; he struck me first on one shoulder with his stick, and then on the other. I said, Sir, what is that for, and went to go away. Then he hit me over the head, and knock'd me down. The watch-house keeper, constable, and watchman, saw me all over bloody. The watchman assisted me, and I charged him with the man. I never saw him in my life till after he knock'd me down. I never was in a publick house with him.</p>

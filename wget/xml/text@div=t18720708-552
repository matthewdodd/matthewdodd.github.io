                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman R</hi> 177). On the morning of 12th June I was on duty in St. James's Street, New Town—I saw the prisoner standing close against the window of the St. John Street flour mill, belong<lb></lb>ing to Messrs. Andrews &amp; Co.—I was about forty yards from him—I watched him for about half a minute—I heard a smash, and went towards him—he appeared to catch sight of me, and ran round the corner of the mill, up the mews into a cart-shed, and concealed himself behind a cart—I followed him, and asked him what he was doing there, he said "Nothing"—I brought him back to the window, where he made a slight resistance—I found the putty cut away and the glass taken out—the putty was quite fresh, as though the glass had recently been put in—I called up Mr. Weiss, the manager, and took the prisoner to the police-station—I found a pocket-knife in his pocket—he gave a correct address—the prisoner said on the way to the Police Court "Have you seen my wife"—I said "Yes"—he said "I can't make out what made me go there at that time in the morning"—I also found a tablecloth in his pocket—that was given up at the Police Court—the prisoner lives at Blue Anchor Alley, Wapping—the tablecloth belonged to him—Wapping is about three or four miles from the mills.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager to Messrs. Andrews &amp; Co., millers, who carry on business at St. James's Street, Hatcham—the prisoner was in their employment on 11th June, and had been for several weeks—he was too late for his train that night from the Old Kent Road, and I drove him down to the New Cross Station, in order that he might go to his home—I next saw</p>

               <p>him in the hands of the constable, about 2.30 in the morning—I was awoke by a knock at the door, and on looking out of the window I saw the con<lb></lb>stable with the prisoner in charge—I came down and saw the window broken and part of the glass was on the ground—the putty looked as fresh as if something had been done to soften it—I can't account for that—we have had no window put in since Christmas last—the safe containing money and valuables was in the office, and also the keys of the premises—the office leads to the mill—the prisoner knew what was in the office—we used to keep a dog in the yard, but he was missing several days before, and I gave notice to the police in consequence.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoners Defence.</hi> I went down with the manager to the New Cross Station. I was too late for the train, and went to have some beer, and got too late for the other train. I went and had some more beer, and got too late for any train at all, and I went back to the mills thinking to go and lie down there till 6 o'clock, which was the time to go to work.</p>

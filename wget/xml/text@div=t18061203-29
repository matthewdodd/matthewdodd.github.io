On the 22nd of November I assisted him in loading of ten sacks of split beans; he was to go with them to No. 48, Blackman street in the Borough; there were nine sacks of Mr. Holdings and one sack of mine which he was to bring back, he brought back the empty sack, I sent him there and I thought he had delivered the whole; I received information from Mr. Holding what the prisoner had been at. I know no more than taxing him about not leaving them; he said just as he unloaded the cart there came a man up to the cart with a sack of barley meal, he asked him to carry it somewhere and he did, and in York street in the Borough he took it off and gave him a glass of gin. I was not satisfied with that.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Holding, No. 48, Blackman street, he is a corn chandler. On the 22nd of November the prisoner at the bar delivered me a note of ten sacks, I shewed him where to stack them in the granary; he had another man with him, they began stacking the ten sacks; I was called out to serve in the shop, and during the time I was in the shop he and the other man that was with him took a sack from off the bulk and put it in the bulk they were making up; they were four bushel sacks they were bringing in, and this this one they took off the bulk was five bushels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them take it off the pile. - A. No, I was in the shop; directly I was done serving in the shop I got up in the cart and went to pull the sack from the top of the cart, he said it was not mine; a little while afterwards our man came in, he found a five bushel sack of split beans had been taken away from the bulk and removed to the sacks he had brought in; I saw the sack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley.</p>
               <p>Q. He brought you a ticket of ten sacks, and you thought you had ten; you have told us that they removed a sack from the bulk, that you did not observe to be done by the prisoner, there was another man with him. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they drove off with the sack in the cart. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the Borough. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that this tenth sack was never out of the cart. - A. It never was.</p>
               <p>Court. You never saw the cart go towards London bridge. - A. No.</p>

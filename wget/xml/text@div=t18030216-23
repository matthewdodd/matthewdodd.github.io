               <p>ROBERT BUNN sworn. - I am servant to the last witness: On Friday the 4th of February, a little after ten o'clock, a man gave an alarm, that a man had taken a bundle of shovels from the door; I went after him, the man said, he was gone over the bridge; I went over the bridge, and came in sight of him, he was running; he turned round to see if any body was after him; I said, I'll have you, and immediately he let the shovels drop; I did not stay to pick them up, but went after him; I was told that he had run up a yard, into a wheelwright's shop; my master came after me, and bid me go back, a man had picked up the shovels and gave them to me as I came back; they were tied up as they are now, when he dropped them; they were taken from the outside of the door, in the street; there were a great many more at the door, but none so black as these; I can say, with certainly, that these are the shovels that were taken away; my master's name is upon them, and I marked them when I brought them back; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180302160017"></xptr>his face when he looked back, he had a smockfrock on; I am perfectly sure that the prisoner is the man that dropped the shovels.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Lesley.) Were these articles at your door? - A. Yes; I did not miss them at that time, the shovels were brought to me, and I knew them directly.</p>

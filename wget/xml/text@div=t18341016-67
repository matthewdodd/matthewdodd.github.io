               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is it uncommon to try a coat on at a sale-room? A. It is a common thing - the part where the coat hung was not darker than the part nearer the door - it was about the same light - there is a sky-light at the back, and he was near the skylight, adjusting the coat - he went out of the shop - I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183410160045"></xptr>him go out - he returned in five or seven minutes - I was there looking at furniture - the coat appeared to fit him - he took off his own coat - that was down by the side of him- he did not take that out with him - I did not see him hold up the tail of the coat, to look at the colour, as he went towards the door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was his own coat an old one? A. It was.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Johnson. My attention was attracted to the prisoner by Mr. Abell, and I went after him - I came up with the prisoner in White Hart-court, Lombard-street, and Gracechurch-street - I saw him cutting the ticket off the coat, which had my handwriting on it - I took him into custody, seeing the ticket in his hand cutting it off - I told him what I took him for - he said he was going to bring it back - I said that was very likely - I am an officer - I searched him, and found no money on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you ever given a different account of this? A. Never - I never said I took him with the coat at the door of my master's sale-room - I took him with it on his back in White Hart-court, fifty, sixty, or seventy yards from master's - it may be one hundred - I never stated that I saw him standing at the office door of the sale-room - I do not know Hewick, or any such name - I have had no conversation with any person on the subject - it is not uncommon to try clothes on - I told the Lord Mayor I saw him cutting off the ticket.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Johnson. In consequence of the alarm I ran out, and went down White Hart-court - I saw the prisoner looking back to see if anybody was pursuing him - when he saw me be ran - I came up with him in Lombard-street, and there met Cope, who took him into custody, and brought him to Gracechurch-street - he said he was going to bring the coat back if we had let him alone - the coat may be worth two guineas.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the coat he now has on the one he had on in the sale-room? A. Yes; it was given to me in the sale-room, and I took it to him at the Mansion-house.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will consider the situation I am placed in - I pledge my word I had no idea of committing a felony - as to the witness taking me in the court it is entirely false - I was taken at the door with the coat on, and was returning with it - I went for the sole purpose of looking at the texture of the cloth, being a tailor by trade - this man came and accused me of intending to steal it - I denied it, and in consequence of that he took me to the Mansion-house - it is not very likely I should have taken the coat and left the one I have on - the difference between the two is not sufficient to cause me to commit the act - when you have heard my witnesses you will believe it not possible I should so far have lent myself to commit such offences - I have a wife and family.</p>

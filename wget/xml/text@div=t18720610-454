On 2nd June, about 4.30 in the morning, I was going down a mews at the back of Lyon Terrace, Seven Sisters' Road, and discovered the prisoner in the act of putting down the kitchen window of 3, Lyon Terrace—I am quite sure he is the man—it was quite daylight—I could see his features distinctly—he immediately left the window and ran the way I was—I went towards the house and saw another man looking over the garden wall, I also saw another man on the wall—I gave chase over several walls, the prisoner took to the fields—with the assistance of Waltham I chased and captured him, the other two got away—I found on the prisoner some matches, a comb, a key, and a pocket-knife—the matches corresponded with some that were found in the house.</p>

I am servant to Mr. William Paton, of 3, Lyon Terrace—on Saturday night, about 10.15, I went to bed—I shut down the kitchen window, drew down the blind, and closed the shutters and barred them—next morning I was called up by the police and found the window open, and the shutters thrown back—I had a box of lucifers that night on the kitchen mantel-piece, three-parts full, and in the morning I found it on the side cupboard, and the matches strewed about the kitchen—these umbrellas belong to my master.</p>

            : On Saturday, the 2d of October, the two prisoners came in from dinner; I removed a shutter, behind which I found some copper concealed in a bag; I had observed the prisoner Cotmore there; in the afternoon I observed him come up again, and Seymour after him; I had concealed myself; Seymour then asked where it was; Cotmore said, it is safe enough, it is behind the shutter; he then moved the shutter and went away; I remained in my station till six in the evening, when Seymour came close to where the copper was deposited; he took up the bag and put it up to his bosom, under his jacket; I waited the space of ten minutes and then my young master came up; they had both worked for Mr. Govey about two years.</p>

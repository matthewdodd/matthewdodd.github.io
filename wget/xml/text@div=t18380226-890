                  </hi>. I am single. I have a little property of my own, and am supported by my friends—I have known the prisoner about eight months—on the 1st of March I met her, by the Spanish Groom, at Greenwich—I had not seen her before for six weeks—she has been a ser<lb></lb>vant—we spoke together, and she asked me to go to the Buffalo's Head, and have a glass of rum, which I did, and then we went to the corner—it was then between eleven and twelve o'clock at night—I was standing near the corner of where I live, as I had had a few words with my landlady—I did not like to go in—the prisoner had had a glass of rum, and so had I—I turned to go home, and I felt her hand at my shoulder—I had no sus<lb></lb>picion of her—I put my hand to pull up my shawl—she crossed the road, and I went to go home—I felt cold, and I then missed my shawl—I looked on the ground, thinking I had dropped it, but I had not—a police<lb></lb>man came up, and I told him I suspected Ann Page had it—he went and took her—I had not lent her my shawl.</p>

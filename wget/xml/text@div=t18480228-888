                  </hi> Early on the morning of 5th Feb. I met Romaine, and accompanied her to her dwelling, somewhere in the neighbourhood of Judd-street, went to bed, and almost immediately went to sleep—I awoke several hours after, and found she was gone—I searched my pockets, and found them emptied of their contents—I went and gave information at the station-house—an officer accompanied me back to the house—we searched, and found nothing—left my address at the station, and in the evening a policeman came to me, and I went to the station-house and there identified Romaine, and saw a knife, which was my property, and which I had in my possession when I accompanied her to the house—I lost 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sovereigns, half-sovereigns, and silver—it was loose in my pocket—I had no purse.</p>

I was at the station when the pri<lb></lb>soners were brought there on 5th Feb—Romaine said they had been at a public-house together, that she felt sleepy, the money dropped from her hand, and he picked it up—Bishop produced a clasp knife, and he gave up a pen<lb></lb>knife and 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—he said that was all he had—after I had threat<lb></lb>ened to poke a ruller down his throat, he produced a sovereign from his mouth—Romaine said the two sovereigns had been given her by a gentleman, but she did not know whether he was at home then—she had left about one o'clock—when the penknife was produced she said, "That is mone; cannot I have it?"—I said, "How long have you had it?"—she said, "Not long; it was given me yesterday by a young man"—she again asked for it, and I said, "No; you can't have it"—I asked if she had any more money—she held out her hand and said, "A penny"—she was afterwards searched, and the searcher brought me 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as found as her—Mr. Williams afterwards came to the station-house and identified her and the knife—some one said two sovereigns were taken—she said there was another in his mouth, and Bishop said, with an oath, "There is not; we changed one at a public-house"—she replied, "Well, I believe he did," and the amount of silver accounted for that—18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of the silver was taken from his fob—the other appeared more ready to be got at.</p>

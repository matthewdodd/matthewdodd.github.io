On the night of the 3rd of August, I counted forty trusses of hay, on his farm, at half-past seven o'clock, and at half-past three o'clock the next morning I missed one truss which I tracked - the policeman gave me some information - I went to the prisoner, at Nuttingdale, I found three quarters of a truss of hay in his cart, which I know to be Mr. Coton's; I said, it was my master's; the prisoner said nothing to me, but told the policeman that he bought it for 1s. 6d. and a pint of beer; I found some hay, (about two handfuls,) in a track, about forty yards from the rick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALESBY. Q. Where had the forty trusses been? A. In the rick-yard by the side of the rick; what I picked up was not in the road but in the meadow - the trusses of hay all weighed 56lbs - two handfuls of hay would not make a quarter of a truss - we reckoned our hay at 2s. 3d. a truss - I do not know whether any was sold for less; it was about four o'clock in the morning I saw it at the prisoner's shed, any one might see it.</p>

            . I had forty trusses of hay there, as I was informed - I had sold some at 2s. 3d. a truss, to Mr. Wright, but I consider this is worth more than that; I have no doubt this is mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know it? A. By the growth of it; this is a sample from the bulk, and this is the hay found at the prisoner's - they appear to be the same growth, and have small clover among them.</p>

             (police-sergeant T 2). On the morning of the 3rd of August I went with Buller to the prisoner's premises - we found the hay there, the prisoner said he had bought it in the Edgware-road, on the night before, for 1s. 6d. and a pint of beer, of a countryman, whom he did not know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where is Welling? A. He has now left the police - he was with me at the time; the hay was in a cart, in a shed, at the prisoner's - I had not seen the prisoner about the hay-rick.</p>

            . I am in the prosecutor's employ, as a haybinder. On the 3rd of August I cut and packed forty trusses, and left them on his premises - I am sure that this hay found on the prisoner's premises is Mr. Coton's - it is hard coarse hay; this is a band which I made.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is there anything particular in your haybands? A. I make them about eighteen-inches- I can swear this is one of my hands - I cannot say that no other person could have made such an one.</p>
               <p>BRIERS BULLEN re-examined. Q. How many places did you see the hay scattered in? A. In four or five; it was in a meadow, fenced all round, and no foot path in it; it was not in the road from the rick to the prisoner's house - I should not have gone to the prisoner's; but Welling, the policeman met me, and told me something - there were some foot marks on the dew, but I did not compare them with any shoes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought it for 1s. 6d. and a pint of beer, the patrol saw me and went home to see if it was right - if I had known it had been stolen I would have taken it away.</p>

I borrowed the money upon the shares at the very full market value, in 1864. Those shares, with twenty-five others, went into the hands of the gentleman to whom I have referred, who is a large merchant in London, and whom I can call; but I decline to give his name. I have only been a nominee. Since then they were renewed in my name at the bank. At that time the banks were failing almost every day, and the value of the shares, upon which 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had been paid, had gene down, the market value being 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.

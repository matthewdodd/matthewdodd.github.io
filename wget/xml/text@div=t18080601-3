               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed. - A. Not till one o'clock; I fastened the door myself, it was fastened in every respect; I was the last person that was up in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. In what state did you find it in the morning. - A. The maid was up first in the morning, she saw a reflection of light through the shop door; in consequence of that she came up to my room door and informed me that the shop had been broken open; it was about five o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light then. - A. Quite light. I immediately came down and saw that the door was left upon the latch and that it had been cut by boring a number of small holes with a common gimblet in one of the pannels of the door; after they got the piece out they could put their hand in and unscrew the iron bar; after that they took down the half shutter and took out one of the squares of glass in the shop door; the squares are very large; it appeared that they got in at one of the squares; after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180806010005"></xptr>which the shutters had been put up again, and a piece of paper of the colour of the door, was pasted upon the hole of the door, and the gimblet that they had bored the holes with, they tied the lock back with it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you miss. - A. I missed twenty pieces of Irish linen, value sixty pounds, about five hundred yards of printed cotton, value fifty pounds, and two wrappers full of my best muslins, figured and plain, about the value of thirty pounds; they were taken from three shelves, which were empty in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more. - A. On Thursday morning the 7th of April, I received a letter by the post; I went to Worship-street and shewed the letter to the magistrate; I had a warrant to search the prisoner's house, No. 45, Seward street, Brick-lane, St. Luke's; I went there in company with three officers on that same Thursday; we went first into the parlour even with the shop; in a chest of drawers, which was in the parlour, we found a piece of muslin. This is the piece of muslin; we found nothing else belonging to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that yours. - A. From the texture of it, the breadth, the quantity, and the situation in which it was placed, and missing it the next morning, I believe it to be mine; it had a fag end on it then, it has not now; the private mark and the fag end has been cut off. I cannot swear to it; I have not any doubt that it is mine; it is worth about ten shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. I understand you to say, that when you discovered your house to be broken open, it was at five o'clock in the morning. - A. Yes; it was day light.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a great deal of force used with respect to this house of yours - there must be a good many more persons than one. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The gimblet being used, the pannel taken out, and the paper stuck upon the hole; I take it for granted you think there were more persons than one. - A. Yes; it must have taken a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. The way they got in was through a pane of glass, do you think it likely that a woman was doing this. - A. I do not pretend to say it is.</p>
               <p>Q. What size was the pane of glass. - A. I never took the dimensions exactly, it was large; I suppose about fourteen inches in width, and eighteen or twenty in length, too the best of my recollection; the whole square of glass was taken out, any moderate size person could get in.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you enquired whether this woman is a married woman or no. - A. We asked for her husband when we went to the house; we went to the house for the purpose of seeing her husband, and searching the house; I did not see the husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear that upon a conviction of a burglary there was a forty pounds reward. - A. I have heard of it for trials in the city; I did not know there was for the county, it was not for that.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street office. In consequence of this warrant; I went to the house of Mrs. Eversall on the 7th of April; I saw Mrs. Eversall, I asked her if her husband was at home; Bishop, Kennedy, and Mr. Rutter were in company with me: she answered that her husband was not at home; there was some other woman in the house besides her; I told her that I had a warrant to search the house. I read the warrant, and then asked her if she had any goods in the house answering that description; she answered no; we then proceeded to search a back room behind the shop. In a draw of a chest of drawers, we found this piece of muslin; she said, she had bought it, but she did not know from whom; we searched different parts of the house, we found nothing more that belonged to this robbery; in searching up stairs, behind a chest of drawers we found a small piece of paper covered with dust; I took it out, I asked Mrs. Eversall what that paper contained; she said garden seed; I opened it before her, and found it contained bank notes to the amount of two hundred pounds and upwards; she then said it belonged to her husband, she knew her husband had a private plant; but she did not know where it was, nor to what amount these notes were I brought away; I knew there had been notes of that kind advertised; I could not find the owner of them. I produce them. I went a day or two after to the prosecutor's house, and saw the way the entry was made; there were holes bored in a square form with a small gimblet, and then it was cut by a knife; after the piece was taken out the hole was about as big as your arm; it was to undo the fastening.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not it appear to be the work of some man instead of a woman. - A. Yes; they do it that way, because if they are taken, they suppose a gimblet would not be considered as an instrument of house breaking.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how the woman came to be indicted. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You speak very sensible - it seems that you think a woman could not do this. - A. I do not believe it was done by a woman. Bishop found some pick-lock-keys.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you think she was the receiver more than the thief. - A. I have no doubt of that.</p>

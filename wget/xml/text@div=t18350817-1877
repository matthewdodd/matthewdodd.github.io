                  </hi>. I live in Goswell-street-road. On the 12th of August, I went to the Metropolitan baths at seven o'clock in the morning—I saw the prisoner Rice there—I paid him, and then I un<lb></lb>dressed and bathed—when I went away, I missed my watch—I went back, and saw Peck—I told him I had lost my watch—he advised me to look round the baths for it—which we did, but could not find it—we then went into the next room, where Rice was—he came and looked, but could not find it—Peck then asked my address, and the number of my watch, which I gave him—he said a number of valueable things were left there, and they kept a book to enter them in—I said if they delivered me my watch, I would give 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.,—I went home, and returned in about an hour—I asked Rice if he had found it—he said he did not know, he would en<lb></lb>quire—he opened a door, and called Peck—who said they had not found it—I repeated the reward, and left—a friend advised me to take a police<lb></lb>man, which I did at five in the evening—I then saw Rice—I told him I was the person who had lost the watch in the morning—he said he knew I was—the policeman then asked if Mr. Peck was in—he said he was not, he was gone to the City—the policeman then saig he should take him into custody—he said he need not do that, for he had watch, and produced it from a drawer.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman of the Church of England—in November last, when I was curate of Woodchurch, Birkenhead, I saw this advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>: ("<hi rend="italic">Advowsons for sale, with immediate legal possession; one for</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Principals only, may direct, Zeta, Bedford's</hi>, 8, <hi rend="italic">Sloane-street</hi>, S. W") At that time I was wishing to purchase the advowson of a small living about 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I wrote an answer to the advertisement, and received this letter in reply, which I believe to be in the prisoner's writing: (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi>, 22<hi rend="italic">nd November</hi>, 1862, 15, <hi rend="italic">Hans-place, Belgrave-square, and signed George Turner. It stated that the property belonged to a friend of the writers, and was in Northampton shire, about two miles from a market town. Rent charge and glebe</hi>, 275<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">endowment</hi>, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; <hi rend="italic">rates and taxes</hi>, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Price, with immediate legal possession</hi>, 2,800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">without a house, or</hi> 3,400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">the vendor building one forthwith; that there were many applications, but that the writer would meet Mr. Cox at the station, to show him the place, on payment of railway fare, and one guinea for time; and, if this did not suit, to let the writer know, who, as an old Cantab, now and then heard of such property.</hi>) I am a M. A. of Trinity College, Cambridge—I wrote this answer to it (<hi rend="italic">This was addressed to the prisoner, stating that Mr. Cox did not wish to lay out so much, and inquiring whether his client would take less</hi>). In answer to that I received this letter, which is in the prisoner's writing. (<hi rend="italic">This requested Mr. Cox to make an offer, but stated that</hi> 2,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">had been refused, and gave the name, in confidence, as Hardwicke, near Wellingborough, Northampton<lb></lb>shire.</hi>) This is my reply. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 26<hi rend="italic">th November, requesting to know whether there was a suitable piece of glebe for a house. To this there was a reply from the prisoner, stating that it would be absolutely necessary for him to meet Mr. Cox, to show him the place and give him information, without making the whole matter known, but that the guinea should be returned if Mr. Cox bought the advowson, and that he would point out a piece of glebe present<lb></lb>ing a capital site for building, and explain how</hi> 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">might be saved</hi>). There are one or two other letters, arranging the time of meeting, and on 3d December I went down to Wellingborough with Mr. Bowring, a friend of mine—we met the prisoner at the station, and he took us to the Hyde Hotel there—we had some refreshment—he said that that was the principal hotel in the place, and the people seemed to know him very well—we then walked to Hardwicke together, two miles and a half, accompanied by Mr. Bowring—the prisoner pointed out the various pieces of glebe land belonging to it—then he went to a cottage in a very dilapidated state, which he said was the only house on the glebe; where a labourer and his wife lived, and where the key of the church was kept—he appeared to be very well known there—he procured the key, and took us into the church, and showed us all over it—I said, "I see by the <hi rend="italic">Clergy List</hi> that this advowson belongs to the heirs of a Mr. Hughes"—the prisoner said, "Yes, it has appeared so for years, but it is now vested in one person; it has never been altered"—I asked him the name—he said that he was not privileged to give it, but it was a great friend of his—he also said that the present rector, Mr. Greenway, was a great friend of his; he had known him for years—I said, "Then you only</p>

               <p>have the absolute power to dispose of this property?"—he said, "Yes; I only have the power to dispose of it"—nothing was said to me at that time about a deposit—I left it in Mr. Bowring's hands, and Messrs. Simpson and Taylor's, my solicitors—the prisoner gave me this memorandum—I find my endorsement upon it. (<hi rend="italic">This was a calculation of the particulars of the living, producing</hi> 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">net</hi>). After that I still continued my inclina<lb></lb>tion to buy it, and received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1862, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to Mr. Bowring, stating that the prisoner was empowered by his client to close with Mr. Cox at</hi> 2,625<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and pay him</hi> 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for the repairs of the chancel; that a draft of agreement was enclosed, with a request that it might be approved and returned at once, as the prisoner was going into Devon<lb></lb>shire.</hi>) This letter was written to Mr. Bowring, and forwarded by him to me. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th December</hi>, 1862, <hi rend="italic">from the prisoner to Mr. Bowring, stating that he could not consent to the deposit being paid into a bank in joint names, as on a former occasion it had led to trouble and expense, but that the prisoner had no objection to make the deposit</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">instead of</hi> 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">if paid into his own hands</hi>). Mr. Bowring and my solicitors, Simpson and Taylor, managed the matter for me after my visit, and it was by my directions that the 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid as a deposit—I was induced to direct it to be paid because the agreement was sent to me by my solicitor, who said that he believed it to be quite correct—I parted with the money because I believed Mr. Wilson to be the real owner of the advowson—this is my signature to the agreement—I signed it, believing Mr. Wilson to be the owner, and that the prisoner had the right to deal with it for him—I had not heard of James Wilson before I received the agreement—I should say that this sig<lb></lb>nature, "James Wilson," to the agreement, is the prisoner's writing, and the attestation, "George Turner," also—I have not been able to discover any James Wilson—when the agreement was signed I could not get the matter completed—there were various excuses made to me, not to Mr. Bowring; sometimes he was going to see a dying friend, and sometimes he was on the Continent—I have never got the title completed, or got back my 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after these matters had gone on some time, I handed the matter over to Mr. Leach, who is very well known in Derby in criminal matters, with instruc<lb></lb>tions to sift the matter.</p>

RIBTON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you had any experience in the purchase of advowsons? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Some little experience—I believe there are persons who are in communication with the real vendors, who act as agents between the vendor and the vendee—I do not know them as "middle men"—there are often parties who act as go-betweens, to conceal the name of the name of the principal, I believe—if they disclosed the name of the principals, the two principals might come together and the agent would be ousted of his profits—I dare say that is the object of concealing it—I dealt with the prisoner as the agent—I believe there is a clause in the agreement that thirty days is to be allowed to complete the title—I should not object to it being known that I was purchasing an advowson; some clergymen do, but I think it is very foolish—a clergyman, I believe, cannot purchase the next presentation for himself; it would be a simoniacal contract—matters went on from 15th December, till I sent up Mr. Leech on 26th March; during which time letters passed between me and the prisoner and between Mr. Bowring and the prisoner, and various excuses were made by the prisoner—he was taken in custody when they could get him, which was a long time afterwards—I afterwards received this letter.

                  <hi rend="italic">stated the prisoner's regret at the result of the treaty, but that it was not his fault, for he had spared no trouble or expense to insure Mr. Cox's wishes; but that at the last moment Messrs.

I am a wine merchant living at Derby, in partner<lb></lb>ship with Mr. Cox, the prosecutor's uncle—in November or the beginning of December, in consequence of a conversation I had with the prosecutor, I went down to Welling borough, and met the prisoner there—we three walked together to Hardwicke, and looked the church over—the prisoner spoke to me, as Mr. Cox's friend, about the price of the living—he said that there must be a deposit of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he had power to sell for the owner, and it was entirely in his hands; there was only himself—the draft agreement was sent to me by the prisoner—I received it on 6th December, and handed it to Messrs. Simpson and Fowler on, I think, the same day—the prisoner pointed out the piece of glebe, and exhibited perfect familiarity with the spot, and where he could get the building stone from.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Mr. Gamble, as solicitors, at Derby—prior to 24th March, this matter was placed in my hands by Messrs. Simpson and Taylor, and I came to London and waited on the prisoner on 26th March, at his house in Hans-place—he was at first denied, but I even<lb></lb>tually procured admission, and saw him, I believe—I gave him a letter of introduction from Simpson and Taylor to the effect that they had deputed me to take up the matter—he said that great delay had arisen in conse<lb></lb>quence of numerous obstacles in respect of title and so on, but they were all removed—I said that a general assertion of that kind would not be satisfactory, I must know distinctly and specifically how the matter stood, and as nearly as I can recollect, he said that Mr. James Wilson, of Clapham<lb></lb>common, was a client and personal friend of his; that he, for Mr. Wilson, had purchased the advowson from Messrs. Craddock and Shelley, of Nun<lb></lb>caton, for a nephew of Mr. Wilson's, but the nephew had changed his mind, and was going into the Army instead of the Church; hence the reason of Mr. Wilson seeking to sell the advowson—I asked him if it had been conveyed to Mr. Wilson—he said, "It has not, but I hold a contract with Mr. Wilson, and he has paid a deposit of 235<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but Mr. Shelley has taken a personal dislike to me, and refuses to go on with the matter. I then employed Mr. Cook, of Wellingborough, a solicitor, to endeavour to carry the matter out, but Craddock and Shelley detected that he was acting for mo, and refused to have any dealings with him; I then put myself in communication with Mr. Dawson, a clerical agent, at Malvern Link, and instructed him to effect a new contract with Craddock and Shelley"—I think he said that Mr. Dawson was a clergyman—he said, "Dawson has told them that he wants the living for himself, and that draft of the contract was drawn;" showing me one between the trustees of the living and Mr. Dawson—I asked him what security he had for Mr. Dawson making over the living to Mr. Cox, in case he became the purchaser—he said, "I have not any"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is the document he showed me, and he showed me at the same time a letter of Messrs. Vallance and Lewis—I said, "Why have you not filed a bill or done something to compel a specific performance of Mr. Wilson's contract with Craddock and Shelley," and I said that it seemed strange that he was opening negociations with new people—he said, "The course I am taking will cause the least delay"—I said, "The matter has assumed quite a new phase;" I had believed that Mr. Wilson was the real owner of this living, but under the circumstances you have related I shall advise Mr. Cox to have no more to do with the matter, and I may as well ask you at once whether you are prepared to return Mr. Cox's deposit of 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or to deposit it in a bank in your name and my own"—he said, "I cannot do either, for I have already paid Messrs.

                  </hi>. I was in partnership with Mr. Craddock, a solicitor, of Nuneaton, at the time of this matter, and was acting as solicitor to the proprietors of the living—the assignees are Mr. C. T. Monk, the bar<lb></lb>rister (not the Q. C.); Mr. Daniel, Q. C.; one of the co-heiresses, and a Mr. Mahon, of Paisley—I know there is no Mr. Wilson who has anything to do with it—I acted as solicitor for all those gentlemen—everything that was done came through my office; nobody else had any power to act—I have never given power to John Wilson or anybody—I became acquainted with the prisoner in September, 1862—I advertised the living for sale, and re<lb></lb>ceived this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Mr. Turner, dated 9th September, applying for particulars—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was signed "George Turner" and stated</hi>;—"I am seeking to buy such a property for a client, and if it is, as you say, in a healthy locality, we shall have no difficulty if you will give me the par<lb></lb>ticulars")—I sent him the particulars on the 12th, but the letter was lost at the police-court—I have a copy of it—it describes the place, the population, and the income, and states the price to be 2, 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 18th September I received this letter from Mr. Turner—(<hi rend="italic">This applied for the refusal till Monday, and stated that he would go and see it on Saturday morning, and requested to be informed by telegram to whom to apply</hi>)—I sent a telegram, as requested, replying to it, and referring him to Mr. Archibald Sharman, a farmer, residing in the parish of Hardwick—on 22d September I received this letter—(<hi rend="italic">This was signed "George Turner."

Yours truly, Craddock and Shelley."—it was after that I saw Mr. Cook; I have made a mistake in the date, I have no memorandum of it—it was a few days after that letter that I told Mr. Cook I suspected he was the agent of Mr. Turner—I recollect the commencement of the negociation with the Rev.

                  </hi>. I am a licensed victualler, and keep the Duchess of Kent public-house, in Deverell-street, Dover-road, in the parish of St. Mary, Newington. On Saturday, the 1st of Nov., about seven or eight o'clock in the evening, I went out into the back yard and found my back gate open, which was a very unusual thing, as it was not an entrance for customers, but merely a private back gate—I went back to the bar, got the key and double-locked the gate to secure it—that was as near twenty-five minutes or half-past seven as possible—I went up stairs to get an apron, unlocked my bed-room door, and found the window wide open, and the dwarf-blinds also—I looked out the window, and found the large looking-glass gone from the dressing-table, and put outside on the leads—I searched the bed-room</p>

On Saturday evening, the 1st of Nov., I was coming from my work, and passed Mr. South's house about a quarter after seven o'clock—I left my work about ten minutes after seven—as I passed Mr. South's house I saw the prisoner Phillips come out of Mr. South's back gate, in Bland-street, carrying a bundle in both his hands—he went up Bland-street—I was on the same side of the way as he was, on the board near to him—I was going the same way as he was—he ran, and turned the corner of Great Bland-street—I saw him by the gaslight when he came to the corner—I saw him stand at the corner of the street, and then he ran, and passed along the Dover-road as fast as be could—I saw him again on the Tuesday following at Mr. South's, in the tap-room—no one was with me—there were two or three others in the tap-room bedsides Phillips—I recognised him immediately—I told the police<lb></lb>man I recognised him—I have no doubt of his being the man I saw that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prisoner's sister—I remember the 1st of Nov.—I was at my brother's house that evening, from six till nine o'clock—Mrs. Darke was there, Mr. Partloe and my brother—I did not go away at nine—my brother did not go out during that time—I remember the day particularly—I remember Mrs. Darke coming—I was standing at the back part of the shop some part of the time while Partloe was there, and part of the time I was at the door—I am sure my brother was there from six till nine.</p>

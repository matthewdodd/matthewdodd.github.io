             was going by my gate with a hive of bees; I ran after him to his father's house, I asked his father if he was at home; he said he was not. I went to Mr. Weedon's at Harefield; he came with me to his father's house; there we found another hive, and four ducks and two fowls; they were dead and in their feathers. We waited about his father's house all night for his coming home. Monday morning about six o'clock, he came home; we took him to the public house, and there he owned where he took the bees from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know these fowls. - A. No; he did not say any thing about the fowls till he came before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. What he said before the magistrate was put in writing. - A. It was.</p>

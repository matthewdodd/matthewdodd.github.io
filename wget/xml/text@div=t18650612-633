                  </hi>. I am thirteen years old, and on 13th May was employed by Messrs. Joseph and Philip Lewey, of 7, Devonshire-street, Bishopsgate-street—on that day, about twenty-five minutes past 2, I was in London Wall—I had with me two parcels, containing 1,000 cigars each, and 7 lbs. of tobacco, which I was taking from Mr. Wills, of Long Acre, to my master's—as I went along I met the prisoner, who said, "My boy, what is the time?" I told him twenty-five minutes past 2—he said, "Don't you work in Fore-street?"—I said, "No, I work at Mr. Lewey's, 7, Devonshire-street"—he said, "I have just come from there, I have taken the same as those goods before, and 1 have to come all the way back to bring these things back again that you have got, because I took them before, when you were gone"—he also said, "I am Mr. Henry Wills; give me those things, and tell Mr. Lewey to send the last two invoices he had, because I can't make up my books without them"—he said, "Run quick, how long will you be?"—I said, "About twenty minutes," and I left—I gave him the cigars and the tobacco because he said he was Mr. Henry Wills—I believed that—he went up London Wall and I went down—I saw him again on the Tuesday after at Bow-street station, in the dock—I am quite sure he was the same man.</p>

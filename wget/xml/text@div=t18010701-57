               <p>MRS. APPLETON sworn. - I am the wife of the last witness: On the 24th of April, the prisoner came into the house about eleven in the morning; her daughter did live servant with us; she came to the side of the bar; I saw her take the pot; I watched her, for I had a suspicion of her; I called to Mr. Appleton, and he went after her, and brought her back, she had the quart pot under her cloak.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I went after the prisoner, in consequence of the information of my wife; I came up with her opposite the White-horse yard, and brought her back with the pot; I delivered it to the constable.</p>
               <p>(The constable produced the pot which was identified by Mr. Appleton.)</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she was taken up in the middle of April last, and no bill being found was discharged by proclamation, and returned her prosecutor thanks accordingly; but that as she was taking leave of her daughter, who was going to a creditable place, the was again taken up by the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>To the Prosecutor. Q. How came you not to follow up this prosecution in April last? - A. I came to Mr. Shelton's Office to give instroctions for a bill, and I was informed that it I came on Friday morning, I should be in time; and when I came, the Grand Jury were discharged; I applied to Mr. Humphrey's the attorney, and he advised me to come to the court, and make an affidavit of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzpatrick. They were about to move the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180107010059"></xptr>court upon affidavit, and I think I myself suggested gested that they must take her up again, and prefer a bill. <rs id="t18010701-57-verdict312" type="verdictDescription">

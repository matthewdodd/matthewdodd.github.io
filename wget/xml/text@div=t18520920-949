                  </hi>. I live in Turner-street, Shadwell. I was going home on the morning of 22nd of September—the prisoner offered to show me my way home—I knew my way, and did not want his assistance—there was another one with him—I went on my way—it was between 12 and 1 o'clock—when I came to a dark place, the prisoner seized me, and tripped me up; he said, <hi rend="italic">"Charley, fork it; fork it!"</hi>—he got hold of my watch, but I got his head down—he could not get my watch—the chain was too strong.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 162). I heard a cry of "Police!" between 12 and 1 o'clock, I went up and found the prosecutor who had hold of the prisoner—the prosecutor's watch was hanging out—I took the prisoner into custody—the prosecutor told me what had happened—the prisoner said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> This policeman said that he knew me to be in company with thieves. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I have known him to be in company with thieves every night—he was sober—I have been on duty in Rosemary-lane, on and off about four years—I knew him twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> This prosecutor asked me to show him the way to Shadwell; he made use of bad language, and assaulted me with his umbrella; I had the mark on my face; as to trying to take anything from him, I did not; I have been a month in charge of a lodging house; I told the policeman if he would go to the gentleman I pay the rent to, he would satisfy him; he told me I was a liar; as to his knowing me in company with thieves, it is utterly false.</p>

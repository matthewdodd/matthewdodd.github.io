               <p>Q. When you brought her back, what did she say? - A. She said she never did a wrong thing in her life before; I am not quite sure whether she used the word before. I sent for the headborough.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gleed. Q. Between eight and nine is a very busy time? - A. Yes. we had a number of customers in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How far might your position be from the shop door? - A. Three yards and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Persons standing at the door, you could not see when they were stooping, at that distance, what they were doing; you were busy; it might be an act of picking up, instead of putting something down; had you any steps? - A. Two steps to go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore of course from the descent you could not see the level of the street? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent indeed; as I went into the shop I saw a woman coming out; the shop was full of people; there were as many as eight or ten people, and they said I was not the woman; there were hundreds of people round the watch-house, crying out, shame on him, and said they would come if they were wanted.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave her a good character.</p>

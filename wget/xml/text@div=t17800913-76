I was drinking in company with the gentlewoman at the bar some time last month. I was coming by her house, at Bluefields, she was sitting at the window. She asked me to come in. I staid there, I believe, about half an hour; then we went to the King's Arms in Sun Tavern-fields; we staid there about an hour; from thence we went to the halfway-house; we staid there about half an hour; from thence we went to the <placeName id="t17800913-76-crimeloc440">Three Cranes at Mile-end</placeName>

               <p>I suppose at all these places you drank pretty freely? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then I may fairly suppose that you was very drunk? - Yes, I was very much so.</p>
               <p>When had you the watch last? - At the Three Cranes; I am clear of that.</p>
               <p>You are clear, why you was so drunk you could not know any thing that passed? - I am certain I had it there, because I took it out to look at at that place.</p>
               <p>Drunk as you were can you positively swear that? - Yes, I will swear, that when I had looked at it I put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Was any body else in the room? - It was in a publick tap-room; there were several other people there but not in my company.</p>
               <p>Did you sit near any body? - No.</p>
               <p>When did you part with the prisoner? - Between ten and eleven o'clock; they took charge of her there; the watch was found upon her person.</p>
               <p>How came you to miss it? - I did not miss it, the people in the room saw her take it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>How long have you known this young woman? - By sight eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>You used often to drink tea with her? - No. I used to go and see her, but not very often.</p>
               <p>You knew where she lived and you and she where in habits of intimacy? - No.</p>
               <p>But you used to pay her a civil visit now and then? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You used often to see her? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you been there a dozen times in your life? - Yes, I may have been.</p>
               <p>Finding you could not put the watch into your pocket yourself did not you desire her to take care of it? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Was you sober enough to recollect that circumstance? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not she say immediately here is the watch which this man, who knows me well, has given me to take care of? - It is no such thing.</p>
               <p>Did she say so? - She did not.</p>
               <p>Whether she did not when the constable came say that? - She said she had a right to it.</p>
               <p>What did she say her right was? - They questioned her to know whether I was her husband? She said, no; but she had a right to take care of it.</p>
               <p>Did not she say that right was because you had given it her to take care of? - No; she did not say so.</p>
               <p>Will you take upon you to swear you did not give it her? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was very drunk? - Yes, but I am clear in it I did not do it.</p>
               <p>You knew her, and had been above a dozen times at her house? - I do not know that I have.</p>
               <p>Perhaps only eleven times, but you have been there often? - Perhaps too often.</p>
               <p>You knew her husband too? - Yes.</p>
               <p>We should not have heard any thing of this prosecution, I believe, if the husband had not threatened you for taking his wife from him? - I did not take his wife from him.</p>
               <p>Did not the husband threaten to bring an action against you for seducing his wife? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And is not that the reason for your bringing this prosecution? - Yes, it is.</p>
               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the jury you will acquit the prisoner.</p>

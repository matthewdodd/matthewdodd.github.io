                  </hi>. I am single, and live in Bull-fields, Woolwich. On the morning of Saturday, the 8th of April, I went to my mother's, and left the prisoner in my house—on my return she was gone, and I missed these articles—I tried to find the prisoner, and saw her on the 10th of April—she had got my things on—I asked her for the child's frock—she said she had pledged it at Mr. Davison's—I asked for the ticket, and she said she had torn it up—she had on my frock, and shawl, and cap—I was not in the habit of lending her clothes—she had been with me a week.</p>

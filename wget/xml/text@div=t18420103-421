                  </hi>. I keep the Norand Arms public-house, Kensington. The prisoner was my pot-boy about six months ago—on the 21st of December I found my wine-cellar door forced open from the inside—I found the rum cask tapped, which I had left full—I dipped it, and found two or three gallons gone—I missed a basket, with twelve bottles of champaigne, and a few bottles of port and sherry—I sent to the station—this wine and basket of rum is mine—I have no doubt of it—the basket is certainly mine—I did not go down to the cellar on Tuesday—on the Wednesday morning I went down, and found it as I have stated—nobody but those acquainted with the place could have known how to get down—they got in from a back area, covered with boards and stones.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's nephew. On Tuesday, the 21st, I saw the prisoner, about three o'clock in the afternoon, with another person—he was at my uncle's front door—he told me they were out of work, and asked if I would stand a pot of beer—they left, and went in the direction of the brick-fields—I know the prisoner had this handkerchief on his neck when I saw him, and part of the wine was found tied up in it.</p>

I was on duty about seven o'clock in the evening of the 21st, and met the prisoner in Webb-lane, with two buddies under hit arm, tied in these two handkerchiefs—I turned back, and followed him—he was walking quick—I passed him on the opposite side—I looked back—he stopped—I turned, and was going back—he dropped what he had, and ran off—I ran after him above a mile—he got away—I am sure he is the man—he dropped these two handkerchiefs, with wine and bottles tied up in them—I saw it was champaigne when I went back to the station—I went to his house, and found him in bed—I had seen him on the Thursday—I went and searched the brick-fields, and found a bottle and two gallons of rum, and in a sewer near the place where I found the basket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at Woodford, in Essex. On the morning of Friday, the 21st of January, I heard from my servant that one of my horses was gone—it was taken between Thursday night and Friday morning—the field it had been in was fenced all round—I saw the field next day, and from the appearance of it I believe it was impossible for one person to take the horse out of the field, the nature of the horse was such, and the fence was so deep—it had no shoes on at the time it was taken—I had had it about thirteen years—I never saw the prisoner about my place—in consequence of information, I went to a gentleman named Abbott—I discovered my horse on the 30th of January, walking along the street, in London, and took possession of it—I scertained that it was in Abbott's possession.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Morgan. On Friday morning, the 21st of January, I missed the horse—I had seen it safe in the field about four o'clock on Thursday evening—it might have been got over the hedge—I observed footmarks by the side of the bank, and on the top of the bank—I have no doubt it was got out there—the hedge was broken down, which was safe the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. My father keeps the William the Fourth public-house, at Camberwell, which is about eleven miles from Woodford. On Friday, the 21st of January, I saw the prisoner at ten o'clock at night—he brought a horse with him—he said that he had brought a hack, and would my father be so kind as to let him put it into a stable for a night—there was nobody with him at the time—my father was ill in bed—I allowed him to remain there for the night—I had seen the prisoner before, and spoken to him—he is a horse clipper—the horse had no shoes on—I saw Mr. Abbott at Worship-street with the same horse—it appeared a little fatigued on the Friday night, but no great deal—it was very tender on his feet, which made me observe that it had no shoes on—it remained in my father's stable till Tuesday morning—on the Sunday the prisoner and Scudds came to our house, and I saw them go to the stable where the horse was, and they partly clipped it—Scudds took it away on Tuesday evening—I saw Scudds, in the prisoner's presence, at my father's house on the Tuesday morning after the horse was gone—Scudds told me he had sold the horse he did not say what for—the prisoner was near enough to hear him—in my opinion the value of the horse is about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

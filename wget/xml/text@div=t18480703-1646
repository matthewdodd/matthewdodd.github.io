                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Titmus, of Wick-lane, Hackney. Our house stands alone in a garden, with a wooden fence—we have a beer-shop in Wick-street. About eleven o'clock, last Thursday week, I left the house leaving the back-door open, and went to the beer-shop—(I had seen the pri<lb></lb>soners there the evening before)—I heard something, went back, and found the back-door shut—a ladder was got, and some one got in through the window, and let me in—I missed the articles stated—two boxes were broken open, but nothing taken from them—the prisoners had no bundle at the beer<lb></lb>shop—I told them I sold cheese, but they only had a pennyworth of bread and a pint of porter.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, at Wanstead. On 22nd June I was at work in a garden adjoining Mrs. Titmus's, and saw the prisoners loitering about the road for an hour and a half or two hours—I afterwards saw John West in Mrs. Titmus's garden—he handed a bundle over the fence to Eliza, who went on with it across the common—he kept on the road, to where there was a vacancy, to get into the road, and I saw no more of them—I got in at Mrs. Titmus's bed-room window, and let her in—I afterwards found the pri<lb></lb>soners in Petticoat-lane, about three miles and a half off—they had no bundle—I told them they had been robbing Mrs. Titmus's house, and said, "Do you know me?"—John stood some time, all of a tremble—at the station I said, "Did not you see me as I was hoeing a bit of cabbage?"—he said, "Yes, I did"—I said, "Were not you sitting facing Mr. Titmus's house about twelve o'clock?"—he said, "Yes, I was."</p>

On 22nd June, about a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I was going into my garden, in front of the house, and saw the prisoners walking side by side in a direction from Mr. Titmus's house—John had a large white bundle under his arm—I kept them in view as far as Victoria-park.</p>

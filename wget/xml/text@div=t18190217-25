               <p>"How are you? how do you do?" I said I did not know him. He said,</p>
               <p>"You must know me, but you forget, I was a letter-man here once, and worked in the building - my name is Williams. I am just come from the East Indies, in the Moffat, and have a few things in a cart here, if you will be kind enough to lend me an old great coat, to lay over them for five minutes." I said I had no old coat - he said</p>
               <p>"Give me any old bit of a thing, and I will leave you a 5 l. note as security." He pulled out a pocket-book. I had an old coat of my own under the Company's coat - I took off the Company's coat to give him the under one; he took hold of the Company's coat, and said,</p>
               <p>"This will do." I said,</p>
               <p>"No, you must not touch that, it is the Company's coat" - he ran off with it, putting down a piece of paper, which he called a 5 l. note. It struck me so much I could not stir for half a minute. When I came to myself I went to the bottom of the yard to look for him, but could see neither him nor the coat. I returned to look for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181902170017"></xptr>the 5 l. note, and found it was an old duplicate, out of date. He never returned. I had to replace the coat. On the 3d of February, 1819, I saw the prisoner at the Mansion-house, and knew him again. I had not seen him before.</p>

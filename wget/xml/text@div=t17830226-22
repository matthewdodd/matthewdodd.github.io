               <p>Did you ever see him before? - Yes, I saw the prisoner coming out of the Half Moon at Brentford, I heard at Harwood's yard that there was a robbery committed on Miss Holden and Miss Pollard, I went directly after in search of the person that committed the robbery, I heard a description of his clothes, that he had a drab coloured coat and black stockings on, and one stocking was much splashed; I searched all the houses, and I saw him at the Half Moon at Brentford, just as he was coming out of the house; and he went about three doors, and he turned short, and I collared him.</p>

               <p>Court. Then the dress the prisoner had on when you apprehended him, corresponded with that which was described to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was it the dress he has on now? - The same coat: I saw the prisoner's wife the next morning at Twickenham, I talked to her about the purse, and she denied it for pretty near two hours.</p>
               <p>Did you receive any thing from the wife? - Yes, a purse.</p>
               <p>Where is that purse? - Mr. Cole has it.</p>

               <p>Court to Miss Holden. What was your purse? - It was dark brown, with silver runners and silver tassels; (looks at the purse) that is the identical purse.</p>
               <p>Court to Inwood.

                  </hi>. I am one of the warders in the Penitentiary. On 23d April last the prisoner was in my ward—it is one of the regulations of the gaol that prisoners are not allowed to speak from their cells to one another—that is made known to the prisoners—on Monday, 23d May, I heard a convict, named Tomlins, calling from his cell to the prisoner, in consequence of which, I went and advised Impey not to have any conversation with him, so as to keep himself out of trouble—he said he had not been talking to him—I said I did not accuse him of talking to him, I merely cautioned him against having any conversation with him—I told him I had heard Tom lins calling from his cell-gate, and I had reported him (Tomlins)—I had an</p>

On 24th April I saw Mr. Atkinson, and found a cut wound, about three-quarters of an inch long, on the back part of his head, at the right side—it was such a wound as a stone slung in a handkerchief would inflict—there was also a bruise on his left cheek. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I have nothing to Bay.</p>

            . I live at 55, Curtain-road Shoreditch. On the 14th of January last, on my returning home, near twelve o'clock, from the Crown and Magpie tavern, in Whitechapel. It was very near twelve. When I came out I came down Houndsditch as quick as I could; I turned to my right along Bishopsgate-street. I came along Bishopsgate-street until I came to the corner of Union-street, on the right hand side of the way. I then crossed from the right hand side to the left hand side in the same street, Bishopsgate-street; just at that time there were several persons at the corner of Angle-alley. I had not gone many yards further; I perceived a man by the side of me. I turned round to look at him, and then I saw two more behind me. I kept walking on as fast as I could down Bishopsgate-street. He kept close to my arm, and spoke to me two or three times. They spoke about the night. I seemed in an hurry; I gave them a slight answer, and took no notice. I went on until I came to the bottom of Hog-lane. I was thinking of turning down there, but as they followed me I kept straight on, and went down <placeName id="t18130217-23-crimeloc143">Norton Falgate</placeName>

As I was going to turn up Hog-lane, the one at my right hand jostled up against me. I suspected then what they were after. I then said, you must not come that with me, my lads, it will not do. Recollecting there was a watch-box a few doors lower down Shoreditch, I was then thinking to find the watchman in this watch-box. When I came to the watch-box the watchman was not in it; he had gone his round. The watch-box stands at the corner of <placeName id="t18130217-23-crimeloc144">King's-head-court, Shoreditch</placeName>

These two pulled me, and the third put his hand to my mouth. They pulled me about twenty-five or thirty yards up the court, and the other man held his hand over my mouth. They shoved me behind. They then throwed me down, and all three fixed upon me; the one at my right shoulder kneeled on my right breast, stopping my eyes. He held my head down, stopped my eyes and mouth; he thrust something dirty into my mouth. My mouth was very dirty when I got up. He put his knuckles to my eyes,; my eyes was very sore the next day, and for two or three days afterwards. He thrust something into my mouth; my mouth was thrusted open, so that my jaw was sore for two or three days. Another one was at my right side, lower down; he was kneeling upon my ribs, and rifling my pockets. At the same time one on my left side, kneeling upon me likewise, just by my side, near my goin. In that situation I felt one on my right hand put his hand into my breeches pocket. At the same time I felt the one on, my left feeling for my pocket-book, and I think, at the same time I heard him on the left hand, say, d - n him, kill him. He repeated that twice. I felt myself agitated in mind. I struggled as much as I could. I was very much alarmed in consequence of my family. At that instant the one that was kneeling on my breast sprang up, and the other one on my right side too. The watchman came past, crying the hour of twelve. At that time, I was struggling very hard. I catched hold of the third man's leg. I saw the other two run away out of the court, the same way that they took me in.</p>

               <p>Q. And the left hand man, you laid hold of his leg, did you - A. Yes, and his hand was at the same time in my right hand breeches pocket. I took hold of the ham of his right knee, just here. His hand was in my pocket, and as I rose up he drew it out, and the silver dropped on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pull the silver out of your pocket - A. I can hardly distinguish that. He drew his hand out of my pocket, and I heard the silver drop upon the pavement, and I saw it at the same time. I saw it in consequence of my laying hold of him by the leg. He drawed me over on my face. I saw the silver, and I picked up a three-shilling piece with my hand, that had come from my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. How much money had you - A. I cannot say. I had been out collecting that day. I had, I dare<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181302170016"></xptr>say, about seven or eight pounds of silver in my pocket. I can only swear I lost a five-shilling-and-sixpenny-dollar, and a three-shilling bank-token. I cannot say how much more, not knowing exactly how much I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober - A. I had taken a little wine after supper, but not more than did me good. I was collected, and knew as well as I do this morning. The prisoner, in striving to get away from me, he drawed me a few yards on the pavement. He then fell down. I got him down by the time the watchman came up, and saw him and laid hold of him while I was still holding his leg.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the prisoner at the bar, was it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know whether you lost more money than a dollar and a three-shilling token - A. Yes, I know I lost more. I cannot say how much. I reckon I lost two pound, as near as I can guess. There was a three-shilling piece found on the prisoner, and the one I picked up. The officer has one. The prisoner had his hands in my pocket. He took it out and put it in again. I suppose he took some silver out, by taking his hand out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any jingling of money - A. I did not hear the money rattle until it fell on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. It was the prisoner that had his hand in your pocket at the time that the silver fell on the pavement - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You are sure that more money besides the five-shilling-and-sixpenny-dollar and the three-shilling bank token was taken from you, are you - A. Yes, I know I lost more.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you lost it before they came to you - A. No, I had not. I had seven or eight pounds of silver in the whole, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear you had five pounds about you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you left - A. I cannot say exactly the sum that was left. The officer can tell you. The money was taken out of my pocket directly the man was taken to the watchhouse, and an account was taken of it.</p>
               <p>Q. You then delivered all the silver to the officer, did you - A. Yes, and the notes likewise, and the notes were in my right hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you gave to the officer all the silver that you had left, did you - A. Yes. What makes me know I lost a five-shilling-and-sixpenny-piece, I took three of a person; I had two remaining; one was gone. That makes me swear to a five-shilling-and-sixpenny-piece.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Cumberland-street, Shoreditch. I was going my round, crying the hour of twelve, and Nag's Head-court is the last of my beat. When I came to the corner I found two men upon the ground. The prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner for robbing him. They laid both on the ground. I called out to the next watchman that was coming by the corner of the court, and bid him spring the rattle. The watchman and patrol came to my assistance when he sprang the rattle I took him to the watchhouse. The watchman and patrol lifted the prosecutor up. I took hold of the prisoner. We took them all to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner is the man, is he - A. Yes; I never let him loose. He was searched at the watch-house by the officer of the night.</p>

            . I was officer of the night. I searched the prisoner. I found upon him one three-shilling bank token. The prosecutor brought in a three-shilling token all over mud, which the prosecutor said he picked up on the ground after I had searched the prisoner. I asked the prosecutor whether he knew what he had lost. He said he could not tell, he had a deal of money about him when he came out. I told him I thought he had better look and see whether he might not miss something particular. He then pulled his money out on the table, and trusted to my counting it. I counted it. There was one five-pound note, two five-shilling-and-six-penny dollars, fourteen three-shilling bank tokens, five eighteen-penny tokens, twenty nine shillings, and nine sixpences, and there was ten pounds in notes besides that. As soon as I counted the two five-shilling-and-sixpenny dollars, he said, if there was not three, one was lost; he had taken three from one person.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Shirley has said that he had of you four pounds fourteen shillings in all; are you sure that you had more money in your pocket - A. Yes, I think I had about eight or nine pounds in silver in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that you lost more than the five-shilling-and-sixpenny-piece and the three-shilling piece - A. Yes. I saw more than that lay on the ground when I was pulled over by the prisoner at the same time that I catched hold of one three-shilling piece. I saw two or three others. I can only swear by the bulk I had in my pocket, and I know it was a great deal lessened. I know I lost one five-shilling-and-sixpenny-piece.</p>

On the night the prisoner is charged with committing the robbery he was coming through Crown-court, in Still-alley, and just as the prisoner got into Crown-court he heard a man cry out, just as if some man was ill-using him. The prisoner went on when a a man and the prosecutor were on the ground. When the prosecutor got up the prosecutor got hold of him and cruelly used him. The prosecutor's conduct was as if he was mad drunk with liquor. The prosecutor gave charge of the prisoner. The prisoner was searched, and on him a three-shilling piece was found, which was his own property. The prosecutor's conduct towards the prisoner will be best proved by the patrol. The prisoner has an aged father and mother, which he supports by his honest industry.</p>

I was determined not to loose the prisoner, as the prisoner was the person that was kneeling on me when I caught hold of him. The patrol has called on me, and abused me because his name is not on the bill. Mr. Moser did not think there was any occasion of more witnesses than what he had called, I am determined to indict the patrol at the Sessions for an assault.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sea cook, and live at 33, Belgrave Street, Rateliffe—I returned from a voyage on 27th September last—about 3 o'clock in, the afternoon, I was in the East India Road; as I got to Belgrava Street, a man, who I know now to be Dunkin, came up and asked the way to the Mile End Road—I pointed it out to him, and he said he was a perfect stranger in London, that he had just arrived from New York, and he was looking about the suburbs of London—we had some more conversation, and he walked up Belgrave Street with me—after we had walked a little way, Ball rushed past us, and his pocket-book fell on the pavement—I picked it up, and sung out, "Friend, you have dropped your pocket-book," and ran after him—he turned round, and said, "I do not know how I can repay you and your friend; I will give you a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note each for your honesty"—Dunkin said, "It does not belong to me; this gentleman, a stranger to me, picked it up; you might have lost the pocket-book and the, contents," and then he said, "What might the contents be?—Ball pulled the strap off, and showed me a great many notes, or what appeared to be notes—I declined the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—we walked on, and Ball said he was a gentleman, from Devonshire, and had an estate there, and he was sorry I could not go down to have some. time with him—I thanked him, and said I should soon have to go to sea—Ball said he had to go on the continent the next day, on business—he said he had come up to London on a point of law, that he had seen his solicitor, and had gained the case, and that an uncle had died, and left several thousand pounds to be distributed to the poor of different districts, and he should like to find trustworthy men to do the great work he had in handy—he also said that he had already given away a considerable sum to some clergymen, to be distributed to the poor, and if any person could show him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would give them another 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to distribute—Dunkin said, immediately, "Could you produce 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said, "Well, I have not got it upon me; but no doubt I could get it"—Ball said, "If any person could show him. 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he would give them 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to distribute—Dunkin said, could show it, and I said I could—Dunkin then promised to show 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he was to receive 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the poor of Coventry—I do take an interest in the welfare of the poor myself and have laboured hard as a temperance man—Ball then said that I was to meet Dunkin at the London Hospital, at 12 o'clock the next day, and then meet him at some hotel in London, at 1 o'clock, and Dunkin told me to, be punctual in meeting him—I went home, and went to Mr. Williams, a ship owner, and asked him to lend me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and he gave me a crossed cheque—I was to return it the same evening or the next morning—I went on the following day to the London Hospital, and met Dunkin there—he asked if I had got the money—I said I had got part of it—he said, "Can you get, 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said, "Yes"—he then said, "I will lend you another fifty; and when we have seen the gentleman, and shown him the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., you can easily pass it to me, and he will be none the wiser for it"—he went away, and we were to meet again, in a quarter of an hour, with the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had spoken to a detective before this—I did not see Ball there while I was talking to Dunkin, and I did not see a man named Jones.</p>

               <p>—Dunkin joined him and shook hands with him—they walked down the front of the hospital, in conversation—I have known Dunkin for some few years—I saw a man named Jones on the opposite side of the way, and I had seen Ball in a beer-shop opposite the hospital, at the same time that Dunkin was with Morgan—Ball came out and walked down the road, and turned up North Street—I then lost sight of the prosecutor, but I saw Dunkin cross the road and join Jones—they walked up the road, and went towards where Ball was standing—I followed—Ball saw me, and went down North Street again—I sent a constable after him, and I stopped Dunkin and Jones—Ball was taken into custody and brought back—I took Dunkin and Jones to the station—Jones was discharged at the Police Court because Morgan could not identify him in the transaction.</p>

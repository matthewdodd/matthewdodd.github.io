                  </hi>. I live in the house of Mr. Henry Davidson, in Bruton-street, Berkeley-square, in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. The prisoner came on trial to Mr. Davidson as groom, a few days before the 24th of April—I was the head groom until about ten days ago—all the property stated in the indictment is mine, and was taken out of the room over the stable—the prisoner slept there two or three nights—I went out and returned in half an hour—I missed the things at half-past six o'clock in the evening—the prisoner said he was going to his father, who had a job for him, and if he did not get the job, he should return again—he did not return—this was after the things were missed—I went to his father next morning and made inquiry, and then gave information to the police—the coat he had on when he was apprehended is mine—I never permitted him to take my property at all.</p>

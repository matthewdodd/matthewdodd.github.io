On the 4th of January I was in the parlour, about seven o'clock in the evening, and saw something moving among the lights in the shop; I looked again and saw the prisoner - I cried Stop thief! and went into the shop; he ran out - I went after him as far as the next house; I could not pursue further, because there was no one in the shop; when I saw him first, he had his hand in my till - I saw the shopman in the next house pursue him, and said, that was the boy; he was brought back again, and begged me to let him go - he said he had not robbed my till; I gave him in charge, and then he dropped some halfpence in the parlour; I missed some silver and some halfpence from the till.</p>
               <p>CHARLES AMOS. I live next door to the prosecutrix; she came and told me to go after the boy - I ran and took him, without losing sight of him; I saw him looking back as I followed him - I brought him back, and one shilling, two sixpences, and three halfpence were found in his shoe.</p>
               <p>ROGER RAGON. I am a watchman, and received charge of the prisoner; he dropped one penny in the shop, and one penny outside - I took him to the watch-house; Brown searched him, and a shilling, two sixpences, and three-halfpence were found in his left shoe.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I searched him, and found this money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The money was thrown down in Goswell-street by a boy, and I took it up.</p>

            . I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; they were taken out of a chest in my bed-room; the prisoner had the cloak and shift on when I took her up, she said she had rather have robbed any other man's house in England or Ireland than mine; I told her if she would tell me where the other things were, I would freely forgive her; she said she knew nothing of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say as to the cloak and shift?</p>
               <p>East. She said she found them in a ditch.</p>

               <p>East. I went out about four in the afternoon, and came home again about nine in the evening; I found the bolt of the back door shoved back, and a lock was broke in the house besides; the door was fast when I went out.</p>

               <p>Consider, Mr. East, do not send me out of my native country, (the prisoner was an Irishwoman) they have transported my husband already; I picked up these things in the road; I never was in the prosecutor's house in my life, I have no acquaintance with his house.</p>

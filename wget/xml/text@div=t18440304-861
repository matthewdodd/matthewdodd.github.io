                  </hi>. I was the wife of Richard Green, now deceased; he kept the Queen's-head public-house at Uxbridge. On the night of the 13th of Feb., I was in the inner room adjoining the bar—I had only the fire-light—I heard a noise like the unlocking of the till, and then the rattling of halfpence—I got up and went to the till, and saw the prisoner who is a stranger, lift<lb></lb>ing his hand from the till, with the bowl in it, and he drew it across the counter—there were some coppers in it—I had seen it a very few minutes before—the till was locked, and the key in it—I went and took bold of the prisoner—he tried to get from me, and pushed me against the window, and broke two panes of glass—the policeman arrived, and I gave him in charge—I heard the bowl dropped when I took hold of him—I got a light, and the policeman picked up the bowl and the coppers as described.</p>

            . Q. Were you introduced to the prisoner any time in July last - A. Yes, I was. I saw him at the Cock, the top of Shire-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you employed by any person - A. Yes, by Mr. Avory, on the part of the bank. I met him first at the top of Shire-lane: that was on the 19th of July last. I found him there. I went with his wife to the top of Shire-lane; he was standing at the top of the lane, and we spoke together. I asked him how he did; he asked me how I did; I said, I was very well. He asked then, how

             did; I said he was very well when I saw him last; that was on Sunday, and I was very sorry to see him there; by there, I meaned Newgate; that I wanted some screens of him, meaning bank notes. We walked together until we came to a house in Carey-street. We went in, and drank together. He said he could let me have a score if I wanted them. I said I would have two first, to try them. He came out and agreed to me the next morning at eleven o'clock, at the corner of Carey-street; by eleven o'clock on the next Wednesday, the 21st of July.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010025"></xptr>We parted that day. I communicated to Avory what had passed. The next morning I met Avory and Wainwright at the Green Man in Shire-lane. Avory gave to me a one-pound bank note, which he marked, to buy two forged notes of the prisoner. Avory and Wainwright went to the house where the prisoner and me had been the evening before, and I went to the corner of Carey-street, according to promise.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 21st - A. Yes. I met Griffiths there according to promise; he gave me two one-pound notes; I gave him the same one pound note which Avory had given to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any thing been said by him what price you were to pay for them - A. Ten shillings a-piece for them; that was mentioned the evening before, the 19th of June. Me and the prisoner Griffiths went to the house where we had been the evening before; that is in Carey-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Avory and Wainwright there - A. Yes; they were there, and I saw they were drinking together, and Griffiths and me drunk together. We then came out, and I and the prisoner agreed to meet at the Three Herrings in Bell-yard. That was to be the next evening at ten o'clock. Then I went to the house where Wainwright and Avory were, and shewed to them the two notes that I had purchased.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they for you - A. No; I took them to Mr. Westwood, and delivered them to him; he desired me to mark them.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they marked before you parted with them - A. I parted with them to Mr. Westwood, they were not out of my sight before I marked them with my name.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these two notes - A. These notes were marked by me before they went out of my sight; I am sure these are the two notes I received of the prisoner. On the following evening, I met the prisoner again at the Three Herrings; Avory and Wainwright were both there, they were not apparently in my company, they were in the same room. I met the prisoner there, and the prisoner said, he did not like the note I had given to him the morning before, it had been marked by some of the small bankers: I said, it would make no difference to me, I gave him twenty shillings in silver for it, and he gave me the note back. Then we came out, and agreed to meet the next morning at the Green Man in Shire-lane; I walked with Griffiths to the end of Cary-street, and then we parted. I then met Avory at the end of Bell-yard; I told him that Griffiths had returned me the note, and I had given him twenty shillings for it. Then on the next morning I went with Avory to Dickens's house, the officer in Gray's-inn-lane, where Avory searched me. He gave me that one-pound note and a dollar. The one-pound note Avory gave me to by more notes of Griffiths, at the Green Man, in Shire-lane; then Avory and me went to the Green Man in Shire-lane; this was on the 22nd of July. I went there along with Avory, and had my breakfast, and change of a note to pay for my breakfast. I told the landlord to keep it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did your breakfast come to - A. Five pence. Then soon after

We then walked together until we came to the end of Carey-street, then we stood and talked some time, and then went to the Five Bells, in Chancery-lane. We drank together, and he gave me a direction to find him any time if I should want him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you spend at the Five Bells - A. Five pence there, and when we drank at the Green Man I paid two pence towards the reckoning at the Green Man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then altogether you spent a shilling at the two houses - A. Yes. We then came out, and parted. I then went with Avory to the Black Dog in Gray's-inn-lane, where he searched me; he found on me a one-pound note and fourteen shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the one-pound note that you received of Griffiths - A. Yes, and fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver. We then went to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no money in your pocket but what had been given you by Avory - A. No. On the 27th of July, the prisoner's wife came to me; I bought a note of her; I gave eleven shillings for it. On the 27th of July the prisoner came to me at the Guy earl of Warwick, Gray's-inn-lane; that was in consequence of an appointment with Griffiths's wife; he met me there. We sat and drank together some time, and agreed to meet on the 28th, the next evening; he did not come on the 28th according to promise; his wife came on the 29th, in the evening; she told me her husband should come. Soon after, he came again, on the 29th; he was to meet me on the 29th; he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with him when he was apprehended - A. Yes; he was apprehended by Wainwright and Dickens.</p>
               <p>Q. When Avory searched you he found a one-pound note - A. Yes, and fourteen shillings and sixpence. I put my name on that note at Mr. Westwood's.</p>

             to Warman. What place are you a native of - A. I was born in Birmingham. I left Birmingham quite young. I get my living here by wine portering and shoe-making. I continued in that line a considerable time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it ago since you went into Worcestershire<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010026"></xptr>- A. It is four or five years since I went there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been there before you left it - A. I was there two years or better.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember being present at any assizes in Worcester - A Yes. I stood at the bar. I was tried, sir, and when I went out of court I went to jail, and staid there two years and better.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Bateman, of Worcester, do not you - A. Yes, he lost a cow. I was in the court the same day as he was; and after he had said a good deal about me, I was not allowed to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the judge - A. I forget.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you serve in the wine trade while you were in London - A. Mr. Moss, and nobody else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you serve any person in Coventry-street - A. Yes, Mr. Cole. I was there for a month.</p>
               <p>Q. You parted with him on excellent terms - A. Very fair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never apply to him for a character - A. No, I did not want a character of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with him about bottles of wine before you left him - A. Yes; he missed some wine, but I did not have them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you confess to him that you stole his wine - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Cole is in the parlour. Did not Mr. Cole accuse you of stealing two bottles, and you acknowledged having them - A. I acknowledged the bottles were there, but I did not have them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you admit to him that you had stolen the wine - A. I am sure I forget now whether I did or not. The property was there, I never had it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been in town since you left your comfortable quarters in Worcester - A. Ever since the 6th of June last; I came up to town and got a place at Mr. Clark's, a wine-merchant, in Maiden-lane. I think I went to Mr. Clark's on the 14th of June. I arrived in town on the 4th; I staid at Mr. Clark's until the latter end of the summer; it was before I laid an information a long time. When I bought the notes of Griffiths was last July. It is eighteen months since I came up from Worcester. I have been in London two years next May.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you serve after you left this gentleman - A. Then I went to Mr. Perry, a wine merchant in Warwick-row; he deals in wine, spirits, and is a publican.</p>
               <p>Q. He keeps the Goat and Compasses, does not he - A. I never knew the sign. I lived there three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you serve afterwards - A. Then I went to my mother's home, and worked at shoe-making. She lived then in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Myers - A. I cannot say, a long time before I left Moss's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Myers was a practiced house-breaker; did not you know he was a thief all the time of your acquaintance with him - A. Yes, not all the time.</p>

               <p>Q. At which time was any thing said about a private still - A. There was nothing said about a private still.</p>
               <p>Q.You have admitted already that you said you had the gin from a private still - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. You never mentioned to him that you could get gin at a cheap price - A. No, I told him I could get gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it for money - A. We were to whack it; he was to have the gin of me for nothing until he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010027"></xptr>sold it, and then we were to part the money. I was to buy it at the retail price.</p>
               <p>Q. And you left this gin at this lady's house in the Seven Dials. Upon your oath, did not you tell him that you could get gin from a private still at ten shillings a gallon, and he was to pay you in bank notes, and now you say you were to get the gin at the retail price - A. Yes, the price was not mentioned; when the gin was sold it was to be shared what he sold it for. I was to buy it and pay for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he sold fifty shillings worth, were you to have twenty-five shillings, and he twenty-five shillings - A. That was not agreed; the money that he sold it for was to be shared between us.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity did you leave at the woman's house - A. I left two quart wine bottles.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that - A. I think it was on a Friday, I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How often had you seen him before that - A. I think I had seen him three times before that.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this had you been acquainted with Avory and Wainwright - A. I have been acquainted with Wainwright a long time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been employed about this particular business - A. I cannot say, it might be a month and more; if I could tell you exactly I would.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you detected any other persons in this offence - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you expect any benefit from detecting persons dealing in bad bank notes - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with Wainwright - A. A matter of eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>Q. That was when you were in town before - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Then perhaps you had mentioned it to Mr. Westwood - A. It was not mentioned till afterwards I had bought of Griffiths; Mr. Westwood knew it before.</p>

               <p>Q. The officers were not with you there - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You met the next day at the corner of the street - A. Yes, I met Mrs. Griffiths at the Green Man; I went to the house in Carey-street with Avory and Wainwright.</p>
               <p>Q. They did not search you then to see what was about you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you might have had two forged bank notes in your pocket and they knew nothing about it; that might be so - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Pray how came it that Avory and Wainwright did not go immediately and seize the man - A. I don't know indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. The note was marked on purpose that they should know it again. Did not you say to them you had better go and take him now, the thing is done - A. No; I went to Mr. Westwood.</p>
               <p>Q. The note was marked there by you, that note never having been out of your possession - A. Yes; the next evening I saw Griffiths again, Avory and Wainwright was with me then.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you tell them to take him then, how came you not to do that - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. He returned to you the note that had been marked by the officers, and the mark that he pointed out to you was the mark that had been put upon it - A. I believe it was; I did not take notice of it. He said I do not like the note you gave me last night, it has been marked by some small bankers; I put the note in my pocket; I kept it the whole night myself, and then gave it into the hands of the publican in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, upon the 22nd they gave you more money, they gave you back the same note and a dollar, was the dollar marked - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Griffiths had the marked note a day and a night before it came to you with this complaint, he had it on the 20th, on the 21st in the evening he returned it; these are all the notes, and there is your hand writing on the back of it - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to write upon this note bought of a stranger - A. Because I did not know his name then.</p>

Had you seen Warman before this day the notes were produced to you - A. I think I saw him once before, he came to me with Avory, I think two or three days before the 20th of July, and on the 20th the notes were brought to me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see them together in the street - A. No, not at that time. I saw Warman a very few minutes after that at the top of Bell-yard, he shewed me that good note that I gave him to purchase with; he said he was to meet him the next morning at breakfast time, at the Green Man public-house, Shire-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning, the 29th, where did you first meet Warman - A. At Dickens's, in Gray's-inn-lane; I searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time he left Dickens's what money had he about him - A. A one-pound note and a dollar. I then went with him to the Green Man, there he had a basin of tea, and a quartern of gin they had together; he changed the note with the publican by my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give directions to the publican about that note - A. Not at that time, after it was changed. The prisoner came in about ten minutes; when the prisoner came in he joined company with Warman, they drank together; he paid his reckoning; they went out together. He paid two-pence towards the gin; they went out together; I followed them; they went talking together up Shire-lane into Carey-street and there they talked together some time. I followed them, and as they kept talking together I went round Chichester-rents; when I went round into Chancery-lane I saw Wainwright opposite of where the prisoner and Warman were walking together; Wainwright was watching them. I went to Wainwright; he told me they were gone into the Five Bells. I went after them, and waited until they came out. I saw them coming as if from there, they went a little way up Chancery-lane and parted.</p>
               <p>Q. When they parted did you follow Warman - A. Yes; I met Warman in Holborn, he and I went to the Black Dog in Gray's-inn-lane; I there searched him again; I found upon him a bad one-pound note and fourteen shillings and sixpence in silver. I went with Warman to Mr. Westwood; I delivered that note to Mr. Westwood; I marked it before I parted with it.</p>

               <p>Q. Then it is not true that within a month this man told you that he was a capital convict - A. No, it is not true; I never knew nothing of it until Mr. Westwood inform me of it; since Warman has acknowledged it he has told me of it, not before.</p>
               <p>Q. The first night that you see him in company with Griffiths he went out and was absent from you five or ten minutes - A. Yes, some minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see your marked bank note again, it was full twenty-four hours in Warman's possession, how it got there you could know nothing, more than what he told you - A. No, not any thing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it quite possible he might have got these other notes from some other man - A. I do not know; I was in company with him all the morning, he was not in company with any body else.</p>

               <p>Q. When he came to you and said he had sold one-pound note for two bad ones, it did not occur to you that was the time to take him - A. No, not till I had got directions.</p>
               <p>Q. How often was it that you saw Warman and Griffiths in company together; did you see a bottle of gin handed - A. No, I never saw a bottle of gin handed.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you saw a paper that you supposed to be a bank note passed could any thing pass without your seeing - A. Nothing could.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it is not true that a bottle of gin could pass without your seeing it - A. I do not think it could; I sat directly opposite at the time this transaction was going on, from the 20th to the 22nd of July. He gave old Mrs. Myers some gin to take to her son. That is all I saw pass between them.</p>

I kept sitting in the same place until I saw Warman and the prisoner coming out of Shire-lane again, they both went towards Chancery-lane? I walked after them, and between Star-yard and Chancery-lane they stopped together. I thought if the prisoner saw me a second time he might have suspicion of me; I ran up Star-yard, I ran round Chichester-rents to the corner of Breem's-buildings, and I saw the prisoner and Warman go towards Fleet-street a little way, they went down Chancery-lane towards Fleet-street, they went in that direction, but they went into the Five Bells public-house.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, having a clear conscience of the charge permit me to address you. I most solemnly declare my innocence of dealing in any forged notes whatever; I have no doubt in my own mind Warman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181312010031"></xptr>has done this either to obtain money from the bank solicitor, or a permanent situation in their employ, be it for which of these it is swearing my life away. I grant my character has been impeach, that imputation does not resemble the present charge. And as it appears by the officers and Warman, that this is a premidated business; they have thought proper to select me for a viction, as I have been unfortunate they thought they might assail me with impunity. I feel convinced through a disgraced individual. No prejudice will operate upon the present occasion to my disadvantage; when he states that he was recommended to me his subject was entirely different, as you will see by the purport of this letter in my hand; I have the letter which was sent by his friend Myers.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Griffiths, a young man has called upon me, he informs me he is in concern with a private still, he will sell you cheap; yours respectfully H. MYERS. P. S. You may see him every morning at nine o'clock, at the Green Man." This letter was delivered to me by Mary Weston. He wishes to impose upon this honorable court, I trust your lordship will examine the evidence given by Avory and Wainwright, they do not correspond with the evidence of Warman, namely of purchasing forged notes of me; there I drew their premeditated guilt in this business. Their giving Warman a one-pound note for the purchace; why then after they had so far completed a fair case for conviction, why not apprehended me; this I am sure must convince your minds as men of understanding, that you are satisfied no purchase took place. Gentlemen, that this was a premeditated business; another reason shews it, my returning a one-pound note; how inconsistant, can any man believe that for a minute; would not a guilty man have kept the marked note in his own possession, sooner than returning it, this is too glaring a thing; a guilty man could have no difficulty in gitting rid of such a note rather than risk life. Would not a guilty man have destroyed this testimony, but that must rest upon your opinion. I was seized in Gray's-inn-lane, and taken into the shop of a broker, who is in court; who stated that he saw me searched, and what money I had about me, which was seven shillings, was given me back. I hope gentlemen you will clearly weigh the evidence given, and give an impartial verdict. I trust your lordship will consider that no man's life ought to be at stake for such a man as Warman. I by mere accident learned that he was convicted of a felony; I am not the first innocent man that Warman has accused as will appear to the court. I have made every possible enquiry; I have wrote to Worcester to find the man; had I brought the man it would clearly prove that he wanted to swear away an innocent man's life. I was offered by the prosecution a pardon of this charge if I would plead guilty of a crime that would have subjected me to transportation; I could not plead guilty of that offence.</p>

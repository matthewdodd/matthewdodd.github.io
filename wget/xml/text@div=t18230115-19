I was getting ready to go with her, and when I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182301150012"></xptr>was half naked, she said she wanted a pair of boot-laces, and then a stay-lace; I said; I had plenty of both, she then said she wanted to buy a pair of gloves - I said she had used mine, and could use them again - she said, she had had enough of me, and would borrow no more. I said,</p>
               <p>"Ann, I am afraid, there is some scheme in it" - she said,</p>
               <p>"No there is not, you know where to find me;" and immediately went out; I expected she was going to Burton-crescent, where we had appointed to go. I got ready and went, but she was not there - I never saw her again. Next morning when I went to breakfast, I found my tea-caddy wrenched open by a fork, and four sovereigns; three crown-pieces; three shillings and sixpence gone, which I had seen safe at eleven o'clock the day before, I missed nothing else that day, being too much confused to look about, on the 5th I missed a petticoat, apron, and a new shift; she left on Tuesday, and on Saturday week, I saw her at Marlborough-street I saw her stripped and my shift found on her back, with my name on it. I claimed it, and said I have been a mother and a friend to you, and why did you distress a poor person like me? I neither threatened or promised her, she cried and said,</p>

               <p>"Mrs. Harrison, I am very sorry, but I have done it, and do not know what possessed me to do it;" she said, she opened the tea-caddy with a fork, and that the duplicate of my apron and petticoat, were at the place where the officers took her, she acknowledged taking the money.</p>

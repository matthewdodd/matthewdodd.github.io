               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Was there a great crowd? A. Not till we came against Mr. Richardson's show, then the crush came, and the prisoner came up against me - I was not flurried - I am sure I am not mistaken in his person; here is the string of my pocket which he left round my waist - he got but two or three yards from me when he was taken.</p>

             (City police-constable, No. 93.) I was at the fair, there was a rush of twenty or thirty persons, the prosecutrix called, "Stop thief," I turned and saw the prisoner go into the crowd, he put his hand out with something in it, to some other person - I took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there not a great confusion? A. Yes, I saw the prisoner pass something to another - I saw a dark substance - I cannot tell what.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see anything in the prisoner's hand? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When he took me I was looking at a boy dancing, he said, "You have robbed this woman," I said, I had not; she then said, I had the property on me, I said, "I never robbed any body in all my life," the next morning as I was going to Guildhall, the officer said, he did not believe I was guilty.</p>
               <p>JOHN SMITH. No, I said I should not have taken him to be one who would have done such a thing.</p>

            . I am nursery-maid to Mr. Crokat, of Connaught-square. On Saturday morning, the 20th of September, I pinned these napkins up, and gave them to the cook for the man who calls for the washing things; I put them into the kitchen about nine o'clock in the morning - she gave them to the man in the afternoon; I did not see them put into the cart.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and have known the prisoner four or five years. On the Monday morning, when I was going to work, Mr. Daniels called to me and said,"Don't Reeves work for you?" I said Yes; he said,"Well, he has got me in a complete hobble. I took some linen home for people, and on returning I had a bundle, and put it into the cart; and when I came to where the wild beasts were, I went to see them, and left nobody with the cart" - and he did not know whether the bundle was in the cart or not.</p>

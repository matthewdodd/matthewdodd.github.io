On the 13th of February I came into the shop, and saw the prisoner at work—he looked very bulky about his bosom, and I said I should wish to know what he had about his person—he said he had nothing belonging to me—I still persisted that he had some thing—he said he had not—I then sent for a policeman, and before the policeman came, he pulled four skins from his bosom—I know these four skins are my husband's—he was working on them at the time.</p>

I was sent for, and found the prisoner—Mrs. Solomon gave me these four skins, and stated in hit pre<lb></lb>sence, that he had pulled them from his bosom—he did not deny it—took him to the Compter, and asked where he lived—he said, at No. 4 Greenhill's-rents, Cow Cross-street, and occupied two rooms on the ground floor—I went there, and in the back room, on the bed I found this bag, with about twenty-five skins, as near as I could guess, and in a corner of the bed-room I found about as many more, loose—I took them to Mr. Solomon, who identified them; and there were eight boas hanging up in the room.</p>

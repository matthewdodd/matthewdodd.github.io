Bank note, and six sovereigns - I had seen them on Sunday, the 5th, the day before, about ten o'clock in the morning; I was looking into the drawer for something about twelve o'clock on Monday, and missed the purse -I found the purse concealed in the coal cellar, with a 10l. note, three sovereigns, and 19s. remaining in it; the rest was gone - the prisoner was doing his duty in the house at that time; I made my loss known to my fellow servants - I saw the prisoner, and challenged him with it; he denied it - I said I believed he had taken it, and if he would own it perhaps it would not be so bad, but if he did not I would go for an officer; it was his business to fetch the coals from the cellar - I went for an officer, who took him into custody.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM YOUNG re-examined. Q. Before the prisoner said any thing to you, what were your words to him? A. As near as I can remember I said, "I suspect you have taken the purse out of my drawer;" he said he had not taken any money - I said "You had better own it at once," and after that he said something; I said I would go for an officer, and did go - he denied it completely; he never acknowledged to me that he had stolen it.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM IVIMEY. He told me he had taken the money, that he took one 5l. note out of the purse, and had been robbed of it by some girl in Westminster; I searched him, but found nothing - he did not say where he found the purse; I received 13l. 19s. from Young.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Young present when he made this statement? A. No - I made him no premise to induce him to tell me about it; he was telling me of it while I cautioned him - Young had fetched me to the house.</p>

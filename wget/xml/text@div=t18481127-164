                  </hi>. I am agent to Mr. Thomas Brassey, a contractor employed on the railroad near Feltham. I missed property of his at various times, from the 4th to the 9th Nov.—on the 9th I was passing the line near Feltham, and saw two men sawing a piece of timber, which I saw was Mr. Brassey's—I asked what they were sawing—the prisoner came up, put his shoulder under a piece which they had been sawing, and carried it away—I; saw the initials had been cut out of it—this is the piece which I prevented the men from sawing—I went to Mr. Biggs, took him to the saw-pit, and then went for the policeman—no sale of such materials as this had taken place by order of Mr. Brassey, to my knowledge—no one had any authority to take them away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the agents for Mr. Brassey, on the line from Staines to Windsor. On 9th Nov. Mr. Knowles took me to a saw-pit—I saw this piece of timber on the pit, and two men were sawing it—I looked all round it—it is Mr. Brassey's property—while Mr. Knowles was gone for a policeman I watched the pit—a man told me something—I went to a shed and saw a man who had been sawing the timber, putting some pieces of timber through a hole in the roof, and the other man who had been sawing the timber, and the prisoner, were outside in the yard, close to the shed—I called to the young sawyer, and said they might keep on throwing out, for I was watching them—I found these four pieces, and several more in the shed—this one has the initials on it; they have been taken out of the others—I am quite positive that these are Mr. Brassey's.</p>

I was called by Mr. Knowles on 9th Nov.—I went to the pit, and saw this piece of wood—I saw the prisoner at his house—I asked him who the piece of timber belonged to on the saw-pit—he replied, "It belongs to me; have not they cut it?"—I asked him to come round to the back of the house—there were fifteen pieces of timber there—I asked him if he knew anything of them—he said, "No"—I pointed to the hole in the shed, and said they came out of there I thought—he said no, they never were on his premises—I asked him to come over to his shed, and then this piece, marked "T. B.," was found in my presence—he said he had bought some of Mr. Crawley.</p>

                  </hi>. I know this long piece of timber—I saw it on the railway side a few days before it was taken out of the prisoner's possession—Crawley was employed to watch the gates of the Company—he was not in the employ of Mr. Brassey—on 10th Nov. I went to examine some cottages of the prisoner's—I saw some pieces of Mr. Brassey's wood that were built into the wall—I considered I had no right to remove them—the prisoner keeps a beer-shop—he is a coal-merchant and a potato dealer, and several other things—his yard is about two hundred yards from the line—he is building the cot<lb></lb>tages about thirty yards from the line.</p>

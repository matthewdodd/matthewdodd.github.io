                  </hi>. I am a ginger-beer maker, and live at 7, Hercules<lb></lb>terrace, Lambeth—on Monday night, 13th October, I was at the Victoria Theatre, selling refreshments in the pit; a boy came up to me, bought two almond cakes, price 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and gave me a sixpence, which I put in my waist<lb></lb>coat-pocket—I gave him five penny pieces in change—I only had a half-crown in my waistcoat-pocket—the boy went to his mother, the prisoner, and she then gave him a shilling, and the boy came to me again for a bottle of ginger-beer, which was 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I served him and he gave me a shilling, which I put in my waistcoat pocket, and gave the boy the sixpence which he had given me before, and five penny pieces—he then went back to the prisoner, and she said I had given her a bad sixpence—I said it was the same that she gave the little boy to give to me—she said it was not, and she would go for a policeman—the boy went and sat in the seat—he did not move—the prisoner went out; I worked through the seats and came out too—I then saw the prisoner with a constable—the constable told her to fetch the boy—she went and stopped there about five minutes—I then found the shilling was bad—I am quite sure it was the one the boy had given me—I had taken no other money—I told the constable it was bad, and he went into the pit of the theatre and took the prisoner into custody—I gave him the shilling; the prisoner had the sixpence back again.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, L</hi> 132). I was on duty at the Victoria Theatre, on the night of Monday, 13th October, at the front door—the prisoner called to me at the door, and brought a bad sixpence—she said the last witnesses gave it to her little boy in change—I saw him immediately afterwards—he came to the door to me, and said the little boy had given it to him—I then asked the woman to go for the little boy—she went into the pit and sat down, and did not come back again—about five or six minutes afterwards, in consequence of something Cundle told me about another piece of money, I went into the pit, and found the prisoner sitting about four seats from the stage, and the little boy sitting by her side—I brought her out, and she was charged with passing a bad shilling as well as a sixpence—she said she had not done so—these are the coins (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked her what money she had got about her, and she handed me her purse—I examined the contents, and found six good shillings, a good half-crown, a bad shilling, and two bad sixpences—going towards the station, I asked what she had got in her hands, and she handed me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., in copper money—at the station she was handed over to the female searcher to be examined, and a short time afterwards the searcher, in the prisoner's presence, handed me over a bad sixpence and a halfpenny, and said she had got it from the prisoner's pocket; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the prisoner said nothing to that—there is a parade-ground adjoining the station—it was near half-past 10 when the prisoner was brought to the station—she was left perhaps a couple of minutes in the parade-ground, but not by herself; one of the reserve men who was on duty was left in charge of her; I don't know his name; he is one of the A reserve men—on the following morning L 185 pointed out a spot to me—I was not there when anything was found.</p>

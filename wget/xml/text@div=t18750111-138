                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Abraham Rowe of 128, Pimlico Road—we keep a lodging house there—I have a son named Joseph nine-teen years of age and another named John who is seventeen—Joseph lodged with us—the prisoner William Bagley lodged with us—I do not know how many lodgers we had in the house on 26th December—there might be twenty, thirty or forty—we have a room downstairs for ourselves and there is a kitchen upstairs, a very large room, for the lodgers—on the evening of 26th December about 6.30 my husband, my son Joseph and I were having supper</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110042"></xptr>
               <p>in our apartment downstairs—I heard the footsteps of five or six persons go up into the kitchen—my husband and Joseph went up to see what was the matter and I followed in about two minutes—there were about five strangers in the kitchen and William Bagley—my husband said to the strangers "Young men go out, you don't lodge here"—Patrick Bagley who was one of then said "We wants John Rowe we will murder him"—my husband said "Go out young man, you don't lodge here"—Patrick then took up a shovel from inside the fender, which was formerly used for digging, a kind of spade that we used to put coke on the fire—it had a short handle, about 10 or 12 inches of wood and the rest was iron—he felled my husband to the ground with it—Joseph said "Do not kill my poor father for he is an old man;" he is 65—with that Patrick knocked my son down with his fist—I did not see the shovel after that—then three or four of them started kicking him when they had got him down—both the prisoners took part in that—I said "Do not hit my poor son, you are killing him"—William Bagley then fetched me a severe blow in the face and knocked me down and kicked me in the back severely—I got up again and they were pushing and dragging my son towards the window—both the prisoners had hold of him—they kicked him severely and another man not in custody as well—they took him to the window and William Bagley said "Up with the window and throw him out, that will be the last of the b----"—I came out as well as I could into the passage and Patrick Bagley met me and said "If you take up a weapon I will do for you you b----"—that was. after they had thrown my son but—I escaped into a private room for about two minutes and when I found the way was clear I came down and found my son insen<lb></lb>sible on the ground—he was thrown out at the window before I came out—they threw him out; when William Bagley said "Up with the window" he was thrown out by the two prisoners and the man not in custody and another young man whom I do not know—there were five altogether but four helped to do it—I cannot say who opened the window, but I saw it opened and saw my son thrown out—there had not been any quarrel or dispute between my son John and the others to my knowledge—he was not at home at this time—three weeks before this there was something about a shirt—my son had let William Bagley have it and he did not pay for it and when he was asked for it he took it off and gave it to my son Joseph—but there were no words nor yet blows then—my son was attended by two doctors—he was insensible and bleeding from the mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not take up any weapon—I had not power to do so—we were all peaceable and quiet, and offered no violence whatever—I did not take up a broom; there was one there—I did not use it, or any of our party—there was no provocation that I know of from us—the height of the window is 13 feet 10 inches from the ground; it has been measured—a wall runs up about 10 feet outside the window, which is about 4 feet wide—there was nothing between the window and the ground to prevent my son falling—I have never known any of the lodgers get through the window by means of the wall—the window is 3 feet from the wall—I never knew any one to get in or out that way—there was only my son, my husband, and myself in the room of our party—it lasted about ten or twelve minutes altogether.</p>

               <p>into the kitchen—I went up immediately afterwards, hearing rather a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> over head; my wife and son followed—I saw the prisoners there, and four or five young men with them, who did not lodge there—I begged of them to leave the house quietly—I asked them to be so kind as to leave and not kick up any <hi rend="italic">row</hi> at all—the prisoners called out "We wants John Rowe, we will murder him"—my son Joseph went and shook hands with Patrick and asked him to be quiet, and to be so kind as to leave the room—Patrick went to the fire-place, took up a shovel, brought it across the room, and struck me on the head, and cut my head open—it knocked me down—Joseph said "Don't kill my father," and he was immediately knocked down by William Bagley, and when he was down they kept kicking him over the room, they kicked him to the fire-place—both the prisoners did so, and three or four more besides—after that I left the room to see if I could get a constable, and when I came back my son was lying on my bed bleeding very much from the mouth and nose—we had not done anything to excite the prisoners or had a word with one of them.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187501110044"></xptr>
               <p>was that I was thrown out at the window on the flagstones on my hip bone—I tried to get up, but fell again—I cannot remember anything afterwards till my mouth was being sewn up by a doctor—I believe I was in bed then—the doctor was there, But I don't remember seeing him—I do not remem<lb></lb>ber anything after that till I came to next morning—I did not hear my father or mother do anything to provoke this assault—I am pretty nearly well now, but I can feel my hip if I walk or stand.</p>

               <p>conscious, his conservation was perfectly cherent in every respect—I found several bruises in various regions of the body, particularly the region of the hip—they were not severe bruises—the bruise on the hip was the most severe—there was very little discolouration—he has complained since of considerable pain—he is a very wiry sort of man, not the sort of man that would be easily bruised much—there were superficial bruises on the back of the head, and under the external lip I found a horizontal wound about an inch long in length, but internally about 1 1/2-inch in length, the two wounds being separated by a very thin partition, the lip was almost cut through—he was not in any danger—he could not leave his bed, and I gave him directions not to leave it—I stitched up the wound—the bruises about the head and body were such as I should expect to find if he had been kicked—there were four or five bruises on the head, and six or seven on the body—the wound on the lip was most likely caused by a blow with the fist—I attended him for nearly a fortnight—I found that necessary—I thought, considering the height of the window, that the injuries he sustained were very slight indeed—I thought some of the bones would have been broken, it was am acadamised road with rough stones—he did not fall on his head, at any rate.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at 128, Pimlico Road,. Chelsea—on boxing night I was in the kitchen—I saw William Bagley there—I can't speak to Patrick—I saw several persons come in, and there was a regular public-house or lodging house brawl—I don't know how it com<lb></lb>menced—Joseph Rowe said to me "For God Almighty's sake protect me"—no one was hurting him that I could see—he said "They intend murdering me, and I intend jumping out of the window"—I said "For God Almighty's sake don't do that"—and he went and got out of the window himself—I was close to him—he put one leg over first, and then the other, and got out—he opened the window himself, and I supposed he was trying to get on to the wall that is close underneath, whether he got a slip or no I can't say, he let himself down somehow or other—the Bagley's were nowhere anigh him at the time—there was no one near him but me, and I am an old man and meant to get out of it as quickly as I could—he was trying to escape from the row, to escape from these people—I believe he was excited and did not know what he was doing, but he certainly got out of the window of his own accord—he went out altogether.</p>

Bagley gave Mrs. Grant the present landlady, some money to go and fetch some beer for his brother and friends—soon after Joseph Rowe and his father came up, and the father pulled his jacket off and said he would fight the best man in the room, that was without any provocation of any sort—there was not a word said before—I don't know what he was going to fight them for—soon after a row occurred in the kitchen among them, and when they were fighting some of them were on the floor and some of them were standing up—I can't say who were on</p>

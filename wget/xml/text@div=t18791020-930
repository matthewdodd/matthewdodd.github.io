                  </hi>. I carry on business with my brother as bullion dealers at Cornhill—I knew the prisoner some years before 1876—he had been employed at Baum's, in Lombard Street, who carried on a similar busi<lb></lb>ness, and failed about that time, and he was thrown out of employment—he called on us at Cornhill, and asked us to engage him in our business—we said that we had no vacancy—he mentioned his connection with Baum's, and suggested that he might be useful, and eventually we took offices in Fenchurch Street, where I and my partners paid 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year rent, and we had telegraphic communication laid on between Cornhill and the branch in Fenchurch Street—we found the bullion and capital lor the branch business</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187910200064"></xptr>
               <p>—the prisoner was in the first instance to receive one-third of the gross profits made, hut we dismissed him at the end of November, 1876, and he was away from the business for a fortnight, and one of our clerks from Comhill took charge of it—the prisoner was then re-engaged at a salary of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, which he was to draw from his cash, and to receive half of the gross profits after 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that arrangement continued till July last, when he was discharged.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GRAIN</hi>. I assert positively that he was our clerk and servant—the name of H. Harris was placed over the door in Fenchurch Street—he had not full control of the office business there, but he had as much control as our managing partner had—there was no one there as a rule to assist him, but somebody would go occasionally from our office—he had full power to buy what he pleased and sell what he pleased as far as money-changing was concerned; he made his own prices—he had business cards with the address on them "H. Harris and Co.," describing the business in German, French, and English—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of them—supposing an emigrant coming from abroad and wishing to dispose of bills, the prisoner had authority to buy them; and he was entitled, if they were going to Germany, to draw in his own name on bankers abroad in order to give persons a draft in Germany—his name would be on drafts on bankers in Berlin and Frankfort—our names were not on the drafts which he drew—he could exercise his own discretion with reference to such drafts to what amount he pleased, but he was told to consult us on any business of import<lb></lb>ance—he could not draw on bankers in his own name and transact business in his own name without asking us for instructions on whom he should draw—he was not empowered to draw for a certain amount on foreign bankers in his own name, but he did so with our knowledge, and those drafts were circulated without our name being on them—persons sometimes came to us at Cornhill with crossed cheques and asked us to change them—we did not then give them the card of Harris and Co. as an independent firm, and send them there to get them changed; we may have done so, but I don't recollect an instance; we were in the habit of sending Harris all business which was too small for us—I remember the prisoner changing a cheque for a person named Jackson—they may have applied to Cornhill first, and I may have sent them on with Harris's card; I do not remember—Mr. Glazier the cashier, or my brother would see such a customer—we are not in the habit of dealing in crossed cheques, and if one is brought in, no doubt it would be brought by a stranger—crossed cheques are not understood on the Continent, and persons having them wish to turn them into money, and English strangers have brought in English cheques crossed, but we do not change them; it is not the regular course of business—the prisoner could change them if he chose to make the inquiries, which we did not choose to make—it is not the regular course of business for a money-changer to change a crossed cheque for a perfect stranger—a man named Jackson was tried here who had passed a cheque which was changed by Harris, and we subpœnaed Harris as a witness, and inquiries were made through Messrs. Wontner and Son in reference to the cheque which passed through our bank—that cheque was changed by Harris and sent back by him to us, and passed through our bankers—I do not remember Jackson coming to us—the prisoner started with a certain amount of bullion as his stock-in-trade—it was his habit to send the bullion-bag from Fenchurch Street to Cornhill every night, and it</p>

               <p>was placed in the Cornhill office—"bullion" means not only coin, but notes as well in our business, and if, when it was there, some one came for some particular class of currency which we had not got, we should go to the bag and take out what we wanted and put a memorandum into the bag, a kind of I O U to replace the amount we took out—we made no permanent record in any book beyond that slip dropped into the bag—my brother would de the same if he required it, and also the cashier—if we were short of any particular currency before the bag came back we sent and borrowed it from Fenchuroh Street—by "we"I mean the three of us—we should inquire by telegram if he had got it, and then send a memorandum slip representing the amount lent—Harris had no business to change crossed cheques without ascertaining what he was doing—he did not speculate, nor did we share the profits of it; he was forbidden to do so—the cash-book was before him, and as he bought anything he entered it on one side, and as he sold, on the other; every one of the occurrences named in the indictment is properly entered on one side or the other; all the sums mentioned in the indictment relate to sums mentioned in this book, and it is from the book that our clerks have made up the accounts that they have—from this book he would post to the ledger and the stock-book—this is the foundation for all the set of books—3,310 marks are entered on 14th January, 1879, as having been purchased by him—we occasionally act as bankers, and allow people to have balances and cheque-books—we opened an account with Harris, and he re<lb></lb>ceived a cheque-book with blank forms, and if he had not coin to pay customers he drew cheques on us, signed "Harris and Co."—all the entries of the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week are merely put down under expenditure account "Harris 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there is no entry of "Harris, wages," or "salary"—it was necessary to put down the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week under the expenditure account before we could arrive at the profit which had to be divided.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> We do a large business at our principal office in ex<lb></lb>changing coupons—I cannot remember whether we paid for the printing of Harris's cards—when he had not money in stock he drew on us, and if one of our clerks was in charge of his office for a time he would sign cheques—he would telegraph to us to say that he wanted more bullion, and if we had it we supplied it—it did not often happen that we wanted it—if he changed a crossed cheque it would come back with the other money from his office to us, and would pass through the accounts—we opened an account in Paris in the name of H. Harris and Co.—this is a copy of our letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was in French, it wot dated</hi> 22<hi rend="italic">nd January</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">from Burt and Co. to a banker in Paris, asking him to open an account in the name of H.

                  </hi>. I am in business with my brother and Mr. Procketon as bullion dealers at 71, Cornhill—on the failure of Baum and Co., the prisoner came to us for employment, and haying no vacancy for him, we eventually established this French business in Fenchurch Street—our firm signed an agreement for the lease, and supplied entirely the cash for carry<lb></lb>ing on the business—he was to act alone at Fenchurch Street, and in order that he might have advice from us we had a private telegraph laid on between Fenchurch Street and Cornhill, for which our firm made an agree<lb></lb>ment with the Post-office—he had to render us an account of his dealings every quarter, which he did satisfactorily till the end of 1878, and there was no difficulty in obtaining the books from him—on the business of last year the gross profits were about 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and as he had half of the profits, over 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that would be 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in addition to his salary—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the quarterly statement he sent in on 31st March this year, of the different kinds of bullion in stock; it is his writing—after we got that the books were not sent as usual; we repeatedly applied for them, and were not able to get them—we asked him for them, and he said that they were not quite in order; he was getting on with them—the matter went on till June, and on 30th June he sent in this statement, purporting to show the amount of bullion he had in hand—we again applied for the books, and were unable to get them—I telegraphed to him on 25th July, and as it produced no result I sent a clerk to him on Saturday—early on the morning of the 28th I waited in a doorway opposite till Harris came—I followed him into the office, and asked him what was the meaning of such extraordinary conduct, referring to the previous Saturday, when he had left the office, taking the key with him—he made no reply—I said "Are the books in order?"—he said "They are"—I said "Why did you not send them as you promised?"—he said that I should find them all in order, with all the lists attached, and gave them to me with the lists—I said "I shall take them to the office, and have them verified in ordinary course; after your conduct we shall not require your services any more; if you have any communication to make you know where to find us, and we shall have occasion to communicate with you before long'—the bag of bullion was not allowed to go back after it came to our office on the Friday night—I found the ledger was made up to 31st March only, and the stock book was only partly made up—I had them posted up by our clerk—I found this piece of paper on the premises with this stock list. (<hi rend="italic">These were the draft accounts of</hi> 31<hi rend="italic">st March</hi>)—this shows that the value of the bullion in stock on 31st March was 542<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; I have compared the ledger with the cash book, and find that he ought to have had 1,043<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—there is no heading to this; it is merely some figures resulting in that sum; it is the balance of the different accounts in the ledger—between those two amounts there is a deficiency of 501<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; the balance of the ledger on 30th June shows that there should be 1,141<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that the deficiency on 30th June was increased to 563<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is a list of the bullion found in the bag on 28th July; it is 582<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the ledger at page 436 shows that it should he 1,157<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that the deficiency had increased to 557<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I prepared this table (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the books, showing the deficiency in</p>

               <p>the different kinds of bullion, and it shows a deficiency on 30th March, 30th J line, and 28th July—I find in the stock book in Harris's writing an entry on page 19 of the purchase of 310 Prussian notes bought on 14th January, 1879, and in the cash book at page 198, on 4th February, 920 Prussian marks—that entry is omitted altogether in the stock book—I find in the stock book at page 30 an entry on 1st February, 1879, of 200 francs French notes purchased by Harris, and by the cash book at page 230 I find that the actual purchase on that date was 2,200 francs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-easamined.</hi> Up to 31st March the ledger which he posted up him<lb></lb>self is correct with the piece of paper which was found—it shows that he ought to have had 1,043<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in hand—the ledger is posted from the cash-book—he has entered 920 marks on 4th February in the ledger, and entered it properly in the ledger in the total of the day—he has made a perfectly complete entry in two out of three books—he was our clerk and servant, and we could have gone and looked at the books and found that on 31st March he ought to have had 1,043<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or we could have fetched the books away—the balance of 31st March was made up about six weeks before—we did not have the books till July, when I took possession of them—it was no use getting them unless they were made up—when he started, in addition to the cards a circular was issued in his name—Mr. Brockton looks after the general management with my brother—we were all three present at the arrangement—we wrote a letter to a Prussian gentleman, saying that Harris was to have the sole signature—he had full liberty to go to his office when he pleased, leave when he pleased, and do what he pleased—it was his duty to attend in the ordinary busi<lb></lb>ness hours—there were ordinary rules of business—he would not take a holiday without our permission, I swear that—he had not to ask out per<lb></lb>mission when persons wanted to change crossed cheques, but as a rule he had to ask us when he drew on a foreign banker, but it depended entirely on the amount—he had a right to do it, and he did it on many occasions—I am not aware of any speculations which he entered into—I know of no transactions outside of what we call legitimate ones for him to go into which he went into, and which left a profit which we participated in—the purchase and sale of bills every day is supposed to leave a profit, but we did not know of every transaction which took place—we frequently sold 30,000 and 50,000 francs to Venablea and Co. on Paris—I have not the remotest recollection of drawing a cheque on my Paris bankers payable to the order of Harris and Co.—our books would show it, and it would be legitimate business—I have no recollection of asking Harris to sell to Venables and Co. 30,000 francs on Paris, as the exchange was rising, but it could have occurred—if a cheque was drawn payable to Harris and Co. it would have to be endowed, and they would have their name there—700 Austrian coupons does not remind me of a transaction between us and 'Harris—Kulb and Go. are money-changers—we may have had to sell them some Austrian coupons, but I know nothing about it—when we did not want our name to appear the prisoner would do the transactions in the name of Harris and Co., and they would appear in our books—I know that inquiries were made about a crossed cheque changed by Jackson—I cannot say whether we said that our books contained no record of the trans<lb></lb>action—I have no doubt we referred them to Harris and Co.—my brother is the senior partner—that very cheque had gone through our bankers and</p>

               <p>appeared in our cash-book—I cannot say whether we returned Harris's name to the Income Tax Commissioners as one of our clerks liable to income tax—I have never seen the return—my brother attended to that—Harris no doubt made an independent return at Fenchurch Street—I do not think my brother has mentioned that the bag was always taken at night by the prisoner and brought back at night by him, until he broke his leg, and then he used to give in an account of his transactions during the day—there was a gross profit all through of about 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from 1876 to 1878, with<lb></lb>out the 570<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd which we say is deficient, and there is really more than that—Baum and Co. were a well-known firm of money-changers, and we took the prisoner from there because we thought we should get the connection of the fallen house—what clients he had we have now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> As to Jackson, the name of the banker would appear in our cash accounts; any other entries would appear in the books of Harris and Co.—if the draft on Paris for 30,000 occurred it would appear no doubt in the prisoner's books, and so would the 700 Austrian coupons—I have no knowledge of any such transactions, nor have they been pointed out to me in the books—we have no means of testing whether the trans<lb></lb>actions in the cash-book really took place—we had to take the prisoner's account of what he professed to have bought and sold during the day—he professes to have bought 3,314 marks on 14th January, and that appears as a charge against us—we are charged indirectly of course—at page 198 the 3,314 marks are carried out as 116<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—in the account the prisoner kept it is charged as money belonging to us, but spent by him in the purchase of those marks, and on the other side there is 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in bank notes which he received of us that day—the ledger is a posting of the cash-book, and tallies with it—in order to see whether we really have the stock which he professes to have bought it is necessary to turn to the stock account, and on doing so I find that he has left out the 3,000 marks with which he has charged us—he never complained of any loss of money or deficiency from any transaction which had taken place—the only suggestion was made at the Mansion House—all the materials for the stock-book are found in the cash-book.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk to the prosecutors at Cornhill—I entered by their instructions from the cash-book to the stock-book the various matters—I don't know whether I have correctly entered all the purchases and sales, but I have had them checked—I can see by his writing up to what date the prisoner checked the stock-book.</p>

            ). Q. Do you know Mr. Vigurs? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a tailor, and a man of considerable property? - A. He is a man of considerable property.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he so stated at the trial? - A. He was, on the trial, stated to be worth full 20,000 pounds, by Mr. Vaillant, the Counsel for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you call at the office of the defendant? - A. On the Saturday, in consequence of the paragraph appearing in the Public Ledger, I, in company with Mr. Roberts, called at the office of Mr. Crowder, where the Public Ledger was printed and published, as we understood; upon our going into the office, we saw a clerk; we enquired for Mr. Crowder, and were informed that he was not at home; we left our names, and for what purpose we called.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. Whose name did you leave? - A. I left my name, and Mr. Roberts's, who was attorney for the family, and a most intimate friend of the family; I had to defend the defendant in that case; he went with me as a friend, and not in the capacity of attorney; Mr. Roberts attended as the friend of Mrs. Vigurs with me, as the solicitor of Mrs. Vigurs: On the Monday following, Mr. Crowder sent me a paper, containing a paragraph contradicting the former one.</p>
               <p>Q.Be so good as to read the offensive paragraph first? - A.(Beads)" A woman who keeps a lodging-house, and whose husband, a tailor, was stated to be worth 20,000 pounds, was tried for stealing three bushels of coals, the property of a gentleman who had apartments in her house; her maid-servant appeared as a witness against her, and she was found guilty."</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. The indictment stated three pecks of coals; paragraph states three bushels of coals; and therefore I think this indictment impossible to be sustained.</p>
               <p>Court. It will be for the Jury to decide whether this paragraph applies to the same transaction</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetham. I was going to state, that on the Monday following, I received a paper, which I presume came from Mr. Crowder, with a paragraph contradicting the one that had been stated in the former paper, which I have here, (produces it;) it was directed to Mr. Chetham, solicitor, Falcon-square; in that newspaper is the paragraph, which I will read, if you think proper.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. If you please.</p>
               <p>Mr. Chetham. (Read.)" In the account which we gave in our paper of Saturday, of a trial of a person charged with stealing the coals of a lodger, our reporter gave an erroneous statement of the result; the party accused was acquitted." It is under the title of Westminster Sessions.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not since had any other application from the solicitor of Mr. Crowder to make any satisfaction that you should think proper? - A. I will tell you the sort of manner in which that proposition was made.</p>
               <p>Q. I do not want to go into any conversation; I want to know whether the name of Mr. Barry had not been given up to you as the author of that paragraph? - A. I do not know how to answer that; Mr. Shepherd certainly did name such a person, but not exactly as the author.</p>
               <p>Mr. Harrison. Q. Were you present during the whole of the day of that trial? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other person tried for stealing coals? - A. No.</p>

            , who stated herself to have been the maid-servant of Mrs. Vigurs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Public Ledger of the succeeding day? - A. I did; and saw the paragraph that has been read, which I understood to apply most completely to Mrs. Vigurs.</p>
               <p>Q.What is her Christian name? - A.Charlotte; her husband's name is John; I went on the Saturday evening with Mr. Chetham, Mr. Crowder was not at home; we left a message respecting that paragraph; we likewise left out addresses in writing; on Monday, the 27th of October, I received this newspaper under cover; it is the same as that Mr. Chetham has produced.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Tuesday, did you see Mr. Crowder in his office? - A. I did; I complained to him of the enormity of the paragraph; his answer was, did I not receive a paper on the preceding day, in which he said he had made an apology; I admitted that I had; Mr. Crowder added, and that is the only concession I can make; I then said, Mr. Crowder, this is not enough, I come here to request, and even to require, the author of it; Mr. Crowder made a pause; he hesitated, and said, that a Mr. Barry, an Irish barrister, who was occasionally<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180105200071"></xptr>the reporter of the Sessions and Old-Bailey trials, had brought it to his office; I then required to see the manuscript of it, which he denied me, alledging that some correction or alteration, he believed, had been made, or might have been made, I cannot say which; and he would not shew it; I repeated my request again, and said, Mr. Crowder, I must request of you to give me up the author; he would not shew me the manuscript, nor give up any other author than he had given up, Mr. Barry; I told him, if he did not, Mr. Vigurs, who was three hundred miles from town, at Penzance, upon his return, would make him give an account of his conduct; he then said, I shall give you no farther information, you may do just as you please, or take what course you please, I conceive I know what course you can take, you can bring an action against me, and I shall suffer judgment to go by default; you can recover only trifling damages and your costs; I then bid him good morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp Q.Have you told us exactly every thing that passed at the time you went to Mr. Crowder's, and saw him? - A. I think I have, but it is impossible to recollect every word.</p>
               <p>Q. He did give you the name of the author? - A.He did.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you made any application to Mr. Barry, at all? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Did he not state to you, that he had looked for the manuscript, but could not find it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say that he could not immediately find it, but if he could find it, he would new it you? - A. He did not; he positively refused.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that he has offered to shew it? - A. I do not know it; there was an application, I understand, made to Mr. Chetham the other day to settle it, but not in my presence.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not Mr. Crowder offer to make any apology that you should require? - A.Never, to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know of your own knowledge, that we were ready to make every apology beyond that of giving you the name of the author, that you should require? - A. I know nothing of it myself, but from Mr. Chetham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gorney. Q.Have you ever seen Mr. Crowder, but upon that occasion? - A. I do not know that I ever saw him, but upon that occasion</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure that Mr. Crowder did not offer you the paper that you required? - A. He positively denied it</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you that it had been lost or destroyed? - A. I state most positively not.</p>

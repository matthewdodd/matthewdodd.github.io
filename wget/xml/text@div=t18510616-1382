                  </hi>. I am a seaman. I was paid off from the <hi rend="italic">Antelope</hi> at Woolwich, on 17th May, and went to the London Coffee-house there, where I met Elizabeth King—the prisoner was there, and I got into conversation with him, and had coffee and bread-and-butter—the conversation brought on that I had sailed with his father and brother-in-law, four years ago; and I told him I was going to Chatham by the 4 o'clock train, and if he liked to accom<lb></lb>pany me he should have plenty to eat and drink, and a suit of clothes—I saw Louisa Baker at the coffee-house, and we all came out together, and went to the Castle Inn, where we had some drink, and I changed a sovereign to pay for it—I took my watch and chain out of my pocket, in front of the bar, and gave them to the prisoner, and he put them on my neck—I then received the change, and while getting it, the prisoner said, "George, your watch wants winding up;" be took it off my neck again, and I have never seen it since—while getting the change it went <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> out of my mind—we all went out together, and when we got to the bottom of the street I found the prisoner was gone, and I did not see him again till he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is in Woolwich Dock-yard. On 17th May I was with Oliver and Baker at the Castle, and saw the prisoner there—I saw Oliver pull out some silver and a sovereign, and a watch, and he asked the prisoner to put it round his neck, and that was done—while Oliver was getting change the prisoner said, "Your watch is not wound up"—Oliver took his hat off, and the prisoner took the watch off him—Oliver and the prisoner went out, and we followed them in a few minutes—I had not seen the prisoner give Oliver back the watch—at the bottom of Ayre-street the prisoner said he would be back again shortly—we went to the Crown and Anchor—Oliver went to see the time by his watch, and it was not there—I never saw the prisoner again till he was in custody—Oliver was perfectly sober.</p>

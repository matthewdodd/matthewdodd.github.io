                  </hi> I am a prisoner in Millbank, under sentence of transportation—I was tried in January for stealing this damask—I entered the service of Messrs. Druce and Co. in Aug, last—I had before that been in the service of Messrs. Wilcoxon for two years—the prisoner was in their employ as carman—I had some transactions with him while I was in the employ of Wilcoxon about some horse-hair seating—I know this damask; it is the pro<lb></lb>perty of Messrs. Druce—I took it at different times from 200, Regent-street by the prisoner's 'persuasion—I first saw the prisoner about a week after I went to live at Messrs Druce's—I met him at the Blue Posts in King-street, Regent-street, which is kept by Wright—he had a van with him with the name of Wilcoxon on it—he asked how I liked my situation, and if I could get anything away—I said I would see—he did not say what he would do with it—an evening or two afterwards I went to his cousin's, for some physic, at No. 13, Gloucester-street—the prisoner was there, he asked me if I could get anything away, as he was in want of money—I said I would, and accord<lb></lb>ingly I took fifty yards of tarbaret to his lodging at 3, Bateman-row, Curtain-road—it was in a brown paper parcel—I delivered the parcel to Mrs. Inwards, the prisoner's landlady—I took afterwards two pieces of silk and worsted damask, tied up in canvass; I gave them to Mrs. Inwards—I got some money from the prisoner on account of the goods, and previous to that I had received 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of him—he knew the goods came from Regent-street—I told him I had brought down to his place two pieces of silk and worsted damask—this piece of crimson silk damask I took about the beginning of October—I took it to the prisoner's cousin at 13, Gloucester-street—I saw both the prisoner and his cousin there—the prisoner untied it, looked at it, and said it was very good—he asked his cousin to let it remain there till the morning, when he would take it away in the van; and with his cousin's permission, the prisoner put it under the bed till the morning—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his cousin asked me if I could get some carpet to cover his room—I told him I would see, as he had given me some physic, and let the silk remain—I took eleven yards of carpet and a hearth-rug, which I sent by the parcels delivery; but I had put Gilbert-street on it instead of Gloucester-street, and I went, and they had not received it—I went to the parcels delivery, and altered the direction, and it was sent—when I called there the prisoner was there—his cousin said it was too good; and the prisoner said, "Let it remain till the morning, and I will take it away in the van"—the prisoner rolled up the carpet, and put it under the bed—the next Sunday I saw the prisoner again, and we went to the elder Armeut's—we asked him if he had got any money for the goods—I did not hear what Arment said—I afterwards took some other carpet to the prisoner's cousin's, as the Brussels carpet would not do, and at the time I was there the prisoner came—he said the Brussels carpet was sold for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said it was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for me, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for him, and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his cousin—I asked if he had any money for the crimson silk—he said no, but he would have shortly—I saw him afterwards at a public-house, and he paid me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—I afterwards let him have this buff and the yellow silk—I put them in the back of the van; he came and took them.</p>

Wilcoxon's, I lived with Mr. Williams, a chair<lb></lb>maker—I never took anything away from him; I can bring my master to prove it—I was employed in chair-polishing—before that I had lived at a brew-house at Poplar with my brother—the carpet was intended for the prisoner's cousin, but the quality being too good, the prisoner and his cousin decided it should be sold, and the produce shared—the prisoner's cousin was aware it was stolen—he offered to come and take anything away that I could give him—I only went once to Arment—no person was there but the pri<lb></lb>soner and his cousin and me—no one can speak to these matters except those who had a criminal knowledge of the transaction—on two occasions I took property to the prisoner's lodging—the person is here who will prove that she took it from me—I asked her to be so kind as to give it to the prisoner when he came home—I could not leave it with his wife, she was deranged—the prisoner was living with his wife—I did not tell the landlady what it was—it was about fifty yards of silk tabaret—no one saw what the parcel contained; it was folded up, sealed, and a string tied round it—I never took any more like that—I then took two pieces of silk and worsted, wrapped in canvas—I do not know on what day I first went, but it was about a week or a fort<lb></lb>night after I had been in the employ of Messrs. Druce—I went there in August—I took the second parcel about a week after I took the first—that was in canvas with string tied round it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter, in the employ of Fisher and Son. I live in Gloucester-street, Curtain-road—the prisoner is my first cousin—I know Chester—I remember his bringing the piece of crimson damask to my house—the prisoner took it away next morning—I cannot exactly say where it was put between the time of Chester bringing it and my cousin taking it away; it was in the room, I could not say whether it was under the bed or on a chair—Chester requested me to let it remain during the night—I re<lb></lb>member some carpet being brought to me by the Parcels Delivery Company, Chester said he would make me a present of a carpet, and instead of that he sent me a carpet and a rug—I refused to accept it; it was too good for me, and my cousin took it away, by Chester's request, the next morning—I got a little-bit of drugget stuff instead of it, which was found on my premises by the officer—I remember going with my cousin and Chester one Sunday to Kingsland-road—I and Chester waited in Kingsland-road while my cousin</p>

               <p>called on some friend, and he was not at home—the bit of drugget was all that I ever had.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How was the parcel of carpet directed that came by the Parcels Delivery Company? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Chester opened it—I dare say it was addressed to me, but I never saw the direction—Chester told me he would make me a present of the carpet; my cousin had nothing to do with it—I was not exactly aware that it was stolen—I could not say whether he bought it or no—I had my doubt about the carpet and hearth-rug not being come by honestly, and therefore I would not have it; that was all that I saw at my place, beside the damask—I had got some medicine for Chester; that was the only reason I was a favourite of his—I had not received any money of him; I begged the medicine of my employer.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of James Inwards; I live at 3, Bateman-row. The prisoner lodged with me six years, up to about Christmas, as near as I can tell—he did not give me notice when he was going—he went away on a Friday, and I did not see him again—I remember two parcels being brought by some one; I could not swear it was by Chester; I believe it was him—they were wrapped in brown paper—the same person brought the two parcels—I do not remember a parcel being brought in canvas—I took the parcels in-doors, and laid them in the chair till morning—I did not see the prisoner—I said, "There is a parcel for you," and he said, "All right."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Crosg-examined. Q.</hi> I suppose you had several parcels left with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to my knowledge—I had been in the habit of managing the prisoner's concerns for him—his wife is insane—I found him an honest quiet man—the two parcels were brought to me both enclosed in brown paper; I never saw one in canvas; if there had been one in canvas I must have seen it—if a man has sworn he delivered a canvas parcel to me he swore what was false; I never received it.</p>

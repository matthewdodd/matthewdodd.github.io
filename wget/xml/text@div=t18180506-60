I did not like the company, and went into the parlour, and had a pint of beer. There were four or five bad women in the tap-room, which made me go into the parlour. The prisoner, Thomas, came in, and appeared inclined to take indecent liberties with me. I went into the yard, put my watch into my waistcoat pocket, returned into the parlour, and found her still there. She suddenly got up, and I missed my watch soon after - I told the mistress of the house. There was no other person in the room.</p>

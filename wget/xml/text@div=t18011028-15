               <p>Q. Was the black one the horse you missed from the pasture? - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the two prisoners doing in the stable when you went there? - A. I did not see them do any thing there; I went into the town, and afterwards saw them; they were a very little distance apart; Ellis mounted Mr. Staples's horse, and tried to ride away, then I seized Price, and said, he was my prisoner for stealing horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in Ellis's hearing? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Ellis do? - A. He tried to ride away, and rode over a Welch runt; the horse knocked the runt down, and fell over it, and threw the man off; this was not above two or three rods from Mrs. Neale's; I found the other bay horse at Whetstone, at Mr. Freeman's, which I had lost from the pasture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Were those horses turned out by you? - A. By my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with your servant? - A. No; but I was in the yard when they came from the stable.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your servant here? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Or whether he saw that you were taking Price at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The horse Elis was upon, was not your horse? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. For the last five months, you don't know, perhaps? - A. I know so far as the time he lodged with me, and for the other time, to the best of my knowledge, he carried on that, and nothing else.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it? - A.Because, if I must speak the truth, I lent him a couple of guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. How are you so sure? - A.Because, in the morning, at half past six, he got up, and said, will you get me some breakfast; I said, I would; he said, have you got the trisle of money by you of two guineas; I said, I have; says he, I will be much obliged to you, if you will lend it to me, and I will pay you when I come back; I said, if you will promise to pay me, I will, and I lent it him on the 1st of September.</p>
               <p>Q. He was going a journey, and would pay you when he came back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He set off on his journey? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say where he was going? - A. To Barnet fair.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clifton. My Lord, I will now call Stevens, the coachman of the Riverhead coach, to prove he took the prisoners down by the coach.</p>
               <p> - STEVENS sworn. - Q. Did you drive the prisoners any where? - A. I took them up at Lewisham, and drove them to Collier's, the White Hart, at Riverhead, on the 1st of September.</p>

               <p>Q. I ask you, upon your oath, never having seen the men before, whether they are the men you took up at Lewisham? - A. That man in the jacket is one (Price.)</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, will you swear that the other is one? - A. In regard to that, I cannot say; his dress is different; it is something like the man.</p>

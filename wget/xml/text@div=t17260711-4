               <p>- Collinson the Constable thus depos'd. Between 11 and 12 at Night, the Prosecutor brought the 2 Prisoners to me at the Watch-house in Thames-street, and accus'd them with stealing from him a Guinea, a Medal, and 5 Shillings; I searched Susan Sly, and in one of her Stockings I found 5 Shillings, and in the other the Medal, which the Prosecutor own'd, and swore to be his before my Lord Mayor, who bound him over to prosecute in a Bond of 30 l. and me in a Bound of 10 l. but yet being unwilling to expose his Character, he has not thought fit to appear against the Prisoners.</p>
               <p>The Prisoners thus made their Defence. The Prosecutor met us in the Street, and invited us to take a Glass of Wine. - We went to the Dog Tavern by Billingsgate, but could not have a Room there,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="172607110002"></xptr> and so we stept over the Way to <placeName id="t17260711-4-crimeloc17">the Gun</placeName>

Then he desir'd us to leave the Medal in pawn, and he'd meet us there another Night and redeem it. - At last he said if we would not pay, he'd send for one that should, and so he sent for his Landlord, who came and clear'd the Reckoning, and then the Prosecutor charged us with picking his Pocket.

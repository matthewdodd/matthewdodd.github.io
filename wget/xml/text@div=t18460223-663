                  </hi>. I am the solicitor to Mr. Levy, the prosecutor of this indictment, and reside in Clifford's-inn. I was employed by him to oppose the defendant on her application for protection from process of the Court of Bankruptcy—I was present at her examination before Mr. Com<lb></lb>missioner Evans, on the 25th of Sept., I believe—I heard her sworn before the Commissioner, by the usher of the Court, to speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth—I examined her on that occasion—I showed her this promissory note, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>,) and said, "Is the signature to that note in your handwriting?"—she said, "No"—(this was not taken down in writing)—I then said, "Did you sign that note in the presence of Mr. Couch and his</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker and pianoforte-maker, and reside at Colchester. In Sept., 1842, Miss Perry came to board and lodge with me and my wife—I had known her before—she was to pay 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for board and lodging, and instruct my children in the pianoforte, if they re<lb></lb>quired it—I had three daughters—the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week was in consideration of the instruction—it would have been more if she had not instructed them—there was no document in writing—she was a teacher of the pianoforte to other pupils in Colchester, and she was to have the use of my piano to instruct her other pupils upon—she continued to board and lodge with me under that agree<lb></lb>ment till about a month after Dec., 1844—my wife left me in Dec., 1844; and in consequence of that, Miss Perry said to me she was advised to leave as soon as she could get employment; she thought she ought not to remain in my house—I said she could remain for a week or two, till she could suit herself, and then leave.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was anything said about the settlement of any matters between you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I said if she would bring her book down, (for she had one similar to this,) we would settle up the accounts, and see what there was due—she had lived in my house more than two years—this is the book I had—it was shown to Miss Perry, and she brought me her book, and I balanced it up like this—there was a balance of 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due from her to me—that was from Sept., 1842—I think some of the account was contracted in April, 1842—this is the book Miss Perry showed to me at the time—it comprehends thirteen weeks in 1842, and the four different quarters in each of the succeeding years—these books were balanced up at different times before—when she paid me money from time to time, this book was brought to me, and I entered it both in hers and mine—there are other items in the book besides the item for board and lodging—there is an item for the funeral expenses of her mother—she signed the book—this is her signature—after the balance was ascer<lb></lb>tained, I said to her I should like a note for the amount—she said if I re<lb></lb>quired it she would give me one—(I have resided in Colchester about four<lb></lb>teen years—I have not been in business above nine)—I sent my son out for a stamp—he brought me one, and I drew the note for 45<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—all the note is my writing, except the signature—after I had drawn it, I read it to her, and asked if she understood it—I read it to her in the kitchen, where we generally take our meals—it is a large room, for dining and breakfasting in—she said she perfectly understood it, and she signed it in my presence and in the presence of my son—my son's signature is attached to it as a witness—I wrote the words "Witness to the signature," and my son put his name to it.</p>

               <p>three or four years ago—I knew Miss Perry's mother—the very first item in this book is a charge for her mother's funeral—I did not know her father—I have no doubt he was a highly respectable solicitor at Colchester—I do not know when he died—I did not know much about the circumstances of Miss Perry and her mother—the mother died, I think, in April, 1842, a few months before Miss Perry came to lodge with me—at that time Miss Perry was labouring as a teacher of music to maintain herself and mother—I do not know the house in which they lived before her father's death, and do not know that it was one of the best houses in Colchester—I am not aware that Miss Perry did any household duties when lodging with me—I am not aware that she assisted Mrs. Couch in preparing dinner and cooking victuals—we kept a servant—she might have assisted without my knowledge—I believe her connections in the neighbourhood of Colchester were of the highest respectability—I do not recollect making the arrangement with Miss Perry about boarding with us, in walking from East<lb></lb>hill, Colchester—I do not recollect where it was that it was agreed she should teach my children for the 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

               <p>asked me where—I said, "In St. John-street"—she then admitted that she had, and I asked her how she could tell me such a falsehood—that was the quarrel—I did not call her any names, except as regards falsehood—I said she had told a lie—I did not, to my knowledge, abuse her in the grossest terms, or call her all manner of names—nothing but the word "liar"—the day on which I had this security for the balance was the 21st of Dec., 1844—I think it was about ten, or ten or eleven in the morning, between breakfast and dinner—it took place in the kitchen—I called her to me at a small dresser in the kitchen—I asked her how much she could let me have this Christmas, but that was after the note was signed—she said, "I will do what I can"—I am not aware of saying, "Can you let me have 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," but she said she would let me have 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect that I said so—I will not be positive whether she said so to me, or I to her—she said, in all probability she would make it up 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after Christmas—she did not say, no, she was sure she could not, but she expected to receive 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., left her by Mr. De Cover, and at soon as she got it I should have it—nothing of the sort—I did not say, "Oh! that is not what I want, I am in such distress to know how I can go on till Christmas"—I wanted money at that time—I was rather in distress to meet my engagements at Christmas—I did not say, "Now I wish you would oblige me with signing this paper" (producing a paper to her)—she took the note from my hand, and read it—she did not take any other paper—there was not on the paper, "I owe Mr. Couch 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I will pay the 21st of Jan., 1845"—I never saw such a paper—she did not say on reading it, "Why, Mr. Couch, I would not put my name to this for the world; it would not be right of me, as I have not 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give; I was never asked to sign anything by anybody in my life"—I did not say, "You don't understand me, Miss Perry, that is not my motive, I merely want to show it is due to me; I have nothing against you in my books"—I was indebted to Mr. Bear, my butcher, at that time—I did not say to her, "Now, if I say to Bear, the butcher, or any others, 'I expect to receive a few pounds from Miss Perry, at Christmas,' they will say, 'We have only your word, Mr. Couch'"—nor did she say, "What can your creditors have to do with me?"—I did not rejoin, "You don't understand me; that is not my motive; I thought you would not refuse to do it, because it can make no difference to you whether you sign it or not"—she did not say, "I shall get into trouble by it," nor did I say, "Why, Miss Perry, do you believe me capable of such a thing?" nor on my faithfully assuring her she should not get into any trouble, did she sign a paper admitting a debt to me of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards received from her a memorandum to apply to the Rev.

               <p>been an erasure of the name in the body of the indentures, in all probability they might think they were got up for the purpose of getting him off from the army, and I might be required at Chelmsford to prove that was not the case, because I showed that erasure to the subscribing witness and to the boy and his father when it was first entered into, several years previous, that they had been intended for another apprentice, but not executed, and as he was taken from charity there was no occasion for stamped paper at all, as no premium was paid; but in order to show the boy we were legal, as I drew the inden<lb></lb>tures myself, I substituted the stamp that was intended for another; and I thought if this man took them to Chelmsford I should have the power I have had over the apprentice taken out of my hands, and probably the Magistrate might compel me to show that the indentures were genuine—that was nearly twelve months before they were burnt—I had a fire at my house in 1841—I think I was insured in the Phœnix—I had tools in my house and workshops—M'Carthy and I had not removed any of them a short time before the fire—if M'Carthy has ever stated that there were any tools removed from the pre<lb></lb>mises for which I made a claim as if burnt, it is not true.</p>

I was living with my father at Colchester, at the time Miss Perry boarded and lodged with him—I remember in Dec., 1844, my father telling me to fetch a bill-stamp—no one was present except my father, when he sent me for the stamp—I brought it to my father—he wrote on it, and told me that Miss Perry was going to give him a note of hand—she was not present then—after he had written on the bill, I went with him into the kitchen—Miss Perry was there when we went in—my father said to her that he had drawn the note out, and he wished for her to sign it; and he gave her the note, which she read—she said, "Very well," and then put her name to the bill—I saw her do that—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the note</hi>)—this is her handwriting—my name is on the bill—I witnessed her signing it—I am quite sure I saw her sign that bill—I shall be seventeen years old next April—I have been to sea—I was examined at the trial at Bristol, last spring—I have never had any quarrel with Miss Perry.</p>

Mr. King—since I have been out of place I have been living at Colchester, with my father; not all the time—I have been up in London a little while—I was staying here to see if I could hap on a place, or see a place in the newspaper—Mr. Couch was kind enough to keep me during that time, about three weeks, at the Exeter coffee-house, London-wall—he has given me 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., I think—he gave me some money, and left word for me to have some more—I do not know how much I have had from him altogether—he has supported me, sometimes giving me money to pay for my food—before he went home he gave me the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—that is a week ago—he supported me with food before that, sometimes at the Exeter coffee-house, and sometimes he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and I went into a coffee-house and had some<lb></lb>thing—he began this about three weeks ago—I cannot say how much money I have had from him—I have had none to-day, not from him, to find myself in food or anything—I have had some money to-day—Mr. Couch gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at London-wall, between eight and nine o'clock—I had none yesterday, not from Mr. Couch—I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Couch—that is all—I had none the day before—Mr. Couch was not with Mrs. Couch when she gave me the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I have not had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether, nor yet 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that I swear.</p>

               <p>"Can you let me have to the sum of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—that was before the note was signed—she said, "Not all at once, Mr. Couch"—he then asked her to sign the paper—he did not put it into her hand, it lay on the dresser—she read it partly, and mentioned 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—she read over when it was to be payable, "21st Jan."—she read that aloud, and she said she could not engage to say she could let him have it by that time—he said that was not his motive—there was no other sum mentioned but 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the conversation by either of them—he said it was merely as a satisfaction to show parties to whom he owed money, being in great difficulties—Miss Perry asked him if she signed it should she get into any trouble by it, and she likewise asked him whether he would take advan<lb></lb>tage of it—he said, "Miss Perry, do you believe me capable of such a thing?"—she then said, "If it is any satisfaction to you, or any kindness to you I will do it with the greatest pleasure."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who was present in the room at that time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Couch, Miss Perry, and myself, and a little girl between eight and nine years old, with her play-things, was going in and out—the son and the apprentice were not present during any part of the time, on my solemn oath—Miss Perry signed the paper—after she had signed it Mr. Couch thanked her—he then took the paper and the pen and ink, and went up stairs—I was washing up the break<lb></lb>fast things at the time—Miss Perry did not quit the house from that time till dinner-time—she assisted in getting the dinner ready that day—she dined with the family in the kitchen—she was at that time teaching at the house of Miss Clay, and she quitted after dinner to go to Miss Clay's, at one o'clock—they dined earlier than usual that day, and she left before the others had done their dinner—I remember Miss Perry leaving the house—there was no quar<lb></lb>rel or misunderstanding between her and Mr. Couch in my presence before she left—I was taken down to the trial at Bristol by Miss Perry's friends—I proved there what I have stated to-day—M'Carthy was not examined.</p>

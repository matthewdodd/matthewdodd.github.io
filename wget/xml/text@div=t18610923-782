                  </hi>. I am a porter in the employment of Messrs. Green, auctioneers, of Farringdon-street, and live at 12, Dorrington-street, Leather-lane—about 1 o'clock, on 23d August, I was at their auction rooms, and the prisoner Williams came there—he brought a small dressing-case, four forks, and a box something like a domino-box, to be sold—he said he brought them from Jackson—he said he was to stop till Jackson came in, which he did in about half an hour—I gave Jackson a receipt for the goods which had been brought, and both of them went out—in about an hour they both came back again, and Jackson asked me for a receipt for an enema, a surgical instrument case, which he had brought on the previous Saturday—I offered to make a minute on the paper I had given him that day for the dressing-case—I was having my dinner at the time—he said, "Finish your dinner first"—after I had done dinner I said, "Come give us your paper, and I will make that right for you"—he then said he had lost the receipt I had given him on the previous Saturday for the enema, and also the one I had given him that day—I then went into the counting-house to make him a fresh receipt—Jackson came in with me and sat next to the door; between me and the door—I had left Williams in the warehouse, and</p>

               <p>I opened a little window in the office and saw him carrying this roll cloth (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it had been placed at the extreme end of the warehouse—he was carrying it towards the outside door—directly he saw me looking at him he dropped it behind a board in the room—I went out. stopped him, and called for the assistance of a policeman—I asked a customer there, packing up some goods, to go and fetch a policeman, and Jackson came up and said, "Here, I will fetch a policeman," and off be went—when I sent a second time, a policeman came directly and took Williams—I waited expecting Jackson, and when I found he did not come. I sent again—the prisoners were in conversation together in the warehouse—Jackson was sitting next to the door in the office—that did not at all obstruct my view of the warehouse.</p>

Green's rooms that day—I said, "You went out to fetch a policeman, and did not return"—he said that he could not find a policeman—I took him to the station, searched him, and found on him seventeen keys on a steel ring—he gave his address 11, Leonard-street, Shoreditch—I went there, and found that he had lived there and left on that day.</p>

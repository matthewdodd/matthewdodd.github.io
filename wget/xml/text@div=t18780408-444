                  </hi>, Q. C. I am Recorder of Liverpool, and live at 64, Queen's Gardens, Bayswater—on the evening of 7th March I re<lb></lb>ceived this letter—I had given the prisoner 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a fortnight before, on account of Lord Howard of Glossop—I have been acting as a friend of Lord Howard in the matter—I first saw the prisoner on Easter Sunday, 1877, or else the Saturday before, at a monastic establishment called Mount St. Bernard, in Leicestershire—he was working there as a gardener, but not living there—I told him that Lord Howard had asked me to come and see him, and that I had been informed by Lord and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080060"></xptr>
               <p>Lady Howard of numbers of things which he had done, and that if I had had the entire guidance of the matter I would not have done anything for him, but I found that Lady Howard had some time before made an ar<lb></lb>rangement with him, under which he had been working there, his wages being paid by Lord Howard—he said that he did not know that before but that he suspected it, that he was tired of being there and would stay there no longer, that Lord Howard had unjustly dismissed him a number of years before from his situation as gardener, when he expected to be made head gardener, and that he had been given in custody on a charge of cutting some vines, and had lost eight years of his life, and had been brooding over it ever since, and that Lord Howard was bound to get him head gardener to the Duke of Norfolk, or Lord Bute, or Mr. De Lisle, or to pay him 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said, "You know that you confessed to Lady Howard some time ago that you have for some time been writing or causing to be written anonymous letters to Lord Howard, his agent, and neighbours; "(I think I mentioned the name of Canon Tasker)" and that you have done a number of acts against Lord Howard's property for which you might have been criminally proceeded against, but Lady Howard and her family take a considerable interest in you and your family, and they think you must have taken some extraordinary notions into your head about your treatment; Lord Howard is in a very low state of health, and Lady How<lb></lb>ard does not wish him to be annoyed any more, and they are willing to continue the payment which you have been hitherto receiving, giving you permission, instead of remaining at Mount St. Bernard, to go wherever you like, provided only that they are kept informed as to where you are and what you are doing"—he declined to make any arrangement, except on the conditions that he was made head gardener to some nobleman or gentleman, or had 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. given him—I said "You will be much better off with 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and your own time and labour free, than you will be in any situation, even if you keep it," and I pointed out to him that he would probably lose it almost immediately he got it, on account of his temper; and that it was truly impossible Lord Howard could recommend him to any gentleman without telling him the whole story, in which case nobody would take him; and I think I said that the Duke of Norfolk knew the story already and certainly would not take him—the interview then ter<lb></lb>minated—he came again to me next day to the Monastery and said that he was willing to make an arrangement—he still asserted that he had a right to be made head gardener to somebody or have 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe he signed this paper in my presence, but the gentleman who wrote it says that he did not, but that he signed it and gave it to me afterwards—I did not see him for some time afterwards, when he spoke not of this paper but of another—I had drawn up a duplicate of the second, and sent it to the Rev. Mr. Sisk, of Manchester, by post, and by return of post received the duplicate back signed by the prisoner—[ spoke to him about it, and discussed it very fully a year afterwards at Liverpool—the signatures are both in the same writing—he had agreed to enter into an arrangement, which was shortly discussed and embodied in this document, to the effect that he should have 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week on condition of his good behaviour, and invariably receiving it through some person known to Lord Howard, either a banker or solicitor, at any place where he might choose to reside; and I stipulated that he should not attempt to live on it, but should save it and support himself by getting a situation—I saw him again one Sun<lb></lb>day</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187804080061"></xptr>
               <p>last February at Birkenhead, during the Liverpool Assizes, and asked him why he had not drawn any money under the arrangement, and why he had left Mount St. Bernard leaving a considerable sum of money in the hands of Mr. Sisk—he said that the arrangement was a paltry one, and he would not condescend to accept anything under it, and asked to have 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or be made head gardener to the Duke of Norfolk—I told him he would be much better off with 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, with his time and labour free—he was very violent in his demeanour rather than his lan<lb></lb>guage, and went away saying that he would not accept anything—I told him that he would be sure to come back in a week, and in a week he did come back—I found him waiting at the door of my Court—he followed me to the hotel, and said that he had made up his mind to take the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week and live on it—I told him he would be very foolish if he lived on it, I thought he had much better work and save the money—he said he thought he would go to America, where he had been before—I said I thought that would be much the best thing; and if he did that I would advise Lord Howard to make him an advance on the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week to maintain himself when he got there—I asked him how much he wanted—he said he thought 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said he might have anything he liked, for, although he had not fulfilled the conditions of the agreement, Lord Howard would not take advantage of that; and I gave him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and wrote down my address in London—he almost recited the terms of the arrangement on paper "C," and he was to write to me—I received a letter from him on 27th or 28th February—I believe it to be in the same writing as his signature—I did not answer it, and received a second, dated 5th March—I then wrote to him—I have no coppy of my letter. (<hi rend="italic">Notice to produce this letter was here proved as being served on the prisoner by Andrew Lans<lb></lb>down on 5th April</hi>.) I said in my letter, "Sir, I did not answer your first letter because I had so often answered in conversation with you the questions you put to me; Lord Howard does not intend to get you a situa<lb></lb>tion for the reasons I have so often given you before. He is, however, desirous of assisting you to the utmost of his power within the terms of the arrangement which was made with you about a year ago, and which we have discussed several times. I can't help again pointing out to you that you would be much better off with the 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week which was arranged for, and your time and labour at your own disposal, than you could possibly be in any situation." That was the substance of the letter—the next letter, the subject of this indictment, was delivered by post at my house, and I handed it to Lord Howard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He complained that he had been dismissed from Lord Howard's service and had been improperly charged with doing malicious damage to Lord Howard's property—I asked him whether Lord Howard was personally responsible for that, he said "No"—he was not dis<lb></lb>respectful or violent to me but he was emotionally violent—when I spoke to him at Liverpool, he came in consequence of a message from me—I sent for him, as Lord Howard had informed me that he had left the convent using very violent language, and it was reported that he had used very violent language at Birkenhead—Lord Howard was in a deli<lb></lb>cate state of health at that time and under medical treatment—I had told the prisoner that Lord Howard was ill, but it was a year afterwards that he wrote "It will be the happiest day of my life when I hear of Howard's death."</p>

The prisoner's father and mother were tenants of my father's—they were originally in very poor circumstances, and in great distress, and he established them in a cottage and they lived on his estate to the end of their lives—they were thoroughly respectable, well-behaved people—they had three children, the prisoner and two daughters—I was a child at the time, and used to teach them in the Sunday school—I lost sight of them when I went away for my education—in February, 1876, I had heard of a letter written by the prisoner to Canon Tasker—I spoke to the prisoner about it and he said that he had not written it—we then talked about his general proceedings from the time he left Glossop—I explained to him that a great many of his grievances were fancied ones—he explained them with great volubility and was very much excited in manner and voice—he said that his principal grievance was the trial for the vine-cutting at Glossop, and he had been dragged from his home when the mill people were about the streets and disgraced, and had been handcuffed, although he promised to go quietly; and he said why was not Scott also treated in the same way, as there was the same presump<lb></lb>tion against him—Scott was the head gardener; he accused Scott and Scott accused the prisoner—I explained to him that we knew nothing about the unnecessary harshness with which he had been treated, and if there was any grievance it was not against Lord Howard but against the police—I said "Well, after all, although, perhaps, you have been treated harshly I am sure you deserved it because you did cut the vines"—he said "Well, and if I did, there is no more evidence against me than there is against Scott, and why was I treated so much more harshly than he was"—his manner was very excited and violent; he looked very much like a man out of his mind—the next thing he said was that Lord Howard had not answered a letter he had written to him after the trial, asking for an interview, of which no notice had been taken, although he had remained in the neighbourhood of Glossop in the hope of being sent for—I said that Lord Howard had never received the letter—after that he said he went to Birkenhead and from thence to America to the diggings at California, and remained there some time and got with a very wild set of people, and his one fault was drinking day and night, and that he was all day meditating upon his wrongs and how he should be revenged, and the people round him said they were sure he had some<lb></lb>thing on his mind and he told them, and they said that there was nothing easier than to be revenged; he would get dynamite or gunpowder, or he could shoot, and if he did not like to do it himself he could get somebody else to do it for half-a-crown, and that he afterwards arranged a plot in his mind and came to England to put it in execution, and he landed at Birkenhead and proceeded to look about to see if he could find some one</p>

               <p>for a sum of money who would undertake to do it, and at last he found a man who had been in Kirkdale Gaol some time, who consented for a good sum of money to do the thing, and he was very flush of money, having been betting at the races, that he gave it to the man, and they went down together to the neighbourhood of Glossop to see how they could put their plan in execution, and it was a very fine plot, and he was to cut the vines and the other man was to shoot Lord Howard, and they concealed them<lb></lb>selves behind the bushes and watched for him to come out; that the man was armed with a gun, but Lord Howard did not appear; that they saw two young ladies coming on the terrace and concluded that Lord Howard was not there, and the dinner hour of the gardener was near, and the man thought it was not fair for him to do nothing, so he went and cut the vines, and he would have cut them all if he had not been afraid of the gardeners coming—there was a second cutting of the vines in August, 1875—I asked him who did the vine-cutting about the 1st—he said that he had done it—I said "Did you do it yourself?"—he said "Yes, I did," and then he drew himself up, and said "No, the other man did it"—I am speaking now of the more recent cutting—he then told me a long rambling story about having joined the American army, and that he had deserted and was obliged to be in hiding for fear of being shot as a deserter, and had suffered an immense deal from starvation and fell ill with brain fever, and there was a change in him, he got weak in his head and his hair turned grey, and all that was Lord Howard's doing—he got very much excited.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. He showed violence towards Lord Howard, but he was perfectly respectful to me—he admitted that Lord Howard and I had been very kind to him and his family—this long conversation took place at Garrington Park—I went there on purpose to have the interview—I thought that having known him in his childhood and my family having done so much for his parents I might have some influence—before the end of the interview he became calmed down and, to some extent, re<lb></lb>pentant—he did not say that he did not mean any harm to Lord Howard—he said that he had in the past meant harm to him—he promised amend<lb></lb>ment for the future—I have known him from a child—I was a child my<lb></lb>self at that time—he was perfectly well-conducted as long as he was at Garrington and was in my father's employment—he came to Glossop as gardener I think in 1867, and remained two or three years—the head gardener who was there when he came was an old man, and he retired on a pension about three months after Shehan came—I forget whether Scott immediately took his place, perhaps Bradley came first, I know there were two head gardeners—I am of opinion that the police treated him with a good deal of harshness by handcuffing him, and I am sorry for him—he was at St. Bernard just a year—I was abroad when he left but I heard of it shortly afterwards.</p>

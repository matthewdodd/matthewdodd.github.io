                  </hi>. I keep the Windsor Castle public-house, Regent's-place, City-road, opposite Pick ford's-wharf. I have known the prisoner some two months, as an unfortunate woman, associating with the boatmen—on 1st April I was obliged to call a policeman, about the middle of the day, through her violent, riotous conduct, and desired her not to come to the house again—on the next day but one, Wednesday, between ten and eleven o'clock, I received a communication from my wife, and went into the tap-room, and found the pri<lb></lb>soner standing with her back to the fire, with her hands down by her side within her clothes—I laid hold of her right elbow—I did not use the least violence—I asked her to walk out—I fancied there was something in her hand to do me an injury, it prevented her arm being at liberty—I walked away to fetch a policeman, but did not say so to her—she followed me, and hit me over the head with some metal instrument—it stunned me—I put my hand to my head, and my fingers were covered with blood, it was running down my neck and my coat—a policeman was sent for—my potman, James Rhodes, left me that evening, before the prisoner came—I sent for a doctor—he is not here—I kept my bed for two days, and am not well yet.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a schoolmaster of Tonbridge-street, New-road. I went to the Windsor Castle public-house, between ten and eleven o'clock to get out of the rain—the prisoner came into the tap-room—Mrs. Morrice came and desired her, in a quiet, kind way, to go out, she did not provoke her—the prisoner refused to go—Mr. Morrice went out, and in a minute or two came back, put his hand on her shoulder, and told her to go out—she would not—he turned round as if to go for something, and she struck him with the poker—the blood ran down his coat—I did not see her take up the poker—I should say she took it up when Mrs. Morrice went out—she was sober.</p>

I was Mr. Morrice's potman up to last Wednesday week—about half-past nine o'clock that evening, as I was leaving, I saw the prisoner coming out of one of the boxes in the front garden—I asked her where she was going—she said she was going inside the house—I said, "Don't go in, because master has for<lb></lb>bidden you the house several times"—she said, "I will, and if your master dares to put me out I will split his head open."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk at the Marylebone Police Court—on 31st May, between 11 and 12 o'clock in the day, I went with Mr. Mansfield, the Magistrate, to the University Hospital—I there saw James Brown, who was a patient—the prisoner was brought to his bedside, and in his presence I took the examination of James Brown, after he was sworn in the usual way—the charge then was feloniously wounding—the prisoner had an opportunity of cross-examining Brown, and he availed himself of it—the cross-examination was taken down, and the deposition signed by the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The deceased was very ill indeed at the time—he had some difficulty in giving his evidence—the prisoner was very much affected, and so was the deceased.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The deposition of James Brown was read as follows</hi>: "About 12.30 on Monday night, Whit Monday, I was in Stanhope Street. I had had a quarrel with the prisoner about half an hour before; we were both three parts drunk. I do not know what the quarrel was about. The prisoner had gone about half an hour, and when he returned I was standing talking to a girl. Newman, the witness in this case, was in front of the public-house. The prisoner came up to my left hand side, when this girl that I was speaking to, said 'Mind him, he has got a knife in his hand; I said 'If he has got a knife I will soon take it away.' Before I could turn round I felt myself stabbed in my left breast. The prisoner walked away, and I was taken to this hospital. I had known the prisoner some time, but had had no quarrels with him.' <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> 'I came up to them, he did not come up to me. I did not say at the Hen and Chickens that I would do for the prisoner before long. I did not take out a knife first; I had no knife.')</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 6, Grafton Street, Kentish Town—last Whit Monday, about 6 o'clock, I was in Henry Street, and met the prisoner—he asked where Brown was—I said he was at work—he said "Nonsense"—I said "Yes, and I am going to meet him now, at Jackson &amp; Graham's"—he said he would go with me, as he wanted to see him, and we went—the book entrance to Jackson &amp; Graham's is in Newman Street, Oxford Street—Lee went down the yard to look for Brown—Brown came out shortly after—Lee was then standing in the street, at the corner, with me—this was about 6.40—he came up to us, and went back again to work; he had not done work—there was some conversation between Lee and Brown—I could not say what it was; all I heard was how long he would be, and he said he could not leave work till 7.30—they seemed on very good terms—Lee and I waited there till 7.30, when Brown came out again, with four of his shop<lb></lb>men—they joined us, and we all went into a public-house in Newman Street—I don't know the sign—we were still all very good friends—there were six men and myself—they had two pots of ale—nothing was said between Brown and Lee at that time—we remained in the public-house</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187207080031"></xptr>
               <p>perhaps half an hour or more—we then went in the direction of Brown's lodging in Henry Street—the other shopmen went away, and left me, Lee, and Brown—we did not go anywhere, we only walked about the street—I should think it was then about 8.30—we went into the Cock public-house, at the corner of Henry Street, about 9.30—they had a pot of stout—Mrs. Brown, the sister-in-law of the deceased, was there; she is Lee's sister—I went across the bar to speak to her; she was at the further end of the bar—I was talking to her, and all at once Brown and Lee had a quarrel, and she turned round, and saw them quarrelling—I had not been away from them two minutes—Mrs. Brown went and parted them—I saw that Lee's nose was bleeding—I took Brown outside into the street—Mrs. Brown attended to Lee; she bathed his face—I did not see any blow struck; I had my back to them at the time—I went out, and talked to Brown, and asked what they quarrelled upon, and he told me to mind my own business—he only remained two or three minutes with me—I then lost sight of him for about twenty minutes or half an hour—I stood outside, talking to Mrs. Brown—this was about 9.30 or 9.45—there were no marks on Brown's face—he had a slight black eye—I did not observe it till he was lying in the hospital a day or two after—I did not notice any appearance of blows at the time or previously—as I was talking to Mrs. Brown, Lee crossed the road—I crossed after him, and asked what they wanted to quarrel for—he made use of foul language, and said God strike him dead, he would do for him that night—he called him a b—y f—g <hi rend="italic">sod</hi>—I said "Nonsense; what is the use of talking that fashion?"—Brown came up at the time, and said "Have not you done yet; you had better go away"—Lee then drew out a knife—I said to Brown, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi>, come away, for <hi rend="italic">Bob</hi> has got a knife"—Brown said "If he has got a knife I will take it away from him"—Lee did not say anything when he drew the knife—they faced each other; Brown was sideways towards Lee—he was going to take the knife from him—he did not strike any blow or say anything—Lee then struck Brown a blow under the left collar-bone, with a brown-handled knife—I saw the knife when he took it out of his pocket—it was shut when he took it out—he opened it—after Brown was struck, he put his hand up, and said to Quiltey, who was Standing by, "Oh, Jack! he has done it!"—Quiltey said "Done what?"—he said "He has stabbed me," and he then reeled back—I had hold of Brown previous to Lee stabbing him, and Quiltey said "Leave go of him, Emma; I will see fair play with them," and then Lee struck the blow—I was endeavouring to keep Lee from him—I had hold of Brown; I wanted to keep him back—he was not trying to get at Lee, but I wanted to prevent him being struck with the knife—Quiltey knew Lee had the knife, because I told him—I took hold of Brown almost directly I saw Lee take the knife out—when Brown reeled back he threw his coat open, and I saw blood fall from him—then Quiltey and Brown ran away in the direction of University Hospital—Lee went away—I did not see him any more after that till he was taken into custody—I went after Brown and Quiltey—I saw them in a chemist's shop, and then they went to the hospital—I had known Brown for many years; I was an intimate friend of his—I was not a friend of Lee's—I had known him also, but I was no friend of his—I had known him for several years by knowing his sister, Mrs. Brown—Brown would have been thirty-one years of age on the 25th of next September.</p>

               <p>was rather passionate when in drink—I believe Lee and him were on very good terms always—Lee would never keep away from him, he was always following him about—Brown was not frequently at my house nor I at his—he only came once to my house—we were not on very intimate terms of late years; we were some years ago; six or seven perhaps—I was married at that time—my husband was not sent to penal servitude for fifteen years—it was not my husband at all who you are alluding to—my husband is dead—he has been dead some twelve months, or more than that—he was convicted here—my mother, my sister, and I were tried with him—my mother was also convicted, for uttering counterfeit coin—my husband's sentence was seven years—the next time I was tried in this Court was two years ago—the first time was three years ago—I was convicted the second time—that was for uttering—I don't know anything about my sister, because I had been away from home, I can only answer for myself—I believe she was convicted—those are the only occasions upon which I have been convicted—I have never been in custody for other cases—I have been tried twice and convicted once—I know a man named Copeland—after my trial with my husband I went and lived with Copeland for a short time—I had not seen Brown for several years then—I knew him—he had been a friend of Copeland's, but had been away for several years—I don't know where Copeland was tried—he was sentenced to fifteen years' penal servi<lb></lb>tude—I can't tell you what it was for, it was some time before I was with him—it was for an affair at Battersea—I believe it was for coining—I was told so—I believe when Brown was away he was undergoing penal servitude—I don't think he was on ticket-of-leave at the time he met with his death—his last sentence was eighteen months—he had been convicted more than once—I can't tell you when he was first convicted—Lee can tell you better than I can—it was some years ago, I could not say exactly how long—it was for felony—I can't tell what kind of felony—I was not so acquainted with him as to know—I can't tell you the next time he was convicted—I should think it was in 1864—he was absent from me then four or five years—how I knew him was living in the neighbourhood; that was all the intimacy at first—I was not living with Copeland at that time—I only lived with him a very short time before he was convicted—I knew that Brown was undergoing some punishment when he was away in 1864—I don't know what it was, I believe it was for felony—the next time I knew of his being convicted was three or four years ago—I think that was the last—I don't know what that was for—he had eighteen months then, I believe—he was not on ticket-of-leave at the time of his death—they sent him back to do the remainder of his time the last time he was convicted—I can't tell exactly how long he had been out of prison before 20th May—perhaps a twelve-month—my name is Emma Newman Wilson—I did not think it mattered my dropping the Wilson—I always go in the name of Emma Newman—my husband's name was Edward Newman Wilson—I did not call myself Wilson in his lifetime—I always called myself Newman when I was living with him—I never knew counterfeit coin made in my house, in the house where I used to dwell—it has not been finished or polished in my house, or the house where I lodged—I have uttered it, and I have been punished for it—Brown did not give it me to utter—I have not been in the habit of doing it lately, not for some time—it was Copeland that I uttered them for the last time—I have never seen Brown do it, but I believe Lee and him have done it together—I did not utter any on the night of 20th May—I believe Brown</p>

               <p>did, and Lee also, it was not in my presence—I don't know what it was for—I was told that three of Copeland's friends were convicted and sentenced to fifteen years', but I know nothing about it—I was not associating with Copeland at that time—I was not living with any one—I did not know the three men—I did not know Copeland at that time—from what I have been told they were friends of his—on the night of 20th May, between 6 and 7 o'clock, I met Lee at the corner of Henry Street—I did not ask him to accompany me to Oxford Street, and show me Jackson and Graham's work<lb></lb>shop—I told him where I was going, and that I had promised to meet Brown there—I scarcely know why I went to meet Brown—when we went into the public-house a pint of porter was drawn, and Brown and Lee drank out of it—I had a glass of brandy, for which Brown paid—Brown then went back to his work, and Lee and I remained in the street—he finished his porter before Brown came out of the public-house, and we came out together—I did not swear that I had nothing to drink on the first occasion I saw Brown—I did not have anything myself then, it was the second occasion we went in that I had the brandy; I swear that—Lee did not go into any public-house while we were standing in Newman Street—when Brown came out again four of his fellow-workmen were with him—I did not before that go into a public-house and pass a counterfeit Shilling at Brown's request—I had 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and a few coppers with me that day—that was all I had—Brown had not given me any money that day—I had not seen him—I had nothing that purported to be money—when we met Brown and his four friends they invited Lee and I to go into the Blue Posts, and have something more to drink—they remained drinking there for some time—they were drinking ale—they had no gin, to my knowledge—I had some brandy—I never touched their ale, nothing but brandy—I can't give you the names of the other men—I don't know them—we were not there more than three-quarters of an hour, perhaps not so much—I did not see any<lb></lb>thing pass between Brown and Lee—I did not hear of his giving Lee three counterfeit florins to tender in payment—I only know what Brown told me when he was dying—he said that he himself had passed two counterfeit half-crowns, and that was what they quarrelled upon—we went from the Blue Posts down Marylebone Street, through Cleveland Street, into the Euston Road, through Stanhope Street to the Cock public-house—Brown and Lee did not go into any public-house on the way; I swear that—they were not tipsy—Lee was the worst of the two—I believe he had had the most to drink—Brown was sober, I believe—he had no appearance of being the worse for drink—he had been drinking—I could not say he was sober—the prisoner was not—I discovered that before we got to the Cock—we got there about 9.30—I am not a very good judge of time, whether it was 9.40 or 9.20 I would not pledge myself—only Lee and me and Brown went into the Cock together—there were several there, perhaps seven or eight—the four friends left us in Newman Street—they called for a pot of stout when they went in—I did not have anything to drink there then—I did not have another glass of brandy—I sat down, and Lee sat down for a few minutes—Brown was standing amongst a lot of people, drinking the stout—Lee was not talking to me—he sat some distance from me—I did not see Brown go up to Lee and ask him what he intended to do—I went to the further end of the bar to speak to Mrs. Brown, and then the quarrel commenced—they were perhaps half a dozen yards from me then—I was in the large bar—I turned my head and saw them quarrel<lb></lb>ing,</p>

I am the wife of Henry Brown, and live at No. 4, Henry Passage, Henry Street, Hampstead Road—the prisoner is my brother—the deceased was my husband's brother—he was about thirty years of age; the prisoner is between thirty-one and thirty-two—on Whit Monday I was in the Cock public-house in Stanhope Street—I went there about 8.30 or 9 o'clock, with my husband and one or two friends, and had some drink there—while there, the prisoner, the deceased, and Emma Newman came in together, between 9.30 and 10 o'clock—they called for a pot of stout, and asked me to drink, which I did—I then turned my back to them, and went across the bar to the same department, and was standing talking to a woman, and Emma Newman came over to me, and asked me how my chil<lb></lb>dren were getting on, and she said to me "Oh! Jane, they are fighting"—I turned round, and saw Lee and Brown entangled the one with the other—I could not say whether Newman's face was towards them, my back was towards them; she was standing aside of me—she told me they were fighting, and I turned round to look at them—she said "Part them, for I can't"—I went across to them, to part them as well as I was able—Brown</p>

               <p>had my brother up against the partition of the bar, and they were close together, and fighting—I did not notice which struck the blows; I saw that they were fighting, struggling together—I believe they were parted, and Brown was turned out, I think, by the barman—my brother was bleeding from the face, I think from the nose, and there was a place over the eye, I could not say which side. that was bleeding as well—I did not see what became of Newman—I should think she could see them fighting from where she stood; she was quite close to my shoulder—I asked for some water, over the bar, to bathe my brother's face, and I wiped the blood off with a handkerchief; I then put it into the water, and squeezed it two or three times, and they gave me some more water, and I bathed him again—Mrs. Quiltey assisted me—after a few minutes, I and Mrs. Quiltey came out, and I think my brother came out with us—I could not swear whether he came out with us or not—I think his nose had left off bleeding then; the mark on his face was still bleeding a little, the blood was running down—from the time Brown was turned out, to the time Mrs. Quiltey and I came out, I should think was about ten minutes—after I came out I stood at the corner of the Cock, with Mrs. Quiltey and my brother—Newman came up and spoke to us, and while we were talking, Brown came up and stood at the post; I did not see which way he came—my brother did not say anything about him before he came up, not to my knowledge—I asked Newman what they were quarrelling about—she said she knew, but she would not tell me—my brother did not say what they had quarrelled about—I said to him "Why don't you keep away from him, you don't seem to agree, why don't you keep from one another?"—I cannot say what he said, they both began to jangle, and I was shoving my brother away to go away, I was afraid they were going to fight again—they began to talk one to the other, what it was about I could not say—I then lost sight of them both; they both went away, I went over to the other corner; some vans came on with a pleasure party—I believe Mrs. Quiltey went across with me, I stood talking to some persons, there was a lot gathered together—not for many minutes, I should say about twenty minutes—and all at once I heard them say that James Brown was stabbed, and I turned round and saw him, and saw some men taking him towards the hospital—I had heard nothing be<lb></lb>fore that to attract my attention—I did not see anything of my brother at that time—both the men seemed to have had something to drink—but of the two I think my brother was the worst—they were both I should say about half drunk, and Lee was the worst—I am not aware that Brown used to carry a knife—I don't know that my brother did, I have never seen him with one—I was examined at the inquest not before the Magistrate—I saw my brother in Newgate after the inquest was adjourned—I asked what the quarrel was about—he said it was all through Emma Newman, she met him at the Cock public-house, and they went together to meet James Brown, and when they met him they had something to drink, that she carried the bad money, and gave him three to pass, he passed three and then Brown passed same, Brown made him give him his share out of one, and then he passed some and he would not share it, and then the quarrel across—Brown wanted him to pass three more 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. pieces, to pay him 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that he owed him—he said he did not think it would be so bad as I thought, for the chaplain of Newgate knew all about her career, for she had been convicted at Newgate and likewise her mother and her husband—he also said that Brown used to go to her house and they used to make the money between</p>

               <p>them I don't know whether my brother was in work on Whit Monday, or what he had been doing during the day, I saw him in the afternoon stand<lb></lb>ing at the corner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I think my brother is of a very warm heart and kindly disposition, and as a rule very good tempered, I never saw him out of tem<lb></lb>per much—as far as I knew he and Brown were always good friends—I did not hear Brown call for a glass of brandy at the Cock and give it to New<lb></lb>man—I don't whether she had any brandy—I did not hear any of the con<lb></lb>versation that took place until Newman called my attention to the fact that they were fighting—my brother was not sitting down then, Brown had him up against the partition—a deal of blood came from him, there was a great deal of blood all over his face—I did not see that his mouth was cut, only the place over his eye, and next day as he was going into the police-van at Marylebone, I saw that the blood was dried on his face—I did not, whilst bathing his face, hear anyone say, "Here he is coming again," but I turned round and saw Brown in the door, looking in, and he said something, and put up his fist to my brother—that was after he had been turned out—he came back again—I should think that was ten minutes afterwards—I don't remember my brother telling me, in Newgate, that Brown said if he did not give him the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. that he owed him he would take it out of his head—I did not hear my brother say that if he came at him again he would set a big man, or somebody else, on him—I have told you all that I know—my brother seemed very much distressed—there was great con<lb></lb>fusion at the time, and a great crowd—I do think freely from my heart that it would never have happened but for that woman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Quiltey, and live at 8, Henry Passage—on the night of Whit Monday I was in the Cock public-house, about 10 o'clock, as near as I can guess—I had known Lee about ten months—I knew James Brown and Mrs. Brown—I did not know Newman—I did not see them come in—I was talking to a friend, a woman I only knew by sight—Brown was sitting down, and he asked me how the child was—I afterwards heard Lee and Brown having a few words; I did not hear what they were about—I saw Brown stand up and strike Lee with his fist, and the blood came from his face; he was sitting alongside of Brown—I and Mrs. Brown separated them—Lee struck back when Brown struck him; he did not get up from his seat; Brown kept him down, he had not power to get up—I could not see for the crowd whether there were more blows struck or not—a lot of people rushed in at the door to see the fight—Mr. Carnell, the landlord, handed some water over the bar to bathe the prisoner's face—one of Mr. Carnell's servants had put Brown out at that time—I did not notice him before he was put out; the crowd was too great—I did not notice whether he had any marks—the prisoner was bleeding from the face and nose—Mrs. Brown and I washed the blood off his face with a pocket-handkerchief, and squeezed the handkerchief—I don't believe there was any second water; I don't remember—we were attending to him for a few minutes—his face stopped bleeding—I remained in the public-house about five or ten minutes—I heard the children shout out that the vans were coming, and I went to look after my husband, who had been to Riddlesdown—I did not see Lee after that night; he left the public-house before me, and I don't know what became of him—I saw my husband, and gave him the baby; he stood talking to some friends, and I went round the corner, and I heard no more till I heard the people shout out that Brown</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 8, Henry Passage, Henry Street, Hampstead Road—on Whit Monday I had been out with a van—I came home with it, and drew up at the Hen and Chickens, in Stanhope Street, about 10.30—I have known the prisoner for a number of years; he was not a friend of mine—I knew Brown about the same time; he was a friend as far as this, he stood for my child—when I drew up with the van I did not see Brown or Lee—I saw Newman standing at the corner by herself, six or seven yards from the van—she told me that Bob and Jem had been having a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, and that Jem had cut Bob's face, and they were frightened if they came to fight outside that Bob's <hi rend="italic">mob</hi> would <hi rend="italic">slip</hi> into Jem—I said, no it would not be such, for I would see Jem righted—I then walked away; my wife came up and I took the child, and went and stood on the kerb by the side of the vans, talking to the man with the horses—I saw Newman talking with Lee, on the area railings of a shop next to the Hen and Chickens, three or four yards from me—I heard some one say, "Here comes Brown," and I saw Brown coming straight down on the pavement on the same side; he came direct facing Lee—he said to Newman, "Mind yourself, Emma;" she was between them—she said, "Here comes Jem"—Brown was moving towards Lee, as I thought, in the attitude of fighting; he had his hands up in a fighting attitude—I did not see whether he struck any blow or not—I did not see what was done next, because I turned round to get my child away—I did not observe whether or not Brown had anything in his hands; I did not notice anything in Lee's hands—I did not hear any more till I turned back again, and Brown turned round to me and said he was stabbed—I took him before the light and opened his shirt, and saw that he was stabbed in the breast—I don't know where Lee was then—I took Brown to the chemist's, and afterwards in a cab to the hospital—both Lee and Brown had been drinking, but of the two I think Lee was the worst, by appearance—I had known them both for a good many years—I never knew them quarrel before—I helped to undress Brown at the hospital; I cut his clothes off, his coat and waistcoat, not his trousers; they took them into the ward with him—I did not look in to his pockets or examine his clothes—I did not see any knife.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Newman examined the pockets in the hospital and gave me a tobacco-box and tobacco in some paper; that was all she gave me—I knew her pretty well, she had lived with Brown as his wife about four</p>

               <p>years ago—they were still very intimate—it was difficult to see what was done in the crowd—there were three large vans and a small one, and a great many people about, just come home—all I saw was Brown coming up in a fighting attitude—whether he struck Lee or not I could not say—he might have done so.</p>

I am house surgeon at University College Hospital—I was not there when Brown was brought in—I saw him on Tuesday evening—I did not examine him there, as he was bound up—I examined him next morning—he had a wound half an inch below the left collar bone, and that wound had been enlarged a little in order to stop the bleeding—it was going on very well; I just took off the dressing and put on another—I can't say how deep the wound was—it would not have been right to probe it, but I afterwards made the <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the wound went through all the muscles and right down to the second rib, which was broken across and splintered, and there was an opening into the cavity of the chest; the lung was collapsed, and the cavity of the chest was half fall of blood and fluid—the wound was in itself dangerous, apart from its consequences—he came in on May 20 and died on June 6, solely from the effects of the wound and its after consequences—a blow with a knife might cause such a wound—it must have been a very hard blow—I saw no marks of violence about his face or anywhere else.</p>

It all lays on you; you have only to say you do not wish to prosecute the case, and that will be an end to it.

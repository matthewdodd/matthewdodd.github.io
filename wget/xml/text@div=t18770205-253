I do duty at the Royal Arsenal—on 13th January I accompanied Inspector Parker to 4, Plumstead Road, where Johnson keeps a marine-store shop—we had a search-warrant—Parker said "You bought 20 lbs. of metal last night, and gave <hi rend="italic">id.</hi> per pound for it"—Johnson hesitated, and then said "I did"—Parker said "Let's have it"—Johnson produced a sack from behind the counter con<lb></lb>taining gun-metal—I heard no more, as I went on searching the premises—this is the bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I also found 24 lbs. of brass strips not marked with the Broad Arrow—I also found the two pieces of leather in a drawer, one is marked with the Broad Arrow, but it is partly cut out—this other piece of leather is produced for comparison.</p>

On Saturday, January 13th, I went with Collins to Johnson's shop, which is about 50 or 60 yards from the entrance to the Arsenal—Johnson was behind the counter—I said "You bought 20 lbs. of gun-metal last night;" he hesitated—I said "You gave 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for it"—he said that he did—I said "Fetch it out," and in two or three minutes he hauled it out from behind the counter—I told the other constable to take him—he said "It's a bad job"—there was another bag of metal; it was weighed at the station, and was 64 lbs.—I saw it in the shop—I was present when it was weighed—I said "There is more than 20 lbs. here"—he said "Yes, I bought them both of the same man."</p>

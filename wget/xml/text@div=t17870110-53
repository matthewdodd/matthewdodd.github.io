               <p>Mr. Knowlys, Counsel for Richardson and Hurst. That is a very hardened observation.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. There had been a good deal of force applied to this shutter? - A good deal of force; it is a slight bolt.</p>
               <p>But what say you to the shoulder? - I do not understand you.</p>
               <p>What sort of a mark was it on the horse hair? - There were three marks of three different people's feet on the horse hair; the print of dirty feet.</p>
               <p>Did it occur to you to try your own feet or Mr. Forrester's whether they would fit? - No, I did not think there was any occasion to try our feet; I perceived my own foot would not fit it.</p>

               <p>Did you see any thing of them on Friday the 22d of December last? - I was going to work, and I saw the window open, and I looked in, and I saw three people in it; that was between four and five on Friday morning the 22d of December.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts was this house? - It is just by Pelican stairs.</p>
               <p>Do you know who lives there? - I really do not know.</p>
               <p>Have you heard since? - No, I have not; I saw the parlour window shutters open, about two or three inches; I saw one with a dark lanthorn in his hand, and one of them called him by his name, Notely, hold the lanthorn this way that I may see.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No; I went a few doors off, and I stood, and the three people jumped out of the window; and there was a fourth man walking backwards and forwards on the other side of the way; two of these men were in the house, Notely and Hurst; I cannot tell who the third man was, for I was afraid of calling out; and I did not observe who the fourth man was; they ran down towards the waterside all four of them; I heard a piece of iron fall, and one of them stopped to pick it up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What are you? - I am a seaman; I was at Greenland last year, and I had been working in a ship.</p>
               <p>The window shutter was just open enough for you to see a dark lanthorn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This they left open on purpose that you might see them as they were committing a felony? - I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>You believe they did, do not you? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>However they had a lanthorn with them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did they see you? - I do not know whether they did or no; I stood five or six doors off.</p>
               <p>You were very much frightened at this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They ran away as fast as they could? - Yes.</p>
               <p>They stooped to pick up a thing that fell down, in order to be better observed? - I cannot tell what for; I walked on about my business; I did not know it was any affair of mine.</p>
               <p>How far was the watch box from there? - I cannot tell; I only know the place by going to work; I saw no watchmen after I went up Fox's-lane.</p>
               <p>Then you saw one in Fox's-lane? - Not to my knowledge; I saw none at all.</p>
               <p>Was not there a knocker to the door of this house? - I did not go back to look; I did not know that the house was robbed till some time afterwards.</p>
               <p>Then you saw three men with a dark<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100073"></xptr>lanthorn in a room, and they jumped out of the window? - I did not know that the house was robbed till some time afterwards, till I heard it was robbed.</p>
               <p>Do you know a Mr. Wolfe? - No, I know no such name.</p>
               <p>Who was it bailed you? - Mr. Fletcher.</p>
               <p>What did he bail you for? - That I might come up here at sessions.</p>
               <p>What occasion was there to give bail for you, that you might come here? - Because I should not lose my work.</p>
               <p>Who is Mr. Fletcher? - A gentleman that lives in the Highway.</p>
               <p>On the highway! what business is he? - He is a gentleman in the office.</p>
               <p>He is a common thieftaker is not he? - I do not know what he is.</p>
               <p>Is not he a runner to the office? - I do not know what he is.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, do not you know Mr. Fletcher is one of the runners to that office? - No, Sir, I do not know any such thing.</p>
               <p>Then how came he to bail you? - Because they told him the whole of it.</p>
               <p>When were you with Mr. Orange and Mr. Forrester? - I saw them over the way to day.</p>
               <p>When did you see them before to day? - Yesterday, and the day before yesterday; I had not seen them before this week; I was at work.</p>
               <p>You have seen them several times since this affair happened? - No, Sir, I have not, only since Monday.</p>
               <p>Have you had no conversation with them? - No, never in my life; I never was before a Justice in my life.</p>
               <p>Never about rewards? - Never have.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are you the man they call stuttering Bill? - I never was called by such a name in my life.</p>
               <p>Was not you before Mr. Smith the Justice, in East Smithfield? - For a wrangle, or a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Was not you before Mr. Smith the Justice on a charge of felony? - No, never in my life; I was there for striking a girl; I never was before any Justice for any harm.</p>
               <p>What girl was it? - A young woman that I live with.</p>
               <p>In short the lady that has the good fortune to be kept by you? - No, Sir, she was married to me at Liverpool; it was some day last week.</p>
               <p>Now, upon your oath, did not Forrester and Orange bail you? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who bailed you upon that charge? - Nobody at all.</p>
               <p>How came you at large? - I discharged my warrant.</p>
               <p>Was not you bound over to the session? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not Orange and Forrester pass their words for you? - No Sir.</p>
               <p>Who might you be at work for that morning? - I was going to look for a day's work.</p>
               <p>The window was open two or three inches? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So you took a peep in? - Yes.</p>
               <p>I dare say you never saw shutters open two or three inches without looking for some of the loose things; was there a dark lanthorn? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was the lanthorn darkened, you know what a dark lanthorn is? - I saw light in the lanthorn, Notely had hold of it.</p>
               <p>So you heard them call out, Notely, hold the candle more this way? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why they were talking loud, were they? - So loud that I could hear; the other man was right over the way, at about as far as I am now.</p>
               <p>Did not he threaten to give you your gruel? - No, he did not threaten me; he did not speak a word to me.</p>
               <p>He saw you peeping and loitering, and then you went about a door or two distance, and they went away; it was your young woman that gave you that black eye I suppose? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>How soon did you tell any body of this? - I spoke of it the next morning to three or four seamen.</p>

               <p>What was their names? - I do not know their names; it was as I was going to Limehouse, going to see for work.</p>

               <p>Can you give me any reason why you did not tell that before, when I particularly questioned you; upon your oath did not you know these men before? - I never did know them.</p>
               <p>When were you in company with them afterwards? - I saw one of them in a public house the night afterwards.</p>
               <p>Who was that? - It was Hurst, that young man with the blue clothes; he was telling some people that they did not get above forty pounds in money.</p>
               <p>How came you in company? - I was drinking a pint of beer with two or three seafaring young fellows.</p>
               <p>What is their names? - They are gone to sea; I cannot rightly tell their names, no farther than seeing them on board a man of war; I did not see them join the other two; I saw four people run away together, and they ran down to the water side.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100075"></xptr>What did you do upon that? - I walked away directly.</p>

               <p>You did not go down to the water side at all? - No, Sir, I did not.</p>
               <p>How near was you to Pelican stairs? - Within four or five doors on the other side of the way.</p>
               <p>You saw them run to Pelican stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did not you go down to look? - I never went to the water side.</p>
               <p>You are quite sure of that? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Nor see what they did when they went down to Pelican stairs? - I did not see any farther than I heard them make a noise in the boat; I did not stop to listen at all; it was a noise as if they were going to push off the boat; I cannot be sure I saw them go off; there were a great many boats rowing about.</p>
               <p>Do you know Pelican stairs? - I never was there in my life.</p>
               <p>How far is it from Fox's-lane? - Not very far.</p>
               <p>How far? - I cannot rightly tell; Fox's-lane comes down to the water side.</p>
               <p>This is the street where the houses open directly down to the water side? - No, Sir, it is six or seven doors where I saw it open.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Captain Stephenson. How far is it down to the water side from your house? - There are six houses between our house and Pelican stairs; the passage down to the water side is thirty-five yards; it is very narrow, and makes it look longer; I do not think it is so much neither; it is about the length of the breadth of this Court.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Are not there a great many lighters at those stairs? - Commonly crowded with lighters, all from our back door to the stairs; I wish them stairs were filled up, and so do the neighbours; for there is none plies there but bad people.</p>

               <p>Did you shew the house to any body after that? - Yes, the Justice sent Mr. Forrester with me, and I shewed him the house.</p>
               <p>Did you go before the Magistrate? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When? - The day after boxing-day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You went yourself to the Magistrate? - Yes, I acquainted Forrester the officer first, and he desired me to go over to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Then that was the only occasion that brought you before the Magistrate? - No, it was not.</p>
               <p>What other occasion? - I was taken up for being disorderly.</p>
               <p>What you had not got into the right train yet? - I do not know what you mean by the right train.</p>
               <p>What was your being disorderly? What was your disorder? - I have no disorder upon me at present.</p>
               <p>What was you taken up for last? - A beadle took me up; I was going down on board of my ship, and I happened to have a match, a steel, and a tinder-box, and a little tinder to strike a light; but nothing else was found about me; I was taken up about half after four.</p>
               <p>Was it not between three and four? - I do not know whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>You saw a cupboard they were opening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A mahogany cupboard? - I cannot say it was a mahogany cupboard; I knew it was a cupboard.</p>
               <p>Did not you get into the house to see if it was a mahogany cupboard? - I shewed the officer the house; I dare say it was a mahogany cupboard; it was the colour of mahogany.</p>
               <p>Then you saw the colour of it very plainly, which made you think it was mahogany? - It looked like it.</p>
               <p>You saw it very plainly? - Yes, yes.</p>
               <p>What light was there? - Am I witch, to tell what light there was in the house; I saw a light in the house, it was a lanthorn; I cannot tell what light was in the house.</p>
               <p>How came you at large? - Because I served my time out.</p>
               <p>What since last spring? - I came away from Woolwich last March; it will be three years this March; I was two years at Woolwich, on board the hulks; and so was them two men there as well as me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. When was you discharged from the hulks? - Last March; I have been at work since.</p>
               <p>I dare say you have not been idle; can you tell me any honest man you have worked for since that time? - The last ship I worked for was the Berwick store-ship, at Deptford; I was determined to take a voyage in it as cook, only for this accident.</p>
               <p>How long was you on board the Berwick? - I was three or four weeks helping to sit her out.</p>
               <p>What ship before? - I was on board the Pearl Frigate. (I must find ears too.) I was in her till she was fitted out about eight weeks; then I left her; I thought to better myself; so I did not sail in her.</p>
               <p>Had you been on board any other before that? - I have not kept an almanack in my head; I first went on board a ship that was laying down at Woolwich, the Dreadnought; I carried her round to Plymouth; she was condemned; I came back in a merchantman.</p>
               <p>So they tried you at Winchester for a burglary? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100077"></xptr>Then you know how that sort of thing is done? - Aye, I believe, I do know.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see any body set about to commit a burglary, and take a light, and leave a window open for people to see? - I believe you to be the best judge; you seem to know more about it than I do.</p>
               <p>Furnish me with a little understanding? - I will as well as I can, but I do not understand housebreaking at all.</p>
               <p>Where was you coming from when you saw these men land at Pelican-stairs? - From Rotherhithe; I had business to do in London, to go look for some prize money I had due to me, for the Monarque.</p>
               <p>Where did you earn that? - Up the streights, if you know the place; I dare say it was about six years ago.</p>
               <p>Who was your agent? - Mackintosh.</p>
               <p>Where does he live? - I will tell you the name of the place, it was in Crutchedfriers.</p>
               <p>Court. Need we go into the black history of this man's life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The moment the Court say that, we have done.</p>
               <p>Is this Watt's hand writing? - I am no scholar; I cannot read.</p>
               <p>Do you know a man of the name of Smith? - Yes, he was no bed-fellow of mine; I was in gaol with him.</p>
               <p>Did you ever say any thing to Smith about Notely? - I never spoke a word to him about Notely; I came from the gaol this morning.</p>
               <p>Have you never said to Smith, that you had Notely under your thumb, and that you would do his business for him? - No Sir, never in my life; I told Smith that Notely hung a man here some time back; that was all that ever I said to him; I never said I would be a witness against him.</p>


               <p>Did not you add, but I have him now? - No Sir, I never did.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, if he had fifty necks, you would hang him? - No, I never did, I will swear that positively, nor any thing like it, no further than Notely was evidence against

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You was taken up for a different burglary? - Yes, and was committed.</p>
               <p>You have been tried? - I was tried once before, and was innocent; that was for another burglary; Holmes that was tried with me was hanged; I was admitted an evidence about last Wednesday week.</p>
               <p>How long was it after before you discovered this burglary? - I told of this first.</p>
               <p>Did you first reveal this burglary before last Tuesday? - Yes, I did; I said it when I was first taken; I owned it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I will not ask him any thing.</p>
               <p>Court. I shall not ask you any question that will accuse yourself of course; but the truth of the answer to my questions may perhaps decide a little on your future fate; now I ask you, on your oath, whether Peters was not with you when you committed this robbery? - No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Was Watts? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see them there at all? - I cannot say I did; I saw somebody there; I cannot say who it was.</p>
               <p>Did Peters speak to you on Pelican-stairs? - I do not know that he did; I do not know Peters or Watts, either of them.</p>
               <p>Richardson never went up from the boat?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178701100079"></xptr>- Never, he came up to the top of Pelican-stairs, but he never came from the stairs that I knew.</p>
               <p>There were only two of you went into the house, and Hurst stood on the outside? - He was to stay by the shutters, but whether he did, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any talk about the dark lanthorn, when you was in the house? - Notely said let me have it now; when he looked in the desk.</p>
               <p>You did not call on him by his name? - I never called on him by his name in the house; I am sure of that; Hurst never was in the house.</p>
               <p>Did Notely take any notice of any person coming to the window? - Not to my knowledge; I saw nobody looking in at the window.</p>
               <p>What sort of a crow was it that Notely broke open the shutter with? - The crow that Notely had was a foot and a half long, his was a crow properly so called; and it was about six inches smaller than his; we had nothing but the two crows and the dark lanthorn; never a one of us had a chissel, that I am positive of.</p>
               <p>Look at that chissel, did you ever see that before? - No, I never saw it before, nor I am sure we had it not with us.</p>

               <p>How long after the robbery was that? - The robbery was done on the Friday morning, and I think it was on the Wednesday following, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Nobody had been taken up before on this robbery? - Notely had been taken up upon bare suspicion of the chissel fitting; that was the day after the robbery was committed.</p>
               <p>When did Peters give this information? - On the 27th; on the Wednesday following.</p>
               <p>Had Notely been detained on suspicion before that time? - Yes, he was committed for further examination.</p>
               <p>Was any thing ever found besides that chissel? - I believe not; no other circumstance had come out, only the trifling circumstance of hearing that these people were together the day before, near the spot.</p>
               <p>The witness Peters was committed before the justice? - No, he was not, he was taken up by the beadle at night, as a suspicious person; I believe he had been before the Magistrate; I had him in my custody for two days, and since he has been in Clerkenwell; Mr. Staples committed him for want of sureties, as being a material witness in this business, as thinking he would not otherwise appear; I saw them sign these informations; Watts's is in my own hand-writing; I saw the Magistrate sign them; this is Peters's mark, and Mr. Staples's hand-writing; this is Watt's mark, and this is the Magistrate's hand-writing.</p>

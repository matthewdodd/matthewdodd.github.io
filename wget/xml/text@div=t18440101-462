                  </hi>. I live in High worth-street, St. Marylebone. On the 22nd of Sept. I was employed by Mrs. Morgan, to watch her shop in Earl-street—I watched in a dark turning, nearly opposite—I saw Cordwell go into the shop—he took a dead goose by the neck, and handed it to Waite, who stood outside the door—he was going away with it—I ran across the road</p>

               <p>and collared him with the goose in his possession—I took him into the shop, and he began scuffling—Cordwell was in the shop all the time—he had bold of another goose, and a turkey—he struck me, and I fell down—he struck me again, and ran away—the officer came, and I gave Waite into custody—I have known Cordwell for two or three years.</p>

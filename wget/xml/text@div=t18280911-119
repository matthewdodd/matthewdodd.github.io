            . I am a Thames Police constable. On the 30th of July, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was on the <placeName id="t18280911-119-crimeloc619">West India Export-dock</placeName>

               <p>JOHN OSBORN. I belong to the George Hibberts. This property is mine - I had left it in my chest in the forecastle, the door of which was locked, but the chest open; I found the lock broken; the prisoner is a stranger, and had no business in the vessel - I fetched the officer, and found him on board; I had not seen him there before.</p>

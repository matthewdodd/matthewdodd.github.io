                  </hi>. I am clerk to Edward Clark, an outfitter, of Pentonville Road, who carries on business as the Universal Co-operative Supply Club—he has a great number of agents to canvass for customers, and each agent is supplied with a cheque-book—John James Roberts was an agent, and was supplied with a book similar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the agent fills in the amount the customer requires, and makes inquiry as to his solvency and collects the money—these four cheques all bear Roberts's signature—on the production of the orders goods would be supplied to the person bringing the cheque—I did not supply these goods—about the beginning of January, acting on instructions, I called on the prisoner Wilson—before that I had issued a number of summonses in the County Court against different people, Alice Oxenford, George Garthwaite, George Fern, and I am not certain about George Lucy—I had seen Wilson pre<lb></lb>viously; she had appeared at the County Court when these actions were going on 5th November—some man appeared for her, who said that he represented her husband; he also appeared for Fern—when I called on her in January I told her that I called from Mr. Clark in reference to several customers who I had sued and who denied all knowledge of the transactions, and we had heard that she knew something of the matter, and she had better tell me all about it, and that we had heard she had made use of those people's names and addresses—she said that she knew she had—I told her I had a list of about 30 names, and she had better tell me what names she had used and I would put a cross against them—she then acknowledged to 12 or 14 names, amounting to 56<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., among which were Alice Oxenford for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of goods, George Garthwaite for 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, George Fern for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth, and George Lucy—she said that she hoped Mr. Clark would not take criminal proceedings against her, and if he would make an account of it she would pay 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I left, and reported to Mr. Clark.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a colourman, of 132, Pentonville Raid—I was an agent for Mr. Clark, and ill March, 1879, I had a book of cheques—I had known Duff 18 or 20 months, he recommended customers to me for Mr. Clark, and I issued cheques to him, Signed by me in blank, Which he filled up—these four cheques were signed by me and given to him: 1163, George Lucey's order, was signed in blank, and 8530 was partly filled up from information given me by Duff—the name in Alice Oxenford's order is in Duffs Writing, both at the top and bottom, and one order is written by him but Hot signed by him—the other two are filled in by his request.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When he got those orders he had already got the customers—I did not inquire into their solvency—the cheque of Mr. Garth Waite was not filled up in my presence—Mrs. Wilson came to the Shop several times—I do not know her writing—orders were not filled up without the person's authority—I gave Duff 15 to 20 blank cheques while I knew him, and the commission was to be shared between us, but I never had any commission—I was not told over and over again that this was an extension of the tally system within another tally System—I do not claim instalments on goods sold, but they are paid at my place Or I should not issue the eiders—five of six weekly instalments Were paid on most of these orders<lb></lb>Mr. Clark would see from my books if customers Were in arrears, and he Would communicate with them—if they paid promptly they saved the entrance fee, but that would not benefit me—if a customer was ill, a month of six Weeks' delay would be granted, after Which I think they would not be allowed the entrance fee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Duff.</hi> I asked Whether this Order was for the widow of the late John Oxenford, and was told that Mrs. Oxenford had a teed hand and could not write her name—I know the writing to be yours—Mrs. Wilson is manager at the Army and Nary Stores', limlicd—yoti Were to pay me half the commission, and I was to return it if customers did not pay—Wilson was to collect money from her people; she was to deduct it from their wages every week.</p>

On 6th March I went to Wilson at 31, Bloomfield Street, Dalston, and told her I should take her in custody for forging an order on Mr. Clark, of Pentonville Road—she turned round and said to Duff, "You villain, you have brought me to this"—I showed here these four orders and asked her if she knew anything about them; she said, "I received them from Duff; I signed them to get the goods"—I took her to the station—Duff walked in front of us—he was called</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector N</hi>). On November 27th Duff brought me a letter, signed "A. Oxenford"—he said that Mrs. Oxenford was ill, and he had written it for her—on 6th March I pointed out to him the similarity between the writings, and asked him whose it was—he said, "Mine"—I then called Wilson into the room, and Buff said, "Mrs., Wilson brought me this order; she said Mrs. Oxenford could not Write, and had authorised me to put her name to it;" we then went into a cigar shop near the Angel, where I signed it, and she put her mark to it"—Wilson made no reply—I said to Duff, "Mrs. Wilson makes some statement respecting you"—Wilson said, "Yes, Duff brought me the orders; he said I could get them filled up in any name I chose, and that if I paid a few instalments it would not be discovered until he was out of the way"—Duff said, "That is not true?"—Wilson pointed to a box containing some letters belonging to her, and said, "If you search that box you will find a letter from Buff asking me to get somebody to go to Clark's as the person mentioned in one of the orders"—Tew Searched the box and found this letter. (<hi rend="italic">This was from Duff to Wilson, promising to send her an order to-morrow morning, and asking her to take it to Clark's and to get a respectable person to go with her and represent herself as Mrs. Isaacson.</hi>)—I asked Duff if that was his writing—he said, "Yes, I admit it"—Wilson said, "On one occasion Buff went with me, after we had obtained goods from Clark's, to a pawnbroker's in Kingsland Road, and he remained in the cab while I pawned the things; I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the money"—"Duff said that he could not recollect whether that was so; afterwards he said it was possible, and that if he received money it was in part payment of a debt which Wilson owed him—I asked Wilson if she owed Buff money; she said that she had—Duff said that he had nothing of the proceeds, but half the commsssion.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. PURCELL</hi>. Wilson had introduced herself some time previously in my private office with a large bundle of testimonials and papers, showing that she had some connection with the Pimlico Stores, but I believe she had then obtained the goods; I afterwards wrote to her husband—she never suggested to me that she could sell my goods, nor did I say that she should have a commission on the sales—I only saw her twice; I cannot give the dates—the bulk of my business is carried on by agents and managers—I was not aware till proceedings had commenced that the orders were not signed by the parties they purport to be signed by; it came out at the County Court, and I then discharged Mr. Roberts, and the result is this prosecution.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. TICKELL</hi>. Wilson represented to me at the latter part of 1878 or the beginning of 1879 that she was directress of the Army and Navy Stores, and I think she was supplied with goods partially on that statement—my manager made inquiries—she paid for them partially, and I wrote to her husband—when I. found that she had no connection with the stores I directed that no more goods, should be supplied to her—I think that was before the date of these orders, but am not positive.

               <p>

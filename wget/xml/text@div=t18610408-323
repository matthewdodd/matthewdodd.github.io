I am the wife of William Clothier, who keeps the Crooked Billet, Wych-street, Strand—on 20th March, the prisoner came, and I served him with half a quartern of rum and a Pickwick, and charged him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the bottle—I am a stranger in London, and that was the first day I had served—they came to 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown—I gave him a shilling, a sixpence, and fourpence-halfpenny in copper—directly he went out I noticed that the half-crown was bad, and laid it on the pewter, by the side of the till—the prisoner had been in two or three times before that day, and he came in again about half an hour afterwards, and called for a glass of ale—I was awaiting his arrival, knowing he would come again—he put down another bad half-crown—I took it up and said, "This is two you have given me this evening; I shall give you in charge"—he then put down a good half-crown, which I put in the till—I showed him the two bad ones—I do not know what he did with them—I never saw them any more—a constable came in directly after, and I informed him of what had happened—t put the bad half-crowns on the till, and I was so worried with calling for a policeman, that I really cannot say what the prisoner did with them—I saw the constable find one on him, but what he did with the other I cannot say.</p>

I went in the house about three or four times; I had two half-crowns, and I am positive they were good. I went in more for the sake of getting change for the second half-crown than for the rum. She said, "I think this is a bad half-crown." I said, "I don't think it is." She took up another one from somewhere, I don't know where, and said, "You have given me another before to-day; I will give you in charge of the police." I said I was not aware that I had done anything wrong, but if I had I would rectify it I do not get my living by passing bad money; if I did I should go further from home.</p>

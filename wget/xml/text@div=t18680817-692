                  </hi>. I am a farmer and cattle dealer, at Southall—on 12th June I saw a boy named Etherington driving four sheep opposite my farm, 400 or 500 yards from the prisoner's shop, going towards it—the prisoner was following him, driving a cart—I said, "What game is this, Norton"—be said, "It is all right; I have received a letter from Mr. Court; I have sent a letter and cheque to Mr. Court"—I knew the sheep came out of my field—he said that he was to have the nine sheep if I did not—the sheep had been in Mr. Court's field, which I let to him, and these were some of his sheep which I had seen in the field the day before—Dwight, Mr. Court's drover, drove them back to my field—the prisoner said, "They are nasty sheep; I will not have them at all; have you got any sheep"—I said, "I have only three fat sheep"—I had them fetched down, and he gave me 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time did you meet him with the sheep? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was before 10 in the morning—I did not notice whether they had a blue mark—the prisoner said, "Sure there is a fuss about the sheep; blast the sheep!

                  </hi>. I live at Southall, and have been thirteen years a shepherd in Mr. Court's service—I saw Ellington on 12th June, not far from the prisoner's place, driving four sheep towards his yard—the prisoner was not there—I remained by the sheep, and in about ten minutes the prisoner called me across, and said, "What business have you to turn the sheep back?"—I said, "When I have orders from master you shall have the sheep back"—he said, "I have written a letter to Mr. Court"—I said, "That has nothing at all to do with me; when I have orders, you shall have the sheep"—I spoke to Mr. Taylor, who said, "I do not know more than what Norton told me"—I do not know what that was—I kept the sheep—they had a blue mark on the shoulder.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time of day was it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Between 12 and 1 o'clock—the prisoner had bought eleven tups and five ewes of Mr. Court on the 11th—it is the habit of dealers to say, "You can take my sheep at a certain price," in the market, and then come for them afterwards, but not to fetch them out of the field.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer and cattle dealer, of Clewer, Northampton<lb></lb>shire—I hired a field, at Southall, of Mr. Taylor—on 26th June I received this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the prisoner; for eleven tups and five ewes, sold to him on the Wednesday before—I had had no letter from him, nor had I written to him—I gave him no authority to remove nine or ten sheep from the field—he never set any price upon them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>the four for a long while afterwards—I sold him after this eight sheep it 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and that is all the dealings I have had with him since he has been at Southall—after I brought this charge I received a letter from his solicitor threatening me with an action—here is the gentleman who sent it to me, and he said, "I wish I had never sent it"—that was before the prisoner was given in custody, but after I had made the charge—(<hi rend="italic">The letter demanded a suitable apology for a gross slander, to be advertized in the newspapers and the payment of</hi> 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to the prisoner, otherwise proceedings would be taken</hi>).</p>

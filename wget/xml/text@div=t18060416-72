               <p>Q. When did you loose your purse. - A. On the 28th of March, at a quarter after eight in the evening, I supped, I goes over and takes some tea and sugar to my daughter at Knightsbridge, it was near ten o'clock when I left her; as I returned I went into the Brown Bear, Knightsbridge, to have something to refresh me; I left there and come forward, that was about eleven o'clock, then I went to <placeName id="t18060416-72-crimeloc430">Hyde Park Corner</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was you drunk then. - A. No, I had only there a pint of beer and a glass of gin; when the girl brought the change back, I put the purse into my left hand breeches pocket, I thought proper then to go home.</p>
               <p>Q. High time. - A. I went out of doors and the prisoner followed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the house then. - A. Yes, she followed me out; when I was about fifty or sixty yards from the house, she came up to me and asked me to give her a shilling, which I refused, I told her I knew better what to do with it.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you and she had not drank together. - A. No more than others.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give her part of your beer. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you. - A. A pint of beer and a quartern of gin, I drank but one glass.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the other. - A. I do not know, it was a soldier's treat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with this girl. - A. No more to this girl than to any others.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know, were you at all in liquor. - A. I had no more than one pint of beer, and two glasses of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. First of all you had your supper, then you went to the Brown Bear, you staid there an hour, you could not stay there without drinking. - A. I had a quartern of gin there.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went to the Triumphant Chariot, and had a quartern of gin, and a pint of beer, where the prisoner followed you out, she asked you to give her a shilling, you refused her. - A. Yes, she instantly made a bit of a push at my pocket, I missed my purse immediately, I called the watchman, he was at a good distance, two women came up and rescued her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they rescue her. - A. They wanted to do it, but I prevented them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she taken in custody that night. - A. Yes, immediately to the watchhouse, she was searched but nothing was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all that passed between you and this woman. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went into the public house, this man was very much in liquor, it was about half after eleven o'clock; when the landlady was turning them out, he said he would not go, the landlady turned us out all together; He wanted to go with me, I would not go with him, he immediately charged me with taking the money; I never saw a farthing of his money.</p>

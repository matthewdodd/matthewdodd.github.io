                  </hi>. I am messenger in the service of Messrs. Atkins and Son, of 62, Fleet-street—I live there—about a quarter past 10, on the night of 15th August, I was about to enter the private door in Bouverie-street in order to go home—it was raining, and the female prisoner came and asked me to lend her my umbrella—I refused, and said I wanted it myself—I went to the back of the premises to look at the fastenings of the shutters—she came round there and asked me again for my umbrella—I told her to go away, for I did not want to have anything to say to her—I then put my hand up to the shutters, and she began to fumble me about—I said, "If you don't go away, I shall give you in charge"—my watch was, at that time, loose in my waistcoat pocket, with the chain inside the pocket where she was fumbling—she then went away—I put my hand to my pocket and found my watch was gone—I was going to run after her, when I was collared by a man, perhaps a couple of yards from where I was standing at the shutters, and not more than two or three seconds after the woman had gone off—I put my hand to my pocket instantly—the man said, "You ought to be prosecuted"—I called out "Police," immediately—he said, "You ought to be prosecuted," before I I called "Police"—he did not say why—he ran away directly I called out—he held me about two or three seconds; his holding me impeded me from going after the woman—I did not see her when I got into Bouverie-street—I cannot say whether the man ran or walked away—I saw a policeman standing opposite Bouverie-street, on the other side of Fleet-street—in consequence of what I said to him, he went down Bouverie-street and brought the woman back—he said to me, "Is this the woman?" I said, "Yes, that I will swear;" and that instant, she put the watch into my hand, and said, "Here is your watch, you won't lock me up?" in the presence of the policeman—I locked her up—when I attended the police-court the next day, I saw Alger in the gallery of the Court sitting there as one of the audience—Cole was then in court—I pointed Alger out to the police—I had an opportunity of seeing his features when he collared me, I looked him right in the face—there was no light except the gas-lamp the other side of Bouverie-street—there was sufficient light to enable me to see him—I have not the least doubt that he is the man—the Magistrate asked me to look round and see if I could see the man—I did so, and in about half a minute I pointed him out.</p>

               <p>the officer who took the woman into custody—I think I saw him in the morning at Guildhall before I got into the box to prefer this charge—I bade himgood morning—he did not tell me that if I looked round the Court, I should probably see the man; nothing was said about it, either by him or anybody else—I had not thought of looking round the Court before I was asked to look by the Magistrate—I was there at 12 o'clock; we were not waiting for any length of time—until I had been asked to look round by the Magistrate, I had not seen any person who I thought was the person who had collared me—he was perhaps four yards from where the woman was in the dock; he was standing—there are seats there for any one to sit down—at the time the woman took my watch, I did not see any man near.</p>

On 15th August, about a quarter past 10 o'clock the prosecutor spoke to me, and I took Cole and took her to the prosecutor—she gave him a watch and said, "Here is your watch, you will not lock me up, will you?"—I did not see Alger at that time—I was at the police-court next day when the prosecutor was asked to look round, to see if he could see the male prisoner, and he pointed him out from as many people as are now in this Court or perhaps more—after the prisoners were remanded at Guildhall, I went below and heard Alger say that he knew nothing of the woman.</p>

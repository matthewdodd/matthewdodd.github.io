I am barman at the John Bull—on 27th February, about ten minutes to seven, a lad asked me for change for a half-sovereign—I went to the till and found a shilling, a sixpence, and a fourpenny piece—the shilling was bad, and I took it to my master, who took it into the parlour and wrapped it in paper—about 11.30 the prisoner came and asked me for a quartern of rum—he gave me a bad sixpence—I bent it and gave it back to him—he said to the woman, "This is a bad one," and paid me with a good florin—I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and he left with the woman—a gentleman said something to me; I looked in the till and found a bad sixpence—I ran after the prisoner, caught him about twelve doors off, and asked him to come back—he did so—I asked him what he gave my master—he said, "Sixpence"—I asked him where the sixpence was which I had given him back—he said that it was the same one—I said that it could not be, because I bent it and gave him in charge—he then gave me back the eighteenpence.</p>

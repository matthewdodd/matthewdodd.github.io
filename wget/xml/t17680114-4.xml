            . I am daughter to the prosecutor; my mother stood wringing her hands, saying she had been robbed of two tubs of butter; I was told by a neighbour that the prisoner had fell down with two tubs; we enquired, and found he lived in an alley in Whitechapel. I with others went down the alley to the bottom, a child shewed me his house; I heard his wife run up, and say they are coming, they are coming; I said you wicked creature, how could you rob my mother, and desired a girl to run for a proper officer, but before one came, the prisoner jumped out of a window and ran away; after that his wife came, and said he was killed; she said do not make a noise, come up, and I will give you the butter; I said then bring it down; some of the neighbours went up with me, she opened a closet, there was the butter, one was in the tub, the other out of the tub, all dirty. I took it and brought it home; there were the letters M O scratched on the tub.</p>

            . I was coming home three nights before Christmas, I met the prisoner next door to Mordecai's; he fell down, I helped him up with his tubs; he went about four doors farther, and fell down again; he had two tubs, one full of butter, the other about half full. When the woman complained of being robbed, I told her of Daniel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>A man came running past and fell down, and left the butter; I said I should be glad to know who it belongs to; this man said it would be the best way for him to help it on my head, and I to carry it home, and see about who owned it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. to S. Mordecai. Did these tubs stand in your house or at the door?</p>
               <p>S. Mordecai. They stood behind my counter, there were two doors to open before he could get to them.</p>
               <p>For the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Markas Garrick. I was at work the same night, at the prisoner's mother's house, she is a baker; she sent me to call him to work; I went to him to the Blackmoor's-head, he was drinking a pint of beer; I asked him if he would come to work; he said he would come and tell his mother he was not able to come to work; he seemed to be a little in liquor; then when the woman came and said she had lost a tub of butter, he said he was coming along to his mother's and found it.</p>
               <p>Marks Marks. The same night this affair happened about a bit of butter, I was sitting in a public-house in Duke's-place; the prisoner came in between seven and eight o'clock; he staid a little while, and asked me if I would be three farthings to his penny; we staid and drank it; then came in Cowen. The prisoner called Garrick, and asked him if he would come to work at his mother's; he went out with him, and came in again, and called to me; I said, what do you want; he said here is a man in Shoemaker-row with a firkin of butter, that wants to sell it; I said, why do not you stop him; presently after there came word, that the prisoner was taken up with a firkin of butter; he follows the baking business, in selling cakes about Duke's place.</p>

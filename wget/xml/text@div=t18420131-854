                  </hi>. I am apprenticed to John Vooght, a butcher, in Lark<lb></lb>hall-lane, Clapham. About half-past eight o'clock, on the 26th of Ja<lb></lb>nuary, I went into a timber-yard adjoining our premises, and saw a bundle of fat tied up in a handkerchief—I took it in, and my mistress opened it—I took it back, and put it into the same place—I believe it to be my master's fat—on my afterwards going to the spot it was gone—I fetched my master—he told me to watch in one place while he watched in another, and at a quarter-past nine he called to me—he said he had got the prisoner—I had seen the prisoner wearing such a handkerchief as the fat was in, round his neck that morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Stannard, who keeps the York Hotel, in Covent-garden. On the 18th of Feb., I saw the prisoner—she gave me a counterfeit crown-piece—I did not discover whether it was bad or not—I immediately gave it to Mr. Stannard—on the 22nd, she came again, and gave me a counterfeit crown—I gave it to Mr. Stannard—on the 28th, she came again, and threw down a crown-piece on the counter—Mr. Stannard took it up, looked at it, and told her it was bad, and that she had brought two before—she repeated the word "bad?" five times over—Mr. Stannard then asked where she brought it from—she said from across the Park, and then said a gentleman in the Strand gave it her.</p>

I received a crown-piece on the 18th, 22nd, and 28th of Feb.—the two first I received from Worley—the last I took from the prisoner myself—I did not discover that the first was bad till I had paid it away, and it was brought back to me after I had received the second one—I then compared them, and found they were precisely the same—I wrapped them up in paper, and put them in a small drawer—I gave all three to Walter.</p>

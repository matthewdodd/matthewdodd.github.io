                  </hi>. I am an upholsterer, and live at Camberwell—on Friday morning, the 21st April, about 2 o'clock, I was at the corner of Parliament Street—I parted with a friend there, and then went over Westminster Bridge, in the direction of Camberwell—I was accosted by a female just as I got over the bridge—I shook her off and went a little way further, when another woman came up to me from behind and swung herself round in front of me, and said "You have soon got rid of her"—I said "Yes, and will soon get rid of you"—I could not swear that Lewis was the woman, it was so momentary—nothing more passed, but she ran away—I felt for my purse, and found it gone—I ran after her—Clough ran out into the middle of the road and laid hold of my right arm—someone halloaed out and a policeman came running towards me—he told me to run after Clough instead of the woman—I gave chase to him and saw him caught—I did not notice Cooper there—I noticed a second man running, but I had hot seen him before—my purse was in the left trowsers pocket—there was a half-sovereign in it, and twelve or thirteen shillings—I had</p>

I was in the Lower Marsh about 2.30, the other side of Westminster Bridge—I saw the prosecutor and Lewis there—I knew her before—all at once I saw her run down York Street—the prosecutor made a start to catch her—Clough ran across the road, and took hold of him—I started to go across the road, when Cooper sung out to Clough "Come on, it is time to go"—he was on the opposite side—Clough then let go of the prosecutor, and they both ran up the Lower Marsh, and into the Westminster Road—I ran to the prosecutor, and asked what was the matter—he said he had been robbed by a female—I pursued Clough and Cooper for about 100 yards—they saw another constable in front, and commenced walking—I took them, and said I should charge them with being concerned in robbing a man of his money in the Lower Marsh—they said they had not been there at all—I saw the woman in custody afterwards—I can swear she is the woman—I have seen the men on three or four occasions—I only lost sight of them as they turned into the Westminster Road, for about a quarter or half a minute—I am certain Cooper is the man that spoke—I swear to them both.</p>

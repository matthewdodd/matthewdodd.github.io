            ; on the first of November, between the hour of eight and nine in the evening; I went out to fetch some candles, I left nobody at home but my little girl, a twelve-month old; I locked the door, and after I had locked it, I tried it by the knocker, and I am sure it was fast, and the windows were fast.</p>
               <p>Court. Are you sure they were fast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long did you stay out? - Almost ten minutes; when I returned, I perceived the door about a quarter of a yard open; I was quite stagnated, knowing that I had locked the door; and as I stood, I heard a rattling within; I was going to step into the house, and I drew back my foot, and at that instant three men came out of the house; I stepped a little way down the court, and they all run out, and I run after them and cried, stop thief! and I saw one of them, which was the prisoner, had my property in a bag; I believe the prisoner to be the man.</p>
               <p>Was he stopped at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you see him stopped? - No.</p>
               <p>How long after he run out of the court was it, that he was stopped and brought back? - About twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Where was he stopped; I think it was in Hatton Garden, he was brought back to me in about twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts did you lose sight of him? - At the corner of the court.</p>
               <p>What light was there in the court? - There is a lamp over our door.</p>
               <p>What opportunity had you to observe the faces of the men that came out of your house? - No further than I stood at the door when they all rushed out; I should know the other two men if I saw them; the prisoner was the first that came out.</p>
               <p>Can you venture to say positively, that the man that was brought back to you, was the same man that you saw come out of your house? - I believe him to be the same man.</p>
               <p>Are you sure of it? - Yes, I am sure of it.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him before? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Then can you, seeing a man run past you, in the instant when you are a good deal frightened and flurried, take upon you to swear to the man? - I believe him to be the man, so far as the light over the door enabled me to see him.</p>
               <p>But you cannot undertake to swear positively that it is the same man? - No, Sir, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Were your things brought back? - Yes, they were brought back with the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Who brought him and the bag back? - The constable, his name is Griffiths.</p>

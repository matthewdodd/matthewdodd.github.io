                  </hi>. I live with my brother Joshua Duke, a school-master, in Gray's-buildings, Kingsland-road. On Tuesday afternoon the 10th of November, at three o'clock, I came from the kitchen to go to the dining-room, and saw the prisoner by the mantel-piece, taking the watch off a nail there—he went to the door, returned and put the watch on a chair—I called, "Thief," and laid hold of him—he tried to get away at the side-door—he opened the door, lifted the latch up, and went out into the fore court—my brother came to my assistance, went after him, and he was brought back.</p>

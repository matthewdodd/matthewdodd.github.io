             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am a watchman: On Tuesday, the 3d of March, at eleven at night, I saw two men come up to the waggon in the Swan-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the waggon loaded? - A. Yes; it was loaded early in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who the two men were? - A. Yes; the prisoner, who was the waggoner, was one of them; the other was Mr. Cox's porter; they brought a parcel, and flung it down at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180104150082"></xptr>tail of the waggon; he took his ladder and let down the tail of the waggon, and Mr. Cox's porter assisted in putting it into the waggon; when the prisoner first came to the waggon, I called out, who is there; he answered, it is I; what have you got, says I; says he, a little cabbage; then I knew his tongue, and said, oh, master waggoner, is it you, how do you do; he said, middling; I said, let it be what cabbage it will, it is heavy cabbage; Mr. Cox's porter said, it is a hundred and a half, I helped him to it, and I am to give him a shilling for carrying it; then they wished me a good night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Who was this porter that was to give him a shilling for carrying it? - A. His name was Richard, I don't know what his other name was.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knapp. I am clerk to Mr. Cox; I was sent by him after the Newbury waggon; I overtook it near Slough; the prisoner was driving it; he was in the tail of the waggon; I asked him what he had taken up the over night at the Swan, Holborn-bridge; he hesitated a little and said something, but I do not recollect what.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prisoner know you? - A. Yes; he went on to the Reindeer, at Slough, and I went with him there; I had the indigo taken out and put into another waggon that was coming to town, and had it brought to the Swan, Holborn-bridge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did you come to town with it? - A. No; but I remarked the number, (it is produced); here is a hole in the bag which the prisoner cut when I came up to him, to see what it was; he said he thought it was smuggled tobacco; it turned out to be indigo; he wondered that Cleveland should ask him to put up such an article as that into his waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Cleveland the porter that helped him up with it? - A. No; another porter.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of Cleveland? - A. He was taken up, and discharged before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Cleveland was taken before he had time to leave you? - A. He was taken up directly.</p>
               <p>Q. He was examined several times before the Alderman? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. When you overtook the waggon this article was not put under any thing by way of concealment? - A. No, he sat before it, but there was nothing upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not immediately tell you he was requested to carry this? - A. Yes: he told me Cleveland had promised him one shillings-worth of something to drink for carrying it. (The property was identified by Mr. Cox.)</p>

               <p>Court. Gentlemen of the Jury, I think it would be too much to convict the prisoner upon this indictment; the charge is not for defrauding his master of the carriage of this parcel; but the question for you to try is, whether the prisoner stole these goods, or whether he merely took it up as cabbage; it will be for you to say, whether it was not the other persons who stole it, and whether he did not carry it merely for the sake of the shilling: if you should be of that opinion, you must acquit him. If the prisoner had disposed of these goods, if they had been in a state of concealment, or if he had denied that he had such goods, the case would have been very different; there was, it is true, a little hesitation; but that might arise from a consciousness of his having taken up goods which ought to have been brought to the master's account. The question therefore for you to decide will be, whether he carried this parcel for the sake of the shilling, or whether he was connected with those porters in taking it away: it does not appear to me upon the whole of this transaction, that you can see your way safely to the conclusion that he was concerned in stealing it. <rs id="t18010415-137-verdict768" type="verdictDescription">

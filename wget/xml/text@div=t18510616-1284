                  </hi>. I live with my mother, Jane Elizabeth Rushton, in Mile End-road. Caroline Jordan was in my mother's service about three months—she was discharged about April—while she was there some things were missed—Charlotte Jordan is her mother—before Caroline had left, her mother brought to our house some lace cuffs, a habit-shirt of mine, and a pair of shoes of my mother's—Charlotte said she did not know the things were at her house, except the shoes, and her daughter told her the shoes had been given her—on the day that Caroline left, her mother came for her, and brought some more cuffs and collars belonging to us, which had been missed while Caroline was there—my mother told Charlotte that it was very funny or strange that she should not know that they were stolen goods—I do not recollect what answer Charlotte made to that—my mother told her of some other things</p>

               <p>that were missing, and she said she would bring back what were at the house, but she never came again—on the Saturday before we went before the Magis<lb></lb>strate, I went to Charlotte's house, at Stratford, with my mother and Miss Williams—we asked her why she had not brought the things back—she said she had not anything in the house belonging to us, to her knowledge—Miss Williams said she would fetch a policeman; we went to the station and got one, and went with him to Charlotte's other daughter's, at West Ham, in consequence of what Caroline had said—we there found some silk, and some edging—we were then going to Charlotte's house again, and we met her near the station—we went and searched her house, and found a purse and a chain, with a gold snap, a netted blind, some muslin and edging, and a habit-shirt, which had been missed while Caroline was with us—when the purse was lost, there was 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in it—the purse and habit-shirt belonged to me, and the other things to my mother—there was a parasol top and some ear-drops found in Caroline's box—the. netted blind and the edging were found in Charlotte's room, and the other things in the back-room—I don't remember that the mother said anything when the things were found.</p>

               <p>I am constable of the parish of Hayes; I took this horse as I was going along with the prisoner in a cart, I saw the horse in a field; I was going to take the prisoner to London, as Mr. Martin was not there, I went no further than Kensington; the prisoner said, that was the horse which he sold to Mr. Wycherlae.</p>
               <p>Did you make him any promise or threat to induce him to make that confession? - No; then I stopped the cart, and the boy said, he was sure that was the horse; I knew the horse, and I was satisfied it was him; it is a very remarkable horse.</p>
               <p>Wycherlae. This horse was bought by Price for me; I sold it to Mr. Sadler, at the Crown at Kensington, for two guineas and a half; he was broke down very bad behind, and could not go above a mile an hour.</p>
               <p>Of no great value, I suppose? - I should have thought at that time, he was worth about 4 l. I took the horse and led him up to grass; the prisoner said, that is the horse that I sold to Price, and the prisoner said, that Price ordered him to bring another if it was a grey one; then I enquired who the field belonged to; and I found this horse belonged to the gentlewoman of the house; Mrs. Sadler, the Crown at Kensington; the gentlewoman gave me the liberty to take him back to Mr. Martin's; Wycherlae had sold him to her.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Do you remember Cook bringing the horse to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is it the same horse? - It is; it is a very remarkable horse, he had a sore back, robbed by the cart saddle; he was wrung in the shoulders, and let down very low behind, and a little before, he had a wart on the shase; the constable brought him home, and kept him in custody for a week; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178710240044"></xptr>have had him four or five years; I have no doubt of the horse; the prisoner lived at Hillingdon, about a mile and a half off; he is a <rs id="t17871024-36-deflabel198" type="occupation">labouring boy</rs>

               <p>Tried by the first Middlesex Jury before Mr. Justice HEATH.</p>
               <p>Court to Price. You appear here in a very bad light, buying this horse, and if it can be proved what one of the witnesses has said, that you ordered him to bring another horse, and that could be brought home to you, I certainly should order a prosecution against you; it is owing to such people as you, that servants are induced to rob their masters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Adolphus Leopold Fill and his two sons, ironmongers, of Broad-street, Bloomsbury—I have known the prisoner above three years—he has been a customer at my master's shop—on Tuesday evening, the 6th of April, I saw him in our yard about half-past seven o'clock—Mr. Barrett came and told me to go and watch him, which I did—he looked out three bars of iron and one bundle of road—he went into the shop, and the bars and rods remained in the yard—the shop is the place where he would have to pay for them—he had a man with him, and he was employed in tying up the bars while the prisoner went into the shop—I saw the prisoner come back, and when he came out, he took down a rod of iron and laid it on the scale with the other three bars of iron—there was no one at the scale then but the prisoner's man—Bugler had weighed the other iron, and it was tied up by the prisoner's man—Bugler had then gone to serve another customer—when the prisoner took down the rod of iron and placed it on the scale, he helped his man with the iron on his shoulder, and the prisoner immediately followed him with a bundle of road—I came down and asked Bugler what the prisoner had had, and I told what I had seen.</p>

               <p>morning a man came and stood outside the shop-door while I was putting out some goods—he said "Who is the young man that gave Lawrence in charge?"—that is all I know about it—it was not a solicitor, it was some hard-working man—I do not know whether he came from a solicitor—it was after that person came, that I came down to his court, last session, and went before the Grand Jury.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the prosecutors' employ. I know the prisoner—on the 6th April he came in the evening to my masters' shop—he looked out three bars of iron—I then looked him out a bundle of round rods—I weighted the bars—the bundle of rods did not went weighing—I then took the board into the shop with the weight of the bars chalked—I put it on the counter—I left it there—I do not know who took it—the prisoner accompanied me into the shop, and I left him there—I was told to go after the prisoner, and I went after him—that might be about six or seven minutes after he left—I did not overtake him—I went straight to his place—it might be about twelve minutes after he left the shop when I got his place—when I got to the end pf the turning, I heard the prisoner throw the bundle off his shoulder—I heard the bundle fall down—when I got up to his place one end of three bars was down the cellar, and the other end up, and the bundle likewise—there was no light—the prisoner told his man to get one, and went in his shop—I overhauled the bars—there was no rod there—I saw a piece of a rod in the shop—it was a whole rod I was sent for.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> The three bars were tied together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, at each end—the rods were fastened in the usual way—I found a piece of a rod lying on the floor his shop—I never knew a blacksmith's shop in which I could not find a piece of iron on the floor—I told the prisoner he had better come back with me, and he said, "Very well"—he called his man, and they bath came back with me—I did not see the iron on the prisoner's man Sims' shoulders—I did not see it was in the scale, till I saw it in the pri<lb></lb>soner's shop—I went before the Magistrate next morning, and was too late—I heard at night that an action was going to be brought—I was afterwards told to came here, and go before the Grand Jury—I have been fourteen or fifteen years with my employer, and I have known the prisoner all that time.</p>

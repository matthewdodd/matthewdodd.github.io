               <p>Did she go off with it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you ever find it again? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see it in her hand? - Yes, she held it up, and slipped it down into her pocket; it was in my fob.</p>
               <p>When did you see her again? - On Saturday; this was on Wednesday.</p>

I asked him why he did not advertise his watch; he said he had had it thirty-five years, but did not know the number; he wanted two-guineas to make it up.</p>
               <p>To the prosecutor. Was you in liquor? - No; I followed her; I thought she would give it me again.</p>
               <p>Did you offer to take two guineas to make it up? - I did not; I believe somebody did go to her to make it up.</p>

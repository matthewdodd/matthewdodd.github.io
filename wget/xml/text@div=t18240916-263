On the 26th of August, about a quarter or twenty minutes after ten o'clock at night, I saw Shannon go out of doors with a small bundle in her hand, Pickering followed her with a quart or pint mug, which, I cannot tell. Pickering put down the mug on the stones, and locked the door, and tried it after her: she went a little way, returned and looked through a little crack in the shutter, Shannon stood still until she came to her again, she said something to her, and they both went away together: three or four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160101"></xptr>minutes after they were gone, I was at my window up stairs, and saw a light through the crack in the shutter, it appeared to me for about half a minute to be gone out, and then to increase a great deal: my son was coming down the street, I called to him to go over and look through the crack, I saw nothing more.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Shannon was Pickering's servant - A. I do not know, I have seen her there. Persons have collected before the house and broken the windows; that might be about three weeks before the fire: I do not think it happened more than once: the officers were there several times, through disturbances between Pickering and her sister. I have seen the neighbours about; the windows up stairs were all broken.</p>

            . I am the last witness's son. On the 26th of August, about a quarter past ten o'clock, I was coming from work; my mother was looking through the window, and in consequence of what she said I went over and peeped through a crack in the shutters of Pickering's house, and saw a blaze in the room. I crossed over to my own door, and looked through the shutter again, and could see the light in the room - I immediately crossed again to convince myself whether it was a fire or not; and seeing that it was, I knocked at the door - no one was there to answer; some young men were talking at the corner of the street. I gave the alarm of fire - they came and broke the shutters open, and broke the windows. I ran home, and got nine or ten pails of water and threw it over the fire. Deadman broke the door open with a crow-bar. I went into the passage with a pail of water; the watchman shewed me a light while I broke the door open, and entered the room. There was a little bag of paper shavings on fire in the cupboard on the first shelf, and an old pair of bellows and some rags in the cupboard were also on fire. One or two of the cupboard shelves were on fire: there was no fire any where else. There was no candle or lamp there - a bed laid on the floor close to the cupboard. I did not notice whether the cupboard was a fixture, or whether it was built with the house - it had no door to it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you been there before you went over - A. Directly. I threw the water in from the street. The cupboard was close to the fireplace, and had no door to it; all the windows in the upper part of the house were broken a fortnight before. I have seen one or two hundred people making a disturbance before the house. I cannot say how often it was - I will not swear that it was ten times. Perhaps I have seen it six or seven times.</p>

            , and live at No. 3, opposite to Pickering's house. On the evening of the 26th of August, I saw Pickering standing at her door; Shannon came up to her in a few minutes with a pot in her hand - it wanted about ten minutes to ten o'clock; they both went in, and shut the street-door after them - waited five or ten minutes, and then opened the street-door, and stood in the passage, and said something to each other. They then shut the parlour door - one of them had a bundle and a pewter pot on the pavement at the street-door. Then both came out - Shannon took up the pot and bundle and went on a little way, while Pickering locked the door, and tried it, and said,</p>
               <p>"It is quite safe." She went on to overtake Shannon - returned again, and looked through a crack in the shutters. Shannon returned, and took hold of her, and with a horrid expression, said,</p>
               <p>"Are you going to stay here all night? - I myself have made all that right." They had not been gone ten minutes before, I saw a glimpse of light through the shutters as I stood at the door. Stacy's son went and broke the shutters open, and gave an alarm. I did not go over - it is a narrow street, they talked loud enough for me to hear them on the other side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you and them particular friends - A. Not particularly good or ill friends; if they had looked over, they must have seen me. Mrs. Stacy was at her window up stairs; there were often mobs about the house. I have often seen the officers there, but it was not owing to any of the neighbours; there was a gas lamp against their passage, which enables me to see into the passage.</p>

            . I live in Turnmill-street. On the night of the 26th of August, I heard a cry of murder, and went to Castle-street. I went into the house after it was broken open, and saw a fire in the cupboard; there was a bed and mattress against the cupboard, and some shavings in the cupboard. I broke the shelves down - I saw no fire when I was in the house, but had seen it when outside; the rags and shavings had burnt as they laid at the bottom of the cupboard - the shelves were burnt: I knocked them down with a shovel. I do not know whether the cupboard was a fixture or not. I went up stairs, and found a deal table placed against the first floor door, outside; there was nothing in the room; some furniture was on the second floor, but none in the lower room that I noticed.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What furniture was there - A. I saw a chest of drawer, a mattress and bedstead on the second floor, and there might be chairs and tables. The table was put against the door, to prevent any one from getting in, as the windows were broken - they had been broken two or three weeks before.</p>

            . I live in Turnmill-street. On the 26th of August, I was at my door; an alarm of fire was given. I broke the street-door open with a crow bar, and found the shelves of the cupboard burning - I have been at the house before. I think that the cupboard was originally built with the house, as it communicates with the wainscoat - all the shelves and the side of the cupboard was burnt. I pulled it down; the shelves were fixed to the wainscoat, either by nails or screws; there was cuttings of paper, old rags, and a pair of old bellows, part of which were burnt - the mattress laid on the floor. I had seen it three weeks before precisely in the same situation. I put my hand to the grate, the ashes were quite cold, and there was not the least appearance of fire having been there that night - the fire had gone no farther than the cupboard; there was a table in that room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. A rag merchant.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean a dealer in marine stores - A. You may call me so:</p>
               <p>"Dealer in marine stores" is written over my door; I call myself a rag merchant: I deal in iron and lead. I have seen persons collected round the house several times; when I went there a fortnight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182409160102"></xptr>before, there was a mob. I think I told the Magistrate that the side of the cupboard was burnt. The paper cuttings were white slips: I cannot say whether they are what people put into grates in the summer.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I heard an alarm of fire, and went to the house about twenty minutes after ten o'clock, and saw fire in the cupboard in one corner of the room, the whole cupboard appeared to be on fire; it was rather abated by water being thrown on it. I got a lantern, and saw a bed and mattress on the floor, with one laid against the cupboard. I took a small heap out of the cupboard on a large shovel; it happened to be some paper shavings, a pair of stays, and the wood of a pair of bellows, they appeared all to have been on fire, but put out by water. On the morning of the 26th, to the best of my recollection, about a quarter or ten minutes after five o'clock, I saw the prisoners in Turnmill-street; Pickering seeing me, came over and said</p>
               <p>"Watchman, people may think I have been out all night, being out so early in the morning, but I have not; I have been sleeping at a house which I have lately taken, for there is a bad lock on the door, and I was afraid to trust it, and now I am come down to see how this house goes on, for I have 200 l. worth of property there." Between a week or a fortnight before that, I saw some furniture carried out of her house early in the morning, it was loaded on a cart or van, she helped to carry some things; Shannon was with her. I went off duty, returned in about twenty minutes, and the cart was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it on the morning before the fire that you saw her in the street - A. To the best of my recollection it was, but she told me before the Magistrate that it was Sunday. I have seen a number of persons collected round her house. The paper shavings were like some I have seen in grates.</p>

On the night of the 26th of August, as soon as the fire went out, I went with Rice to No. 15, Slade's-place; Pickering had taken that house, she was going to bed there - she asked what I wanted her for, I said I would tell her as soon as she got to the watch-house, and when we got there she asked me to be as good as my word. I said she was charged with setting her house on fire; she seemed much alarmed, and asked for water, and before that could be obtained, she went into hysterics. I went to the house next day, and brought away the cupboard, shelves, some burnt paper and rags.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is Slade's-place from the house - A. Three or four minutes walk. I knew where to find her.</p>
               <p>RUEBEN RICE. I was with Clark, and apprehended the prisoners - they had lived in Slade's-place for nearly a fortnight. I have the cupboard shelves, stays, bellows, a gown, and pieces of paper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The gown is a stuff one - A. Yes - it is not a thing which easily burns. She had slept at Slade's-place for a fortnight before the fire, and had moved part of her furniture there. I saw Pickering in Castle-street between three and four o'clock in the afternoon of the fire. I have frequently seen persons collected before the house, and she has sent for me to disperse them - she was obliged to move in consequence of it.</p>

On the 12th of June, I was sent with Mr. Edwards's coach to Willis's rooms. I went to a public-house close by, called for some gin and water, and took out four 1 l. notes from my fob to pay. I afterwards put them into my fob again, on the top of my watch. I did not change either of them. I then ran home as fast as I could - when I got as far as <placeName id="t18200628-100-crimeloc565">Bedfordbury</placeName>

I refused, she instantly put her hand into my waistcoat pocket, and took 5 d. out; she would not return it, but said she would spend it - we went to a public-house, and had two glasses of gin with it - when we came out, it struck me, that as she took my halfpence, she might take my watch - and I put my chain down into my fob, on the notes - she walked on, and insisted on my going further with her. I said I would not, she instantly put her hand into my fob, and got the watch and notes out. I caught the watch in her hand as she pulled it out - I took it from her, and put it in again. I then felt and missed the notes, she ran down a passage, and was taken about two hours after - as the publican knew her, and gave information. She went by the name of Modest Mary. I was with them when she was taken, about twenty yards from where I was robbed. I positively swear she was the woman.</p>

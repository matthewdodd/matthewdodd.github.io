I took them from him: I had laid a sixpence down just before; I missed the sixpence, nobody else had been in the bar. My property is of no great consequence; but he had a good deal of property upon him. I sent for a constable, and he searched him, and took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to frequent your house? - A. He said he had been in my house, I don't know that he had.(

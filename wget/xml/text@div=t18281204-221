On the 17th of November, I received one thousand for Mr. Knott, and delivered them to the prisoner, about a quarter before six o'clock; they were all in one cart, with two horses - they were Mr. Nurse's; I saw about one thousand bricks in the Alpha-road, on the 22d; Mr. Nurse has two marks on his bricks - one is W. N., and the other N.; I never authorized the prisoner to take any bricks there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. It was not light at that time? A. No - there are fifty or sixty men employed on the wharf, and about thirty carts; there are two moulds; the bricks are all marked so at that place - there are millions made there; I have sold a great many.</p>

            . I live in Little James-street, Pomona-place, Lisson-green, and keep a horse and cart. The prisoner applied to me, on the 17th of November, to go round by the Nightingale public-house, and fetch up some bricks, and bring them to Steven's-buildings, for Mr. James - I removed them at two loads, as I had but one horse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you were taken up? A. Yes - when the Magistrate was about to commit me, I told them; there were about one thousand bricks; I showed Mr. Darke the place I took them to - I do not know that Mr. James was there when I shot them; when I took Mr. Darke there, the building was carried up - there was no building when I went.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you take any bricks out of the wall? A. Not then, but we have since, and I have them here; they have the mark on them.</p>

Yes: I cannot tell how long ago - I am not very often there; Mr. James lives in York-mews, nearly a mile from the wall - I was not there when the bricks were delivered; I was there about a fortnight before - I do not think the wall was built then; the foundation was laid, it was level with the ground; I took this brick from the wall this morning and washed it, to bring it decently to Court.</p>

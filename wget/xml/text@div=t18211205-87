On Saturday night, between six and seven o'clock, the prisoner and another came and had a glass of gin each, the prisoner tendered me half-a-crown, which I looked at, and said it was bad, she said, it was not, and it was impossible it could be for she had just taken it. I returned it, and asked her to give it me back - and thought it was bad; she said, she was certain it was not, and that I did not know good from bad. I asked for another; she said she had no more money about her. Ferris, the officer, came in, I gave it him, he said it was bad; the other woman also denied having any money; four-pence halfpenny was found on her, and on the prisoner was found another bad half-crown and seven-pence; she said it was impossible both could be bad.</p>

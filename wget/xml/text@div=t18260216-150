On Saturday, the 28th of January, between one and two o'clock, I was in the office, below where I live, and some persons gave me information - I went into my parlour - my wife, who was very ill, and lying on the sofa, said "The girls think there is a woman in the house;" immediately the girl said "Here she is;" and I saw the prisoner pass from the kitchen - she had come in at the lobby, and then through a private door, came up to the part of the house which I occupy; she was a perfect stranger to me, but I saw her dropping a number of things out of her apron under a table - they are now here. I took hold of her, and asked what she did there; she said"Oh, the gentleman, the gentleman;" she then said"Here is your property; I am a poor woman in distress -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182602160073"></xptr>I have got nothing;" I then sent for an officer, and when he came he proceeded to search her - a silver table-spoon dropped from her person.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter-in-law - I live with him. I heard a gentle knock at the street-door, and then I heard the door open; I conclunded that my sister, who was in the parlour, would open the door; I went just afterwards towards the kitchen and saw the glimpse of a person in a white shawl, and a straw bonnet; I then went and asked my mother if any person was in the kitchen; I then went out and saw her going up stairs; I immediately called for Mr. Dimes, and gave her a push into the kitchen. The property she took was up stairs in the bed-room.</p>

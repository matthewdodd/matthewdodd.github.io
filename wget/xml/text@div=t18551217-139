                  </hi>. I am master of Merchant Tailors' School, and have been so ten years and a half. It is my duty to reside in the house, south of the school, nearer to Thames-street—the school is on the north of the house, on the east side of Suffolk-lane, which is a narrow, pre<lb></lb>cipitous lane, leading from Cannon-street to Upper Thames-street; it has only width for one carriage—I know the premises nearly opposite my house perfectly well—till lately I believe it was a warehouse for ordinary goods, packages of various descriptions—since April last the defendants have been in possession of those premises—since then a' business has been carried on which appears to be connected with the mixing of some spirit or other—I have seen the mixing going on in the street—they transfer the spirit from one vessel to another called the tarboy—when they are mixing it, a very noxious effluvia is produced—I perceived on my premises there was a very noxious smell of this naphtha, which is very offensive—of course it is not so bad when they are not mixing it as when they are, but it is very bad then—I have no means of knowing whether any persons sleep on the defendants' premises—I and my wife and family sleep on my premises, and a good many boarders—I have now sixteen—generally, when they are not mixing it, if the weather is at all warm, there is a very sour stale smell, like the escape of naphtha from a lamp—it pervades the lane, and the rooms of my house—my own library, and my kitchen, and the front door of my house are towards the defendant's premises—I have not attempted to use that library lately, I was driven out by the smell—I perceived it in that room very badly indeed—I gave up the room in consequence—when I attempted to use the room in the summer, I found the smell from the lane gave me the headache, and nausea, and falling sickness—I really could not sit in the room—I had not had such symptoms before—I was obliged to have the window open sometimes in the summer, and then of course the whole room was pervaded with this nauseous smell; and on last Sunday I noticed the smell very bad when I came home from church in the morning—it has been so since April last—it is considerably less in cold weather, and it is more when they are mixing than when they are not—the stuff in this phial (<hi rend="italic">smelling it</hi>) has the same smell of which I complain.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT "WILKINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I am afraid there are several other subjects of annoyance in that neighbourhood? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I have complained of want of light—I do not know that I complained some time ago, when those premises were used as warehouses, of the streets being blocked up by carriages and waggons—occasionally they are—I have represented that my dining room was reduced to a mere cavern, but I do not know that I stated that the carriages were a special annoyance—at the back of my house is a skin warehouse—that is an unpleasant smell—I do not know what skins they are, I believe they are foreign skins—they sometimes emit a very unpleasant smell—I think next door to the defendant's is a wholesale druggist's, but I really can hardly swear it—I do not know whether there is a wine and spirit merchant's a little beyond that.</p>

Not the one you mention, but the one at the top of the lane; I thought the smell came from washing their casks—there are three or four large houses between that and the defendant's—in Nov. four gentle<lb></lb>men came to look over my premises—they came over my house—I do not know whether some of these things were mixed while they were there</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170105"></xptr>
               <p>they said they had been mixing them—I did not discover any smell from the lane, but from the gentlemen that had been in the warehouse there was a very unpleasant smell—they brought it in with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have just stated that the windows of the library were closed; was not your hall window open? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know—I did not see it—I never complained to the defendants of that smell—I have complained to my own friends, and to the master of the Merchant Tailors' Company—my health is tolerably good just now—I do not know that this evil has added much to the medical expenses of my establishment—my boys have bad no illness—they say that the evil of which I complain is a very powerful antiseptic.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILDE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you aware that antiseptic means to keep from rotting? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—when those gentlemen came to me they told me they had been mixing, and they smelt like it—I said to them, "Gentlemen, you have brought in the smell with you very strong"—I went with them down into the study at their desire—they wished to go—the window and door were perfectly shut up all day—I did not find any smell, there—I led the gentlemen into the room as far as I can recollect, and I said, "There is no smell here"—the skins in that warehouse are, I think, dried skins—they seem to be brought from abroad—there is only a warehouse there—I have smelt them at times—I never felt any sensation of sickness or headache from them—the druggist's at the top of the lane was where the smell came from—I spoke to Mr. Reid about it, I think about May—I did not know what the smell was—I asked him if he washed his casks in the lane—during the whole time I have been there, I did not experience this feeling till the defendant's place was in operation—I do not know that I complained to any one about the carriage way being blocked up—I did not speak of the lower rooms being darkened—it is the upper rooms—the northern rooms.</p>

We reside in Upper Thames-street, at the end of Suffolk-lane—we have lived there since Feb.—in April we began to be annoyed by a strong smell of spirits and naphtha—it came from the defendant's premises, next door but one to where I live—it was very unpleasant—it always smells in the house—it has had a very great effect on my health—it has produced violent head ache and sickness, and frequent fainting—I had not been troubled with these symptoms prior to this—I was obliged to leave my home for five weeks in July—I went near Watford, in Hertfordshire—I perceived this smell in the small dining room that we generally live in, and in my bed room—on retiring at night I find it in my bed room—on 24th Oct.

I felt I was restored, and I returned to my duty—I have not felt so strong as I did previous to going, but generally speaking my health is very much improved—I have not smelt the smell lately so much as before, except once Mrs. Richards had pasted some papers against my window, and they pulled them down for the windows to be repaired, and I then smelt it very much, but the window has been put in repair a fortnight or three weeks, and now I do not feel any inconvenience from it—the smell was worse in the warm weather, but I did not know whence that proceeded till I had an opportunity of going into the warehouse with Dr. Taylor, and I perceived that the smell there was the same as that that pervaded my own dwelling.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cook to Dr. Hessey—I think I went into his service on the 16th Oct.—as soon as I got there I experienced a bad smell—I never smelt such a smell before—it made me very ill indeed—I had violent giddiness in my head, and headache, and sickness—the stuff in this bottle has the same sort of smell—it came from opposite our house—the kitchen windows are directly opposite the defendants'—I am obliged to keep the windows shut, and at times I could not go near the street door—I am obliged to get my fellow servant to go, on account of the smell.</p>

                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Edwards, a solicitor—his office is at No. 3, Laurence Pountney-hill—that is to the eastward of Suffolk-lane—I am employed there from day to day, generally the whole day—for the last few months a very unpleasant smell of naphtha has pervaded our office—in the back rooms the windows look into Suffolk-lane—it is very strong indeed there—I have no doubt it came from the warehouse of the defendants, because we wrote to them, and received an answer from them, which is the reason why I conclude it comes from their premises—it was very much better for a short time after that, and then it was as bad as ever again—we have a good many clients come, and they have complained of it—I have been there since Christmas, 1853—I had perceived this smell before last April—it affected me somewhat in the same way as fumes of charcoal—it causes a very disagreeable sensation in the throat—it is not near so bad in the clerks' office as it is in Mr. Edwards's office at the back.</p>

                  </hi>. I smelt this smell very much last summer—it was very offensive indeed—it was undoubtedly naphtha—my office abuts on Suffolk-lane—the windows look on Suffolk-lane—it has had different effects on me at different times—it depends on my own health—at times it produces giddiness and nausea, and it affects my sight—it has never caused me to vomit—I am a very robust man.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a doctor of medicine, and fellow of the Royal Society, and have very extensive practice as a chemist. On the 19th Oct. I went to examine the defendants' premises—I met with very great kindness and attention—I went to Mrs. Richard's house first, and I perceived at the back, adjoining the wall of the defendants' premises, a smell, which I immediately recognised as wood naphtha—it was strong—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170109"></xptr>
               <p>saw at the wall of the defendant's premises there were four lower windows, imperfectly glazed—they were stopped with newspapers and other things—I then went to Mr. Robinson's, at the corner of Suffolk-lane, which is nearer to the defendant's premises—I perceived the same smelt of naphtha there—I went into the defendant's warehouse—I perceived the smell of naphtha there stronger—I found wood naphtha stored there with other things—the defend<lb></lb>ants said the wood naphtha amounted to about 5,000 gallons—it was in tins holding, as I was informed, twelve gallons each—there was no mixing going on at that time—all the naphtha was in those tins—there was spirits of wine there—I was not informed what quantity—I then asked to look at the place where the mixing took place, and there were two large vats for mixing this naphtha with spirits of wine, according to the Excise regulations—each vat was capable of holding about 2,000 gallons—they were partly open at top—there was a sliding valve and a hopper in the centre—the top of the vat was not open, only the centre where this hopper was—there was no spirit in at the time I was there—the course of mixing would be to put in the spirits of wine or the naphtha-it would not matter which was put in first—they would mix and blend together—let them stand a little tune, and they would chemically mix—it is taken out, at a tap below, in tarboys or tins—in drawing off it would emit a vapour, it is so very volatile—it would give out its vapour the same as gin does in the street—there is 1-10th of naphtha mixed with 9-10ths of spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What time would it take to put alt this into the topper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The tins have rather narrow necks, perhaps half an hour—it does not require to be long in the vat, I should think twenty-four, or thirty-six hours—it would be in the process of putting in, and drawing out, that the effluvia would evaporate—at the time I was there none of these processes were going on, but, notwithstanding that, there was a very strong smell escaping from these tins—the effluvia is very volatile, it diffuses all over the place—it is lighter than alcohol, and is perceptible to a much greater extent—in hot weather there would be so much more Vapour go off that the smell would be greater.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILDE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What is this naphtha? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The product of the distilla<lb></lb>tion of wood—it contains tardy oil, which is very inflammable—it is used by chemists, chiefly for spirit lamps—it does not give much light—it is used for heat more than light—there is another naphtha, which is obtained from coal, which gives great light but not much heat—the effect of breathing this vapour, mixed with air, produces insensibility—it has been used for that—it is more powerful than chloroform—it has been used on horses during surgical operations—nausea, head ache, and giddiness are such symptoms as naphtha, mixed with air, would produce—it is decidedly narcotic.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it possible for a person to become used to it, so as to be less affected by it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—to persons constantly in it, the effects would go off—but there are some who never can get used to it, and not be affected by it—it depends on the constitution—it is very inflammable—it is more inflammable than the vapour of spirits of wine—it would be ignited under circumstances where spirits of wine would not take fire—in hot weather it would be very dangerous to bring any light in connection with it—it would be most dangerous to carry on by candle light—if any fire were to take place in the neighbourhood, it would be a most dreadful explosion, I think more dangerous than gunpowder—in one experiment, I poured some on some gun<lb></lb>powder, and it burnt off itself without setting fire to the gunpowder—gun<lb></lb>powder requires close contact with any hot body, but this will ignite from a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185512170110"></xptr>
               <p>distance—I held a bit of red hot iron over a saucer of gunpowder, and it would not ignite at the same temperature that a saucer of this did—it is an explosive, inflammable gas—there are substances more inflammable than this—ether is more inflammable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What would the effect of water on it be? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> This hot liquor would float on the water, and be carried down the street—this would still burn over the surface of the water—a very large body of water might extinguish a small quantity of it, but 5,000 gallons would have the effect of burning down a large part of London—this has been tried as a liquid for infusion into dead bodies, but the smell was so offensive that the students could not go on with the operation—they preferred the smell of the body—I would, certainly, sooner sleep with a barrel of gunpowder in my room than I would with a barrel of this—this is capable of being ignited from a distance.</p>

I examined the defendant's premises on the 24th Nov.—there were about 800 gallons of naphtha there—they were not then mixing—the naphtha was in tin cans—there was a strong smell of naphtha—the effects of the vapour on persons is first an offensive smell, then nausea, headache, giddiness, and insensibility, and temporary disturbance of vision—it produces the sort of effect that other narcotic vapours produce—if a large quantity of this were stored, no doubt a considerable quantity of vapour would go off—in hot weather especially—it is very volatile, indeed, it is very inflammable—if there were any fire in the neighbour<lb></lb>hood it would be very dangerous—I watched to see if there was any fire, or candle, on the premises, and I found no lights were used on the premises.</p>

My house was broke open last Sunday was se'ennight, about eleven o'clock at night. Sharplin the evidence, who was my apprentice, went down to let a person out who had supped with me; he came up and informed me that the counting-house window was broke open, and the desk shattered to pieces; a piece of the shutter was taken out, and a hand put in, and the bolt lifted up, and ten guineas and forty shillings were taken out of the desk: the upper part of the desk was found on the east side of the church-yard; a carpenter and some neighbours, on seeing it, said it was impossible it could by done by people on the outside only, which caused me to suspect my apprentice: there were some implements found by the watchman in the church-yard.</p>

A long time passed and no opportunity happening, it was agreed they should break in at the compting-house window last Sunday was se'nnight, and break open the desk. There are two bolts to the shutter, they bid me leave the upper bolt undone, and bolt the bottom bolt, and that they would break open the shutter and lift up the bottom bolt; they came on the Sunday night and broke in; I was on the outside of the wall, and helped Stevens over the wall; they broke open the window, and broke the clerk's desk open; and they came again a second time, I was then in the kitchen, which is right over the counting-house: they told me on the Monday, that there was but six guineas good; they took away the desk and carried it into the church; they said they got back again over the wall by means of a little ladder they had; that when they got over the wall the first time, it was about seven o'clock; that when they got over the second time, it was about nine o'clock.</p>

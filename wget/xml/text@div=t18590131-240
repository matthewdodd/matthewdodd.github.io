On 23d December, about 20 minutes past 12, I was in Aldersgate-street—I received information, and went to Arnold's ink manufactory, 135, Aldersgate-street—I found two policemen there; Clark, one of them, handed me a screw-driver, a right-hand glove, and a broken candle—I searched the premises, and found the sky-light broken, as if some one had fallen through—about an hour afterwards I went to the station, and saw the prisoner there, and a woman, who has since been discharged—I had the glove and the other things in my hand, and Lyons said, "That is my glove, but the other things are not"—the inspector asked him what the glove was lined with—he made no answer, but Grieves said, "It is lined with red velvet or plush"—it is so lined.</p>

On 23d December, about a quarter past 12, I received information about a skylight, went to the side door in Half Moon Passage, and saw the first floor window open—on being admitted by the housekeeper, I saw the skylight, and found underneath it on the floor a right-hand glove, a screw-driver, and a broken candle, which looks as if a knee had fallen on it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—my notion is, that the persons had gone up the staircase of another house, and out at the window on to this skylight, the woodwork of which, being rotten, went in, and the men with it, as I guess—if they just put their feet on the skylight, they would go right through, and fall nine or ten feet, but I do not consider that they must have out themselves with the glass.</p>

On the night of 22nd December, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I saw Grieves at the bottom of Half Moon Passage, twenty or thirty yards from Messrs.

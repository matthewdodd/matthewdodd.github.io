                  </hi>. I have come from Maidstone—previous to my going to Mr. Jackson's at the Prince Albert, Regent's Park, I had not been in any employment—I do not know the date that I was barman at Winter's, but if he says that it was from 4th March till 9th June I believe it is cor<lb></lb>rect—I was in service at Hoxton before that, but only a month and a few days—after I left Winter's on 7th June I went to and fro to Wood's, I knew him previously—I know he was not there till 21st June—between 21st June and 11st August I mostly went up every morning at 9 or 10 o'clock and got home in the evening at 5 or 6 o'clock—I did not wear an apron, nor did I serve, or get weekly wages, but he gave money at times, sometimes he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of a night and sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he has never given me a character before—I used to clean boots and knives and forks and sweep out the bar—I saw Mary Millian there, and she must have seen me—I had no set wages—I advertised for a situation—I told Wood I was going to do so, and asked him to assist me, and he said "Yes"—I saw Alfred Jackson, but I cannot say the date; I gave him his own letter, which was a reply to my advertise<lb></lb>ment—I told him I had been living at Wood's, at the White Horse, in Long Acre, as barman—I was not at Wood's when Jackson called there—when I received the letter from Jackson I went to Wood and thanked him for his kindness in giving me a reference to Jackson—it is true I left on the next day, August 22nd, having been there twenty-two hours, I do not know what for—I saw Wood three or four days after and told him I had left, and I went to and fro to Wood's occasionally—I then advertised again with different initials, and Mr. Brown answered me, from the Black Horse, Deptford—I went and saw him—he asked me where I had been living—I told him at Wood's, Long Acre, as barman, for six or seven months, but I never mentioned Jackson's name—he asked me what wages I wanted and told me what he was going to give—I did not see Wood till after Mr. Brown had seen him—I then told him I had got Brown's situation—he said he thought Brown seemed a very nice man—I remained with Brown until I pleaded guilty at the police-court; I heard that Wood came to the police-court, but I did not see him, I heard his name called.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have known him three or four years; I knew him at the public-house he had before this one, but did not help him there—I believe I was honest, I did not steal his money, or cheat him; I believe I always behaved honestly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Humphries, and live in Gore-lane. I hung two shirts and a shift in my yard to dry on the 4th of March, about a quarter to three o'clock in the afternoon—when I returned home at a quarter to ten at night, I missed them—the line was cut—these now produced are what I lost.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of a policeman. About twenty-five minutes past nine o'clock, as I was going into the yard to call my cat, I saw a person like the prisoner standing in the yard—he had something under his left arm—I called to my husband to come to my assistance, as a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> was in the yard stealing Mrs. Humphries' linen—before he came to my assistance the prisoner ran away—I followed as far as a gas-light, but</p>

               <p>I could not follow him farther—I saw him throw something from his left arm under Mrs. Hammersley's window—I have known the prisoner up<lb></lb>wards of twelve months—I am positive he was the person—he had not got many yards with the things before he threw them away, just inside the entrance gate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> The witness told a little girl that lives with Mrs. Humphries that she saw a man in the yard with something light on his arm, but who it was she did not know; if she had known me to be the man, and I not liv<lb></lb>ing yards from the place, I should have been taken the same night; a policeman will state he saw me in the lane at twenty minutes to ten o'clock talking to a young woman; I stood talking with her till about ten minutes to ten, and then went home; I did not go down the lane till half-past nine; I had been to meet my father.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 51, St. Paul's Road, Canonbury—on 5th July I went to bed, having looked round and seen the house safe—my daughter disturbed me at about two o'clock, and I sprang a rattle—a neigh<lb></lb>bour came—I went round the house, and found the side door belonging to the garden had been opened, and a zinc plate which had formed a ventilation, to the pantry had been cut out—it had been fixed in the brickwork like a window—I cannot say whether a man could get through the hole, but a large boy could—I found a pair of boots outside—a constable came—I looked over the house, and in about an hour some candlesticks were brought, which I had left in a cheffonier which was unlocked.</p>

On the morning of 5th July I was on duty in St. Paul's Road, Canonbury—soon after two o'clock I heard a rattle, and went to Mr. Jacobson's house—he gave me some infor<lb></lb>mation, and about an hour afterwards I saw the prisoner, and two others not in custody, coming from Canonbury Park Square, about 200 yards from the prosecutor's house—when they saw me coming they turned and went away—I ran after them, and saw the prisoner throw a bundle over some railings into a garden—I went after him—he ran into another garden—I went after him, and he threw a stone at me—he afterwards ran into a garden where I had seen him before, and I saw him get out of an empty water<lb></lb>butt—I was with 34 N—we went into a house where there was some glass broken, and found the prisoner up a chimney—we were obliged to light some paper in the chimney before we could get him down—I left him in the sergeant's charge, went to the garden</p>

I was with Patis—I heard a rattle spring, and found the prisoner about six feet up the kitchen chimney of a house—it was very thick with soot, not having been swept for twenty years—I told him that if he did not come down I should light a fire—I lit some paper and he came down—I saw the hole which had been covered up with perforated zinc—it was quite large enough for him to get through—the other men got away.</p>

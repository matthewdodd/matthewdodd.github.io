             sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to the prisoner's at the house of one Norton, on the 22d of May, in <placeName id="t17800628-11-crimeloc65">Plough-court, Carey-street</placeName>

I knocked at the door; I met Mrs. Norton coming out of the cellar. I put her into the parlour in custody of one of the constables. I went down into the cellar, there I saw the prisoner Storer sitting at work at the press; he had the copper in his hand, and was cutting out blanks for making halfpence of; he did not see me till I put the cutlass over his hands. This cecil (producing it) is what the blanks were cut out of. On the other side of the cellar there was a very large press and dies in it for making halfpence; there were a quantity of half-pence by the press which were finished.</p>

               <p>I went to the house a quarter of an hour after Prothero. In one cellar there was a large press. In another cellar adjoining, there was a small press. In taking the large press down I found a quantity of halfpence, which were finished (they were produced) one of the presses was for cutting blanks, the other was for stamping the impression.</p>
               <p>Mr. GREGORY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a monier of the Mint. The half-pence produced by Mr. Clark and Mr. Prothero, are counterfeits.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Norton who belonged to the house, told me to carry a screw home for her belonging to the cutter, and asked me to put it together, for her husband was out of town. I went down to put it together for her, and these gentlemen came in the while and laid hold of me.</p>

               <p>I was out of Place. Mrs. Norton gave me leave to be in her house till I got a place. I never saw this young man in the house in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178006280047"></xptr> my days before that morning. I am sure he never worked at the press; and it was not in order for work.</p>

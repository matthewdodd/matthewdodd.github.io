Curtis from Stone-stairs wharf, Ratcliif, to Smith's distillery, Whitechapel—it was customary for every man at the wharf to receive a ticket with each load of sand—a man a the other end was to receive the ticket from him—John Keating was placed at the wharf—in consequence of something that came to my knowledge that day, I gave the prisoner into custody—I told him he was charged with stealing a load of sand—he said he only received one load, and that he delivered, and the other part of the time he went to have his horses shod—I did not meotion two loads to the prisoner—he, without my having said anything about two loads, said only one had been delivered.</p>

On Tuesday, the 12th of Sept., I was superintending the loading of sand at the stone-wharf, Ratcliff—the prisoner came that morning to fetch sand—he came first at a quarter-pastseven, another man named Mansfield came at the same time—each had a cart—the prisoner's cart was loaded with sand when I left the wharf—his cart was larger than Mansfield's—I handed the prisoner his ticket, No. 694, when his cart was nearly loaded, and he requested me to give it to his mate, Mansfield—I</p>

               <p>did so—the ticket has on it, "Rook, one load of sand"—I am sure this is the ticket I offered to the prisoner with the first load—I left the yard before his cart left—I saw that curt, drawn out in the main road by the prisoner, about ten minutes after I left the yard—it was then about twenty minutes to eight in the morning—I went to Mr. Smith's distillery, which is about a mile from where the sand was delivered—if the prisoner had gone straight it would have taken him about half an hour—it was five minutes to eight when I to the distillery—I staid there till twenty minutes to ten—he did not come with his load while I was there—Mansfield brought his load while I was there, about twenty minutes past nine—I left the distillery twenty minutes before ten—I went to the wharf, and found the prisoner there loading his cart with sand—it was about one-third full—I had come straight back from the distil-lery to the wharf—I asked where he had taken his first load—he said, to Smith's, where he had been accustomed to take it—I said, "You make a mistake, you have not taken it there"—he said, "I have, I will lay you a wa<lb></lb>ger of 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—there the subject ended—I gave him this ticket, No. 696, with his second load—I gave Mansfield two tickets—he was taken up, but the Grand Jury have ignored the bill against him—I was on the premises all the time I was at Mr. Smith's—it was impossible for him to have brought a load of sand there without my seeing it—a load of sand would weigh about two tons, and would be worth about 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I received the ticket I have produced to-day from Withalls, at Mr. Smith's distillery, next morning, and some other tickets for things taken in the afternoon.</p>

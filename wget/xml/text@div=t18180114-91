On the 13th of December the prisoner came to my house about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning, by himself, and had a glass of gin, which came to 2d - He gave me 1s. I gave him 6d. and 4d.. I held the shilling in my hand, suspecting it was a bad one - I had just taken a bad one of a woman. I compared the two together, they corresponded; they are now together, and I cannot distinguish one from the other-one of them was given to me by the prisoner. I went out after him immediately, and saw him come out of Atkin<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181801140042"></xptr>son's house; we followed and secured him in Carter-lane. He was searched, and another bad shilling found on him-(looks at them)- these are the two, one of which the prisoner gave to me.</p>

            . I keep the Bell, public-house, on Addle-hill. The prisoner came to my house on the 13th of December, and had a glass of gin, he gave me a shilling. I looked at it, and asked him for another, thinking it bad - He said he had not got another. I told him he had given me a bad one the day before. He said, "I did not change that shilling." I told him to go away, returned his bad shilling, and took the gin from him, telling him not to try it again, as he would get into trouble. He said he had no more money of any kind. Cheesman came in, and we went out together and took him.</p>

I went into the Green Man, public-house, in Bucklersbury, the woman followed me, the prisoner came in after her, called for a glass of gin, and offered a shilling, which Mr. Humley said was bad.

            . I am inspector of the Police of Acton. On Sunday night, the 18th of October, about a quarter-past ten o'clock, I was on duty in Pigwell-field, near the park road, in Acton parish, and heard some footsteps; a little farther I saw the prisoner, just by the gate which divides Pigwell-field from Park-road - he was on the footpath - Clark, the officer, who was with me, first got up to him; I laid hold of him by the arm, and asked where he was going - he said home; I asked where that was - here plied to Barton's court, Hoxton; I asked where he had been to - he said to the Bird Cage, at Stamford-hill; there is a public-house of that sign - I asked what brought him that way, as it was not in his road from there to Hoxton - he said surely a gentleman might take a walk, which way he liked; I said it appeared to me rather strange he should take a walk that way at that late hour in the night - I and Clark took him to the watch-house, supposing there was something amiss; I saw Clark search him - the prisoner pulled off his coat, put his arms out, and said, "Now, search me;" nothing was found in his coat, but the skirts of it were wet - after Clark had done searching the coat, he went up to the prisoner, took of his hat, and in it was this silver tea-caddy (produced by Clark) - when his hat was laid down there was likewise some leaves of privet and quickthorn came from his hat; I then assisted in searching him, and found him wet nearly up to his knees - I desired him to pull off his shoes, and they had then got water in them, as though he had recently come out of some water. I know Miss Flower's house; I first saw him about two hundred and fifty yards from their house, going by the road way, but by going over the field at the back of the house, it is about fifty yards nearer - in coming that way a person would have a ditch of running water, about two feet wide, to cross; it is generally about eighteen inches deep - when I met him he was going as if he had come from the field where that ditch was. On the Monday morning I went to the prosecutrixs' house, examined the field and the ditch - I traced footsteps from the house, across the field, to a gap in the hedge, one side of which is privet, and the other quickthorn; after returning through the house, I went the road way into the field, and observed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182910290045"></xptr>an appearance of some person having slipped down the bank of the ditch into the water.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say he had found the caddy? A. I asked where he got it- he said he picked it up; I have heard other property was picked up about the fields and road - a woman, who was in charge of the house, was taken up, the ladies being absent in the country: I have heard the son of a woman who was in the house has absconded - the woman was held to bail before the Magistrate; I do not know whether she is in custody now; I have inquired every where for her son, and cannot meet with him - I have searched for him; there were three examinations before the Magistrate - I am not aware of any witness being here who knew he was living in the house; I have searched for him to bring him to trial.</p>

Next morning I examined the field adjoining Pigwell-field, and found two cruetstands in that field - I saw Plumb find a pepper-box stopper near where we found the cruet-stands; that field is at the back of Miss Flowers' house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Then articles were found loose? A.

            . I am the prosecutrixs' servant. I went up to bed at the same time as Bland; I was not up when the watchman came - when I got up the house was apparently in the same security as the night before; no door or window was open - the front door was on the single lock as Bland had gone out; it was bolted and chained at night - no window nor any door was broken; I saw my brother last on the Sunday of the robbery - he came to the house, and was with my mother and me; my mother did not live there - my brother was a seafaring man, and was seeking for a ship; I dined in the kitchen - the plate and articles were kept in the bed-room I slept in, in the portmanteau produced, which is Miss Flowers'; it stood under my bed - I had seen it last on the Friday; it was not locked - my brother came there about three o'clock that day; I went out, leaving him with my mother; I returned at nine, and he was gone then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Did you ever see the prisoner before? A. No; I have not seen my brother since the robbery - he lived with my mother, about five minutes' walk from Miss Flowers'; I do not know where my mother is -I cannot tell whether my brother took the portmanteau out and hid it in the ditch.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had your brother been from sea? A. Four or five months; he had been gone four years and a half from the family; he came home about five months ago from the hulks at Sheerness - he had done something; I do not know what - he was at sea before he went to the hulks - he went from the Marine Society.</p>

When I went out in the morning the front door was regularly closed as it was the night before; no part of the house was broken - the chain was up as I had left it; I went to the house about a quarter to ten o'clock - I knew of nobody being in the house, except the servant when I went to bed.</p>

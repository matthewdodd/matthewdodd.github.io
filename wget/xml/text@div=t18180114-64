On the 10th of November, between twelve and one o'clock, the prisoners came into my shop to look at some seals; they staid a considerable time looking over the goods, and then went out. In about an hour or two afterwards I missed the seal, which was a very remarkable one, and told my man if he should see them again to secure them. Next morning Plummett came, and not seeing me, he was to call in about an hour; he came in about five hours- I told my man to go to the banker's, by which I meant to get an officer; the moment he went out Plummett left the shop, and ran away- he was secured. I am sure the prisoners are the men that came the first time. I never found the seal- nobody had been in the shop after them till I missed it. I saw Plummett handle it.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Ganthony-On the 10th of November the prisoners came to the shop to look at some gold seals- I reached the case, they said they were too dear. Plummett handled several of them, and the last in particular - We afterwards missed it. Next morning Plummett came again, I called Mr. Ganthony - He said he could not stop, but would return in a quarter of an hour. Between twelve and one o'clock he came, I went for an officer, when I returned he was gone.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DRINKWATER. On the 29th of November I was sent for to Mr. Bamfield's, in Cheapside, and the prisoners were given into my custody.</p>
               <p>PLUMMETT'S Defence. They asked 38s. for the seal, I offered 30s., and went away-next morning I went again, and asked if they would take it, the gentleman said no, and I left.</p>
               <p>MR. GANTHONY re-examined. Not a word of the kind passed- he asked to see my goods, and then ran away.</p>
               <p>PERRY'S Defence. I went to the shop with Plummett.</p>

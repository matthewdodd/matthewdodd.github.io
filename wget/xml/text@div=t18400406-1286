                  </hi>. I keep a book-stall, in Carnaby-street, Golden-square. Some time ago I was indebted 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to a person named Scott, for which I received a summons—I attended the Court of Requests, at Westminster, and was ordered to pay the sum in four weeks, with 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. costs—I went to the Court, I think, on the 28th of November, to pay the money, and saw the prisoner in the Court, opposite the place where the money ought to be paid in, where they call people's names over—I was looking about, and the prisoner said to me, "What is your business?"—I said I had come to pay in some money which I was sued for by Mr. Scott—I had the order with me, and showed it him—he said, "It is all right, I can take your money; it will be perfectly light"—I had not known him be<lb></lb>fore, nor did I employ him—I understood him that he could take my money for the Court—I firmly believe he said, he was an officer of the Court—he said he could take my money, and it would be perfectly right—he said he had not got a pen and ink there, but if I would walk with him over the way, he would take my money and give me a receipt for it—I went over the way with him, and paid him the money, because I believed him, from his own words, to be a lawful officer of the Court to receive the money—I paid it under no other impression—I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the debt, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the costs—he gave me this receipt on a card—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—"Received the debt and costs due to Mr. Scott, of the Gas Company, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. Charles Duneclift. Nov. 28"—when he gave me this card, with this receipt on it into my hand, I said, "Now, sir, is this perfectly right?"—he said it was perfectly right, and I should never hear any more of it—on the 9th of March a distress was put into my house for the same debt, and 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more costs, and I had to pay it twice over—I never taw nor heard any more of the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the chief clerk of the Westminster Court of Requests. I am the proper person to receive money paid into Court there—there is no other person authorised to receive money—the prisoner had no authority to receive money, or to act in any way—an order was issued for William Pedder to pay the debt and costs, and it was not paid in—there are two orders up in the Court against agents receiving money.</p>

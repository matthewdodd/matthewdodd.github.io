               <p>Q. Will you swear he was the person who pawned the things, or whether it was not the other man? - A. They were both standing together, and I put the money down on the counter; they were there but a very few minutes; if I had met the prisoner in the street, and had been asked if I knew him, I should say, yes; but if I had met him accidentally, I should not have given it a thought.</p>

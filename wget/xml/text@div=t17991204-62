               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Davis was the man that knocked you down, and took the money out of your waistcoat-pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You said so the last Sessions? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the Jury acquitted the prisoner, though Davis was the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you swore then as you do now? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You applied to the Court for your expences, did not you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you were refused them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps you have heard of such a thing as a forty pound reward? - A. Yes; you told me so yourself.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that there is a forty pound reward if this man is convicted? - A. I do not want to convict him, I was bound over.</p>
               <p>Q. You never found these halfpence of shillings, or looked for them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you were perfectly sober? - A. I was not quite so sober as I am now, I knew what I was about; I had had nothing but part of two pints of porter to refresh myself in the day, and six-pennyworth of gin and water among two of us; there was a witness of mine, Bracher, that made a mistake, and swore that Robus was the man; he told me, after I had left the Court, that he had made a mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. The first warrant that you took out was only for an assault? - A. Yes, at Worship street, and the Justices would not hear it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you afterwards went to Lambeth-street, and got a warrant for the robbery? - A. Yes.</p>

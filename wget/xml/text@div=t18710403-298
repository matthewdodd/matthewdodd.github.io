I am a pawnbroker, in partnership with Thomas Read—on Tuesday night, 6th March, I saw the warehouse safe at 10 o'clock, before going to bed—my daughter called me the next morning, and said there were two men at the kitchen window—I told her to be quiet, and I went to the front window and called for a policeman—there was a policeman about 100 yards away, but he did not come quickly, and the men got away through the back premises—I did not see the men—I found these seven blankets down the garden, which I identify as pledges—a square of glass had been taken out of the kitchen window—there were two or three clothes props placed against the wall, so that a man could climb up and get through the window—the blankets are worth about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

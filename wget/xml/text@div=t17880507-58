               <p>I work for Mr. Chawner; the prisoner worked in the same house, though not in the same shop; the wire mentioned in the indictment, was delivered to me to manufacture, on the 19th of April; I put it in my box, and having occasion to go out of the shop, on my return I missed it; when I saw it at Guildhall it was very much bent; I think it was bent a little before; I did not see the prisoner take it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many pieces of wire were there in your box? - There was another beside that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How many in the whole? - Two, the other that was left was stronger and longer.</p>

               <p>I work for Mr. Chawner in the same shop with the last witness; there is a convenience to make water at the end of the shop; the prisoner came in under that pretence, and put his hand into Wendelbow's box and took out the wire, which he bent and put into his pocket, so that it might not be seen; I went up to him and interrogated him, on which he put it in the box again; I collared him and carried him to my master; and took the wire out of the box to shew to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Why did not you stop me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178805070093"></xptr>when you saw me put it in my pocket? - Because you did not give me time.</p>

               <p>Crow brought the wire to me; I delivered the prisoner in charge to the constable, and left the wire in the constable's possession; it has the appearance of being drawn in a plate; that is my property; it is unfinished wire, and given to Wendelbow to work in a tureen.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is it your silver or the workman's you deliver it to; whether upon a deficiency the workmen is not answerable to you? - It is my property; I weigh it to the men, and expect a proper return.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord; it is very false; Crow never saw me take the wire; I never touched it; there is a reward which is paid by subscription by the masters for prosecutions of this kind; Crow has swore falsely to get the reward.</p>
               <p>Court to Crow. Do you know of such reward? - Yes, but I never expect any, nor never mean to take any.</p>

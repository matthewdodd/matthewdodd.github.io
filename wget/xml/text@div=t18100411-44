               <p>Q. In consequence of that were you called upon for the purpose of identifying the person of the name of Bains - A. Mr. Churchhill asked me if I knew the prisoner to be the man of the name of Bains; he said he came over in the Warley.</p>
               <p>COURT. The name mentioned in the paper - A. Yes; the name mentioned in the certificate - Bains.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you sign this receipt which was the receipt of wages of Bains - A. I witnessed it by the desire of Mr. Churchill. I signed a receipt as a witness of another person, a seaman, and I signed this receipt as a witness that the money was paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gleed. Is that the receipt signed by you - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>COURT. You understood it to be a payment; you saw a payment made of a sum which you supposed to correspond with the sum in the receipt of thirty-four pounds and a fraction - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was taken without objection as to the amount - A. Yes, as to the amount, by the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of some suspicion that was entertained did you go to the house in which the prisoner lodged, when he was taken - A. I did. I think it was in the latter end of January, or the beginning of February; I found him at a bonnet shop in Whitechapel-road, opposite of Union-street. The prisoner was in bed; I told him he had been doing wrong, he must go with me to the India House; he said he was not afraid of going, he had not been doing any thing wrong.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that signature, did he make that signature the T and the N altogether - A. That is the way he signed; I observed that is the way he wrote his name at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You particularly looked at it and saw that he wrote in that manner - A. I did not particularly look at it, but I saw that is the way he wrote.</p>

               <p>Q. That his name was Bains you only knew by the production of this piece of paper - A. Lawson called him Bains, and the other people of the ship.</p>

               <p>Q. Hyams put his name to it to authenticate it as much as he could - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. With respect to the description that he gave of Bains, and being an American, did you find that correspond with the name that you had of a man on board the ship, in the Ledger - A. Yes; it corresponded with the surveyor's account. Before the ship sails the surveyor has the ships crew mustered, he asks the names and puts them down, the station, age, and country.</p>

               <p>Q. I do not know whether you know the hand-writing of Jones - A. No.</p>

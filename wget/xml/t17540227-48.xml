I considered him as my servant till the 2d of July last. He came backwards and forwards after that, and I paid him for his attendance; he had not settled his books till about August, at which time he was ill, and had been some time before he had the care of my whole business. He bought in all my goods, served in the shop, and kept my books, and I had very great losses at the time he was my servant, but did not suspect him, till one day, my daughter being at a house in the city, about the 6th of Feb. where was the Prisoner's daughter, who said, she was going to have a new suit of cloaths, of a rich yellow tabby; and that her pappa had had it by him a great while, and it was a whole piece. My daughter told me of it when she came home; and I having lost so many things, that it is impossible to tell my losses; I made diligent search for this piece. I never had but this one piece so rich a yellow silk in my life, I could not find it.</p>

            . I am very sure it was not. Then I sent Mr. Manger to the mantua-maker, who, the daughter said, had it to make, for a piece of the silk, to see if it was the silk I had lost, which he did, and I have all the reason possible to believe it my silk which I missed Then I looked over my books to see when this piece came in, and found it came in in Feb. was twelve-month. Then we went and took the silk and the Prisoner before Mr. Fielding, there he was charged with taking it; he said, he bought it of a Jew, in St. Mary-Axe, for seven shillings and sixpence a yard, and that there was thirty-four yards: [she holds it in her hand.] I do verily believe it is my silk. I never since I was in business had but this one piece of such rich yellow silk, for which I gave the maker 11 s. an ell. I got a search-warrant and searched the Prisoner's house, there I found two silk handkerchiefs, one about the Prisoner's head, and the other about his neck, which I can swear to be my property: [she took them both in her hand, and measured them by one in her pocket : they were uncommon ones for largeness.] These I swear are my property. It was a piece of taffaty, of a bad colour, and I had it printed in eight handkerchiefs for my own use. I believe there is none so large, and such as these are, in London.</p>

            . No, I did not. I had lost three out of the eight, and was much inquiring after them to the Prisoner; he said, you have left them behind you, where you go; you having a multiplicity of business, may have forgot them.</p>

            . I reckon they were worth seven shillings and sixpence each when new. I found a very great deal of goods at the Prisoner's house, which I verily believe to be my property, and such as I had lost, but I will not swear particularly to them.</p>
               <p>On her cross-examination she said, she discharged the Prisoner, because he lived at a high rate, and she could not think how that could be; that she had no other yellow tabby silk in her shop, except what was in masquerade-dresses; that she strongly suspected the yellow silk to be hers, from an observation that she had before made, that the salvage was not so good as might have been expected to such a silk. That she does not believe there is another piece of yellow tabby so rich as to match it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lawrence. I made two particular pieces of yellow silk tabby, one for Mrs. Glass, and the other Mr. Henley in Cheapside had. I delivered Mrs. Glass's on the 27th of Feb. was twelve-month; [he takes the piece produced in his hand.] I know it by the silk and the leasures. I am certain this is what was made by my order, and which I sold to Mrs.

            : there is no difference in the two pieces, only about a quarter of a yard of the salvage is altered in that of Mr. Henley's, being a mist ake in the woman that warped it; and I had observed it before it went out of my hands; they were made a small matter richer than common. [He produced a small piece cut off of Mr. Henley's piece, and compared it.] It may be seen that nothing but the scissars parted the two pieces, they being wove one after the other. I sent my servant

            . On the 7th of February last, I dined at the Service-club, in Regent-street, and left the house shortly after eight o'clock. I had a severe cold, and abstained from drinking - I was quite sober. I returned home through St. James's-square, by the house of the late Lord Londonderry, and up King-street - I had walked by the bottom of Duke-street, about twelve yards. I was dressed in a Portuguese cloak, which confined my arms a good deal; it was open in front, and my chain and seals were exposed. I do not recollect meeting anybody in <placeName id="t18230219-18-crimeloc108">King-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18230219-18-crimeloc108" type="placeName" value="King-street"></interp>

I half turned round to see who it was, and in turning I fell against the rails. I saw a man standing close behind me, with both hands lifted up, in an attitude ready to strike - I imagined that he had an enormous stick; but I do not think it could have been so, because if it had it must have fractured my scull. I called loudly for help, and cannot say that the second blow fell upon me; I held up my umbrella, but I rather think the man did not strike, but ran away. At that moment I saw two men on the other side of the way. There were three gas lights; the most distant of which was not many yards off - one of those two men pursued the one who struck me, and the other crossed to my help. In a few minutes the prisoner was brought up to me, by Roper and Donovan, who were the persons I saw pursuing him. He appeared very much agitated, and said to me,</p>
               <p>"Are you the man I shoved against just now?" I believe I answered,</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you call shoving, but I am the man whom some cowardly villian has most cruelly assaulted behind my back;" I think he said,</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, I took you for another man." I desired he might be carried to St. James's watch-house - I followed as well as I could with assistance. I felt myself much hurt, and could not speak plain, my tongue was parlalyzed. When I got to the watch-house, I felt sick and faint - I did not then see the prisoner; I told the constable it was a man of the same stature as that (meaning Donovan, who stood before me); I did not mean to accuse him as being the person. I was much agitated, and did not know who the person was. Upon getting home, I had fomentations applied to my head, which was exceedingly swollen, but not cut. When the prisoner was brought up to me, a cotton umbrella was produced, saturated with wet, as if from rain - it did not rain then, but I think it must have rained before. The soldier who had it, said the prisoner had struck him. He was dressed much meaner than he is now, and was much agitated at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. When you described the person at the watch-house, the prisoner was not in your view - A. No. Being much agitated, I cannot be certain what passed. I cannot say whether the man had passed me, but if he had not he could not have seen my seals. He was near fainting at the watch-house - I cannot say whether any words passed after I received the blow, nothing was said before. I held up a silk umbrella instantly.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was brought to you, he said he mistook you for another person - A. To the best of my recollection he did.</p>

            . On the night of the 7th of February, I was in King-street, and heard a cry of</p>
               <p>"Help, for God's sake help," accompanied with the sound of a blow or blows. I and Osborne were standing together; we turned round, and saw two persons on the opposite side - one of whom was struggling, and the other running. I pursued him, and in St. James's-square he dodged me round the posts, and got into Pall Mall, where a soldier stopped him, on which he rose his umbrella to make a blow at the soldier, and then dropped it - the soldier picked it up, and gave it to me - we brought it with the prisoner into King-street, to General 
               <persName id="t18230219-18-person202">Kerr</persName>
            , who was talking to the witness - he said,</p>
               <p>"This is not the gentleman I shoved against;" the prosecutor said,</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you call shoving, but I am the man who was struck just now." The General desired me to take him to the watch-house, and he would give charge of him - as we went along he begged very hard to be let go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. I go on messages, and live in Angel-court, King-street. Osborne lives at Mr. Newton's, St. James-square - he was talking to me about giving me a job; we did not go into a public-house, as he had been insulted there.</p>
               <p>Q. The General said at the watch-house that it was a man about your stature - A. Yes.</p>

            . I was standing with Donovan by Willis's rooms, and heard the sound of a blow or blows, with a cry for assistance - we saw two men on the opposite side. I ran across to the General, and Donovan went after the other man, who ran away. The General appeared much hurt and agitated - I remained with him till the prisoner was brought back, which was in a very short time. I saw nobody in the street but the man and the General - I looked over the moment I heard the cry. When the man saw us approach he ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you came up the person ran away - A. Yes. I was telling

            . I am day watch-house keeper, and was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in. Donovan had the umbrella; I saw him put it into the cupboard - I afterwards took it out of that cupboard; it was very wet and heavy when it was put in. I asked him where he lived, he gave me a correct direction - it had rained very hard that night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had occasion to come from Pimlico, where I live, to Poland-street - I crossed the Park, and finding it very cold, I ran or trotted across the Park into Pall Mall, up Kings-place, into King-street, and was met by a man, who made a heavy thrust at my stomach with a stick or umbrella, which irritated me - I turned round, ran a few paces after him, and thrust at him with my umbrella, and struck him. I saw one or two persons<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182302190012"></xptr>whom I thought belonged to him, and ran to prevent my being ill-used.</p>

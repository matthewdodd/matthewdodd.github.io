               <p>Q. What is the prisoner. - A. She lives up stairs in the house as a lodger. On Wednesday evening I missed my things out of my drawer in the room where I sleep.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you accuse her of it. - A. I had suspicion of her; my mistress and I went up stairs and accused her with taking of them; she said she had not seen them. An officer was sent for, he searched her room, and found a bit of the gown in her cloak; the gown was in an unfinished state, it was a bit that was left; we searched her pockets and found four shillings and sixpence in money upon her, and the key which she had opened the door; I had lost that key for a week. I had another key to the lock. When I fetched the children down, about nine o'clock in the morning, the things were in the room; I locked the door when I came out of the room. I am sure this is a piece of my gown.</p>
               <p>- KASSAN. I am a pawnbroker; the gown and apron was pledged at our shop by the prisoner; I lent her six shillings on the gown and eighteen pence on the apron.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Wednesday evening, between seven and eight o'clock, I was sent to take this woman in charge; she was very much intoxicated; she said she knew nothing of the gown. I found four shillings and sixpence in her pocket in copper, I found this key, she said it was the key of her door; I tried it, it would not go into the key hole; we pulled her cloak off and shook it; this piece of gown fell out of the cloak.</p>
               <p>(The property produced and identified.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. In Bishopsgate-street I met a woman that owed me six shillings and sixpence; she changed a seven shilling piece and gave me a five shilling paper of halfpence; he found four shillings and seven pence in my pockets; I never saw the gown. She brought me the bit of gown up; there are other lodgers in the house, and as so her door it is opened morning after morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a house painter, and live in Backeridge-street, St. Giles's I knew the deceased, John Goulding; he was a bricklayer, and lodged in the same house with me. on the 30th of last September the deceased was in the house, and the prisoner came in between eight and nine o'clock in the evening—there were several persons in the house—the deceased came to the five-place to light his pipe, and the prisoner took off his won hat and struck the deceased on the head with it—nothing had passed between them preivous to that—Goulding had a hat on—he said, "If you dio that again I will knock you down"—the prisoner directly struck him again with his hat, and the deceased made a blow at Welch, but it did not hit him—he then seized the tea-pot, which stood on the hob, and threatened to throw it at the prisoner—a man named Smith, who it belonged to, came and took it out of his hand—Welch came from behind the stool, where he stood, and took hold of the deceased—he laid hold of him with both hands by the collar and threw him down on the floor—Goulding was intoxiented at the time—I had not known much of him before—I have seen him several times—I have seen him very often tipsy—I should think he was between forty and fity years old—he was not a large pawerful man, but a small man—when he fell I observed his head come in conteact with a wooden form—he never spoke or moved after he fell—the pirosner lified him up into a sitting position on the floor, and by his order soemwater was brought in, and he (the prisoner) btached the man's temples—several persons said a cotor ought to be sent for as he seemed in dying state—one was sent for but did not come—the person is not court who went for the docotr—he prisoner lifited the deceased off the floor and put him on a sent—he oblised to be held no by the prisoner and another person—he appeared quite senseless from the moment he fell on the floor—he could not sit without being assisted—he was quite helpless—the prisoner then said, "some persons come and hold him, and I will go for a doctor"—some person come and hold him, and I never returned at all afterwards—I went to the station-house and got a policeman, who took the deceased to a doctor's in Oxford-street—the doctor said he was quite dead—I never heard of their having had any previous quarrel.</p>

                  </hi> I was in the home in Buckeridge-stret, and saw Goulding and Welch there—I went out to fetch some things in for tea, leaving Goulding and the prisoner together in the kitchen—when I came back I saw the prisoner and the deceased at the fire quarelling—I do not exactly know what they were saying—they said they had ben <hi rend="italic">larking</hi> with the deceased—I was not there at the commencement of it—the first thing I saw was the deceased had got hold of the tea-pot, that was by the fire-place, and said he would <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> it at the prisoner—he attempted to do so, but I took it out of his hand—he then held up his fist towards the prisoner's face—the prisoner said, "Do you mean to strike me?"—directly afterwards the prisoner took him by the coat and threw him down—that was the first blow I saw pass between them—the prisoner appeared to be intoxicated—I knew him before, and have seen him intoxicted several times—the decessed's head came in contact with the from that was in the from that was in the room—he appeared to be hurt—he struck the back of his head against the form as he fell—he was not sensible after that—he never spoke nor moved, but lay on his back about a minutes or two—some one in the room said a doctor should be sent for, that the man appeared to be dying—the prisoner and another man assisted him up in a sitting position—he appeared to me to be dead at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a suregeon and apothecary, and have sur<lb></lb>geon to the parish of St. Giles' thirty-four years. the deceased was brought to me by a polcieman—he was dead then, and appeared to have been so for ten minutes at least—I live about three stones' throw from where this took place, but he was taken to Oxford-street before he was brought to me—there were no marks of violence about hsi body—there was <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the 4th of October—there were no marks of violence about the body, but in cutting away ear, and a prodgious quantity of coagulated blood between the scaslp and skull—there was no fracure of the bone—I opened the head and found a quanitity of avafracture of the bone—I opened the head and found a quanity of extravasated blood sated blood pressing on the brain—the whole of the brain presentd one general state of inflammation—the blood-vessels of the brain were exceed<lb></lb>ingly turgid—some were ruptured, and the vessels were ruptured in consequence of the violent fall he had—his being in liquor would make the vessels turgid and predisposed to apoplexy, but if he had not fallen I do not think he woudl have had the apopexy.</p>

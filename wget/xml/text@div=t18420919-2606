                  </hi>. I live at No. 31, Great Queen-street, Lin<lb></lb>coln's Inn-fields, and am in the employ of Baring, Brothers, and Co. On the night of the 20th of August I had been to see a friend in Heroming's-row, and left his house at past one o'clock in the morning, and was pro<lb></lb>ceeding towards home—when I got to St. Martin's-place, the prisoner accosted me—he appeared to have been loitering about there, and as I passed by him he muttered something to me—I did not hear what he said—I passed on without noticing it, and when I got to the end of St. Martin's-place I crossed over obliquely to St. Martin's-Iane, and find<lb></lb>ing him following close behind me I said to him, "What the devil do you follow me for?"—he made no answer, but turned back to Hemming's-row, and left me—I went on through New-street into Covent-garden, and saw nothing more of him till I got to the piazzas, and half way along the piazzas, between James-street and Evans's hotel, the prisoner came behind me, and said, "If you don't, I will charge you with the police with an unnatural offence"—this was said in more than a whisper—I did not notice any per<lb></lb>son about him at the time—I still walked on, and my exclamation was, What?"—I was entirely taken by surprise—I said, "What?" and he came up to me, took hold of my arm, and said, "Then I will," and gave me immediately in charge of a policeman who was at the corner of James-street—I had not seen the policeman before I got to the corner of James-street—he said, "I give you in charge," and said to the policeman, "I give this gentleman in charge for an indecent assault," as near as I can remember, for I was excessively confused—the policeman took me to the station, the prisoner going with me—he there made a charge against me—I this was Saturday night—I was locked up thirty-six or thirty-seven hours till Monday morning—there were two intoxicated persons in the cell with me at first—they were bailed—there was two other persons, one</p>

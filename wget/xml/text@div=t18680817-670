I am a clerk in the London and Westminster Bank, St. James's Square branch—Henry Allen opened an account there about 18th January, 1864—I cannot give the exact date—on opening the account he would have to sign this book—I saw him sign it, and I filled up the ad<lb></lb>dress for him as he said he could not write, that he was not a great scholar, and would I write it for him—the address is Latimer Road, Hammersmith—that would be the ordinary signature on which the account would be drawn out—I am accustomed to act upon handwriting at the bank—these two cheques for 705<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 902<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., I think, are not in Allen's handwriting—in my judgment they are not—these deposit notes (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are genuine, as far as I can judge—there are nine of them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier at the St. James's Square Branch of the London and Westminster Bank—I know that a person of the name of Henry Allen had a deposit account there—I have been in the habit of acting upon his signature in paying money—I know the prisoner as his wife—I remember her bringing this deposit receipt for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the 18th January—she came with 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, to be paid to her husband's account—that increased the sum from 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—according to our practice, we keep possession of the deposit receipt for 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and issue a new one for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when she brought it it was signed Henry Allen across the stamp, as it is at present—there was 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. due for interest—I paid that in money, and gave a new receipt for the 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this is it—on 27th April she came again to the bank and brought the deposit receipt for 900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., signed—that would make it an order for payment; 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">9s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. interest had accrued—I filled in the amount, and it then became an order for 902<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she said she would take 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, the rest in fives and tens, half of each, and the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in cash—I compared the signature to the order with the signa<lb></lb>ture book, and at the time believed it to be the genuine signature of Henry Alien, the depositor—I have since compared it more carefully, and also the order for 706<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, and I now consider that they are forgeries—the numbers of the eight 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes which I paid the prisoner were 64, 496, 62, 904, 72, 072-3-4, 72, 798-9, and 72, 800—the ten 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes were num<lb></lb>bered 7857 to 7876 inclusive, and the five 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes 59, 189 to 59, 193</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186808170018"></xptr>

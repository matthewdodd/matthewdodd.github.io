             the other boy was stopped first, and the person told him there was something in the mail that belonged to him, and Tapping said if there was he should not have it - Then the person stopped me, and said I must go along with him and he would not hurt me, then I was carried into a great field about half a mile out of the way; to the side of a great gravel pit, and the person desired me to jump down that place; I told him I could not, but at last I jumped down - He made me jump down, for he was going to draw a pistol at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you jump down with your horse?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. I sat on my horse and jumped down, I can't say I jumped down, for I tumbled down; then the person opened the mail and took out the Exeter bag and the Portsmouth bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person stay with you after that?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. She put her hand in her pocket, and gave me a shilling.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Council. What makes you say, her?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Because I took her to be a woman.</p>
               <p>Council. What made you think so?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. I thought so by her voice and her hand.</p>
               <p>Council. Why by her hand?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Because it was a soft hand.</p>
               <p>Council. How do you know it was a soft hand.</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Bec ause she took hold of my hand when I was in the pit.</p>
               <p>Council. What did she take hold of your hand for?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. She shook hands with me.</p>
               <p>Council. Look at that woman with the child in her arms, and see whether you think she is the person?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. I can't be positive to the person - The person had a crape over her face; and a long white wig on.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any description of the clothes the person had on, or of the horse?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Yes, the person had on a blue great coat, and rode upon a bald faced sorrel horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard the Prisoner speak since?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Yes, and I believe her to be e same person.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174409120035"></xptr>Q. Why do you take her to be the same person?</p>
               <p>Brotherton . By her voice, Sir.</p>
               <p>Jury. How long was it after the 8th of February before you saw the Prisoner again?</p>
               <p>Brotherton . I believe it was about a month - At Sir Thomas de Veil's.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were with her there, had you any apprehension that the voice was the same?</p>
               <p>Brotherton . Yes, Sir?</p>
               <p>Q. And you take upon you to swear that you thought then it was the same voice?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. I cannot swear 'tis the same voice. - I said to Sir

             that I thought it to be the same voice.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did this thing happen?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. Between six and seven in the morning - I believe I did not go out of the office till five.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go after you were robbed?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. I went to Staines - I told them I had been robbed - I did not say any thing of it's being a woman's voice there - I did when I came to London to Mr. Robinson the Sollicitor to the Post-Office, that I thought it was a woman's voice, and to Mr. Jesse .</p>
               <p>Q. When was the crape put over the person's face?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. After I was in the pit; and the person kept my hat something over my eyes, that I could not very well see.</p>

            . I believe it was on the 29th of March that the Prisoner and Brotherton were before me, and Brotherton gave an account about the robbing the Western mail, and he said then that he was sure it was a woman by her voice, and by her hand: he said to the best of his remembrance the person that robbed him and gave him the shilling was the person that was then before me; and I think he said that he verily believed that the same blue veins that appeared there, were the same that gave him the shilling.</p>

            . When the Post-boy came to town, he gave an account to the Post Master General that he was robbed. I was immediately sent for; I asked him whether he could remember any thing about the voice, and he said, it was a comical voice, it was not like a man's voice, it was a womanish voice.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a person was it for height?</p>
               <p>Brotherton. It was a tall person.</p>

            . I must absolutely contradict him there, for when he was before me, he said it was a short thick person, and much about the height of the person then before me.</p>
               <p>There being no other evidence on the side of the prosecution to prove the fact upon the Prisoner, and the Jury not thinking this evidence sufficient, she was <rs id="t17440912-53-verdict301" type="verdictDescription">

On the 11th of July, the prisoner, who I knew before, called and asked to go into my privy, my hymn and prayer-books were in the parlour, the trowsers were in the window, but were taken at a different time. I went out with him at a quarter past eight in the evening, returned at nine, and missed them.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, the prisoner went out with my father in the evening; I am sure the trowsers were then in the parlour window; he came back alone in about five minutes, and said he knew of a place for me, and wanted pen and ink to write the direction, but I would not leave the room. I was looking out of the other window - he staid a short time and told me not to tell my father that he had been back, on any account; he went out with the tail of his coat wrapped round him - nobody but him had called - my little sister and I were alone in the house, and before my father returned, I missed the trowsers, and went to look for him, but he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had been in disgrace with your father - A. My father beat me, saying, I must have left the door open, or taken the book myself, and the prisoner said, it served me right.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW to MR. WILLIAMS. Q. Had not you some conversation with the prisoner about your son before this - A. I said he had left the door open, and been at play while the books were stolen. I sent for the prisoner next day, to say I had a place for him, and then secured him.</p>

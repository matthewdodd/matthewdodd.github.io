                  </hi>. I am a constable of the East and West India Docks. On 23d Dec., about ten o'clock in the morning, I stopped Matthews coming out of the Dock with a truck—I asked for a pass—he said it was all right, they had got the master's pass—Lusty, who was with him, produced the pass—I objected to it, and Lusty returned with it to get the weight put upon it—while he was gone I examined the truck, and found concealed under some old rope and canvas, three coils of rope—the pass only specified ropes and shaking—I refused to let it go out—Matthews said "I don't wish to deceive you, it did not come from that ship at all (that was the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow</hi>) it came from the <hi rend="italic">Miame</hi>"—that they bought it of the ship-keeper—Lusty came back with the pass and presented it to me—he walked away—I took Matthews into custody, and went to the <hi rend="italic">Miame</hi>, which was lying in the dock—I asked Backhouse, the ship keeper, if he had sent any rope out of the ship that day—he stood a few minutes, and said, "Yes;"—I said, "Did the captain authorise you to do so?" he said, "No; but I have sold some rope to two men for 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I took him into custody, showed him the rope, and he said, "That is the rope I sold"—I pointed out Matthews to him—he said, "That is one of the men that I sold the piece to"—I know the writing of the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow</hi>—this pass is not his writing.</p>

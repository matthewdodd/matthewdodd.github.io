Upon Monday night I pulled them off. Upon Tuesday morning I missed them, and I challenged our boy that had been with us four days, the boy said he knew nothing of them, I gave them up for lost. A gentleman came to me from Covent-garden, and said they were advertised. Upon Thursday I saw the buckles, and I knew them to be mine, I saw them at the office in Litchfield-street. I don't know as I ever saw the prisoner about the house before, in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bond, a constable, produces the buckles.</p>
               <p>How did you come by them? - This woman came to the shop of my next door neighbour. I keep a cloath's shop. I am by trade a taylor.</p>
               <p>When did she come to the shop? - Tuesday; the day after this lady lost them. I think it was the 30th of October.</p>
               <p>What is your next door neighbour? - She deals in womens cloaths, she called me to look at them, the prisoner offered those buckles to sell to that woman, I came and looked at them, and she asked my opinion, I said my opinion is, they are stolen, I would not have you buy them, you will get yourself in trouble; I dare say she has not come honestly by them, I dare say they cost thirty shillings; the woman flew at me and collared me, which gave me reason to think her a bad woman. I sent for a constable, we took her to Litchfield-street, and had her examined.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that is the woman? - I do think it is. I am very certain. The justice advertised them immediately after he had committed her.</p>

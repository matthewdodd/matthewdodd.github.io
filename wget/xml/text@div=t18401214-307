               <p>on the 2nd of December. I saw the prisoner go into Mr. Jefferini's shop, in Garnault-place—there was a man and a woman a little further off—I could not swear that the prisoner was in company with them—I waited till he came out—I ran round a street, and met him—I seized him—he resisted very much, and I tore both sleeves of his coat up to the arms—I saw him throw, from his right hand, a piece of paper under an apple-stall, and something in the shape of money fell from it—after he was secured I went to the place, and found there four counterfeit shillings—I told him he had been to a shop in Garnault-place—he said he had not—I took him to the shop, and Mr. Turner recognized him—scarcely a minute elapsed between his throwing the paper and my picking up the shillings—I did not lose sight of it—there were persons about, but they could not step on it, as it was under the stall.</p>

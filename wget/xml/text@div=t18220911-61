            . I am a constable. The prisoner was brought to the watch-house, and I took the property stated in the indictment out of her lap; I have had it ever since; the lace petticoat that was found in pawn was not in it. The prosecutrix saw the things next morning, and claimed them in the prisoner's presence; she had said she brought them from her sister's at Chelsea, and told the prosecutrix that she pawned the lace petticoat. She at first said they were her own. I asked her to describe the marks - she told me of some marks, and others she told me wrong. I went to find her sister, but could not; I returned, and told her it was false, and I must detain her. In the course of the night she wanted to see Mr. Williams, not Mrs. Williams, but Mrs. Williams came with me; the prisoner then said she took them from the house, and cried very much. I know nothing of the prosecutrix. I saw a person who turned out to be

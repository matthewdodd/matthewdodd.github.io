               <p>PHILIP MAYHEW. On the evening of the 5th of December last, I had two twenty pounds, and five one-pound Bank of England notes; they were paid by the Commissioners at Somerset House; I had these notes some time about me; the two twenties were sowed in between the waistband and the lining of my trowsers. The prisoner spoke to me first; I saw her under the Piazzas, Covent Garden; she took me to a house in <placeName id="t18160110-110-crimeloc605">Hart-street, right opposite to Covent Garden Playhouse</placeName>

She was not in bed more than an hour, when she got up, and said it was too early to go to bed; I could not stop her; I let her go away; I did not at that time suspect any thing. I awoke as soon as it was day light in the morning; I found my trowsers under the window, with the two twenty-pound notes gone; the breeches seemed as if the lining had been bitten. I found my four one-pound notes in my waistcoat pocket; I never saw either of the twenty-pound notes since. I have heard her say that she gave them to an old jewis woman, as she thought they were two one-pound notes.</p>

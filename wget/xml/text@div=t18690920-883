               <p>live at 42, Grettou Road North, St. George's Road—on Thursday afternoon 2nd September, about 3 o'clock, I met a man named Ellis, and went into the Prince Regent, at Walworth—we had some half-and-half, and while we were drinking the prisoner and two others came in—they got hold of at; friend's beer, and seemed to know our Christian names—they <hi rend="italic">Neded</hi> him and <hi rend="italic">Joe'd</hi> me—I thought that my friend knew them, and he thought that I knew them—I said to Ellis, "I must go along home, and pay for the ton of coals, and surprise my wife"—I left the three men with Ellis—I got round to the end of North Street; when I got to the Rising Sun I was caught by the shoulder, and someone said, "Halloa <hi rend="italic">Joe,</hi> stand a pot, old man"—I looked up and saw the prisoner, and the two other men, standing round me—I stood a pot, and left to go on my way home—just as I got to the Masons' Arms I was seized again, and the prisoner said, "<hi rend="italic">Joe,</hi> old man stand another pot"—I said I had stood one already, and they said it was only a suck—I stood another, for the purpose of getting rid of them—I took out ray bag to pay for it—I went on towards home again—I went into the Sandford Road, when I stopped for a moment—I then walked on a couple or three steps—I was seized round the neck by the same three men—they tried to get at my pocket—they could not do that, and slit my trowsers up, and tore the pocket right out, where the canvas bag was—they let me fail, and ran away—I was kicked—it was about teu minutes before I recovered myself—the pressure on my throat took away my speech—after I recovered myself I went to the police-station, and gave information—I got two constables, and we came along the road to the Rising Sun—I looked in at the door, and saw the three men in the bar—they saw me, and two of them ran out of the middle door, and the prisoner took the side door, and went towards East Lane—I followed at a little distance—he was walk<lb></lb>ing brisk—the constable was further ahead, and as he passed him he put his head on one side and tried to go past—I put up my hand, and the con<lb></lb>stable said, "<hi rend="italic">Ginger,</hi> I want you"—he said, "No, you are mistaken"—I said, "No, I am not; you were one of the three"—I lost 23<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money, and a ticket belonging to the market—amongst my money was an old smooth half-crown—I have seen that since, at the station-house, after the prisoner had been searched—I could swear it is the same I had in my pos<lb></lb>session—I told the policeman that if there was a half-crown with a piece off the edge, it wits mine—that was said in the prisoner's presence—these are the trowsers that I had on at the time (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

I am a carpenter—on 2nd September, I was with the prosecutor, in the Prince Regent—we had something to drink, and two young women came across that I knew, and had a drop of gin with us—while we were there, the prisoner and two others came in, and began to get themselves in our company—we had two pots of half-and-half together—the prosecutor went out to go home, and the prisoner said to me, "Has <hi rend="italic">Joe</hi> gut any <hi rend="italic">posh</hi> on him?"—I said he had got a few shillings in his pocket, and that is what he wants to pay for a ton of coals for his wife—I went out to see if I could see <hi rend="italic">Joe,</hi> and I saw him going up the middle of the street—I went into the Prince Regent again, in about ten minutes, and the prisoner and the others had gone—I saw the prosecutor pull this half-crown out of his pocket to pay for the beer, and he said he would not change that, for he</p>

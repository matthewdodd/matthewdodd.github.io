                  </hi>. I am a trunk-maker, and live in Greville-street, Leather-lane. About half-past six o'clock, on the evening of the 5th of November, I missed a trunk, which I had seen about five minutes before—I ran down Fox-court, and found the prisoner just crossing the end of the court, with the trunk on his shoulder—I asked him where he was going—he said a gentleman had given it him to carry somewhere—I said, "You must come back with me, that story will not do"—he came a step or two, then <hi rend="italic">chucked—the trunk down</hi>, and said, "Well, you shall carry it then"—he made a desperate struggle to get away, tried to throw me down, and knocked me against the wall—I gave him in charge—this is my trunk—my name is inside it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable G</hi> 110.) I took the prisoner into custody about half-past six o'clock, and secured the trunk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I—was passing down Holborn, and a gentleman came up and asked me to carry the box to King's-cross; I carried it; the prosecutor came out of a court, and asked how I came by the property; I turned round, and said, "This is the gentleman that gave it me to carry." The moment the gentleman saw me taken into custody, he ran off; I put down the box; the prosecutor collared me; I did not try to resist, to get away, but turned round with the intention of detaining the party who gave me the box; I walked along with the prosecutor till we came to a police<lb></lb>man, and was given into custody.</p>

               <p>JOHANNAH WHITE. I am the wife of the last witness. The prisoner came to me at our lodging, between twelve and one o'clock, on the day in the indictment, and said he had met Mr. White in the Stand walking with another gentleman, and therefore he did not like to speak to him. The prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181604030057"></xptr>sat down. The watch was hanging over the mantlepiece. The prisoner wrote a note for Mr. White, and laid it on the table, and said he would call on the next day but one. He went out, and I immediately missed the watch. I saw no more of the prisoner until he was apprehended. I knew him coming home from the East Indies.</p>

               <p>GEORGE MORLEY. I am a pawnbroker, and received this watch in pledge from the prisoner at the bar, on the 3rd of April, in the middle of the day.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I leave it to the mercy of the whole Court.</p>

               <p>(It appeared by the testimony of Mr. Newman, the governor of Newgate, and Mr. Hardy. his assistant, that the unfortunate prisoner, who while he remained at the bar was suffused in tears, had been a surgeon of some eminence, and had gone out with the convicts to Botany Bay, in his professional capacity, and had made several Voyages to India, the last of which had been so unsuccessful as to reduce the unfortunate man to the greatest distress, and compel him to the unfortunate act which brought him before the Court.)</p>

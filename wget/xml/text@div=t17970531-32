               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and see if that is the man? - A. That is the man; I was not certain of it when I was summoned up at first, but I am clear of it now; my horse came in, I saddled the horse, and set him off myself.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. The Captain did not tell you he was going to High Wycombe? - A. No; I understood so from Mr. Hinton, the other stable-keeper; I understood him that it was for two days, this was on the Saturday; and on Monday this letter (producing it), came down to Mr. Hinton, from Captain Harcourt, he has signed his name at the bottom of it, W. Harcourt; he never returned, and I never saw him again till he was at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner himself tell you he was going to High Wycombe? - A. I do not recollect any thing of the kind, it is a long while ago; Mr. Hinton is here. I got the horse back again the latter end of August, or beginning of September, following; I had a letter to inform me the horse was in Smithfield; I went, and Mr. Blunt had him; they told me he belonged to Mr. Philpot, of Paddington.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This took place at Oxford? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - A. The 12th of October, 1795.</p>
               <p>Q. The person, whoever he was, went to Mr. Hinton first? - A. Yes; he asked me what I valued my horse at; and I said, I could not fell him under twenty-five pounds; and he said, the mare would not do for his company, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner replied, I believe, that he had no objection to him if he liked his paces? - A. I do not recollect; he said, if he liked him he would take him at all the money; I thought he was a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not ask you if the horse was really your own, that you could fell it? - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that he might rely upon it, the horse was your own, and you might sell it yourself? - A. No; I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not, in fact, know any thing about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310035"></xptr>the actual hiring, as to the length of time? - A. No; I heard it from Mr. Hinton.</p>
               <p>Q. That letter, I believe, contained a note for twenty-five pounds, for the supposed value of the horse? - A. There is the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you answer my question - Was not that the purport of the letter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never receive a note for twenty-five pounds, a draft upon a person in town? - A. No; not any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. In that letter you were told, if he liked the horse he would keep it? - A. Yes; I heard that he had slept at Tetsworth, the first stage from Oxford.</p>
               <p>Q. That was where he had, in fact, hired the horse to go to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was eighteen months from the time of the horse being hired, till you saw any thing of the horse again? - A. It might be ten or eleven months.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not see the prisoner till a little while ago, at Bow-street? - A. I did not see him till I was summoned.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he is the person? - A. Yes; I was not that night, being candle-light, but I am now positive he is the man; he has a dent in his chin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, over and over again, say you could not ascertain that he was the man? - A. I did not rightly understand Mr. Bond's question, I had been riding up from Oxford; I am very certain that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the question, over and over again, put to you by Mr. Bond? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you said, over and over again, he was not the man? - A. No, I never said he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Ford, another Magistrate, desire him not to put the question any more; for having denied it so many times, it was of no consequence whether you swore it now or not? - A. I did not hear him say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had some conversations with the runners during these examinations? - A. No, only Croker; I asked him how he did, upon the steps, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Croker tell you there could be no doubt of his being the person? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before he hired the horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you mean to undertake to swear, though you did not chuse to do it upon your examinations? - A. I am very positive and clear that he is the man.</p>

             sworn. - In October 1795, the prisoner applied to me at my yard, in Magple-lane, Oxford, about eleven o'clock in the day; he said, Hinton, how do you do; I told him he had the advantage of me; he said, did not I recollect him at the Angel I told him no; he asked me how my wife and family were, and I told him; then he asked me if I had a horse sit to carry him as far as Tetsworth or Wycombe; he said, he was going to meet a recruiting party that day; if they were not at Tetsworth, he should go in pursuit of them till he met them, that is to say, as far as Wycombe; I told him, I had not a horse that was capable of performing the journey; Mr. Gardiner being present in the yard, I asked him if he would like to serve the gentleman with a horse; he told him, if he would not over-ride him, he should have his horse; the gentleman wished to see the horse, but not seeing the horse, he turned round, and asked me, if I thought he was a capable horse, I told him he was; I know nothing of their agreement, I took my leave of them and went about my business, and they agreed between themselves; I afterwards saw him ride down the street, over the bridge; I should have told your Lordship, that when he was making himself known to me first, he told me he was a gentleman that I had once dressed, with a lady, at the Angel, (at that time, I followed the capacity of a hair-dresser), and I had then served him with a gig, and he paid me for it, and behaved very genteelly; at first, I doubted it, but he said so much about my serving him, that at last I had no doubt that he was the gentleman, and a gentleman of great respectability, character, and fortune.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you first saw him at Bow-street, you did not undertake to swear to him? - A. No; but the features of the face, the more I have thought of them, the more they occur to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way you usually form an opinion, that as the distance of time increases, your recollection increases? - A. No; but when a person has been absent a considerable time, you don't recollect him immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you undertake to swear to him at Bow-street? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure he is the man? - A. I am sure he is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You did not think he was the man when you saw him at Bow-street? - A. I did think he was the man, though I would not swear to him.</p>

             sworn. - About the latter end of October 1795, I believe it might be the 29th; the prisoner came to my house in Arlington-street, Piccadilly, he had been there two days; he sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310036"></xptr>for me up to his apartments, he begged I would excuse the liberty he had taken with me, being a stranger; he said, he was under some very unpleasant circumstances, that he had just arrived from Chichester, with a recruiting party that had come from the West-Indies, light-dragoons; he called himself Captain Clifford; he said, he had got into a very unpleasant affray; he said, he could not think what was the matter with the people in this country, he thought they had an enmity to the army, for he and his brother officers had got into an affray, and he had almost severed one man's arm from his body; two of his brother officers were in custody, and what was very unfortunate, he had lent his servant to a party to go a shooting; he expected his servant to follow him from Guildford, that his business in town was to see his attorney, who was unfortunately out of town, and that his agent would not do any thing without money, and his request to me was, to lend him eight guineas, that he had a horse cost him twenty-five guineas, over at the Three Kings, and that the horse should remain in the stable till he had paid me the eight guineas; the story seemed very well told, and from his manner, I believed him to be what he represented himself, and I lent him the eight guineas; in about two days more, I had a second message from him; he told me then he had sent the attorney's clerk to Chichester, that he had given him all the money he had received from me, that his servant was not yet returned, and begged I would advance him the sum of three guineas more, for which he would give me a written agreement, that the horse should be at my disposal if the money was not returned, which agreement is here. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see this horse? - A. Yes; it was a black cropped horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know whether that horse belonged to the prisoner? - A. He came and swore to it afterwards; as soon as he got the three guineas, he decamped, and left the house bill unpaid, which was six or seven pounds, he lived in a very extravagant style; I sent the horse to the Repository, to dispose of it, but there was not above eight guineas bid for it, and a friend of mine advised me to send him down to a straw-yard till the March following, and then I had him up to the Three Kings again; I sent him to Tattersall's, and there he sold for twelve guineas to Mr. Philpot, and in the month of September following, the horse was owned while Mr. Philpot was riding him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long had you the horse in your possession? - A. From the latter end of October, 1795, till the latter end of March, 1796, the horse was then sold.</p>
               <p>Q. And what became of him afterwards, you do not know of your own knowledge? - A. Yes, I do; I was present when he was sold, he was sold to a Mr. Salmon.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the time you sold him to the time he was sold to Mr. Salmon? - A. I sold him to Mr. Salmon myself.</p>


               <p>Q. How many months after you sold him to Mr. Salmon, was he sold to Mr. Philpot? - A. Two months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. With respect to the circumstance of this horse, which I hired, as has been sworn by the prosecutor: I was coming to Oxford on the 24th of October, and I asked for Mr. Hinton, from the recommendation of a person at the Bear inn, Oxford, he told me he had horses to lett; I went down and said, Hinton, have you any horses to lett? he said, my man, Mr. Gardiner, had a good horse, but did not wish to lett it out for hire, he would rather dispose of it; and, in an hour and a half, I went down to this yard, and there I found Mr. Gardiner, with the horse ready for me; I took my spurs out of my pocket, and said, I was going on the London-road to meet a Captain Winter, then of the third dragoons, who was coming to Oxford to recruit; I sent him to get me some spur leathers; when I was fixing them, he said, I do not like to let this horse go, the price, with saddle and bridle, is 25l. and I said, if I like the horse, I will send you a promissory note for the money; and as I was going out to High-Wycombe, a Mr. Fisher, of Oxford, joined company with me; unfortunately for me, I cannot learn any thing of that gentleman; I asked his opinion of the horse, and he said he did not think he was worth so much; I slept at Tetsworth that night, I could not hear any thing of Captain Winter, and I proceeded to London on the 5th morning; not hearing any thing of my friend, I went to Mr. Allen, a merchant, at Kennington, and learned that he had been, and was gone down to Chichester; I went down there with a Major Blunt, who has since been tried for an assault at Chichester; we went out together, and got into an affray from my kissing a girl in the street; it was impossible that I could, as has been stated, with only a slight stick in my hand, severe a man's arm from his body; I found there were warrants out, and, in the night, I took a place in the Chichester coach, and went to Mr. Bland's hotel; I wished to send an attorney from town, and I went after a Mr. Bevan, formerly Bevan and Mudge, but he was out of town; I then went to a Mr. Holmes, a gentleman of Arundel, and he told me he would endeavour to conciliate the matter, and for this purpose I borrowed eight guineas of Mr. Bland. Previous to my giving him that agreement, I sent for a stamp, and sent down a promissory note of 25l. payable at No. 6, Crescent, in the Minories. I never heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310037"></xptr>any thing further of this horse, till I was apprehended; I believe Mr. Bland knows that I have been confined in prison for debt, and got a letter of licence from my creditors, till I could get a reconciliation with my friends; Mr. Bland might have sent down to Oxford, and informed them where I was. As I am free from any intentional defraud, I trust my case to your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>

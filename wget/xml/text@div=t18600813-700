               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> Owing to the excited state I was in on the day I was committed at Bow-street, and my broken-hearted mother and wife being in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130047"></xptr>
               <p>court, and my being in the flurried and nervous state that I was; I beg to recal the plea which I made that I was guilty, it being given unintentionally, as the letter was only detained by me, it not being in a fit state for delivery. The letter would have been delivered in due course, had it not been for the following accident. As I was about commencing my delivery, I went to pull a newspaper out of the bundle of letters, when the string which was round the bundle, only once, broke, it being very rotten, and let some of my letters fall to the ground, and some of them went into a puddle of water; I picked them up and arranged them again as I went along Duke-street, and took a piece of string from my pocket and tied them up afresh, and on arriving at the corner of Charles-street in Duke-street, I thought I would go down and deliver those letters for that street; aud on account of their being wet and my putting my hand at the bottom of the bundle to pull them out, the first one that I went to pull out was the one directed to Mrs. Rymer, 51, Charles<lb></lb>street, but, owing to the string being tight round them, the letter would not come out, and I was afraid to slacken the string too much for fear of upsetting my letters again, so I went to pull it out, but rather harder than I intended, when it tore up the middle—the string had cut it through, being wet in the manner shown. On finding that it would not come out without tearing more, I let the string loose; and on looking to see what was the cause, I found the letter contained money, and that the cause of the tearing was that the string had got between the two coins which it contained; on loosing the string more and drawing the letter out, one of the coins fell out on the pavement, which I picked up im<lb></lb>mediately, and a gentleman that was passing at the time said to me "Postman, that is a very careless way for people to send money in letters like that"—I said it was, and then he said, "If I were you I would take it back to the office, and show it to some one, for they might write to the office and state that some of the money was lost out of the letter, and then you would be blamed"—I replied, "Perhaps it would be the best way to take it back and get the inspector to put it in another envelope, and state to him how it happened"—so I put the letter in my coat pocket and the money in my waistcoat pocket, and went on with my delivery; had I known that this would have happened through it I would have got the gentleman's name and address. When I got to Parliament-street I put my hand into my pocket to see that I had got the letter safe, when I found that the other coin which was in the letter had worked out of the letter into my coat pocket, and on taking it out and looking at it I found it to be a half-sovereign. I took the American coin from my waistcoat pocket and the half-sovereign from my coat pocket, and placed them both in my tobacco-box for safety, as I did not like to put them in my pocket with my own money, nor to have them loose in my waistcoat pocket for fear of their getting out while I was running up and down the stairs to the different offices in Parliament-street. When I had finished my delivery about half-past 3, I did not know what to do about delivering the letter, but I made up my mind not till I had been back to the office and showed it to the inspector; but on arriving at the office at ten minutes past 4 o'clock, which was my time, and the duty being rather heavier than usual, and the short time which is allowed to do the duty in, and the hurrying and driving which there generally is at that hour of the day on account of the men wanting to get out of the office to get their delivery done to go home to their tea, and my being the same as the rest, caused me to forget (but not wilfully) to show the inspector the state of the letter I had in my possession; the consequence was, as I was leaving the office with my delivery about a quarter to 5 o'clock with the other men in</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186008130048"></xptr>
               <p>a hurry, I was stopped at the corner of Charlotte-street, Pimlico, by the post-office officials and taken back to the office, to the comptroller's room, where I was asked if I had a letter for Mrs. Rymer, 51, Charles-street, and not thinking for a moment but that what the inspector meant was, had I got one in the bundle which I then had, I stated that I had not seen one, upon which he told the officer to search me, and he found the money in the tobacco-box where I had put it when it came out of the letter, and on being asked about the money I forgot what I was saying; my being taken as I was and never having been in such a position before, made me in that flurried and nervous state that I hardly know what I said or did till it was given in evidence against me at Bow-street the next day; I did not know but what they had got the letter, as they did not ask me for it or ask where it was until I was placed in the cell at Bow-street, and I had been in there about half an hour when I put my hand in the pocket of the coat I am now wearing and found the letter; but being in that state of mind charged with stealing, and thinking it was of no use, I tore it in half and threw it down the closet; but afterwards I was sorry I did for I was told that I ought to have kept it till my trial, to show; I can solemnly declare I had no intention of detaining the letter for any other purpose but to show the inspector as I was advised; had I been allowed to go with the delivery, which I had when, I was stopped, the letter would have been delivered to whom it was directed, as I should have thought of it when I got to the ground again. The original letter was destroyed in the cell; here is one like it (<hi rend="italic">handing one in</hi>).</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. How long have you known him? A. About six weeks - I never allowed him to pawn any thing of mine, and I never pawned any thing of his; I know Mr. Blair, of Pimlico, I was his tenant at one time - I had some tools at the prisoner's father's at that time; the prisoner carried them there, and he asked me to come to his father's house, as he wanted to talk to me about going to America with him - I did not expect a distress from Mr. Blair, but there were three quarters of a year's taxes due when I went into the house, and I was not aware of it; the tools in this indictment were not taken to the prisoner's father, they were at the place where I was putting up an organ.</p>

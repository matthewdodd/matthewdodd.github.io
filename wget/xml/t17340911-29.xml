               <p>Slaughter. Yes, the Prisoner and Prosecutor are Brothers-in-law - And, says I, he says you have got his Breeches. Why, says the Prisoner, the Breeches are not worth Threepence. But then there's the Ring, says I; Aye, says he, but he gave me that - There has been a great Family Quarrel between them.</p>

            . We met at Slaughter's House to agree the Matter up. Says the Prosecutor to Slaughter, Why do you encourage an informing Rogue (meaning the Prisoner) in your House? Do you intend to turn Informer too? For the Prisoner had laid an Information before the Commissioners against the Prosecutor. - Says I to Smith, I'd have you make the Matter up, for Knot is a very honest Man, I have known him fourteen Years. Why, says Smith, you don't know what a Rogue he is; I have been too favourable to him, I could have hang'd him, if I had sworn the Door was lock'd when he rob'd me; but now it can be only Transportation. I saved his Life once before, when he went to hang himself; for his Sister found him swinging, and set up such a damn'd Squaul of Fire and Murder, that I run up in a surprize. He began to keck, and I, like a Sot as was, cut him down, and his damn'd Clum-foot came thump upon the Floor. - I ask'd his Sister about this, and she said she knew nothing of it - The Prosecutor at last offered to make it up, if the Prisoner would pay half the Money that was due on the Information. But the Prisoner would not agree to it.</p>
               <p>The Prosecution appearing malicious, the Jury <rs id="t17340911-29-verdict140" type="verdictDescription">

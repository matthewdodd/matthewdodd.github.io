               <p>Richard Trigtoe. In the first Place, I live at the Prince's Bagnio in Bolton-street, in Long-Acre, and on Easter-Monday, about 11 at Night, I went into Drury-Lane for a Coach. I stood opposite to <placeName id="t17320419-40-crimeloc200">Holsford-Alley</placeName>

Coach! and up comes the Prisoner and says to me, How do you do? Why, pretty well, says, I. Won't you go and see my Lodgings? says she. Why I don't care it I do, says I; for tho' she was a Stranger to me, I did not know what Business she might have with me, and so I went with her 5 or 6 Yards down the Alley, into a House, and up one pair of Stairs, and there she wanted me to treat her with a Dram. I told her I did not care for drinking; but she said I might give her one, however, for she could drink if I could not. I told her, I was not so d isposed. I staid 30 Minutes with her, and discoursed about one thing and another, and then I found I was got into a lewd, disorderly House, and therefore I did not care to tarry any longer; and so, just as I was about to go, she catches hold of my Chain, pulls my Watch out of my Breeches, and puts it into her own Pocket. I demanded my Watch again, but says she, I wish I may be damn'd to Eternity if you ever have it, except you give me a Guinea. I reason'd the Case with her, and told her, the Watch was none of her Right, and therefore I would have it again. But it signify'd nothing, for she would not give it me. And so as I was going down-stairs she call'd several Men Names, Jack! Tom! Dick! but I got out of Doors, and she follow'd. I turn'd to the Right and she to the Left. I took an Opportunity and seiz'd her at the End of Wild-street. She cry'd out Murder! Fire ! Watch! The Watchmen came and quieted the Broil, and took us away, but I never got my Watch again.</p>

            , Constable. Between 11 and 12, the Prisoner and Prosecutor were brought to me by 2 Watchmen: He charged her with forcibly pulling a Watch out of his Pocket, and saying, She would not deliver it without a Guinea. He was sober, but she seem'd to be a little fuddled.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The Prosecutor met me in Colstons-Court, and said, Will you go with me my Dear? No, says I, I am going to Bed. But at last we agreed, and he carried me into House in the Court, Number 18. When we came up-stairs, he told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173204190017"></xptr> me, he had lost his Watch; he treated me with a Dram, and when he was going, he said, Now, my Dear, good Night. But as I lighted him down, he charged me with taking his Watch.</p>

The Prosecutor came in and went upstairs with the Prisoner and another Woman; the other Woman came down first, and went away, and the Prosecutor staid a Quarter of an Hour longer with the Prisoner; and when he came down, he seem'd to be fuddled. She followed him with a Candle, and when she came into the Court, he charged her with taking his Watch.</p>
               <p>Court, to the Prosecutor. Did you see her take your Watch? Prosecutor. Yes. Court. Then she cannot be guilty of privately stealing. The Jury <rs id="t17320419-40-verdict201" type="verdictDescription">

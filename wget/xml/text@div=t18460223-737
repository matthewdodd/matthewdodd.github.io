                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my brother William; we keep the Red Lion public-house, Edgware-road. Chubb was my bar-man—Green has been in the habit of frequenting the house since Chubb has been with me—on the 20th of Feb., about six o'clock in the evening, suspecting some<lb></lb>thing, I cleared the tills—in one I left two shillings, two sixpences, and a 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. piece—Chubb brought me another shilling from the parlour, which made three shillings in the till—Green came in—in consequence of what I saw I watched, and between eleven and twelve o'clock I left in the till two half-crowns, eight shillings, and some sixpences, which I did not mark—I had another bar<lb></lb>man, whom I sent to bed a little before eleven o'clock—Chubb was alone, attending the customers—I saw Green come in soon after eleven, with a jug for a pint of porter—I was in a private parlour exactly opposite—looking through a window into the bar—I saw Chubb serve her—she gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave her 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, then looked round to see that all was clear, and I saw him take more copper, and put two shillings in between it, and put it on the counter—I directly followed Green, with the jug in one hand and the change in the other, and before she got out of the door I took her by the hand, and said, "Allow me to see your change"—she opened her hand, and had two shillings, and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in halfpence—I directly asked Chubb what change he had given her—he did not answer directly, but when he saw the change in her hand he said change for half-a-crown—I said, "No, she gave you six<lb></lb>pence"—Meeder came round, and I gave her in charge—he had been watch<lb></lb>ing in a different part of the house—I am quite certain if half-a-crown had been put down I must have seen it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Harrow-road, and am a parish-constable. On the 20th of Feb., at a quarter past ten o'clock, I went to the prosecutor's house, in consequence of a communication—I saw Green come in about half-past ten o'clock, with a jug for some beer, which she paid for, and left—I followed her, and in Market-street she met a woman, and I heard her say, "It is <hi rend="italic">no go</hi>"—she went from there into No. 80, Star-street—I saw no more of her till she came to the house again about a quarter-past eleven, she called for a pot of beer, and tendered a sixpence for it, which she pushed along the counter—Chubb put it into the till, and took out three penny-pieces—she took them all up—he put his hand in again, took out more halfpence, put his hand into the place where the silver was, took some out, and put it between the halfpence—I could not see what silver it was—Mr. Mullins called me round—I went, and he had Green by the hand, and there was two shillings and 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in copper in her hand—I desired him to mark it—there was no other customer there, nor anything to obstruct my seeing this.</p>

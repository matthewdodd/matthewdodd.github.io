I am the wife of Benjamin Wilderspin, a tailor, of 60, Walton Street, Chelsea—the prisoner came to lodge there on 4th May, and continued there till the 26th—she brought two children with her, a boy, named Willie, and a girl, Laura, but no man—the girl was about 4 year of age and the boy under 2 years, a year and a half, I fancy; he could not walk—I knew the prisoner as Mrs. Pleasance—she told me she had lodged in Trevor Square before coming to our place—when she first came the said she was going to take the boy to his aunt at Cambridge—on Satur<lb></lb>day morning I got up at 8, and then found that the prisoner and the boy were gone; the girl was left at home—the prisoner came back alone—I did not see the boy again—on Wednesday, the 26th, I saw the prisoner and the little girl together until dinner-time, about 2 o'clock—the child was playing—Inspector White had been before she went out, and had seen her—I did not see the little girl alive again after about 3 o'clock—I did not see them go out—I saw the prisoner again that same night in one of the cells at the Walton Street Police-station, and had a short conversation with her—I said "Why did you not say something to me before you went out about taking Laura away"—she said she loved her children too well to leave them to the</p>

On Wednesday night, 26th May, about 1/2 past 12 o'clock, I was in Walton Street, Chelsea, watching opposite No. 60, in plain clothes—I had been watching there since about 1/4 to 2 o'clock in the afternoon—I did not see the prisoner till about 1/2 past 12 o'clock; she was then standing in the New Head, opposite Ovington Square, about 80 yards from No. 60, under the shadow of the gaslight, alone—I said, "Are you locked out"—she said, "No"—I said, "Did you have a little girl with you when you left home this afternoon—she laid, "Yes"—I said, "And your name is Mrs. Pleasance, is it not?"—she said, "Yes"—I said, "And where is your little girl now?"—she said, "Dead, in the water in Battersea Park, I drowned it, it died in my arms without a straggle"—I said, "Can it be true what you say?"—she said, "Yes, my poor Laura is in Heaven now, I hope"—I said, "Where is the little boy?" (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Sleigh interposed, and as the fate of the boy was the subject of another indictment, he considered it should not be alluded to on the present charge. Mr. Justice Hawkins could not exclude the evidence, it being part of t)ie con<lb></lb>versation between the prisoner and the witness, but the Jury would understand it would not affect the present inquiry</hi>)—she said, "I will say nothing of the little boy"—I said, "The matter is serious, be careful what you say as I shall have to repeat your words; you will have to go to the station with me"—she said, "Yes, I will go quietly"—I said, "I feel truly sorry for you"—she said, "You would if you knew my troubles"—I then took her to the station and handed her over to the custody of Inspector White—I noticed that her clothes were wet, I believe all over, her hat and hair were also wet—on Thursday, the 27th, I took her from the police-court to the prison in a cab—she made a statement which I afterwards put down, as soon as I had lodged her in the prison, and this is the note I made—she said, "Do you know who employed Mr. Dutton" (he had appeared for her before the Magistrate at the first hearing) "Is he for the prosecution or the defence?" I said, "For the defence."—she said, "I do not know the name, who he said employed him; I do not want the friends of the father of my children brought into the matter at all, as his sister and mother have been very kind to me, and they cannot help what I have done."—I said, "Do be careful what you say as I shall have to make use of your words; I don't ask you to My anything, and whatever you say it will be voluntary"—she said, "Mrs. Baird is a bad woman, and it was through her that my husband was taken away from me." She made some further statement about the other child, and then she said, "Young Mr. Wilcox was living with us in Trevor Square</p>

I am a M.R.C.S. and lire at Oak House, Battersea—on Thursday morning, 27th May, between 2.30 and 3 o'clock, Inspector White brought me the body of a female child, apparently between three and four years of age; it was dead and cold, the rigor mortis had set in—in my judgment she had been dead several hours, probably five or six—there was no decomposition—she was beyond all medical aid—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on 31st; there was no sign of disease or any marks of violence—the stomach contained partly-digested food—in my judgment the cause of death was suffocation—if she had been put into the water and kept under until death took place that would produce the appearance I saw—in cases of ordinary drowning we generally find a frothy mucus about the mouth, in this case there was none—if a person was kept under the water until death took place I should not expect to find it, spasm of the glottis would ensue, and you would not find it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Supposing the woman had thrown herself into the water with the child, intending to drown herself, and had fallen down and so the child had been kept under water there would be no frothy mucus; what I mean is that the child must have been kept under water for some<lb></lb>time, from one to three minutes—I have had some experience of pregnant women—I have no knowledge myself of this woman's condition—when a woman is pregnant she is more likely to have local determination of blood—they are local determinations to the uterus principally—I cannot say that I have read Montgomery on the signs and symptoms of pregnancy, but I have had a large experience in those cases—I have read extracts of a book by Esquinol, but I must protest against being examined over the whole range of medicine; if you will ask me as to my own knowledge and experience I will answer you—with some pregnant women the cerebral disturbance amounts to a disorder of the intellectual faculties; some are subject to phantacies; in some exceptional cases they amount to a perven<lb></lb>sion of judgment, which sometimes becomes violently maniacal—I cannot say that the gloomy and desponding state is greater in the earlier stages of pregnancy than in the later—I have not observed it—there is a tendency to insanity amongst certain pregnant women—that tendency would be very much strengthened by trouble—want of sleep would be a collateral cause; the loss of dearly beloved friends might be; indeed any mental anxiety—sometimes the mental disturbance is so great that women will eat things which under other circumstances they would regard with loathing, and they will regard with antipathy persons for whom they entertain the greatest affection—the whole moral nature, in some exceptional cases, is changed.</p>

I am medical officer at the House of Detention—I have been there nearly 40 years, but have actually been surgeon there about 20 years—I saw the prisoner during the week she was there—I saw her several times during that period, and I conversed with her, but not to any great extent, as my opinion had not been asked about</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> As far as I know she is perfectly sane at this moment; I saw nothing like insanity about her—I suppose it is possible for a person to do an act in an insane moment and be perfectly sensible Boon after, but it is not very common—sometimes pregnant women take violent antipathies—in a few cases the physical disturbance may overthrow the mental faculties; it is very rare—I do not think that the tendency to the anticipation of evil is greater in the earlier stages of pregnancy; it is not my experience; I think they get more depressed as time goes on.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon of Her Majesty's gaol of Newgate—I hate been so 25 years—I have had a large experience with male and female prisoners, and in cases of insanity—the prisoner has been in Newgate from 3rd June to the present time—I have seen her almost from day to day and conversed with her many times, especially with a view to ascertain the state of her mind—during the whole of the time she has been in New<lb></lb>gate, in my judgment she has been perfectly sane—I have seen no indica<lb></lb>tions of insanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> A severe domestic affliction is one of the proximate causes of insanity—any great mental trouble may be the proximate cause of insanity; the loss of relatives or friends might be, or great pecuniary loss in some cases, long watching, great anxiety, and want of sleep, anything that tends to exhaust the nervous system—I should consider a combination of such causes, coupled with pregnancy, sufficient to account for derangement of mind—in pregnancy the moral judgment and intellectual faculties are very often disturbed—the prisoner is no doubt pregnant.</p>

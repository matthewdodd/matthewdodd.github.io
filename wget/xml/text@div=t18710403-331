                  </hi>. I live at Coleherne Mews, West Brompton, where the prisoner puts up—I am married—my husband's name is William Perry—he is a cab proprietor—I believe the prisoner owns the cab he drives himself—on Tuesday, 27th December, I remember the prisoner driving into the yard—I live over his stable—he does not live there—when he drove into the mews I asked him how the roads were, whether they were not very bad—he said they were very bad indeed—as far as I could see he was perfectly sober—I saw the policeman come into the yard—I did not notice whether he was very much out of breath—I did not hear what the policeman said—I heard them talking—he was getting down from his box when I spoke to him—the policeman came in a few seconds after—I believe he was then standing at the stable door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cab-driver, and live at 8, Stamford Street, Fulham—I have been a cab-driver nine years—I have known the prisoner six years—he has always been a careful and sober driver—I was on the cab rank, just by Thistle Grove, on Tuesday night, 27th December—I did not see any person run over, or hear of it—I was on the rank from about 9.50 till about 10.54 or 10.55—I did not hear anyone call out "Mark Hill"—I saw the prisoner driving his cab, like a sober man, at about five or six miles an hour—I heard no cries—he was going in the direction of the "Gunter Arms,"—as he went by, a servant called me—he was about twenty or twenty-five yards from me—he went up towards the "Gunter Arms," and I picked up a lady, and went to the Argyll Rooms—I saw Mitchell, the constable, the next morning, outside the "King's Arms," in the Fulham Road—I said nothing to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a saddler, at 1, Hare Street, Piccadilly—on Tuesday night, 27th December, I saw Mr. Martin, and two other gentlemen, get into the prisoner's cab—he had been waiting at the bottom of the arcade—he frequently waits there for Mr. Martin—they got into the cab, and Hill took the rug from his horse's back, threw it on the top of the cab, and drove away—as far as I could see, he was sober—I have ridden in his cab—I have always found him a steady, sober driver.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have not been in Court during the trial—I was one of the party, on this night, with Mr. Martin—we broke up at 10.30, as near as possible—that is the regular time—there is no decided time that I am aware of—a remark was made, that it was getting later than usual—it was 10.30 as we came out of the arcade, and that was the time they got into the cab.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner received a good character, as a sober, steady driver, from three other witnesses.</hi>

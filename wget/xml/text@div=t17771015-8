               <p>They were brought by one of our men to the house, and I was to have lotted them; when they were brought to me, they were tied up in a bundle with other linen; I untied them; I hung up the linen as far as the printed catalogue went; the wearing apparel I put loose on the bed. In about an hour and a half after the rest of the catalogue came from the printer's, I went to hang up the wearing apparel; I then missed the things mentioned in the indictment; I told one of the clerks, and hand-bills, with a reward, were printed, and the things were found pawned. I saw the prisoner that day in the room.</p>

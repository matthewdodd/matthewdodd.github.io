                  </hi>. I am public analyst for Paddington—I received from Jonas Hall a tin of English condensed milk which had been opened at the bottom instead of the top, and about a quarter of it had been taken out—there were some slight specks of a white powder scattered about on the sides, and a few on the surface—the milk being sticky they stuck to the sides—I picked them out, and placed them on a watch glass, and found that they were an insoluble white precipitate—I thought at first it might be arsenic, but upon analysis I found—it was not—white precipitate is a poison—I picked out the particles from the surface of the milk—I did not observe any in the bulk of milk—white precipitate is sold by chemists in 5 pennyworths and mixed for vermin—I am not aware that it is ever used internally for children—the effect of administering a very small quantity would produce a burning sensation about the mouth, and throat—even a grain or two would produce some sensation—it would take a larger quantity than two or three grains to kill a child eight months old; I should say ten or fifteen, but it would depend upon whether the sickness threw it up again—it was a very small quantity indeed that I took out of the tin—it is a thing easily detected—half a grain can be detected very readily, or less than that.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The evidence of the small quantity was so distinct that I did not analyse the bulk—I did not take out all the specks, but I took sufficient for analysis—all that were there were visible—it was not all mixed with the milk; it stuck on the surface and sides—I don't think the whole of the specks would amount to two or three grains—it was on the surface and sides alone that I found the specks—it did not sink down—full three-quarters of the contents of the tin were still there—it could have been stirred up-with the milk, but that was not so in this case—I think possibly it might have been dropped, or spilt, or fallen in, or in some manner have come upon the surface.</p>

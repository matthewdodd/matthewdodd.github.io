                  </hi>. I live at 38, Fleet Lane, City, and am a tin plate worker—I was out with Joseph Reeve and Miss Reeve—about 12.40 a.m., on Sunday morning, 4th June, I wished the young woman "Good night!" at the corner of Southwark Street—my brother was with me, about a dozen yards away—the prisoner had been out with us early in the evening, and had left us about three-quarters of an hour before—I felt a blow at my arm as I was wish<lb></lb>ing "Good night!"—I looked round and saw the prisoner there—I remember nothing till he was in custody—I was bleeding from my nose, mouth, and arm, and was stabbed in the arm—my coat was cut—I gave him in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 1, Moorgan's Lane, Tooley Street, and am a packing case maker—on this Saturday I was standing at the corner of Southwark Street—the prisoner beckoned me to go on—I remained where I was, thinking he might want to speak to my sister—I saw him suddenly run from round the corner up to the prosecutor and stab him—I ran up to them—the prisoner said "I have done it, you may take me"—I said "Done what?"—the prosecutor gets up and says "I am stabbed"—we had a struggle with the prisoner—a policeman came up and we took him.</p>

                  </hi>. Some time ago I kept company with the prisoner—about a week before this took place, I broke off the engagement—I was wishing the prosecutor good night at the corner of Southwark Street—he came up to us—I did not see him stab the prosecutor, but he fell and got up again, and said he was stabbed—I picked up the knife, shut it up and put it in my pocket, and took it to the station—the blade was open—I don't know if there was blood on it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The knife is here—I only found the handle, the police<lb></lb>man found the blade—the blade was broken.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not say he was cleaning his pipe out with his knife—he had a pipe—he had been drinking.</p>

I am a surgeon—on this night I was called to the station, the prosecutor was suffering from a wound on the left arm, midway between the elbow and the shoulder, about 2 inches long—half an inch deep—the knife produced would be likely to have caused the wound before it was broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The wound is quite well now—I did not attend him after this night—I am the Divisional Surgeon—if a man hit another with his fist, the knife being open, it would cause such a wound as this—it would have made a punctured wound if given so.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> There must have been some considerable force to make a wound like that.</p>

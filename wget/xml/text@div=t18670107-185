I live at Stratford New Town, West Ham—on Friday, the 14th December, I was standing in Maryland Road with James Ainsworth and the prosecutor, between half-past four and twenty minutes to five in the afternoon—I saw the prisoner come past—the prosecutor said to Ains worth, "Is that the painter who struck you at Forest Gate?"—the prisoner turned round and said, "What have you got to say about the painter? I will stick a knife through the first one I come near"—he then rushed at the prosecutor and struck a knife into hia left hip—I did not see the knife, but I heard it shut—the prisoner ran away—the prosecutor fell against the fence—I helped to put him on some stones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> From what part of his person did the man take the knife? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Out of one of his pockets—I could tell it was a knife by the wound—I did not see anything in his hand—he had on a lighter coat than he has now, worsted corduroy trousers with buttons up in front, and a low new-fashioned hat—I have repeated all that he said—he did not use any bad word—I met Ainsworth when I left off work at half-past four—we had just left off work—I saw the prisoner again next day, Saturday—he was taken in custody on Saturday night.</p>

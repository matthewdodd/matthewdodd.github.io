            . Mr. and Mrs. Spencer was going out of town for a few days, Mr. Spencer left with me a twenty-five pound bank note on the 7th of November; Mr. Wiseman come and asked Mr. Spencer if he would pay him some money that was left on a pair of pantaloons; Mr. Spencer told him he had no change, if he would come in the evening he would pay him, and give him half a guinea that he had promised him as a gift. Wiseman said it would be of very great use to him if he could have it then; Mrs. Spencer desired that I would let the girl go and get change, I was called into the back room, the girl came back and said that she could not get change; she had a piece of paper in her hand apparently like a bank note. At the time that we came back Mr. and Mrs. Spencer went away; I went into the front room and said where was the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room at that time. - A. Only the prisoner. I looked round and could not find it, I went to the top of the stairs and called to the servant to know where she had laid it, she answered on the card table; I looked for it again, but could not find it on any of the tables in the room; the servant came up and she could not find it. I then asked Mr. Wiseman if he would go after Mr. and Mrs. Spencer and stop the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not suspect him. - A. No. I sent him after them to know whether the servant might not have given it to the mistress in a mistake; he was gone about an hour and a half. he returned and said he had been as far as Kensington and could not overtake them; he went away, and said he would come on the Saturday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he seem distressed for the money. - A. No, not after he had asked Mr. Spencer. On Saturday he came and asked me if I had found the note, I told him no.</p>
               <p>Q. You were describing a room where the prisoner was and where the servant laid the note on the card table, where was that room. - A. The dining room, up one pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any body been in that room. - A. There had not any one, no one could have gone in without my knowledge.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow street. On the 11th of November I went down to the prisoner's lodgings with Lavender, to No. 3, Seymour place, Chandois street. I searched the prisoner; in his small clothes I found twelve shillings, I asked him if that was all the money he had, he answered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180612030051"></xptr> yes; I then proceeded to search the two rooms, which were on the ground floor. In the first room I searched and found nothing; I proceeded to the back room and was going to search in a cupboard, where there was a quantity of rubbish, when the prisoner took my intention off by saying, come into this room and I'll shew you money; I went into a room that I had searched before, he took me to a box that I had overlooked, he produced a quantity of pawnbroker's duplicates, saying there is money; he kept me in suspence for a couple of minutes, I then returned to the cupboard from where he had taken my intention off; the prisoner followed me, put his hand over my shoulder, and from behind some rubbish he took this purse and gave it into my hand, saying there is the money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the purse contain. - A. Eight pound in bank notes, two two's and four one's, four guineas, four half guineas; the other side contained a quantity of duplicates, some of them pledged as recently as the 7th of November. I then asked the prisoner who this money belonged to, his answer was, it belongs to myself; he said he had got it by a hit in the lottery, making use of his own expression; he afterwards said he had got a part of it of some persons to make them garments.</p>
               <p>Q. Now it was visible to you that he was illuding you not to make this search in the closet. - A. Just so, there was a quantity of rags and filthiness in the closet, there was two poor children nearly naked; and the whole of his apartment was a scene of distress.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord and gentlemen of the jury, with submission I beg to observe, that I am as innocent as a child unborn, of the offence alledged against me. At the time I called at the prosecutor's house, to solicit payment of a small account that he owed me for work that I had done, I had been in business myself twelve years; I have been in the habit of working for the prosecutor many years; sometime ago I was obliged to wait for my money four years; since then I did not give him credit to a large amount. The same time the prosecutor went out of the house, there was the maid servant and the other persons, they told me they had given the note to her master and mistress; and desired me to go after them, which I did, and could not overtake them. I have three young children who are left motherless; I have supported them honestly, and industriously.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

I am a cabman, and live at 14, Richmond Road, Barnsbury—on Monday night, 16th April, about 12.30, I was at the corner of Euston Square and Seymour Street, in the Euston Road, having a cup of coffee; my cab was standing by the side of the kerbstone—a four—wheeled cab came down the Euston Road from Tottenham Court at a furious rate, and ran into my cab—the prisoner was the driver; he was not sober—he was thrown off his box into the road, and his horse bolted off again with the cab, after getting free from my cab, and ran up Seymour Street—I asked the pri<lb></lb>soner for the number of the cab and for his ticket, he said he had not got a ticket—I said "Are you not going after your horse and cab?"—he said"—No, it can go where it likes"—there was room for two or three cabs to pass in the road without coming into collision.</p>

I keep a coffee stall at the north-west corner of Sey<lb></lb>mour Street—on this Monday night, about 12.30, I heard a hallooing and shouting, and looking down the Euston Road I saw a cab coming along at a furious rate quite close to the kerb; the last witness' cab was standing behind my stall, and before I could hardly say anything the horse struck the cab and turned "it into the road—the prisoner fell off his cab, and the cab turned the corner, and went up Seymour Street at the same rate—shortly after I saw the prisoner standing there talking to the other cabman—he had been drinking.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Crown Street, Hoston, and am a cabinet maker—at 12.30 on the morning 11th May I was walking through Hoxton Square—I was seized suddenly by two persons by the wrist and another tore my coat open and ran away with my watch and chain—the one that took my watch was tried here last Sessions—the prisoner knocked me down and kicked me in the head—I was cut on the mouth and there is a scar there</p>

               <p>now and also on my hand where they jumped on it to get my ring off—I was laid up in bed for a week—my gold watch and chain were worth 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was picked up insensible after I was kicked on the head and taken to the station—I had known the prisoner two or three years—I gave infor<lb></lb>mation of the robbery to the police afterwards—I was afterwards taken to the Old Street police-station to see a number of men and I picked the prisoner out from amongst them—I knew him by the name of <hi rend="italic">Cockey</hi>—he is the man who attacked me that night—they had been watching me for some two months.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective G</hi>). On the morning of 18th June I was in Brick Lane and saw the prisoner in company with two men whom I knew—I saw them go into the Three Cranes public-house—I obtained the assistance of Detective Cooper and went and took Lewis in custody, and said I should take him for picking a woman's pocket in the Whitechapel Road that morning—I got him in a cab and then told him I should take him to Old Street Police-station for robbery and knocking Mr. Hopkins down on 18th May and robbing him with other men—he made no answer—at the station he was placed with the other men and Mr. Hopkins came in and tapped him on the shoulder as soon as he came into the room-Lewis said it was not a fair identification as some of the men were older—I knew Lewis by the name of <hi rend="italic">Cockey</hi> and that was the reason I took him into custody.</p>

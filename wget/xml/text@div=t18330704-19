               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. Was your master out? A. Yes, it was on Sunday; my master came home that night, but I did not tell him of it that night - Riddle was not much intoxicated; I did not see any one but Godwin standing opposite; the omnibus was directly opposite my master's - Godwin was right opposite my master's house, and must have seen it - Riddle took it over in his hand.</p>
               <p>CONRADE MANGER WEBB. I keep the shop. My shopman told me of this the next morning - I called Riddle into my room; he confessed that he took a ham on Sunday evening, and said he was sorry for what he had done, but he had taken a ham, and given it to the driver of the omnibus; I asked him why he had done so, he gave me no answer; I then sent for the officer; I could not miss the ham, I had so many.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took both the prisoners; Riddle told me he had been asked by a coachman, whom he did not know, to give him a rasher of ham, and he gave him a whole ham - I took Godwin, he said he knew nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you stated that he was charged with stealing a ham? A. No, receiving one; he said he knew nothing of any ham whatever.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this Mr. Rawlinson's hand-writing? A. Yes; this other is the writing of Mr. Phillips, the second clerk in the office - it was read over in presence of the prisoners (read) "The prisoner Riddle says I took the ham out of the shop, wrapped it up in a red handkerchief, and gave it to the coachman; he asked me first for a rasher - I rode down with him and back; he then said, get a small ham if you can; I was in liquor - the prisoner Godwin says I was in liquor."</p>
               <p>ELIZA LAWRENCE re-examined. Q. Did you see the coachman at the time the ham was taken? A. No, not till I got to the door - I don't know whether Riddle got off the coachman's box.</p>
               <p>Henry Wade, of Richard-street and Mr. Arnold, Little Towerhill, deposed to the previous good character of Riddle.</p>

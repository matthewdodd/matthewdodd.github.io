                  </hi>. I reside at East End, Finchley, and am station master at the East End Station, Great Northern Railway—in the station there was a tin box nailed to the wall of the waiting room for contributions. in aid of the blind—I am unable to say when I last saw it there—I missed it on Monday morning, 15th September—I was at the station on Sunday night, but cannot say whether the box was there—it was last opened and the money taken out on or about the 5th August—this is the box (pro<lb></lb>duced)—I found it in a field on the 19th September—it was broken off with an instrument which we call a'driftpin, also the property of the railway company—it was about 2 feet from the box—there was a farthing in it—I am unable to say whether there was money in the box when I last saw it on the wall, but I tapped it a day or two previous to the 14th and believe there was money in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter at the East End Railway Station, Great Northern Railway—this tin box. was attached to the wall of the station—I saw it there last on Sunday night, the 15th September, at 10.20, when I locked the waiting-room door—the window was shut, but I cannot say whether it was fastened—I was the first person at the station on Monday morning, and found the lock of the waiting-room door had been tampered with and the bolts withdrawn from inside, but the doors being locked they had not succeeded in opening them—on going into the waiting-room I saw one of the windows was open—it looks on to a cab rank, and is about 3 1/2 feet from the road—I missed the box from behind the door, and I also found another box had been tampered with belonging to the Railway Benevolent Association, but it had not been opened.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman G</hi> 82). I saw Barnard on the evening of the 15th September at East Finchley, close to where he lives, and from the description I had received of him from the station master, about 10.30 that morning I stopped him and said "Is your name Barnard?"—he said Yes"—I said "Where have you been on Sunday evening?" or if he had been at East Finchley Station—he hesitated for some time and said "I have; I was at the railway station until about 9 o'clock with a boy named Green"—in consequence of his communication I went to East Finchley with Barnard—I looked about for Green and found him in a school—Barnard was then speaking to his father—I said' to Green "Where</p>

               <p>were you on Sunday evening?"—he said "I was at East Finchley Rail<lb></lb>way Station; I left there about 9.30"—I said "Do you know anything of the contribution box being taken from there?"—I asked him a second time before he answered me—he said "Yes; I saw a box hung on the wall; Barnard stroked it and said there was money in it"—I told them I should charge them both on suspicion of stealing the box and the contents—Barnard said in the hearing of Green "I didn't steal it; Green stroked it; and called my attention to it"—Green made no reply, but hung his head—as we were passing by the East End Finchley Railway Station, Green said "We might as well tell the truth; I took the box off" the wall and Barnard carried it out"—it might have been "Barnard took the box off and I carried it out"—it is nearly four weeks since now Green said "We took it to a field at the rear of the station to open it to take the money out, and on hearing somebody come we threw it across the hedge and ran away"—I sent for the station master, and with the boys went in search of the box, but could not find it—I took them to Highgate Police station and they were charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The station master did not tell me to take the boys into custody—he said they were in the habit of loitering about the neighbour<lb></lb>hood of the station, and from what he said I imagined they took the box—I did not tell Barnard I was going to charge him with stealing the box until I brought him in front of Green—I did not tell Green that I had been told by Barnard that he was the other boy who was there—I pointed out Barnard—Barnard said Green stroked the box, and said there was money in it—it was a voluntary statement to me—it was about an hour from the time I met Barnard to when I made the charge at the police-station—I cautioned them, and drew the attention of Green to Barnard when he accused him, and said "You hear what he says; be sure you tell the truth"—I did not add "It will be very much better for you if you do."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The loss of the box was communicated to the police, and a description of the boys, in consequence of which Barnard was apprehended, and he made a communication to me, and then I went to Green—I used no threat or inducement to the prisoners to make the statement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to James Colan, a ham and tongue dealer. I was out with his cart on the 9th of January, about six o'clock in the' evening—I was on Tower-hill, I had a small bag containing 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver, and the rest in copper—it was my master's, and what I had received for hit goods—it was in the cart under the seat—it was an open cart—I was sitting on the seat with the money under me—as I got to the corner by Trinity-square, I heard the money rattle—I turned and saw the prisoner jumping off the cart with the bag in his hand—I immediately stopped the horse, and jumped off the side of the cart—the horse ran away—I was obliged to go and stop it, and the prisoner made his escape—I had a full new of his person—I went on Friday round Tower-hill, and Tower-street, (where it is my firm belief the prisoner must have seen me put the money in,) and then I saw the prisoner standing, watching every cart that went by, he went and looked into them—when he saw me, he went up Barking Church-yard—I went after him, he went across Tower-hill, and stood against the railings, and then stopped looking at a child's chair—I saw the policeman, and gave him into custody—I am quite positive he is the man.</p>

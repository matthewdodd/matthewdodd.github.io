               <p>Q. What did he do when he first got into the coach? A. He was impudent, and said he should like to kiss the old lady, or something; the door was shut, and the coach drove on - it went slow, as it was up hill; he took my purse two minutes after he got into the coach, and got out directly - I do not know whether he stopped the coach, for I was terrified; if it did stop it drove on directly- when the toll was demanded at the turnpike, I told the toll-man I was robbed, and refused to pay; the prisoner drove on - I wanted to get home: I never saw him before- the robbery made me know him, for I trembled liked a leaf: he was dressed in a light coat and buttons as a hackney-coachman; a man whom he called his brother was on the box with him, driving; I was going to Lower Islington - when I asked the fare at the stand, which is near Oxford-street, they said 3s.; I saw this chariot, and he refused to take me under 3s.; I told him to take me as far as he could for 1s. - he took me to Battle-bridge; I gave him 1s., got out, and told him if he would take me home I would give another one - he said he would; I went into a public-house, changed half a sovereign, and had half a pint of porter - the prisoner and his brother had a glass of gin each; I pulled out my purse to change the halfsovereign, and he took the change under pretence of looking at it, and put it into his pocket; I was ill, and too timid to say any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180038"></xptr>Q. Did you get into the coach again? A. Most assuredly - he said, "Old lady, I will take you;" I got in- he drove half way up the hill, and then stopped; he came first on the left side, then on the other, and said he wanted something out of the chariot - I said, "This is not a stage; what do you want?" he felt about me - he knew my money was on my right-hand side; he went round to the other door, got in, and sat by my side - I felt him take my purse; he jumped out immediately - I did not know what to do; I had been laid up for five weeks with the rheumatic gout, and could not walk - the coach went on, and I came to the turnpike - the prisoner came, and asked me for the toll: I told him I should not give any thing, I had given enough; but I did pay it - the prisoner took the sixpence; I told Mr. Bury, who kept the gate that I had been robbed, but said no more, for I thought I was in very bad hands, and the sooner I got home the better - he drove me to Norfolk-street instead of New Norfolk-street, where I live, and sat me down in the middle of the street, in the middle of the snow, and left me there - that is two or three streets from New Norfolk-street; the person, he called his brother, was still with him - I saw the watchman coming up; the chariot drove down to the end of the street, which is no thoroughfare - the watchman said, "You are left in a distressing situation;" I said, "Never mind me, stop that chariot," and he tried. but said he could not - the watchman took me home; I did not see the prisoner again till Saturday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you in any business? A. I have a husband who supports me - he is <rs id="t18300218-70-viclabel380" type="occupation">in the surveying line</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y" targets="t18300218-70-victim493 t18300218-70-viclabel380"></join>, and was formerly an officer in the army - I do not assist in his business; I have had the rheumatic gout about two years - I have taken a small quantity of brandy, when I have been sick; I had some that day - I begged of the coachman to give me brandy, for I thought I should die from the inclemency of the weather - when I had the beer I gave him a glass of gin- the weather was cold; the beer did not agree with me- I threw it off my stomach immediately, and said I should like brandy; this was after I had rode some distance in the coach, he got me the brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. How had you been employed that day? A. I had been very busy with my daughter, who had been laid up; I do not know why I am to say where she lives to bring her into trouble; she is young and blooming - I had been on business with her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How far does she live from where you took the coach? A. I took a cabriolet for her in Rathbone-place, and walked to where I took the coach, which was at the stand near the New-road - I had gone out to receive the money; I was not in a public-house before I went into one with the coachman; I had fetched a trunk from Seymour-street, and had half a pint of beer between me and my daughter - I do not know the name of the public-house - I bought some boots in Seymour-street -I dined at home that day, and had no more than I usually have, a pint of porter - I am frequently very ill; it is always attended with sickness - the prisoner never tried to kiss me; he said, "Old lady, I should like to kiss you;" I turned a deaf ear to that; that was after I had been to the public-house, at the time he took the purse -I distinctly felt his hand in my pocket when he took it, and I tried to binder him with my band, but was too feeble - I was too weak to cry out - I was unfit to be out of doors; my daughter wished me not to go, but I was anxious for her sake - I was afraid she would not be treated well on the road; I placed her in a cabriolet, paid the man, and told him to take care of her - I took the number; she was going to her destination - she dined with me that day; she is not here - I should have gone home in the Omnibus, but there were none at half-past ten o'clock; I left home abont six, and took my daughter to Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you engaged for four hours and a half? A. We had to walk; it is a long distance, and my daughter had a trunk.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told the man at the turnpike you had been robbed, did you not say who had robbed you? A. I spoke of it, but I thought the gate-keeper might be as bad - I knew I had a husband at home; and when I got home he said, "Good God! what an hour to be out;" he had advised me not to go out - he was not pleased at this.</p>
               <p>Q. When you arrived in Norfolk-street were you not in such a state of intoxication you could not walk the rest of the way? A. No, the watchman will tell you the same; I was stupified with fear - I have no power with my right hand, having the gout in it; I received the money at No. 71, Lombard-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, after all this, is it true you paid the coachman 3s.? A. He paid himself - I gave him no money, except 6d. to pay the toll - I was a helpless woman, and thought it much better to go to my husband; I did not take the number of the coach - it was my daughter that took the number of the cabriolet.</p>
               <p>Q. After the man left you alone in the coach. why not put down the glass and say you were robbed? A. Islington is not a very thronged place; I thought he should drive me to my own door - I did all I could to have him detained when I got out; two watchmen came up - I was placed in the snow; I told them to follow the chariot, and it very nearly turned over.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You set out about six o'clock to walk with your daughter? A. Yes; I walked all down the road to Seymour-street, Euston-square, where I bought my daughter a pair of boots - I then went to Rathbone-place, and put her into a cabrioet at half-past eight o'clock - we had staid a little time in Rathbone-place; I called there to pay a sovereign.</p>
               <p>JAMES BURY. I keep the turnpike at Islington. On the 3rd of February, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I remember seeing a yellow chariot driven by the prisoner - I knew him before, having taken toll of him many times; his chariot is No. 226 - when he got to the gate I knocked at the door, and asked for 6d. for the toll two or three times - nobody answered; I then opened the door, and saw the old lady Thompson sitting on the left hand corner of the chariot - I asked for the toll; she said she would not pay it, that she had been robbed - she did not say who by; the coachman got off his box, and came to the gate - there was nobody with him at the gate; I asked for the toll again - Thompson said she would not pay it; the coachman said she must, and in about half a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183002180039"></xptr>minute he paid it himself - I cannot say where he got it from; he gave it to me, shut the door, and drove away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prosecutrix appear to have been asleep? A. No, I could not see what state she was in - she sat up in the corner; she did not name the prisoner as having robbed her; if she had I could have called the watchman - there is one near the Angel, and another near the toll-house; it was between eleven and twelve o'clock at night - there was nothing to prewent her giving information; the chariot door was open- she came to me on the Friday evening, at the Highgate gate - she was alone; she said nothing about her busband's insisting on her prosecuting.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of Thursday, the 3rd of February, I was on duty, and saw Mrs. Thompson sitting in the snow in Old Norfolk-street - a chariot brought her there; I did not see the coachman, but heard his voice - I saw the chariot come down nearly to the bottom of the street; I told him it was no thoroughfare - he instantly said, "Then I must turn round;" I came up to Mrs. Thompson again - I had not seen the coachman set her down; she then said,"Stop the chariot, I am robbed;" I went out into the main road, and the chariot got away - it drove very fast; I went about two hundred yards, but could not overtake it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long is Old Norfolk-street? A. I should think about one hundred and twenty yards; I saw Mrs. Thompson sitting in the snow before I saw the chariot - I led her home; she walked.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you account for her sitting in the snow? A. No; I went very close to her, but smelt no brandy - she seemed much agitated; she spoke to me first, and said"Stop the chariot, I am robbed;" I had come in at the bottom of the street - the chariot came down to the bottom, and then I saw her sitting on the snow; it was after the chariot turned that she spoke to me - I saw the chariot coming down the street before I spoke to her - there was a watchman with me, named Element; he was not before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any money for coming here? A. No - I have drawn 1s. from the constable last night.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that is all - be cautious how you answer - how much have you had? A. Two shillings, no more - I had them from the constable Willsher- one last night, and one the day before; I asked him for it, because I wanted it - I had one on Monday, and the other yesterday; that was at Clerkenwell - I did not refuse to go in at Clerkenwell until I had it; I cannot tell whether it was before or after I gave my evidence -I think it was about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not make it a condition on which you went before the Grand Jury, that you were tohave 1s.? A. No; the officer desired me to attend - I brought Mrs. Thompson with me part of the way; I went to her house once before that, and had a glass of rum, but no money - she gave me the rum; I did not ask her for it - I have received no money from any body, except the 2s.; I have eat and drank - the prosecutrix was sober; she seemed very much agitated, and trembled - I cannot say she had been drinking; I swear she appeared sober - she was much agitated at losing her money.</p>
               <p>Q. If you followed the coach two hundred yards, why not call out? A. It drove away, and got out of my sight- when I came to the top of the street it was gone; I did not say I saw it for two hundred yards, but that I followed it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you got to the main road, did you see the chariot? A. No, it was gone away.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How do you know it went fast? A. It went from the top of the street to the bottom; that leads in to the Lower-road, which is lighted with gas; I could see two hundred yards, and more I should think; I was not with the prosecutrix a minute before I went to look after the coach - I did not see it turn the corner, and do not know which way it went.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it went fast? A. I went from the the top of the street to the bottom; the next turning is King-street, which is about thirty yards - I cannot say it did not turn down there; I did not tell the Grand Jury I saw the coach for a considerable distance.</p>
               <p>MRS. THOMHSON re-examined. When the chariot came up the street again it was almost turned over by the furious driving - when he drove through the turnpike he used an expression to the man; he said, "The old b-r had like to have taken me into -" some term, meaning the prison.</p>

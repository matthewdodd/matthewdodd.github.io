                  </hi>. I am in partnership with my father, William Woods, a dealer in hardware, in Newgate-street The prisoner has been to our shop, and had some small dealings for ready money—I never gave him credit—on the 25th of June he brought a list of articles, and said he had an order for those goods from a Captain Smith, and if I would allow my porter to go with him to Captain Smith's, I should get the money for them—there was one set of ivory-handled table cutlery worth 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not exactly the pattern he wanted—he said he would take them to Captain Smith; if they were approved they would be kept, if not, they would be returned—I made up the goods in two parcels, and told the porter to go with him to Captain Smith, at the Jamaica Coffee-house, where the prisoner said Cap<lb></lb>tain Smith was waiting—he was to deliver the goods on the money being paid by Captain Smith, and not otherwise—if he approved of the goods there was 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be returned, the whole amount; if not, there was to be minus 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the table cutlery—he was to deliver the goods on the money being paid by Captain Smith, and not else—the porter and the prisoner left the shop together—the porter returned some time after, with one of the parcels of goods—the parcel the prisoner kept contained the set of cutlery that he was to show Captain Smith, also some penknives, scissors, and pencil-cases, amounting to 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they were not sold by me at all—all the goods in the parcel that the porter brought back were the goods positively ordered.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Woods. On the 25th of June I received instructions from Mr. Woods, junior, to take the goods, and receive the money—I went with the prisoner to No. 7, St. Michael's-alley, Cornhill—while going along, the prisoner proposed to carry one parcel, and then wished to carry the other, that being the larger—I told him I could manage it myself very well—I was lame at the time—I let him have the larger one—he offered to take the other one as well—when we got to St. Michael's-alley, he said he would go up stairs, and see if Captain Smith was up at the shipping agent's—he went up stairs, and took the smaller parcel with him—he came down stairs again, and said Captain Smith was not there, he was round at the coffee-house, if I would wait a few minutes he would bring him back, and have the other goods—I said I would <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with him—I turned into the passage, to get the other goods to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with him, but I was not fast enough, and he was gone with the parcel before I got into the passage—I had laid the parcel down in the passage to rest—he did not return to me at all, nor pay for them—I did not see Cap<lb></lb>tain Smith—I saw the prisoner next at the Computer, about six weeks afterwards.</p>

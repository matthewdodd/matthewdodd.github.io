                  </hi>. I live with my brother Christopher, a grocer at Twickenham. On the 18th of Nov., the prisoner came to the shop, and re<lb></lb>quested change for a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque, and produced this cheque—I asked his name—he said his name was Brown, that he lived at Kingston-house, and that he had dealt at our house, and frequently sent a boy overfor goods—I told him I could not conveniently give him change—he then said, "If you will give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account it will be sufficient, as I am going to London, and I will call for the remainder in the morning, I will leave it in your possession—I saw it was dated 4th of Sept., and thinking it suspicious that it should be dated so far back, I immediately suspected it was not genuine, as we had no customer named Brown living at Kingston-house that I knew of—Mr. Davis, a butcher, came in at the time, and made a sign, which made me suspect that it was not genuine—I told the prisoner that I thought it was not a genuine cheque, and asked him if he dare take any money on it—he immediately took up the cheque off the counter, said no, and ran out of the shop—I im<lb></lb>mediately</p>

               <p>followed him, and about 100 yards off overtook him—I threw him down—he resisted, hit me over the hand with a stick, and got away—I fol<lb></lb>lowed him again, saw a man named Priestly in the middle of the road, and told him to stop him, which he did—he was brought back to the house—a constable came, and found in his hand the cheque he had produced to me, and also in his pocket another cheque for the same amount, purporting to be drawn on the London and Westminster Bank—I gave him in charge—I had the cheque in my hand—I had possession of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a butcher, and live in Heath-lane, Twickenham. On the afternoon of the 18th of Nov., the prisoner came to my shop, and asked if I could change a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque for him—I said I could not—he said I should very much oblige him if I could, or would get it for him, and he would give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for my trouble—I went and asked a neighbour to come in and see if he knew the party—he said, "No"—I brought the cheque back, and gave it to him again, as I could not change it—I asked if he was known in the neighbourhood—he said, "Yes," that his brother lived at Kingston-house, and that his name was Captain Adelaide, or Captain Corfield, I do not know which—I noticed the name of Murray in the corner of the cheque—I cannot say which cheque it was.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier of the Marylebone branch of the London and Westminster Bank. I know nothing of the prisoner—he had no account with us—we have no account with any person named S. Murray—we have with David Murray, but his handwriting does not in the least resemble that on this cheque.—(<hi rend="italic">Cheque read</hi>)—"London and Westminster Bank. 4th Nov., 1842. Pay to Mr. Brown, or bearer, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—<hi rend="smallCaps">S. MURRAY."</hi>) I pay cheques—I do not keep the books—a book is kept with the names of all our customers in it—I have looked at that book, to see whether any S. Murray banks with us, but my mind was quite made up before that—if any S. Murray did bank with us, the book would show it—the book is filled up by the par<lb></lb>ties themselves—they sign their own names—the books show who does or does not bank there—I am supposed to know every person that banks at our house—I know we have no account with any S. Murray—I know that partly from the books, and partly because every new account is mentioned to me instantly—new accounts are always made with the manager—the book is in the office for reference to by the clerks—it is not here, nor is the manager—it is an incorporated banking company—several hundreds of persons bank at our branch—every time a new account is opened, the book is brought and shown to the cashiers—I might or might not see the party—the manager always sees them in the first instance.</p>

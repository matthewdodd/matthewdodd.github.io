On Monday, the 7th of September, I lost this property, and on Tuesday morning, Linscott, my foreman, gave me information; I called the prisoner into the parlour, and said I had been told he had robbed me - he denied it; I said I must search his pockets, his drawers, and his box, and if he objected to it I would send for an officer - he hesitated, then put his hand into his pocket, and took out a duplicate, which Linscott said he had taken and put into his pocket, that it might be written off in the book; when he gave the duplicate, I said,"Where is the money?" he gave no answer, but I found in his pockets two sovereigns and 1ls.; I questioned him about it, and he had about 13s. more than he could account for - he then said, "Sir, this 9s. is all I have ever taken from you - I put the halfpenny in the till."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hand over any money? A. Yes, three half-crowns and one sixpence; he said one of the shillings was the one, but he could not say which - I did not say any thing to induce him to confess.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You are sure you did not tell him if he would give you information you would not prosecute him? A. No, I did not - he had been about ten months with me.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Lawton's employ; the prisoner was in the same service. When an article was redeemed he should put the money into the till: I had settled the account on the Saturday night, with the prisoner, but on the Tuesday morning I called for the account again, and noticed the prisoner abstracting this duplicate; he saw me, and desisted, but I missed it afterwards, and named it to Mr. Lawton, who called the prisoner into the parlour, and he ultimately took the duplicate from his waistcoat pocket; he said it was the first money he had taken - I did not miss the money from the till; I took the account of the cash that day, but did not notice this morning what it was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not the prosecutor say he would not prosecute him if he would confess? A. No - I was not there all the time.</p>

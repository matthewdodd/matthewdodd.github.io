On Sunday morning, the 27th of June, between seven and eight o'clock, he was sitting up in bed, and the child was in his room; he appeared very fond of it - I went into the room, and saw him give her more than half a glass of rum; I did not object to it, for the men who work for my husband have been in the habit of giving the children liquor from their infancy; and my husband, when he took a drop, would give the child a drop at the bottom; I saw him put the glass to the child's mouth, but did not suppose she would drink it all herself; she drank it voraciously - there was better than half a glass: I had said I wished he would give Margaret, my eldest child, a drop, but he was fonder of this child than her, and gave it her to aggravate me - she did not complain of being ill; I went out about eight o'clock that morning, and left her at play - I returned between ten and eleven, and found her in bed, ill, and between one and two she got more affected - it did not affect her at first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she stagger at all? A. She was used to stagger; she seemed a little giddy, and wanted to go out with me - she was taken to an apothecary's between one and two o'clock; he gave her some castor-oil, told us to put her to bed, and she would be well by eight - she was taken to the hospital before eight, as she got into fits, which she was subject to, and died between eleven and twelve that night; her father gave her some melted butter, thinking she would discharge it from her stomach; I know nothing of her having soap-suds.</p>
               <p>MARY ANN WHITEHEAD. I saw the child at ten o'clock in the morning, quite tipsy; she said the prisoner had given her a glass of rum - she was subject to fits when teething, but not at this time; I put her to bed, went out with her mother, and returned at half-past eleven o'clock; she was then senseless - I went away, returned at three, and she was in strong convulsions; I took her to the hospital.</p>
               <p>CHARLES WEST WHEELER. I am an apothecary of St. Bartholomew's-hospital. I attended the child till half-past eleven o'clock on the Sunday night, when she died - I attribute her death to taking a quantity of rum, which would cause fits; she was in strong convulsions - her state was altogether different to what it would have been in a common teething fit; there was more torpor - I should think she had taken about three table-spoonsful of liquor; her body was opened, and there is no doubt of her having been previously in good health - the mischief decidedly arose from the quantity of spirits which had passed into her stomach.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The child was in the habit of taking more than I gave her, and it never took the least effect- I did it merely from good nature; I and other men have given her more than she had then; the father and mother often saw her take more.</p>

               <p>On the 14th of December, towards the evening, I was engaged with a customer; the prisoner came into my shop, I had reason to suspect her, and I took notice of her; there were two parcels of handkerchiefs on the bottom of my counter, she wanted some callico wrapper; when I had done my business I was engaged in, I shewed her some, the very first piece I shewed her did, she wanted a quarter of a yard, that was 3 d. she paid me, I then missed one parcel of handkerchiefs, which I have now in my possession; I followed her out of the shop immediately, I overtook her about a yard from my shop, just without the door, I stopped her, I charged her immediately with having my property, she said she had got nothing; I brought her back into the shop, and I felt under her arm; I took these handkerchiefs from under her arm, under her cloak, (produces the handkerchiefs) they are the same I took from her.</p>
               <p>Jury. Have you any shop-mark? - No doubt of it, but these were not marked, being just come in, I am sure these are one of the parcels, she fell on her knees and cried for mercy.</p>
               <p>- BURGESS, servant to Mr. Tatnell, sworn.</p>
               <p>I was in the shop at the time, I observed the prisoner come in towards the close of the evening, I had reason to suspect she had no good intention from her behaviour in the shop, we were all bustling, and she kept getting towards the lower end of the shop, where these handkerchiefs lay; I saw them just before, and when the customers were gone Mr. Tatnell served her; she went out, I missed the handkerchiefs immediately, he missed them before me; he fetched her back, and I saw him take the property from under her cloak, I knew the handkerchiefs, they were the same.</p>

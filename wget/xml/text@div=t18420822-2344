                  </hi>. I am a stationer, and live in High Holborn. On the 28th of July, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my shop, looked at some letter paper, and selected two reams—he then selected a ream of double small-hand—he wished me to send it with our young man, who was to bring the money back again—I an not positive that was said—but I had previously sent our young man with him, and he had brought the money back—I called the young man down, and told him to take the paper with the prisoner and to bring me the money back—I had no intention of parting with the property without the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I am apprentice to Mr. Starie. On the evening of the 28th of July I went with the prisoner, with two reams of letter paper and something else—he took me first to a public-house in Long Acre—he wished me to sit there—I said I had rather not—we then went to a public-house in Newport Market—he there took the paper from me—he did not say any thing, but went into the public-house—I let him have it under the idea that he was going to show it to a customer—I waited a minute, and then went in and made inquiries—he was gone—there was a back door to the house—I never saw him again till he was in custody.</p>

On the 31st of May I was in my back room, and saw three persons come into my shop at a quarter before ten o'clock at night; two of them came in first, and while they were being served the prisoner came in, took this ham-bone, and made off - I stopped in the shop till the others were gone; they said, "He is gone to the left," but I knew he was gone to the right; as soon as they were gone I put off my white coat and apron, and put on a dark coat; I then went across the road, and soon afterwards I saw the prisoner with my ham-bone, and the others were standing close by him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing the prosecutor's shop, and three young men came out, one having a hambone in his hand - they went on before me, and (I suppose, thinking they were pursued) the one who had the ham dropped it, and they all ran away; I picked it up, intending to restore it to the owner, whoever he might be - I was seized and charged with stealing it; the prosecutor states that he observed the three young men in the shop through the window of the back room, where he was sitting, and yet takes upon himself to swear I was one.</p>

               <p>THOMAS HASTINGS re-examined. Q. Did he tell you he had picked it up? A. No, he said he had no ham-bone; I gave him a good shake, and it fell from under his coat -I did see him through a window, but I am certain he is the person.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said, "I have not got it - there lies the ham." Witness. No, he threw it down after I shook him.</p>

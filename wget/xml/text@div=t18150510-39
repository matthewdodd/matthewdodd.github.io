On the night of the 6th of March, I watched the prisoner; in the course of that night, he was to come up to London, with his team; I put two trusses of hay for his horses, I put them myself on the cart; he was not to have more hay than he wanted for his journey, eighteen miles; he was to return the same day; he had three horses, two trusses of hay was a set allowance. On the 6th of March, I saw him at half past eleven o'clock, go into my rick yard, he cut a truss of hay from my rick; he let it remain while he called my servant, Hopwood, to go to London with him; my servant, Hopwood, came, and I saw the prisoner go, and take the truss of hay, and put it on his cart; he cut and bound the hay himself.</p>

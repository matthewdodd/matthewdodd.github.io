               <p>Prisoner's defence. I went in and called for a pint of beer, and sat in the box were there were two gentlemen drinking out of this quart pot; they walked out of the house, and left it half full of beer; I took the pot and pint and put it on the bench, to see whether they returned. I sat there half an hour, and was rather fresh; I had another pint. I took it home with me in order that my family might have the beer; that Saturday I took half a pint of gin home from that house, excepting a glass I took out for my comrade. One pot of beer is worth a dozen pot to me.</p>

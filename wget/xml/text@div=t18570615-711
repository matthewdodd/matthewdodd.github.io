                  </hi>. I live at No. 15, Church Way, New Road, St. Pancras. On Sunday morning, 17th May, between 9 and 10 o'clock, I sent my son on an errand—he had not been gone a minute or so before I heard somebody say, "There is two upon one, it is not fair," or something of that sort—I went out, and saw two boys fighting my boy, and just as I got up to the boys the prisoner's wife was there, and she turned away—I separated them, and sent my boy away about his business—I then went and spoke to a neighbour, named Norman—I still kept my eye on the pri<lb></lb>soner's shop, for I had a mistrust for some time past that he intended to do me some injury—I could not see him, and I went past, and when I got opposite his door he threw a quart tin pannikin of vitriol at me, and said, "Take that, you old b—, that will warm you."—(<hi rend="italic">The witness, who appeared in a very weak state, here became very unwell.</hi>)</p>

On Sunday morning, 17th May, I sent my son on an errand—my husband went out to separate him and two boys—I saw the prisoner standing at his door, with a quart tin pot in his hand, and as my husband returned he threw the contents of the tin pot over his head and face, saying, "Take that, you old b—, that will warm you"—he repeated that more than once—my husband at first thought it was water, till he had gone a few paces, and then he said, "Oh, Eliza, I am burning! take me to the hospital"—it burnt his clothes, and also burnt my hand and arm—he was taken to University College Hospital.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commission-merchant, and live in Ratcliff-gardens, St. Luke's. About April last the prisoner came to me with some watch-guards, chains, and fingers—he said he knew a man who was in difficulties for some money, and if I would sell the goods, he would divide the profits between him and me; that the man wanted to raise the money to pay some bills—I sold half a dozen watch-guards to Mr. Danieli, and some to Mr. Isaacs—he came very often to my house—one Saturday</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183707030075"></xptr>
               <p>I met him in St. Martin's-passage with a merchant and a man named Gay<lb></lb>ton—we went to a public-house, and Gayton offered me five dozen chains like these produced—the prisoner was present at the time—the other man who passed as a manufacturer said the goods were not quite finished, but he said I could take a penknife and make the fringe, and could sell them for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. more—I never saw that man before—he was dressed like a respectable man—he said he wanted to raise money to pay some bills, and his work<lb></lb>men—William came to me alone at first—he asked me if I should like to see the merchant or manufacturer, and then he brought this man and Gayton, at least, I met them with him—I paid the merchant for the guards in the public-house—I sold them for 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Williams and I divided the profits.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did the merchant tell you what his name was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—Gayton was not the merchant—I understood that Gayton had given the things to Williams to sell for the merchant—it had not been said to me, but that was my conclusion—Gayton afterwards told me that he would have nothing more to do with Williams, for he had laid out 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and Williams had not paid him—I was taken up myself for stealing these things, and my wife too, for a fortnight—I said directly I was taken that I had had the things from Williams—I have lately married Mr. Knott, who kept a lodging-house in Ship-yard, Old Bailey.</p>

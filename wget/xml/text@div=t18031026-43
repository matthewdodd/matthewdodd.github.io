               <p>GEORGE WRIGHT, Sen. sworn. - The prisoner never accounted to me for this bill; I have paid the money.</p>

               <p>Q. There was another note of nine pounds upon Mr. Jeffery, of Pall-Mall? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You afterwards called upon Mr. Jeffery, and indemnified him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the mother of the prisoner inform you he had lost the notes? - A.She came and made some excuse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, if they paid the money, and ten pounds more, you would not proceed against him? - A. I left it open before I instituted any judicial proceeding for his friends to make any proposals.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was very much intoxicated. I had been at a house in St. John's-street, Smithfield; I had a green money-bag in my pocket; I went to Gregory's house, he was not at home; a gentleman in the parlour told me, if I wanted to see Gregory, he was at a house in the neighbourhood; he went with me, and after taking me through several courts and turnings, we went into a public-house; Gregory was there; he asked me to sit down, and he would pay me; I repeatedly objected to staying, but he prevailed upon me to drink to a great excess; I staid about two hours; I then came out of the house, and became insensible; Gregory left me; I went through several turnings, and at last fell against a wall, and went to sleep; I waked about two o'clock in the morning; my recollection returned, I missed my pocket-book, green bag, and every thing out of my pocket; I then went into the fields, and remained the rest of the night. Through fear and shame, I absconded for a fortnight; I then went home to my mother's, and was concealed there till I was apprehended; Mr. Wright came in a blustering manner, and said if my friends had come forward, he would have taken it at half-a-crown a week.(For the Prisoner.)</p>
               <p>PHILIP DIGNAM sworn. - I keep the Black Horse, Little Wild-street; I saw Gregory at my house on the 26th of February; I made up twenty-five pounds to oblige him to take up a bill with, which I lent him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing that young man with him? - A. Yes, he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any exchange of paper between them? - A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. What is become of Gregory? - A. He has been executed.</p>

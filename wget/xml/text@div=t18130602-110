I went to Mrs. Proctor and asked her if she had lost any thing; she said, yes; we pursued after them and could not find them until half past nine at night; nothing of the property has been found I am sure I saw the prisoner come out of Mrs. Proctor's house about half after four in the afternoon; there was a dark coloured chocolate handkerchief, which hung out of her apron, she put that into her apron.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you any criminal conversation with her? - No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>What did you suffer her to attend you all the way? - I could not get her away, she would follow me.</p>
               <p>Court. Could not you have resisted and prevented it if you had thought proper? - I could not get the money out of her hand: This was about three in the morning.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you so long with this woman, and yet have no criminal conversation? - I know nothing more then I tell you.</p>
               <p>But you was in liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>What could you have been doing for four or five hours? - That is all that I know about it.</p>
               <p>You had more than one pint? - We had two pints at the first house, and one more at the other.</p>
               <p>Was you in a private room with her at Oxford-market? - No, in a public room.</p>
               <p>Was any other company there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What public house, was it in Oxford-market? - I cannot tell that.</p>
               <p>Which way did you go up the market? - We turned to the right from Oxford-road.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you make no resistance? - All that laid in my power, but I could not get the money, I called the watchman, and he came to my assistance, he took her up and shook her, and one guinea dropped out of her bosom, and another guinea was found in her pocket, and my handkerchief; the rest and the bag was never found; a woman came on her side.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Is there any truth in all this? - No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever give her this purse of yours? - I told her I was going to Smithfield, I never took my purse out, I was as sober as I am this minute.</p>
               <p>You are sure you never went up stairs? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you never kiss her all these five hours? - I never touched her only setting by her.</p>

               <p>Court. What kind of character has the Royal Oak? - There is a parcel of loose women there, the prosecutor said, the prisoner had pulled him in, and taken the handkerchief off his neck, and robbed him of almost 70 l. I took her, shook her, and one guinea dropped from her, and the other guinea I took out of her pocket, she was stretched down; the man was over her, I would not let her go at all; I would not believe he had so much money in his pocket, and he pulled out ten guineas and a 50 l.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178306040073"></xptr> bank note out of his pocket; (The prosecutor deposes to the handkerchief, there was no person near me all the night but this girl.)</p>

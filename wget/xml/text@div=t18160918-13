            . I am the daughter of the last witness. On the 22nd of July last, I quitted my father's house; my mother was gone out before me. I was the only person left at home. A little boy brought a message to me that I was to go and meet my mother at Shoreditch Church at three o'clock; I did not know the boy.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went did you fasten the doors and windows - A. Yes; I locked the door, and I am sure that the doors and windows were fast when I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. On looking about you before you went out, was all your father's furniture and all your mother's wearing apparel safe in the house - A. Yes. I met my mother in the Kingsland-road; she had been to Town; she came by Shoreditch; she came home with me; she is very ill. I returned with her about seven o'clock. I went out before three; I left nobody in the house. On my return, I found one of the panes of glass cut out; that was where the latch opens. Any person who put his hand in through that part might open the hasp.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that the window was entire as to all its parts before you went away - A. There was one of the bottoms out before I went away; but nobody however, by putting their hands through that, could open the window; I am sure none was out near the hasp. I took notice of the things before I went out, and when I returned. I missed two bed-furnitures, three gowns, four shirts, two frocks, a coral necklace, and other things mentioned in the indictment, together with a purse and three half-crowns, and a few two-penny and three-penny silver pieces; no other money that I am aware of. I saw some of these things on the following Saturday week; I saw them at the magistrates. That is all I know about it.</p>
               <p>EBENEZER DALTON. I am a police officer of Whitechapel. I know Shorthand; I never knew him until I apprehended him; I went to a place that I understood was his lodging, on the 23rd of July last; it was at 28, Harbour-street; Griffths and Cpombs were with me, they are two officers. When we went to the house Griffths and I went up; I had received information about half an hour before that, that such things were deposited in the prisoners apartment, and supposed to be stolen. I went into that apartment; I did not see the prisoners at first. While we were searching the room, the female prisoner came home; as soon as she saw us, she ran down stairs directly; I hallooed out to Coombs to stop her, and I ran down, and brought her up again where Griffiths was. I searched her, and down her bosom I found these beads. I got some information from her. In consequence of that, I went into the Minories, and there I found Shortland smoaking a pipe. I asked him what his name was; and he said, Smith. I asked him where he lived; he said, he lived in Fashion-street, Spittalfields. I told him he must go along with me, and he came with me, and when I got him to No. 28, in this street, I said. I think you live here instead of Fashion-street; I took him in to the lower room. I searched him, and look the watch out of his pocket; I have had that watch over since.</p>

            . I was in this lodging. I know no more than receiving the information from the woman. I don't remember the man saying that he had only lodged there one night; Hill said that she had lodged there more nights than one. As soon as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181609180030"></xptr>we went up stairs, I found this property tied up under the bedstead. While I was there looking round the room, the female prisoner came on the stairs, but not quite into the room. When she saw me, she ran down immediately; we called out to stop her below, she was stopt by Coombs; she was searched by Dalton, and that necklace was taken from her bossom. While I was searching her box, she flew down stairs the second time; Dalton went down stairs after her, and brought her back up stairs, and I searched her box, and in different parts of the room I found all the property which is here.</p>

            . I keep the house in which this property was found; I look at the prisoner Hill; she took the room on the Thursday; she said, she should not sleep there that night and on the Friday Shortland and she came together, and they brought a box; they did not sleep there that night, nor on the Saturday night. The young woman slept there on the Saturday night, and on the Sunday night; Shortland came about eleven. Shortland went out about five o'clock in the morning, and came home to breakfast, and after that they both went out together within a minute or two. In the evening Hill brought in the two bundles just in the dark, and she said, she was tired, and I helped her up.</p>
               <p>Shortland's Defence. I was at work with a gentleman at the time of the robbery, and went for a pair of lasts.</p>
               <p>Hill's Defence. These things were given to me in a bundle in Brick-lane by a girl of the name of Ann Smith, and she asked me to take them into my room.</p>

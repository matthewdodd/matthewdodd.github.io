                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On Monday, 7th September, I searched the prisoner's lodgings, 32, New Union Street, Little Moorfields—he occupied the second floor—the landlady, Mrs. Hodges, was there the whole of the time—I found a number of sword bayonets, gun barrels and ramrods, under the bed, wrapped up in canvas, rolled up tightly—but neither stitched nor tied—they are all here—there were seven bayonets—six or seven barrels, and seven ramrods and muzzle stoppers—I found a long Enfield barrel, and some daggers, under the seat of the sofalin' the front room, and under the bolster of the bed I found a sword—I took them all down to the Moor Lane Station, and on the following day the prisoner was taken there by two other officers—I told him I had found these things in his place, and unless he could satisfy me how he became possessed of them,</p>

               <p>he would have to be detained—he said he had been a soldier all his life, and had been in the Garibaldian army, and that they were trophies he had saved—they were all produced before him—he said the sword was presented to him while in the Garibaldian army—I also told him that I had received some ammunition from Messrs. Vyse, of Wood Street, that is where his wife works—he asked to look at it—I then asked him what he wanted with such a quantity of fire-arms and ammunition; he said he kept them for his own amusement—he was asked some other question by the Inspector, and said, he had been a soldier all his life, and a revolutionist, and he hoped he should die as one—I found a small rosette, but I have not got it here—I. found no rifle stocks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief armourer at the Tower of London—we issue arms to the volunteer corps from there—the arms have the name of the corps upon them, and numbered, if ordered—I have examined all these arms carefully, and with the exception of the long Enfield barrel, they all belong to the 28th Middlesex—I am enabled to say that by the marks upon them—they are numbered 555, 867, 903, 223, 63, 201, 64, 84, 228—they also have got a Government mark.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you any memorandum when these rifles were given out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, a man named Hunt would issue them—he is not here—each of the sword bayonets described bear a distinct mark—the rifle is marked upon the plate, and the number of the corps; and also upon the rammer—there is a mark on the bayonet by which we can tell whether it belongs to the barrel—taking up a single rifle-barrel I cannot say, of my own knowledge, that it was issued to any particular corps—no other person can.</p>

                  </hi>. I am sergeant-instructor of musketry to the 28th Middlesex—it is the practice of the volunteers of that regiment to keep their rifles at their lodgings—on reference to this book I find that the man who had rifle No. 84, was a person named O'Brien—the entry was initialed by me—the books are kept jointly by two of us, and sometimes the entries are in my writing, and sometimes not—O'Brien is still on the books of the corps—speaking from memory, I should say he had not attended drill for eighteen months—at the end of last year I made inquiries for him at his lodgings, but could not find him—we have the address of every member—I know O'Brien has not resigned—the man who had rifle No. 555 was Edward Haydon—the entry in this book was initialed by me when the rifle was issued, on 20th May, 1867—he last attended drill some time last year—he has not returned his rifle—it is the duty of every man to bring back his rifle when he resigns—I cannot find out anything about him—rifle No. 201 was issued to a man named John Madden—he attended drill last some time last year—he has not returned his rifle—I cannot tell what has become of him—rifle No. 903 was issued to a man named Kennedy; he last attended drill some time last year—he has not returned his rifle, and I do not know what has become of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How many men have you in this corps? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Pretty near 1000—I cannot tell the last time every man came to drill, without reference to the book—the book is not here—I have memoranda extracted from the book, which I thought would do as well—it was an oversight my not bringing the book—all the men I have named are on the strength of the corps now.</p>

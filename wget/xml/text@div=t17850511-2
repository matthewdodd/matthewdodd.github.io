               <p>I am a silversmith, in King's-street, Westminster; I know the prisoner very well, he applied to me to dispose of some property on the 4th of April, it was a gold watch chain, this is what I bought of him, at the rate of three pounds ten shilling an ounce, I believe it came to near three pounds.</p>
               <p>Court. How much did you give him for it? - Above fifty shillings, he applied to me afterwards, on Wednesday the 6th with some gold and silver coins, and I suspected him, and I gave information to Mr. R. Abington, a Justice of peace, in King's-street, Westminster; he was apprehended in consequence of that information on Saturday the 9th, he was then I believe servant to Mr. Stanhope, he was apprehended in Tothill-street, at the sign of the Angel.</p>
               <p>Was any thing found upon him? - A key, a few halfpence, and a watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you know this man before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How long before? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Had he before brought any thing to sell at your shop? - Nothing of any consequence, I did not know he was in service at that time, he told me the chain was left him by his father.</p>

               <p>This chain is my property.</p>
               <p>When had you last seen it, Sir? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>How long had he been in your service? - About a fortnight, this chain lay in a little box, made on purpose to hold various things of that sort, in a recess within my bureau in the upper drawer in my dressing room.</p>
               <p>Who had the key? - I had the key, which he said, he took once, I can swear to this chain by a very particular mark, it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178505110006"></xptr> was a watch-chain of my wife's, and I made it for myself, it is much shorter than any other of the kind, I have no doubt of its being mine, it is gold.</p>
               <p>Was your bureau kept constantly locked? - Generally, I did not miss this chain till it was brought to me.</p>
               <p>Can you say whether you had seen this chain after he came into your service? - I believe I have seen it in that place where it lay, but had not taken it out.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow, Prisoner's Council. Had not you a good character with this man, Sir? - An extraordinary good one, better than I ever had before, from a Mr. Moore, whom I believe to be a very respectable gentleman, though I do not know him.</p>

               <p>How do you know they were his lodgings? - His wife was in the room, and some of the things were found upon her, which Mr. Stanhope owned afterwards; and these things were in a chest in the room, and when the prisoner came home I found the key in his pocket which opened it, I unlocked the chest with the key, this was on the 9th at night; I suppose we had been three quarters of an hour in the house, before the prisoner came home. (Three gold snuff boxes, and a gold dish deposed to.) These things lay on a bureau in the room, but not in the bureau, these watches were all found in his chest, and all going. (A case of instruments deposed to.) I took the prisoner into custody he signed a confession.</p>

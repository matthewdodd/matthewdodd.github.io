            . I produce a certificate, which is from the church of St. Peter's, at Cork; I received it from the hands of John Forsyth, the minister; I compared the names and dates with the register - it is a true copy; that enables me to swear that the names and dates are the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. P. ALLEY. Q. Where do you live? A. At Greenwich. I went from England to Cork to get the copy of the register; I did not know any one at Cork, nor the minister; I went to St. Peter's, and got this from the parson at the church, and then I brought it here; I swear I took the book, and compared the hand-writing - the signature, and that also: the parson was a very old man; I mean to say I had my hand on the book while I read it - the parson did not read it to me.</p>
               <p>The certificate was read, the purport of which was that Thomas Riorden was married to Catherine Roberts on the 9th of October, 1799, at St. Peter's Church, Cork, according to the ceremonies of the Established Church of the United Kingdom.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS objected that there was a variation in the the date of the marriage according to the certificate, and the year of the King's reign set out in the indictment.

            . My name before marriage was Ellen Roberts. In the year 1799, the latter part of it, I was living in Cork; I was there, I believe, on the 9th of October - I had a sister named Catherine; I was married then. I know the prisoner - he was then living at Cork, as a carpenter; my sister was married twenty-nine years ago - it was in the month stated; I remember the day of the month - I went with them to the church door, and then returned to help my mother to prepare the wedding dinner - they returned in about three quarters of an hour; my sister went by the name of Catherine Roberts, and after marriage by the name of Catherine Riordan; they lived in my father's house, as man and wife; I heard Riordan say after the marriage, that Mr. Forsyth married them; they lived at my father's for four months, as man and wife; they then lived a short distance off: my father and mother are both dead. In about four months he left my sister in a state of pregnancy, without any notice. Five years ago I came over to England, and saw the prisoner; I had never before seen him since he left - an arrangement was come to; he said he would settle a house on my sister Catherine, and told me he would come to Greenwich on the Sunday following, to settle; he came on the Saturday evening, but so drunk that no business could be done. - About a month after that I met him on Blackfriars-bridge - he gave me 1l., and said that he would allow my sister 2s. 6d. per week - he continued to do so for about two years and a half, and I sent it to my sister at Cork. During this transaction he sometimes called my sister Kitty, and sometimes his wife. At the end of two years and a half, he said he could not live longer with his second wife, and if I would send for her over, he would either take her home, or set her up in business; he gave me 4l. to send over to bring her over; he had three children by his second wife: my sister is still living - my sister did not then come over; she came over last June or July; she was ill at the time the money was given - that was about two years(when she came over) after the money was given. The child by the first wife is dead. When my sister came over my husband wrote, and the prisoner came down to Greenwich he saw her, and said he would put her into business, but she objected to a school, as being too sedentary for her- he slept at my house that night; he said he was living in Exmouth-street, but he did not come down again. I next saw him in Exmouth-street; he was living with a young woman there, and had two children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This was in 1799? A. Yes; I do not know that he was apprenticed to his father; my sister is about fifty-six years old - she was then about twenty-seven: I had lived in Cork all my life - I never saw his father; I have heard since that he was an apprentice to his father: I did not then know that he was more than seventeen - I know he was then more than twenty. I remained in Cork all my life; until about five years ago- my sister was Protestant; he was a Catholic - I had heard him say so - I left her in Ireland.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not keep a house herself before her marriage? A. She did; in Cold-lane - she kept it about six years; she was not keeping that house when she was married - she was living with my father. I have lately been on good terms with the prisoner; my husband did borrow a little money of him, and he paid it - it was lent before this charge was made, and it was paid before; I swear that my husband is not in debt to him - he would do nothing for her; I did not know the second wife until lately - I heard of it five years ago; we did not wish to make any charge if he would have provided for my sister.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you brought the charge against him at all? A. No. I only know that he is a Catholic by what he said.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS took an objection to this certificate, on the same ground as the former one: there was a variance in the date of the certificate, and the year stated in the indictment.</p>
               <p>ANN BARTON. I live at No. 6, Bedford-court, New North-street, Red Lion-square.

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182802210124"></xptr>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How old are the children now living? A. One seventeen, another fifteen and the girl eight years; the boy who is seventeen is bound to his father - the other is bound to Mr. Brown of Exmouth-street, tailor; the girl her father took care of - the children were taken care of at both our expence; one he apprenticed to himself - I cannot say who paid the apprentice fee with the other. When I left him, I did not take about 200l. in cash - he is very false if he says so; I only took my clothes and a few books - he made me an allowance for about two years, but it was not paid - he was about twenty-two years old when he married me.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister, I was living with my father when my brother was said to he married; my brother lived with him also; when they were married he was apprentice to my father - he was about eighteen years of age; my father never gave his consent - indeed neither my father nor mother knew anything about it - he did not sleep one night out of my father's house before the date of the certificate (the certificate of the first marriage.)</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you know of the marriage? A. No: I read in the newspapers the date of the certificate; it was in 1799 - he slept at my father and mother's house three months after he was said to be married.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was he born? A. I believe in 1781. I was born in 1778; I did not know Robert's family - she lived in Cold-lane herself; I did not know her father and mother: I have heard my brother speak of her, but I never heard him say that he was married to her: it was reported, but there was no certainty of it - my father never asked him about it: he sent her away that he might not have anything more to do with her.</p>
               <p>Mr. P. ALLEY submitted that there was an end to the case, the witnesses on the other side had only made the prisoner twenty years old. - Mr. BODKIN suggested that the 26 Geo. II. did not extend to Ireland.</p>

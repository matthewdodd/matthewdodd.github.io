                  </hi>. I keep a pie shop at 208, Strand—on Monday, 8th June, about 10 at night, Riley came and asked for three twopenny pies, he gave me a half-crown which was soft, and I broke it with my teeth and told him it was bad—he said that he did not know it—I returned him the pieces and he went out leaving the pies behind—he came again next morning between 10 and 11, asked for a twopenny pie, and put down a bad shilling—I told him it was bad and that he was there last night—I kept the shilling and he went away—about 4 o'clock that afternoon Sheridan came for a penny mince pie, he gave me a shilling—I broke it, it was soft—I told him it was bad—he said that he did not know it, and asked for it back again—I gave him the pieces and he left—I called Everton's attention to him, and shortly afterwards the two prisoners were brought back—I gave the constable the shilling uttered to me by Riley.</p>

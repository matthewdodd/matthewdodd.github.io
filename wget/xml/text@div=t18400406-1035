                  </hi>. I am in the employ of William John Hall and an<lb></lb>other, wharfingers, at the Custom-house Quay, Thames-street. On the 25th of March, between three and four o'clock, I was in Fore-street with a wagon—I went to a house at the corner of Whitecross-street, and inquired for Mr. Piggott, and was directed two doors round the corner—as I came from the house I saw the prisoner with his feet on the box of the wheel of the wagon, and his hands on the wagon—he had a hook in his hand, which he struck into a bale of goods, and pulled it off the wagon—the bale, being</p>

On the 25th of March, I was standing at my shop door, and saw the prisoner follow the wagon on the off side, and after it turned round by Cripplegate church, he put his foot on the wheel, laid hold of the raft of the wagon, polled himself up on the wheel, and pulled the bale off, it fell off, and I saw him put the hook in his pocket—he stood alongside the bale, the carman went up and spoke to him, he struck him in the mouth, and ran away, but he caught him by my shop-door.</p>

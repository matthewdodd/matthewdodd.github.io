I produce four spoons, claimed by Mr. Pratt, they were pledged on the 5th of December; I am sure the prisoner pledged them; I advanced eight shillings upon them. She came again on the 7th, and said, she had lost the ticket; I gave her the form of an affidavit; she went to Hatton Garden office, got the affidavit signed, she came back, and sold the spoons out, and out I gave her eleven shillings for them. On the 15th of December, these spoons were claimed by Mr. Pratt. I produce them.</p>

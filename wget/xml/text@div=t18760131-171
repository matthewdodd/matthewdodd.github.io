               <p>about 6.30 leaving him sitting by the fire-side—the prisoner was not there—I was gone about ten minutes, and when I returned he was sitting on the stairs outside the door bleeding very much from his head—the prisoner was there then, and in her presence he said "Jane it is your hammer that she has struck me with"—she said "I never struck him, he struck me first"—he said "I did not"—a policeman was there, and we all went to the station, and the prisoner was charged—my husband came home he was taken to the infirmary, and died on the 20th—we had three hammers in the house—I am sure of that.</p>

I am the wife of John Rawlinson of 4, Bell Court—we live in the next room to where the deceased lived—on 13th January about 7.30 I heard—wraugling in their room, and heard Mr. Fyans call out "Murder! police!"—shortly afterwards I heard a voice say very faintly "All right, let me go;" everything was quiet after that—about five or six minutes after that I went into the room, and saw the prisoner lying on the bed cross-ways, and the deceased on top of her with his knees on her stomach holding her by the throat—I got him away, and she then got off the bed—I held her by the wrist, and she went across to the window.—she got away from me, and gave him deliberately a clout on the head, and knocked him down by two blows—he fell on the old bricks which imitated the fender—I did not see anything in her hand though I held her by her wrists—ho got up with my help bleeding very much from his head——she came a second time to strike him another blow, and the table was over<lb></lb>turned, and the light went out directly—that second blow knocked him down—I sent a child for a constable—the prisoner was bleeding from her face very much when I went into my room—she was speaking about some money on the landing outside my room door, but my husband would not allow me to go out—I cannot tell how the wound on her forehead was caused.</p>

I live at 4, Bell Court, below Mr. and Mrs. Fyans—about 7.30 o'clock on this night the deceased burst my door in—his forehead was bleeding very much—as he stood facing the door, the prisoner, who was facing my door in the passage, throw something at him, but what it was I cannot say for I could not find it; it hit him and he said "Oh, I am a murdered man"—I am sure there was something, and it went towards the fireplace—I looked at the time and could not find it—he said "Don't turn me out, I am a murdered man"—the prisoner heard that, she was standing at my door.</p>

               <p>paralysed on the opposite side—the wound was rather on the right side and he was paralysed on the left—that is the ordinary course—the other wounds were comparatively trifling—he became worse, and died on the 20th—I afterwards made <hi rend="italic">a, post-mortem</hi> examination and found on the top of the head a piece of bone about the size of a sixpence driven into the brain—it was quite detached—the scalp was divided and the bone was fractured and driven into the brain—there was extravasation of blood, caused by the fracture, on the surface of the brain which was the cause of death—the wound must have been inflicted by a blunt instrument—a hammer would be a very likely instrument to do it—it was a round wound—it is impossible from its position and depth that it could be caused by' a fall, but the wound at the back of the head might be—the fracture was in three pieces—the inner part is more brittle than the outer part, and it was sticking into the brain—the <hi rend="italic">durer mater</hi> was ruptured—there was <hi rend="italic">pus</hi> round the wound and at the front part of the brain as well, that was the result of inflammation—it must have been caused by a heavy blunt in<lb></lb>strument like a hammer.</p>

I got away from him with the help of the woman next room and then 7 ran at him and struck him twice with my fist, I knocked his head against the bricks and against the iron bedstead.

                  </hi>. I am a widow. In 1853, I lived at St. John's place, Blackheath—in Jan. in that year, I let the house to Mr. Samuel John Hallum, reserving to myself one of the rooms in the house, and in that I kept about twenty boxes—I locked that room, and took away the key with me—in the ensuing Oct. I went to the house, and went to the room where I had left my boxes—I had left some of them locked, and some un<lb></lb>locked—I opened some, and missed several things out of the locked boxes—I should think they had been opened by false keys—some of the boxed I had left locked were open, and some were not—I missed some dresses and stock<lb></lb>ings,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185507020055"></xptr>
               <p>and a number of cuffs—I made inquiries, and spoke to Mr. Hallum—one of the female prisoners was then residing there—I was unable to obtain any information as to how the property had gone—in June, last year, I went again—I missed some Indian articles, and some other things out of a deal box, which I had fastened with tacks—the lid had been raised up; I rang the bell, and Cecilia Collins came—I asked for Miss Hallum—I showed Cecilia Collins the box which had been emptied out; I asked her if the had ever seen anybody go into the room—she said she had not—the Indian articles were of great value—I do not remember whether Cecilia said anything—I think she said, "It might have been your cook, whom you left in the house"—I had left my cook there, not as my servant, she was hired by Mr. Hallum—I saw her there when I was there in Oct.—I do not know at what period she left Mr. Hallum—I made inquiry about my property, but could not find where it had been conveyed to—the next visit I paid there was in Feb., 1855, when I retook possession of my house, the two yean having expired—I arrived about 2 o'clock—Mr. Hallum's family did not leave till the evening—I saw both Cecilia and Catharine Collins there; I saw them both there during Mr. Hallum's term—I examined my room shortly afterwards—I had locked the room when I visited it on the last occasion, and taken away the key—when I unlocked it, I found every one of my boxes had been opened, except one, on which was a padlock—out of that box some things had been taken before I put on the padlock—(a great <hi rend="italic">number of articles were here produced</hi>)—I left this property in the room in question when I let the house to Mr. Hallum—I know the whole of tibia property to be mine—it was left in the room, some in boxes, and some about the room—these carpets were not in boxes—in the course. of last month, I went down to Mickfield, in Suffolk; I went to a house, accom<lb></lb>panied by the constable—I there saw a part of this property which is not lying before me—I saw the prisoner, John Collins, there, but not in the house.</p>

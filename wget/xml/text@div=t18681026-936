                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Robert Holdsworth Carew Hunt, and another, who carry on business under the name of Joseph Barber &amp; Co., at Brewer's Quay, as wharfingers—up to 28th September, Thomas Henry Bennett was in their employ as book-keeper—it was part of his duty, occa<lb></lb>sionally, to collect money, and he ought to hand it over to the cashier, and I should see it passed into the cash book—supposing he got a cheque in the name of Barber &amp; Co., it was not any part of his duty to sign it—on 28th September, I found out something, and spoke to him about it, and in the evening he left, and did not return—he was told to come next morning—his salary was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—his father has been with us nearly forty years, and is a very respectable man—in July, previously, we had discovered a loss, and I spoke to the prisoner about it, but in consequence of his father having been with us so many years, we allowed him to go on—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I received in the forenoon of 2nd October—it is from the prisoner John—he was in our employment about eight years ago—he knew our mode of doing business, and was down at our place almost every day, on business—the Foreign Vineyard Association, trade a great deal through our firm, and John was their dock clerk—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was dated 2nd October</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">from John Bennett to Messrs. Barbery and stated that his brother had gone when they could not touch him, and that he, John, would call on them</hi>)—John called on the afternoon of the 3rd—Mr. Hunt refused to see him, and told me I had better see him, which I did, in the presence of Mr. Hunt, junior—he said, his intention was to have come to arrange about our loss, but when he found it was so great, he said he would have nothing to do with it—when he wrote that letter, the loss was 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I discovered 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. since—I had disco<lb></lb>vered at that time that two cheques drawn upon Faulkner, Dear &amp; Co., had been paid in to John's account—they were payable to Messrs. Barber &amp; Co.—I produced the two cheques, and said, "These have been paid into your account at your bank, and surely you must know something about them"—he said, "I could not know, because Tom paid them in, as the credit-slip will show"—and he produced the credit-slip, which is in Thomas's writing—he said, "Of course, you will see I can know nothing about it"—I said, "Have you had any cheques of Barber's in your hands, besides these?"—he was very indignant, and asked me if I thought he was a thief; and said he had not—I asked him where his brother was—he said, "I know, but through his wife, and I shall not tell you where he is; but he is where you cannot touch him"—I told him he could not have any objec<lb></lb>tion to tell us if we could not touch him, but he would not—I asked him if he had any money—he said, "He was not such a fool to go away without money; he had plenty"—I asked him in whose name the bill of sale was on Thomas Henry's furniture—he said, "I know, through his wife, but I cannot tell you"—I said, "There will be no objection to your telling me,"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186810260075"></xptr>
               <p>but he still refused—he afterwards said he would let me know in whose hinds it was on the following morning—this diary (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is in John Bennett's writing—my attention has been called to the entries respecting this matter; they are in his writing—this letter, marked "B," is John's, and this letter, marked "C," is Thomas Henry's—this letter, marked "E," is John's—this promissory note for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is not marked; the body of it is in John Bennett's writing, and the signature is Thomas Henry Bennett's—the endorsement on this cheque for 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is drawn to order, is not genuine; it is Thomas Henry's writing—the counterfoil of the cheque, dated 29th September, for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., is, I should say, in John's writing—it is payable to Thomas Bennett or order—we cannot tell what the total amount of our loss is—at present we have found out nearly 700<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I believe it is consider<lb></lb>ably over that.</p>

                  </hi>.

Q.</hi> Have you known John Bennett some time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About light years—I know some of his family, and have been at his house—he occupies a large house, what I should call a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. house—he makes tome considerable income by letting it in lodgings—his wife makes all the expenses of the house and something over—during the eight years I have known him, his character has been most excellent—he has been an upright and honest man—he sold wine, on commission, to a large extent—I should say he made 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year by that.</p>

               <p>FREDERICK ARIS DOWLEY. I live at Sidbury, in Devonshire - I live on my income. On the 2d of November I was passing up Goswell-street, towards Islington, about six o'clock in the afternoon - the gas-lamps were lighted. I had three ladies in my company - two were walking some distance behind, and one had my left arm - my watch was in my fob; when I came within two or three yards of <placeName id="t18271206-49-crimeloc245">Bell-alley</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18271206-49-crimeloc245" type="placeName" value="Bell-alley"></interp>

I immediately pursued after him, and just at the entrance of the alley; several persons surrounded me, and attempted to stop my progress - he ran down the alley. I cleared my way, and ran after him, calling Stop thief! - he had got some yards before I got up to him; there is a thoroughfare from the alley into Golden-lane; but he took a turning to the right, and then into Great Arthur-street. I had lost sight of him in turning the corner, but was certain the same object presented itself to me the moment I turned - it is impossible I could catch sight of any body in turning but the same person, and I say I am quite certain I never lost sight of him; when he got into Great Arthur-street, he fell - there was nobody near enough to him for me to mistake him. I made sure of taking him then, but just as I got up to him, I fell myself - he got up, and I got up and pursued; some of his companions were running behind me at the time, but I outrun them; he ran down Great Arthur-street, turned to the right, then inclined to the right again into what is called Pump-court. I lost sight of him in turning the corner there, and he ran into a house, just as I turned the corner of that court; a voice or two cried out "He is gone into this house." I went into the passage, and a man, apparently a blacksmith, came out and said, "Shall we go up." I said Yes; a woman put her head over the bannisters, and said "There is nobody here that don't belong to the house - I insist upon it you don't search my house without a warrant." I then staid down stairs, and shortly after a man came in and went up stairs - that was not the prisoner; in a short time two persons came down together - I was then watching just outside. I instantly seized the prisoner, who was one of them, and said "This is the villain who has robbed me." I have no doubt whatever of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the person who offered you his assistance at hand then? A. I do not know - there was a great crowd; the people immediately cried out "That is not him, he belongs to the house; the man who has robbed you has gone round the corner;" they immediately got round and hustled me. I loosed my hold of the prisoner, and he disappeared. I saw him in Clerkenwell prison in about a week. I had returned to Devonshire, and come back again. I was certain he was the man, and have been certain of him from the robbery to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. Setting aside the question, whether he had robbed,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182712060049"></xptr>can you be certain he is the man whom you seized coming out of the house? A. I have no doubt of it, and am certain he is the man who robbed me. I had a full opportunity of examining his face. I have not found my property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were the ladies friends of yours? A. They were; I have not brought them here. I cannot say whether the one who had my arm saw the man who made the snatch - she lives in St. Martin's-le-grand. I was a little alarmed. I let her arm loose, when I pursued the prisoner. I cried out, "I am robbed," or something of that kind; the other persons attacked me after I was robbed. I only lost sight of the prisoner for the instant, as he turned two corners, until he went into the house; my brother has not interfered in the business. It might be nine or ten days after that I went to Clerkenwell; the prisoner was not pointed out to me - there were thirty or forty prisoners; he was not at all distinguished from the rest. I pointed him out immediately - there was no light in the alley.</p>

            . I am a special constable of St. Luke's. I heard of this robbery, about two days afterwards - I made inquiry in Goswell-street, and was directed to a person named Buckle, in Arthur-street, from information - I afterwards saw Mrs. Buckle, the landlady of a house in Arthur-street, and about a week afterwards, I and Harrison went to a house in Gravel-walk, Blue Anchor-alley, and found the prisoner in bed with a young woman - I went to search his clothes; Harrison, said, "Billy, I want you;" the prisoner said, "What for?" Harrison told him for a bundle taken in Chiswell-street; he jumped up out of bed, and said, "I know that is a lie - I know what you want me for, it is for a robbery in Goswell-street, for the watchman told me the officers were looking after me;" we then said it was for that; we sent for Buckle; he brought a lad to the watch-house, who said he was the man.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live with my mother, at No. 3, Great Arthur-street, Goswell-street. I work for Joseph Emms, who is journeyman to Mr. Townsend, a paper-stainer. I was sitting at tea with my mother, between six and seven o'clock, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went to the door, and saw some persons running down Arthur-street - I first of all saw the prisoner being chased - Mr. Dowley was next to him, close behind him, and others were running behind him - I am quite sure of the prisoner - I knw him well before; he ran into a house, at the entrance of Pump-court; the door is under an archway - I believe Mr. Baxter keeps the house; three or four people live in it; Baxter is one; Mr. Dowley went under the archway, and lost sight of him - I said, "He is gone up here," and showed him the house; he went just inside the threshold - I afterwards saw the prisoner come out with another man - Mr. Dowley seized him, and said, "This is the man who has robbed me;" two or three men rushed in between them; Dowley lost his hold, and the prisoner got away - I saw him again on the morning of the Tuesday week afterwards - I knew his name before, and told the officers who it was, and told Mr. Buckle - I saw him when he was taken up, at the watch-house, and cannot be mistaken in him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What part of the house were you sitting in? A. The ground floor, in the shop - I was not acquainted with him, only he used to work at Coach-makers' Hall once - I had not spoken to him for five years, but had very often seen him about - I sleep at my mother's every night - I was never in a Court of Justice before.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old, and live with my parents in Great Arthur-street. I work with my father, who is a gas-fitter - I live almost facing Pearle - I was having my tea, and heard a cry of Stop thief! I went to the door, and saw the prisoner in Great Arthur-street, running towards our house - I am certain he is the man; the people were all behind him, running after him, and when he came facing the house I ran - I did not notice Mr. Dowley till the prisoner ran into the house - I then stopped Mr. Dowley, and told him he had run into the house (I believe Baxter lives in the house) - I did not see him run in, but I was not a yard from him, and he could not turn the corner; as I heard steps in the house I told Dowley he had run in there - Dowley waited just at the step of the door, and so did I; another man went into the house, and in two or three minutes the prisoner came out with that man - Dowley seized him, and said,"This is the villain who robbed me;" I believe some persons rushed between him and the prisoner - Dowley lost his hold, and the prisoner got away; he turned the corner, and ran towards Bridgewater-gardens - I saw him at Worship-street, about eleven days after, and am sure of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen the man here, who came out with the prisoner? A. No - I had never seen him before; there were a great many people about.</p>

On the day Mr. Dowley was robbed, the prisoner ran into our house - I heard a row in the passage, ran down stairs, and met him coming up; he did not live there - I never saw him in the house before; a short while after, another man in a long coat, who I thought looked like an officer, came up; he collared the prisoner, and said, "This is the man I want;" he went down stairs first, and the prisoner after him (I did not see that man's face); when he went down, he said to Mr. Dowley,"There is no man there" - I saw Mr. Dowley lay hold of the prisoner, and say, "This is the man;" a woman who stood there said, "That is not the man who robbed you; he is gone up the alley" - I should know that woman again; I have known the prisoner a long time, by seeing him about Golden-lane; he wanted to go into the one pair room, but the man who lives there, said, "You shan't come here;" the prisoner at that time was all over mud, as if he had been on the ground; the people rushed between him and Dowley, and he got away.</p>

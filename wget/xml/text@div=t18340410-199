            . I am beadle of Clerkenwell. Mary Ann Roberts was before the magistrate, but she is under age, and her mother was bound for her appearance - I produce these two certificates - I have examined them with the books - they state that "John Johnson of this parish and Mary Ann Harvey of this parish were married in this church by banns, on this 14th day of October, 1827," and that "John Johnson, bachelor, and Mary Ann Roberts, of the district rectory of All-Souls, in this parish, spinster, were married in this church, by banns, on the 15th day of September, 1833" - I know the prisoner by his having relief from our parish - his wife pointed him out as her husband.</p>

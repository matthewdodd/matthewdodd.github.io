                  </hi>. The prisoner was in my employ, at Enfield-highway, as a carter, for three of four months—on the 26th of July, I found about a bushel of oats in a sack, under a manger, in one of my stables—it was covered up and tied over very curiously, to be carried away, as I thought—I cut a few bits of paper, and put them in, that I might be sure of it—I then told the constable, and watched, and between eleven and twelve o'clock that night the prisoner went into the stable and fetched the sack out—he put it into his own stable, where his horses stood for a little while, and then he put it on a load of potatoes, which he was going to take to London—he then went back and fetched a bundle of tares form his loft, over his stable, and put them on his cart—he then tied up the sleeves and collar of his smock frock, and put a parcel of mixed corn in it, and put that on his cart, and then he took, besides that, his horses's allowance, his nose-bags, and his bottle-truss—he then turned his cart round and went on to London—I told the officer, who followed him and took him.</p>

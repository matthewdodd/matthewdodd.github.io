            . I am a hair-dresser, and live in Leadenhall-street; at past seven o'clock on Thursday morning, the 5th of April, I was going up the street, to dress a gentleman, and saw the prisoner Richard standing at Mrs. Cartwright's door; before I came up to him, I suspected him, and directly I came up to him, he stepped into the shop, and took a paper bag - the other prisoner was in the shop at the time; I turned round, and Richard kept turning round, and looking at me, quite agitated. At the time he took the bag Charles stood on the mat, within a yard of him - it could not have been done without his seeing him. I went into the shop immediately Richard was gone, and enquired of Charles what man that was who took the parcel out of the shop? He said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, There has nobody taken any thing, I have seen nobody." I said</p>
               <p>"There has, and I know the person." He said</p>
               <p>"There was a parcel on the counter, and it is gone - but I did not see any person take it." I told him I should return after I dressed a gentleman, and I would see to the bottom of it, as I had been often robbed myself. I told the servant - she went to fetch her mistress down. After I had been on my business, I returned to the shop, saw Mrs. Cartwright, and told her, in his hearing, what had been done - I told her to keep him, and I would return. I went again at half past ten o'clock, found Richard there, and said, he was the man.</p>

            . I am an officer; I apprehended Richard at his father's house, in Colchester-street, Whitechapel - he was in bed. I said I wanted him for stealing a bag of wafers that morning - he got up, and took me to a house in Lambert-street, Goodman's-fields - he went into the parlour, and asked for the bag he had left there that morning. The bag was produced, containing 5 lbs. of wafers.</p>

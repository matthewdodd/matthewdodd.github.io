               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> The smooth one is the one I gave on Friday. I was in Regent Circus and saw a traveller get off an omnibus with two parcels strapped together. I carried his parcels till four o'clock, and he gave me the smooth half-crown and a tea cake, and told me to meet him next morning. I then went to the prosecutor's shop and got some tobacco and changed the half-crown. On Friday morning I met the traveller in Regent Circus, and went with him. He gave me another half-crown and told me to meet him the next morning, but I could not, as I was locked up. I went to the prosecutor's shop for a half-ounce of tobacco, and gave him the half-crown. He showed it to a man in the shop, who pronounced it bad. Do you think if I knew that the half-crown I took there on Wednesday was bad I should have admitted being there on the Wednesday?</p>

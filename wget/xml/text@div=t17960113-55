I discovered four pounds of powder concealed under some paper, in a room where the prisoner works; in which room we never keep powder: on which, I suspected the prisoner had robbed me; in the evening when he came in from his work to go home, I called him, with the rest of the men, into the counting-house; and, on searching them, when I came to the prisoner, I discovered his breeches to look very bulky; without examining him, I took a coach, and took him to Bow-street; when we got there, in the front of his breeches, he had a paper of starch; one of the officers searched him, and, in the back part, he had eight pounds of powder, and, in his pockets, six pots of pomatum, which are my property; I marked the four pounds of powder that was in his room; one pound of them he had in his breeches, the whole of the four pounds was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you marked the pomatum? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed the pomatum? - A. No; he might have taken ten times as much without our missing it.</p>

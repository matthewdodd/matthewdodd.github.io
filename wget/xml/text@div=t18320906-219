               <p>Prisoner. Q. When I was taken you asked the witness what sort of a coat it was, and what did he reply? A. I asked him whether he saw the coat taken from the cab, with the grey horse - he said Yes; that it was a coat with three or four capes, and it has three - he said he saw you get up, take it up, and put it on, look round and then go off with it on your back.</p>

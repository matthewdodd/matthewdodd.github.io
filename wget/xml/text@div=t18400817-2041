                  </hi>. I am single, and live in High-street, Great Garden-street, Whitechapel—I did live in the same house with the prisoner. On the 9th of July, about twelve o'clock in the day, I went up into her room, with Maria Morris, and asked her for a box of clothes which she had of mine—she said I should not have them—she was lying on the bed at the time—the things were in the room, and I took them away, and took them down stairs to the next house—about half-an-hour after I came up again, but she was not at home—about half-past three or four o'clock I went up again, and asked her for an apron, which she had on, of mine—she refused to give it me, and I untied it—it fell off—Morris took it up, and ran down stairs with it—the prisoner took the poker and threw it after her—she then went to lie down on the bed again, and told me to go out of the room—I said I would not go out unless she gave me the things she had belonging to me—there were other things there belonging to me, which she had on at the time—she said she should not give them to me, she thought what I had had of her would very well pay me—I said, "Very well, I will go"—she said, "If you do not go out directly I will stab you"—she hit me, and I struck her again—she then took up a knife, and stabbed at my face—I put up my arm to defend my face, and my arm was cut from the wrist to the elbow—I went down stairs into the next passage, and there I fell down, and fainted away—I went to Mr. Little, a surgeon, in Leman-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I apprehended the prisoner about an hour after this happened—I saw the door was broken, as a great many more are in that court—it is a regular thing—the whole court is let out to unfortunate girls.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence, written.</hi>) "Six weeks ago, between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, Mary Ann Clewly, during my absence, broke open my door, and took out her box and clothes. She went away; she returned about half an hour afterwards, I had then got home, and was much sur<lb></lb>prised to find my door broke open. I had got an apron of her's on, which she came to fetch; I refused her to give it till she explained why she broke my door open, and took her things away, while I was out. She would not give me time to untie the apron, but tore it off, and gave it to a woman she bad brought with her, who took it and ran down stairs with it. She then struck me a violent blow on the eye, and severely scratched my face and tore my gown all to pieces. I did not return her blows, as she is a strong powerful woman. She then became calm, as I told her several times to go out of my room; my little boy came in and asked me for a piece of bread and butter, I took up the loaf and knife to cut him some, she turned round, as I thought, to go out of the room, instead of that she made an aim at me again. I held up my right arm to prevent the blow, and she struck her arm on the knife. I was so frightened I let the loaf and knife fall on the floor. She went down stairs then, I followed her down to see if she had hurt her arm much; when I found she had cut her arm I was ex<lb></lb>ceedingly sorry, as I only held up my arm to prevent her striking my face again. The Sunday prior to the quarrel, this woman, a total stranger to me, came and asked me to let her leave her box, and stay with me in the day-time, which I did, not knowing she was given to drink or of so vio<lb></lb>lent a temper. I was never accounted a bad temper or quarrelsome dispo<lb></lb>sition. This being my first offence, I trust you will be pleased to take my situation into consideration."</p>

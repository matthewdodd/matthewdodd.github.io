                  </hi> am cook to Mr. Richardson, of Belgrave-terrace, Hol<lb></lb>loway—I sleep in the top back room—I bad this work-box up there, but I left the key in it—on Saturday the 11th of May when I got up I had four sovereigns in it, and about two o'clock on Monday I missed one—I noticed some white paint on the lid of the box—some painters had been employed there on the Saturday—no one but the prisoner was employed in that room, I am sure of that—there were about five painters employed on the morning of Monday—I acquainted one of the servants and Cole—the prisoner came on the Monday and worked—he did not come on the Tuesday—on the Wednesday he came to work at the next house, which was empty—I was called into the next house, and found the prisoner with his hands tied behind him—Cole asked me what I charged him with—I said, "Taking a sovereign out of my box"—Cole said, "Are you not ashamed to rob this young woman of her money?"—he said, "I don't deny it"—Cole then said, "Give us some security for it, or give it up"—he said, "I can't give it up, I have not got it; I will work it out"—and then I went away.</p>

                  </hi>. I was employed at this house on the Saturday—the prisoner was employed there in painting the spout at the back, with white paint—none of the others were painting with white paint—on the Monday Bridges told me what had happened—on the Wednesday I took the prisoner at another house—I tied his hands behind him, a card be<lb></lb>fore him, and painted his face—I sent for the prosecutrix, and asked what she charged him with—he said he did not deny it—I told him if he did not give back the sovereign I would give him in charge—he said he could not give it up, he would stop and work it out—I had a brush of paint in my hand, and did what I was sorry for—I put it in his face, and tied him to the rails.</p>

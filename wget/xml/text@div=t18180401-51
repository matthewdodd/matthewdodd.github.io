On the 5th of March, about half-past four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our house, and presented this cheque (producing it). I examined it, and asked him for whom he received it? he said from Messrs. Smith and Co., distillers, at Bow or Bromley, I do not know which. Suspecting it to be forged, I took it to Mr. Toulmin, who is one of the partners. There was something in the body of the cheque, which induced me to think it was forged. Mr. Toulmin came forward, and asked the prisoner whom he wanted to receive it for? he said for Smith and Co. Mr. Toulmin said it was rather an odd thing that the cheque should not come through their bankers. The prisoner then said he had it from a person of the name of Thompson, who was clerk in Smith and Co.'s house. He said he got it at the Bird in Hand, public-house, at Bow. John Stephens, who is our porter, was desired to go with him in a coach to Bow. Mr. Fairlie keeps cash at our horse. The cheque is not his writing.</p>

I asked him for whom he received it? he said for Smith and Co. On my making some remarks about it, he hesitated, and said it was from a clerk of Smith and Co., distillers at Bow. I asked him where he received it? he said the clerk saw him passing as he was coming to London, and promised to give him 5l. for it.

            . In consequence of directions which I received from Mr. Toulmin, I went to Bow with the prisoner in a coach. When we left town the prisoner told the coachman to drive to the Bird in Hand at Bow. When we arrived there he pointed to the King's Arms, and said that was the house-(he had before said it was the Bird in Hand). I told him to look round, and see if the person who gave him the cheque was at the door - He said, No. We went into the parlour and tap-room, but could see no person there who answered his description. The prisoner said, it was a tall man, with a brown coat and black waistcoat. The landlord was asked in his presence, if any person of that description had been there that day? he said there had not. I took the prisoner into custody, and searched him in the parlour of the public-house, and found a bill-case on him, with an old bill in it, which I produce - I brought him to the banking-house. He asked to speak to one of the partners-Mr. Rowland Stephenson attended him. I was present-neither threats nor promises were used; he wished to speak to Mr. Stephenson privately. Mr. Stephenson told him he must say what he had to say now, as it was public enough, and asked him how he came to obtain the cheque which he had tendered in payment-if he had it from Fairlie, the supposed drawer? he said, No. He asked him if he had found it, or if any body had given it to him? he said, No. He asked him if he wrote any part of it? he said that he wrote the whole of it, through distress. I locked him up.</p>

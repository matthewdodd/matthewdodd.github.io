                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 94). In consequence of information I went to the prisoner's house in Fryer-street, on 25th January, about a little after seven o'clock—I saw him taken into custody by Hunt on another charge—just after he was taken away, a man came in with fourteen wooden pails—(searched the house, and in the back parlour, behind a chair, found this large milk-pail, with the small one in it.</p>

I</hi> have been told so—I was subpoenaed here—I was told the case was left for Mrs. Watkins, to go before the Grand Jury—we remained at the house four or five hours—we were not there till four o'clock in the morning—I believe we left at half-past twelve—three of us left together—we had a little beer together there—we were glad to get it, the house was in such a filthy state—we had no search-warrant—we had no spirits—the prisoner's wife sent for the beer, and she got beastly intoxicated—I cannot say whether Mary Ann Nicholli was examined at the police-office; she had charge of the prisoner's house.</p>

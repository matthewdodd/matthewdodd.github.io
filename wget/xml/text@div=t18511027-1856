                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Apollo public-house, Tottenham-court-road. On 6th Oct. the prisoner came about 8 o'clock at night—he asked for 1 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of rum; he drank it, and put down a coun<lb></lb>terfeit sixpence—I broke it up, gave it him back, I told him it was bad, and was no use—he said he had no more money except a penny-farthing; but after fumbling for some time, he found another halfpenny, and put the farthing back in his pocket—he left, and came back in about an hour, and asked for 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of gin—I told my wife and daughter—he tendered ano<lb></lb>ther counterfeit sixpence—I broke it up and threw it at him—I said he had been before with a bad sixpence—he said it was a b y lie—there were two men at the counter—they said, "Halloo, old fellow, you have made a mis<lb></lb>take this time; have you got any more of these?"—he said, "Yes; you shall have a dozen for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—they said they would give him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he swore he would not let them have them—he went out—I took my hat and followed him to the next house, the Marlborough Arms—I went in there, and saw a sixpence on the counter—I told the barman not to serve the prisoner, for he had passed a bad one at ray house—the prisoner was then given into custody, and I saw him drop two sixpences—the policeman or the potman picked them up.</p>

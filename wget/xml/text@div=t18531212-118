                  </hi>. I am a retired officer from the East India Company's service. I live at the Yorkshire Hotel—in June, 1852, I had two dogs in my possession; they were at Harlsdon-green, five miles from town—during my temporary absence I lost those dogs—on my return the prisoner introduced himself to me, and said he could and he would find them and return them to me, if I would give him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I parted with 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him on the faith of his restoring the dogs—I gave him four sovereigns in presence of an officer of the police—he went away with it—the officer followed him, but he gave him the slip, and got away—when I gave him the money I he said he would restore the dogs in ten minutes, or a quarter of I an hour.</p>

I am superintendent of police at the East and West India Docks In June, 1852, I was inspector of police—the last witness made a communication to; I went to a cigar shop—the prisoner and another man came in—the prisoner said that if Mr. Nether wood would I give him 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., he could recover his dogs—Captain Nether wood put down four sovereigns, and I believe the prisoner took it up, and went out—I followed him, but he escaped my vigilance.</p>

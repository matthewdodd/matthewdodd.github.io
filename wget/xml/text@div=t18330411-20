On the night of the 1st of March I went round the lower part of the house, and it was all fast - the front and back doors were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183304110015"></xptr>locked and bolted - the front and back parlour windows were fastened; the kitchen window was shut, but not fastened - it is a hanging sash, and opens in and out; I saw that it was shut when I went to bed - I was the last person up; my mother and father have part of the house; my husband's father came down first in the morning - he is not here; I came down after my husband, about a quarter after six, and found the house as my husband has described; a desk was taken from the sideboard, and the contents taken out and strewed about the floor - the drawer was taken from the table and laid on the floor, and four pocket-handkerchiefs taken from that drawer, and four pairs of gloves, two linen aprons, a pair of shoes belonging to myself, which had been worn, and two pairs of shoes belonging to my husband; the house had been entered by the back kitchen window - a mug and several other things which had been placed there were removed, and laid on the floor - I had left the mug on the windowledge, and other things, as usual, when I went to bed; the window was shut as when I left it - my father had found the street door open, and the back door also; I lost two shirts of my husband's, and one night-gown, which the Policeman brought to our house on Saturday morning, with other things; I knew nothing of either of the prisoners before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.How far do you live from Mill-wall? A.About three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>EDWARD WILLIAM WIGGINS. I am a pawnbroker, and live at No. 80, Broad-street, Ratcliff-cross. I have two shirts, a bed-gown, and pin-cloth, which I took in pawn from the prisoner in the name of White, on Saturday morning, the 2nd of March, between eleven and twelve o'clock - she said they belonged to herself; I live about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know her before? A. Yes, for four years - she often pawned at another shop where I had lived, but not at this shop; she then pledged in the name of Myddleton - I did not recollect her, not having served her for a considerable time; grown people generally say things are their own.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she ever before pledge in any name but Myddleton? A. No, I have left the shop she used to pledge at fifteen months.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I searched Myddleton at her house, on the 2nd of March, about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, and found two pairs of shoes and one pair of boots in her pocket, and a shirt in her hand; she said the shirt belonged to her husband and the shoes to her daughter; I found the table-cloth in the house, that belonged to Reeve's mother - Myddleton rented the house, and Martin lodged there, and slept in the next room to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.This was at Mill-wall? A. Yes; I understand she has a husband who is employed by Mr. Fuller, a builder; she knew Martin was in custody when I took her; the house has been a lodging-house for seamen, but Martin was the only lodger at that time.</p>
               <p>MRS. REEVE. These shoes are mine; I had seen them the night before the robbery, under the table by the window; the night-gown is mine - I know it by a mark on it; I had seen it the night before - it was taken from the back of a chair; this shirt is my husband's, and was there the night before, and another shirt also.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Martin lived four years and a half with me - he was absent about four months, and then returned; he gave me the things to pawn for him, saying his sister was dead, and had left them to him; he gave me his monthly note to pawn them for him - the shoes belong to my daughter.</p>

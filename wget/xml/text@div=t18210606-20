I immediately ran to the door, opened it, and looking up the street, I saw a young man running; I closed the door and pursued, crying Stop thief! - I kept within thirty yards of him till we got to St. Ann's-court, where he turned down - I came up with him, and found him in custody of the three witnesses - it was the prisoner. I saw this watch laying at his foot with the glass out, and the seconds hand knocked off with the fall; I knew the watch directly - it was the property of the executors, it hung about the centre pane, within reach of the arm through the broken pane. I have been in the shop nearly two years - it was there before I came; there was no particular mark, it has no maker's name, I had observed that before it was taken; the ticket was brought to me by one of the witnesses - it is in my handwriting. Mr. Robinson gave it to me; the prisoner was the man I pursued, to the best of my belief. I had no opportunity of seeing his face till I got into the court. It is worth 30 l.; the pane of glass was whole and safe before - I could not observe the face of the person whose arm was through the window.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WHITE. I live with Mr. King, a batter, at No. 10, St. Ann's-court.

I saw the watch lay on the ground with the glass out - I did not see or hear him drop it.</p>

            . I keep a public-house in St. Ann's-court. I heard a cry of Stop thief! I immediately ran out, turned the corner, and White had the prisoner in his possession. I laid hold of his arm, and during that time he let the watch drop, I saw him drop it - it fell on my foot, and the glass came out; I picked it up, and gave it to Stephens - the prisoner was secured. I picked up a paper which I took to the shop, and gave to Dixon. I should know it again - that produced is it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see it fall from my hand - A. I did.</p>
               <p>ROBERT HOWARD. I am a constable, and live in St. Ann's-court. I was in my shop, and heard the cry of Stop thief! ran out and saw the prisoner stopped by White, and Robinson had hold of him. I collared him and saw Stephens coming up, and saw the prisoner drop the watch from his right hand - Robinson picked it up, he said it fell on his foot, it was not bruised - the prisoner said before the magistrate that he did drop it.</p>
               <p>THOMAS HOBY STEPHENS re-examined. I had not noticed the watch that morning. We do not move them from the window at night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I got up about seven o'clock in the morning to bathe, it was wet, which hindered me. I was walking about, and stood up in Wardour-street- for three quarters of an hour under shelter, and heard a smash at the window as a cart came by. I saw somebody run from the shop, and ran after him.</p>
               <p>GEORGE WHITE re-examined. Nobody ran down the street but the prisoner.</p>

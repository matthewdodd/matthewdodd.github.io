            . I live at Richmond, on the the 11th of November, about one o'clock, I received a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040034"></xptr>dividend of 40 l. at the Bank, and had 60 l. before in my pocket-book, which was in my outside coat-pocket. I was going to dine in Serle-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, there was no coach at the Bank, and I went to the Mansion house, public-house, and had a pint of porter with my friend Brownley, who came out of the Bank with me. I had no conversation with any one at the public-house, we came out, and at the end of the court leading into the street, I saw some persons and one of them gave a spring forward, I turned round to my friend and said,</p>
               <p>"Let us get a coach, for we are in bad company," I saw the person who sprung forward sufficiently to know him, it was the prisoner; I saw him again ten days after, but was not very positive of him, when I first saw him, I thought him very like the man, but he was differently dressed. When I came out of the public-house door, I buttoned my coat and perceived my pocket-book there, I walked along the passage, the man sprang forward and in two mintutes, I felt and missed it and have not since seen it. There were five or six people about me, they continued where they were on the man's springing forward, I got aside of them and got away; I got into a coach at the end of the Old Jewry, and found my pocket cut through when I got to Mr. Ross's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where were you when you first missed your pocket-book - A. At Mr. Ross's, twenty minutes or half an hour after I left the public-house, I came out of the public-house near two o'clock, it was the day Hunt came to town, but before he came, there were a great many people all along the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who first pointed the prisoner out to you - A. I saw him at the Mansion-house sitting down, I called an officer and said</p>
               <p>"That is the man who jumped out, but I cannot swear he robbed me."</p>

            . I am acquainted with Mr. Prentice. I came out of the Bank with him, and came towards the Mansion-house public-house. A man who appeared like a coachman, stood at the back of my chair, in the public-house, and when I got up to come away he walked out before us, we came into the passage and I believe the man who jumped out from the wall was the same who was in the house. Just as we came out Mr. Prentice said he thought we were in bad company, we went on to the Old Jury, called a coach which he got into, and I left. I saw the prisoner in custody at the Mansion-house last Thursday week, I could not exactly say that he is the man, but very strongly suspected that he was, and I am almost sure of it. I am possitive of it now.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you more positive now than at the Mansion-house - A. I have considered it more and am more convinced that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY - Q. What are you - A. A baker. I will swear the prisoner is the man I saw; when he was at the Mansion-house, he was in a different garb, he was the same stature, and I believe the same countenance.</p>
               <p>Q, Do you mean to swear you are positive, or that you only believe he is the man - A. I believe it.</p>

            . I am one of the day patrol. On the 27th of November, I went with Mr. Prentice, to the Fleece, public-house - I sent him into the parlour, and told him to take no notice of me. I went in afterwards and Gilbert was not there. The prisoner was in the bar, and said Gilbert lodged there, and would be in between eight and nine o'clock. I said I came respecting a 10 l. note, which had been paid by Gilbert to the pawnbroker, and which was a stolen one; he said he had sent a 10 l. note by Gilbert, to redeem a pledge. Gilbert did not come in, and I told the prisoner he must go with me to the Mansion House - this was a little after seven o'clock; he put on his hat and walked with me. I left Mr. Prentice to wait the arrival of Gilbert. I then asked the prisoner how he became possessed of this 10 l. note; he stated that on the afternoon of the 11th, the landlord and landlady were out, and he was minding the bar all the afternoon, and between five and six o'clock a person came in, and had some brandy and water, and asked for change for a 10 l. note - that he gave him change out of his own pocket. I asked what address the person gave; he said he thought he had sufficient knowledge of a good note from a bad one, and did not ask him, and that he could not write and could not put the address on if he had heard it. In about three quarters of an hour the prosecutor and his friends brought Gilbert. We sat in the porter's lodge, where there is a good gas light - I think only me, the porter, and the prisoner were there. The prosecutor called me out in a few minutes, and stated that he was confident, and would swear the person who was there was the person who sprang before him at the time he came out of the public-house. After we went in again, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"I have not yet seen the note, and wish to see it." This note and two others which had gone into the Bank, laid on the table, and he picked out this one as that he sent by Gilbert. I said then if he could not write he could read writing; he said</p>
               <p>"I can write a little, I did not mean to say I could not write at all - there is my writing on the top of the note," and he thought he wrote it for the name of Day; but on looking at it, it was Mr. Davis, King-street, Cheapside, written in a very bad hand. He was taken on Wednesday, and detained till Thursday, and taken to the Mansion House, and we were sent to Guildhall. The prisoner told me he wore a white coat and a cap on the day of Hunt's entry, and went out to see Hunt, but went no farther than St. Paul's Church-yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you were talking with him at the public-house was the prosecutor there - A. No; he was in the parlour, and the door shut. I think he saw me taking the prisoner away; he could not see his face - the bar is very dark. He might go into the parlour without seeing him.</p>
               <p>Gilbert being called did not appear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was assisting a friend who keeps the public-house in Little Knight Rider-street, and on the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182212040035"></xptr>11th of November, about a quarter or twenty minutes past one o'clock, some persons came in, and said Hunt was coming - two young men ran out, and I followed them. I went opposite the South door of St. Paul's, till Hunt passed, then returned, and in Sermon-lane, met Peer, and told him he was too late, for Hunt was gone by. I was not absent more than ten minutes, Mrs. Christie asked if I had seen Hunt - I said, Yes. She went up to dress, and went to meet her husband about three o'clock, and left me in charge of the house. Three persons came in about five o'clock, and had brandy and water - one of them came and asked for change for a 10 l. note; I refused - he said he could not pay me, I sent the servant girl to get change, she could not, and having money in my pocket, I gave change; I asked his address, he said,</p>
               <p>"Davis, King-street, Cheapside;" a few days after, I sent Gilbert, who had lived servant with me before, to redeem some articles, and he gave the note. The prosecutor saw me attending to the business of the house sometime, and said nothing about me. Directly I was asked about it, I said, I sent Gilbert with the note, and explained every thing.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What makes you speak particular as to the time he was absent - A. I particularly requested him not to stay, as I wished to go out; but some gentlemen came in after he had been out, and detained me.</p>

            . I drive the Southampton coach. I went to the Fleece at one o'clock, on the day of Hunt's procession, the prisoner was there, and served me with a pot of half and half. I went out before the procession came, returned, and had more to drink, he was there then, and between half-past one and half-past two I went up Sermon-lane, and met him with two little children returning to the Fleece he said I was too late.</p>

            . I am employed in the Perogative-office, Doctor's Commons, and dine at the Fleece. I have known the prisoner eight or nine years. I saw him at the Fleece the day Hunt arrived, cooking chops, which I ordered at half-past one. I saw the procession, returned to dinner, and staid there till near three o'clock, he was in the house all that time serving and assisting in the house.</p>

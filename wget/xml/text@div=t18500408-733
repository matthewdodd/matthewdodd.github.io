                  </hi>. I am a manufacturing stationer, in partnership with my brother. The prisoner was our traveller, and was paid by a com<lb></lb>mission on all sales effected—it was paid at stated periods, he drawing on us in the mean time for what he wanted—if he received 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Bar<lb></lb>ham on 11th Jan., he has not accounted to me for it—I find by the book, that he applied to me for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 11th Jan., which I gave him, but he paid over no money to me—we discharged him about the 7th Feb., and about a fortnight afterwards we found this amount was paid—I did not give him into custody for about three weeks afterwards—I had reasons for that—I charged him with taking Barham's account, and not paying it to us—he said he knew he did; he put it into his pocket, went down to Hertford, and finding himself rather short, he made use of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Had he authority from you to receive money on your account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; my brother engaged him—this letter contains the terms of the engagement—(<hi rend="italic">This letter was from the prisoner to Messrs. Smith, accepting the situation, the terms being 5 per cent, on all sales effected</hi>)—it may have been more than a month after discovering this that I gave him in charge—I saw him the day before, but said nothing about this—I knew it, I had reasons for saying nothing about it—I told Webb to take him next day—he had no commission on bad debts—there are debts unpaid which he has obtained orders for—the settlement is still open—he did not tell me before, or when he was discharged, that he had received this money.</p>

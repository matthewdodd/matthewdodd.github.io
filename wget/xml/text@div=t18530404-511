                  </hi>. I live at No. 59, Whittlebury-street, Euston-square, and am at present living on my means The prisoner formerly lived under my protection—we separated in the early part or middle of Jan. last—on the night of 7th March, I was at the Scotch Supper-rooms in company with a female—the prisoner came in a few minutes before 12 o'clock—after seeing that I was there she left very quickly, and did not return—I apprehended violence from her, and not wishing to subject the young lady with me to violence, went down stairs, put her into a Hansom's <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> which was drawn up at the door, and immediately got in myself—I saw the prisoner standing by the door of the rooms, between the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and the door; I kept my eye on her, and as the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> was about to start the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, she rushed forward and threw the contents of a phial into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I placed myself before the lady to pro<lb></lb>tect her or her dress—as I saw the glitter of the phial, I put up my bands to cover my face, and the contents of it went on my gloves and on my cost sleeves, and a trifle on my face—the colour was entirely taken out of my gloves and coat—I was burnt a little on my throat and forehead, and felt a slight tingling sensation; the skin subsequently peeled off—I threw open the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> doors, seized the prisoner, and shouted for the police—I charged her on the spot with throwing corrosive liquid over me; 1 do not recollect clearly what she answered—there was a great crowd and a din of voices.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 23, Little Pulteney-street, Golden-square. On Monday, 7th March, the prisoner came to my shop to purchase some oil of vitriol—I asked her if she was aware it was poison, and for what purpose she wanted it—she said she did not know it was poison, but wanted it for the purpose of cleaning a fender she had purchased, to get the rust off—I supplied her with six drachms of diluted sulphuric acid—I said, "I will write on the label, 'Vitriol—poison;' be careful of it, because if it is taken it will injure any person, or if it is thrown on anybody it will injure them;" I did not mean <hi rend="italic">thrown</hi>, I meant <hi rend="italic">spilt</hi>—I cannot say that this produced is the phial, but the label is the same that I put on, and this phial would contain that quantity—I examined it at the police court, and there was a very slight portion of liquid remaining in it, which I ascertained to be an acid, and I should imagine it to be diluted sulphuric acid—the burns on these gloves would arise from the sprinkling of diluted sulphuric acid upon them—almost any acid would produce them.</p>
